## Question

According to recent medical literature, what is the link between chronic marijuana use and schizophrenia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the link between chronic marijuana use and schizophrenia, including causality, dose–response, mechanisms, modifiers, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the question in PICO terms and define "chronic" use. Then, I should appraise the strength of evidence by hierarchy and identify the highest-quality sources. Next, I will examine dose–response and risk thresholds, followed by mechanistic plausibility. After that, I need to consider confounding and reverse causation, including Mendelian randomization and shared vulnerability. Finally, I will translate this into clinical and public health recommendations and note uncertainties and gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the PICO framing and definitions so I don't misinterpret the literature. Population: adolescents and young adults, the peak period of psychosis risk and cannabis exposure. Exposure: chronic cannabis use, which I should operationalize as frequent or near-daily use given the dose–response literature. Comparator: nonusers or infrequent users. Outcomes: incident schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders, and symptom severity/relapse in established psychosis. I need to ensure I distinguish transient psychotomimetic effects from persistent psychotic disorders, because conflating them would overstate risk [^524aa9c1] [^f08635bc].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and prioritize the strongest sources. Wait, let me verify the top-tier signals: large prospective cohorts, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization provide the most robust inference. High-quality cohorts show a dose–response relationship between cannabis use frequency and psychosis, with the strongest risk at daily/near-daily use, and MR studies suggest a causal contribution of cannabis initiation to schizophrenia risk, albeit with modest effect sizes. I should also weigh contemporary policy-natural-experiment data showing rising population-attributable risk after legalization and potency increases, which strengthens the public health signal [^81c1d487] [^e184fd7a] [^fb0a82a2] [^996e76df] [^2cddbf80] [^db36cd85].

> I will now examine the dose–response and risk thresholds, since "chronic" implies frequency and cumulative exposure. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: multiple meta-analyses converge on a log-linear increase in psychosis risk with frequency, from roughly no excess risk with yearly use to about a 35% increase with weekly use and about a 76% increase with daily/near-daily use. Some models show even larger effects at very high exposure, and potency modifies risk, with high-THC products carrying greater psychotogenic potential. I should double-check that these estimates adjust for confounders where possible; yes, many analyses do, though residual confounding remains a limitation in observational designs [^81c1d487] [^e184fd7a] [^65306451] [^435c37cc] [^490f25a5].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility, because causality is strengthened by coherence with biological pathways. THC acutely increases dopamine release and can induce transient psychosis in healthy volunteers, while chronic use may dysregulate dopamine signaling and interact with glutamatergic and GABAergic systems implicated in schizophrenia. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought chronic cannabis universally upregulates striatal dopamine, but I should correct that: some human data associate chronic use with decreased dopamine synthesis, so the net effect likely reflects complex receptor-level changes and sensitization rather than a simple increase. This mechanistic picture aligns with a component-cause model rather than a sole-cause model of psychosis [^0cc5e822] [^753155d6] [^e23787bf] [^d48b2092].

> But wait, what if the association is just confounding or reverse causation? I need to check genetically informed designs. Mendelian randomization studies using cannabis-use SNPs as instruments generally support a causal contribution of cannabis initiation to schizophrenia, with pooled estimates around a 37% increase in risk, though effect sizes are smaller than in observational cohorts and depend on the exposure definition. Shared genetic liability explains part of the association, yet MR and sibling designs suggest that residual confounding does not fully account for the effect, supporting a causal interpretation alongside gene–environment interplay. I should confirm that these MR analyses pass sensitivity checks; yes, most report no strong pleiotropy signals, though assumptions must be scrutinized [^fb0a82a2] [^996e76df] [^ff3cf577] [^08c9597b] [^0e256627].

> Next, I should review modifiers that amplify or attenuate risk, because clinical counseling hinges on them. Early age of initiation, especially before 16–18 years, confers markedly higher risk, consistent with neurodevelopmental vulnerability. High-potency THC products and synthetic cannabinoids increase risk, whereas CBD may mitigate THC's psychotogenic effects. Genetic vulnerability, including family history and polygenic risk for schizophrenia, interacts with cannabis exposure, and sex differences show stronger associations in young males. Hold on, I should verify the potency claim: yes, multiple studies and reviews converge on higher risk with high-THC/low-CBD products, and experimental work shows CBD can antagonize THC-induced psychosis [^668f9bde] [^490f25a5] [^d48b2092] [^7f3b6156] [^bb28ee30].

> I will now examine outcomes in established psychosis, because chronic use may worsen illness course even if it does not solely cause it. Continued cannabis use after a first psychotic episode is associated with higher relapse risk, more hospitalizations, and longer inpatient stays, and quasi-experimental within-person analyses suggest these effects are not fully explained by confounding or reverse causation. I should confirm that these associations persist after adjusting for adherence and other substances; yes, several longitudinal and modeling studies show dose-related relapse risk with ongoing use [^e4352b52] [^cb5fc4ea] [^0ab06f19].

> Let me translate this into clinical implications, and I need to ensure the guidance matches the evidence strength. For patients at risk or with a first episode, counsel abstinence or marked reduction, especially with high-potency products and in adolescence. For heavy users, taper frequency to below weekly if cessation is not feasible, given the risk threshold data. In established psychosis, integrate substance-use treatment into care because continued use predicts relapse. I should confirm that guidelines align with this; yes, AACAP and other high-credibility sources recommend early intervention, CBT-based approaches, and careful diagnostic caution during withdrawal, with abstinence associated with improved outcomes [^668f9bde] [^1721d5bb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk or population impact without context. The lifetime risk of schizophrenia is about 0.7–1%, so a 30–40% relative increase from daily use translates to a modest absolute risk increase, yet population-attributable fractions can be substantial where cannabis use and potency are high. I should double-check the PARF estimates: Danish registry data show the PARF for cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia rose from ~2% in the mid-1990s to ~6–8% by 2010, and newer Canadian data suggest further increases after legalization, particularly in young men. This supports targeted prevention in high-exposure populations [^ca7f067e] [^db36cd85] [^2cddbf80] [^61b5f3d6].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and gaps so the synthesis is balanced. Many studies rely on self-reported exposure and observational designs, potency and product composition are often unmeasured, and MR estimates are sensitive to assumptions. Some recent cohorts suggest age-dependent effects with stronger associations in adolescence than young adulthood, which may reflect potency changes or neurodevelopmental timing. Longitudinal studies with repeated, objective measures and harmonized potency metrics are needed to refine risk estimates and mechanisms [^ab685e00] [^8d088524] [^f08635bc].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: chronic, frequent cannabis use — especially daily or near-daily use of high-THC products — is associated with a dose-related increase in the risk of developing schizophrenia and with worse outcomes in established psychosis, and converging evidence from prospective cohorts, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization supports a causal contribution, albeit with modest individual-level effect sizes and substantial population-level implications. Clinically, prioritize prevention, early intervention, and harm-reduction counseling, with particular vigilance in adolescents and young adults and in those with genetic or clinical risk factors [^81c1d487] [^e184fd7a] [^fb0a82a2] [^668f9bde].

---

Chronic marijuana use is associated with a **two- to threefold increased risk** of schizophrenia, with the strongest evidence for a causal relationship in genetically vulnerable individuals and those who initiate use in adolescence or use high-potency THC products [^d0eca9dd] [^fb0a82a2] [^8d088524] [^490f25a5]. The risk is **dose-dependent** [^81c1d487] and rises with frequency and potency; daily or near-daily use confers the highest risk [^e184fd7a] [^65306451]. Mechanisms likely involve THC-driven dopamine dysregulation and neurodevelopmental disruption during adolescence [^0cc5e822] [^e601dde1]. While not all users develop psychosis, the population-attributable risk is substantial and has increased with modern high-potency products, supporting public health warnings and targeted prevention [^db36cd85] [^b16df6d4].

---

## Epidemiological evidence

Multiple longitudinal and meta-analytic studies show a consistent association between chronic marijuana use and schizophrenia:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Regular cannabis use is associated with a 2–3-fold increased risk of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders [^d0eca9dd] [^90a92a8a].
- **Dose-response relationship**: Risk increases with frequency and potency; daily or near-daily use and high-THC products confer the highest risk [^81c1d487] [^e184fd7a] [^65306451].
- **Age of initiation**: Early use, especially before age 16, further elevates risk, likely due to neurodevelopmental vulnerability [^668f9bde] [^8d088524].

---

## Causal inference and confounding

Establishing causality is challenging given observational designs; however, several lines of evidence support a **causal contribution**:

- **Mendelian randomization**: Genetic instruments suggest cannabis use causally increases schizophrenia risk, with an estimated 37% higher risk among users versus nonusers [^fb0a82a2] [^996e76df].
- **Temporality**: Cannabis use typically precedes psychosis onset, supporting causality over reverse causation [^13e44371] [^cf3ef9a9].
- **Confounding control**: Associations persist after adjusting for socioeconomic, psychiatric, and substance-use covariates, though residual confounding remains possible [^d0eca9dd] [^93a95597].

---

## Biological mechanisms

Biological plausibility centers on THC's effects on the brain:

- **Dopamine dysregulation**: THC acutely increases dopamine, a core pathway in psychosis; chronic use may sensitize dopamine systems and precipitate psychosis in vulnerable individuals [^0cc5e822] [^753155d6].
- **Neurodevelopmental disruption**: Adolescent exposure may impair prefrontal cortical development, increasing psychosis risk [^e601dde1] [^b6aac4e6].
- **Gene-environment interaction**: Variants such as COMT and AKT1 moderate THC's psychotogenic effects, explaining individual variability in risk [^f20cb718] [^435c37cc].

---

## Vulnerable populations

Certain groups are at **disproportionately higher risk**:

- **Genetic vulnerability**: Family history or polygenic risk for schizophrenia amplifies cannabis-related psychosis risk [^7f3b6156] [^4322882c].
- **Adolescents and young adults**: Early initiation and heavy use confer the highest risk, particularly with high-potency products [^668f9bde] [^8d088524].
- **High-potency users**: Modern high-THC/low-CBD products markedly increase risk compared to traditional cannabis [^490f25a5] [^d0eca9dd].

---

## Clinical implications

Given the strength of evidence, clinicians should:

- **Screen and counsel**: Routinely assess cannabis use in youth and patients with psychosis risk, and counsel on dose-, frequency-, and potency-related risks [^668f9bde] [^1721d5bb].
- **Early intervention**: Address cannabis use in first-episode psychosis to improve outcomes and reduce relapse [^e4352b52] [^cb5fc4ea].
- **Public health messaging**: Emphasize risk reduction, delay of initiation, and avoidance of high-potency products [^4322882c] [^490f25a5].

---

## Limitations and gaps

Key uncertainties include **potency standardization**, as THC:CBD ratios vary widely and are rarely measured in studies; **long-term outcomes** remain uncertain, as most data are observational and long-term randomized trials are infeasible; and **individual risk prediction** is limited, as genetic and environmental modifiers are incompletely understood [^ab685e00] [^f08635bc] [^f20cb718].

---

Chronic marijuana use — particularly frequent, high-potency use beginning in adolescence — **increases schizophrenia risk** through dopamine dysregulation and neurodevelopmental disruption, with the highest risk in genetically vulnerable individuals. The relationship is causal at the population level, though not deterministic for individuals, and warrants clinical screening, risk counseling, and public health action [^fb0a82a2] [^d0eca9dd] [^b16df6d4].

Introduction

Psychotic illnesses have an annual prevalence of around 0.4% of the population and a cost to the economy of £13.5 billion a year in England alone. Early-onset psychosis may herald chronic illness, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, with considerable impact on the individual's functioning, social and occupational opportunities. Consequently, better understanding of early psychosis is critical to the development of preventative and treatment strategies. Comorbid cannabis use is a particularly important problem for the clinician treating patients with psychosis, as it is present in around 30–40% of patients with early psychosis, constituting a considerable proportion of their caseload, and is associated with poorer prognosis.

This article will restrict itself to the association between cannabis and psychotic disorders. When discussing the association between cannabis and psychosis a clear distinction must be made between several psychosis outcomes: (a) risk of developing enduring psychotic disorder, (b) risk of relapse once a psychotic disorder has developed and (c) the transient psychotomimetic states that cannabis induces. In particular, transient psychotomimetic states are common, self-limiting, non-clinical entities, experienced in around 15% of users; demonstrable in healthy individuals when administered phytocannabinoids, with increased propensity with psychotic disorders or risk of psychosis, they are not the focus of this article, wherein we focus on the relationship between cannabis and outcomes related to the development of psychotic disorder and its relapse. In the first section we present a critical review as an overview of the epidemiological association between cannabis and psychotic disorder, and go on to discuss differences between patients with established psychotic disorder who use cannabis and those who do not. In the second section, in order to advance understanding of the neurobiological association of cannabis and psychotic disorder, we undertake a systematic search to delineate whether neurobiological differences exist between groups.

### Changes in incident schizophrenia diagnoses associated with cannabis use disorder after cannabis legalization [^2cddbf80]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis use is associated with subsequent development or earlier onset of psychosis and schizophrenia. Evidence suggests a dose-response relationship, with more frequent use of higher-potency cannabis products associated with a greater risk of schizophrenia. Cannabis use and the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of cannabis products are increasing globally. A recent study estimated that the proportion of cases of schizophrenia in Denmark associated with cannabis increased from approximately 4% in 2000 to 8% from 2010 to 2016. However, cannabis was and remains illegal in Denmark and a frequently raised public health concern is that legalization may result in further increases in cannabis use and the incidence of psychotic disorders. Evidence on the association between cannabis legalization and psychosis is lacking. Studies from Canada and the US examining periods immediately after cannabis legalization found no significant associations between legalization and increases in psychotic disorders. However, prior studies have been underpowered to detect changes in psychotic disorders given that they are relatively rare and that there are anticipatable multiple-year lags between cannabis policy and detection of potential changes in psychotic disorders. Mechanistically, legalization would gradually increase cannabis use, increasing cannabis use would increase the incidence of psychosis, and individuals with incident psychosis would then need to be diagnosed in the health system. Consequently, studies evaluating changes in the proportion of incident cases of schizophrenia associated with cannabis use after policy changes can provide an earlier indicator of the possible associations of legalization with schizophrenia.

Cannabis policy in Canada has shifted markedly over the past 2 decades. Medical cannabis in Canada has been legal since 2001 for a limited list of severe or chronic medical conditions and was greatly expanded in 2014 for anyone with medical authorization from a physician indicating they would therapeutically benefit from cannabis. In December 2015, the federal government committed to legalizing nonmedical cannabis; after this announcement, there were large increases in illicit and gray market medical and nonmedical cannabis dispensaries and online vendors. Legalization of nonmedical cannabis came into effect in October 2018, making Canada the first country in the world to allow commercial sale of nonmedical cannabis. The current study is situated in Ontario, Canada's most populous province (14.5 million residents). In Ontario, there were initially restrictions on the number of legal cannabis stores and types of products that could come to market. In early 2020, the market in Ontario began to commercialize with the introduction of new products with high THC content (concentrates, vapes, and edibles) along with the removal of store restrictions.

### Cannabis use and the risk of later schizophrenia: a review [^ccbd79cd]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To study the role of cannabis use in the onset of symptoms and disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum.

Design

Review of five population-based, longitudinal studies on the relationship between cannabis use and problems ranging from the experience of psychotic symptoms to hospitalization with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia. Several hypotheses are examined that may explain this relationship: (1) self-medication; (2) effects of other drugs; (3) confounding; (4) stronger effect in predisposed people, and (5) etiological hypothesis.

Findings

Hypotheses 1 and 2 can be dismissed; hypothesis 3 is still open to debate, and converging evidence is found for hypotheses 4 and 5-antecedent cannabis use appears to act as a risk factor in the onset of schizophrenia, especially in vulnerable people, but also in people without prior history.

Conclusion

There is an intrinsic message here for public health, but how that message is to be translated into action is not immediately clear.

### Cannabis and psychosis: are we any closer to understanding the relationship? [^0d288ce9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

This paper provides an update from the literature on understanding of the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia. In particular, the paper focuses on the latest findings and remaining areas that require investigation.

Recent Findings

Three hypotheses have emerged as potential explanations for the association between cannabis and schizophrenia, namely cannabis can trigger schizophrenia, cannabis is used to mitigate symptoms of schizophrenia, and there are common factors which might account for the association. Biological and genetic factors dominate this field of research; this has been at the expense of exploring social and cultural contributory factors which influence cannabis and schizophrenia.

Summary

The evidence for cannabis acting as a causal factor for schizophrenia has so far not been established. Research needs to extend beyond males drawn from western countries if we are to advance knowledge and understanding of the link between cannabis use and schizophrenia.

### Does using marijuana increase the risk for developing schizophrenia? [^aa2a1378]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

As more US states and other countries consider legalizing marijuana, clinicians need to know the possible effects of this drug. Research has shown a connection between marijuana use and an increased risk for schizophrenia in young people who are vulnerable to developing psychosis. An international panel of experts addresses topics such as risk factors for schizophrenia, the potency and effects of cannabis use on adolescents, the effects of concurrent drug use with cannabis on schizophrenia risk, and current attitudes toward marijuana.

### The environment and schizophrenia: the role of cannabis use [^dc409256]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

Cannabis use is associated with poor outcome in existing schizophrenia and may precipitate psychosis in individuals with preexisting liability. To investigate the overall effect size and consistency of the association between cannabis and psychosis, a meta-analysis from prospective studies was carried out. The pooled odds ratio was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.7–2.5) and could not be explained by confounding or reverse causality. Evidence suggests that cannabis is a component cause in the development and prognosis of psychosis, in which mechanisms of gene-environment interaction are most likely to explain this association. Potential new methods to directly link genetic liability to the effects of cannabis are discussed.

### Cannabis and psychosis [^7e83cc84]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

There has been considerable debate about the reasons for the association observed between cannabis use and psychosis in both clinical and general population samples. Among the hypotheses proposed to explain the association are the following: 1) common factors explain the co-occurrence; 2 cannabis causes psychosis that would not have occurred in the absence of cannabis use; 3) cannabis precipitates psychosis among persons who were vulnerable to developing the disorders; 4) cannabis use worsens or prolongs psychosis among those who have already developed the disorder; and 5) that persons with psychosis are more likely to become regular or problematic cannabis users than persons without psychosis. This article evaluates the evidence on each of these hypotheses, including recent research on the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in schizophrenia. The evidence suggests that common factors do not explain the comorbidity between cannabis use and psychosis, and it is unlikely that cannabis use causes psychosis among persons who would otherwise not have developed the disorder. The evidence is more consistent with the hypotheses that cannabis use may precipitate psychosis among vulnerable individuals, increase the risk of relapse among those who have already developed the disorder, and may be more likely to lead to dependence in persons with schizophrenia.

### Cannabis and psychosis: are we any closer to understanding the relationship? [^22ffcd77]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Three hypotheses outline the potential relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia in contemporary literature:
Cannabis can trigger schizophrenia in an individual who would not have developed the illness if they had not been exposed to the drug.
Individuals with a predisposition to schizophrenia use cannabis to mitigate the prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, referred to as reverse causation.
Common cause suggests that other factors are responsible for the relationship such as childhood trauma or genetics for example.

Although the first of these hypotheses appears to be simple, it has proved to be difficult to investigate with confidence. Research relies on observational methods mainly with all the limitations these have, but there are other problems in exploring this theory. It is widely thought that the dose of cannabis is a factor in increasing the risk of psychosis, but there is significant heterogeneity in the assessment of dose. Some researchers use exposure of 50 times or more, others use the proxy of last month usage to indicate regular use as opposed to infrequent or occasional use of the drug. This is compounded by the diagnostic criteria for cannabis-induced psychosis that rely on subjective assessment. For instance, an assessing clinician or researcher trying to establish that cannabis played a causal role for an individual presenting with psychosis would need to decide how recent use of cannabis should be in order to make this differential diagnosis. The possibility for error is amplified when considering that metabolites of cannabis can be detected for weeks following exposure, clearly raising the risk of a false positive association and diagnosis of cannabis-induced psychosis.

### Cannabis and psychosis: are we any closer to understanding the relationship? [^87f6f8c6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2016 demonstrating its status as the most popular drug after alcohol and tobacco globally. As with all drugs, there are risks associated with its use; some risk is due to the substance and some will depend on the regulatory status of the drug in the local jurisdiction that the individual resides in. One risk of using cannabis continues to attract significant attention, namely the risk of developing psychosis. Distinguishing between causation and correlation on this issue has proved to be a challenge. However, it is critical that we understand how risks such as developing psychosis and schizophrenia for those that are exposed to cannabis unfold, so this knowledge could be used to reduce harm and to more effectively target scarce public health resources to high risk groups.

Scholars and clinicians have been aware of a link between cannabis and schizophrenia for over a century. However, it wasn't until cannabis use became popular in western countries during the 1960's that researchers began to investigate the nature of the relationship. The seminal observational study by Andreasson and colleagues set the research agenda on this topic, reporting that cannabis was an independent risk factor for schizophrenia with 6% of heavy cannabis users going on to develop schizophrenia.

### Are cannabis-using and non-using patients different groups? Towards understanding the neurobiology of cannabis use in psychotic disorders [^31b89e01]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

A substantial body of credible evidence has accumulated that suggest that cannabis use is an important potentially preventable risk factor for the development of psychotic illness and its worse prognosis following the onset of psychosis. Here we summarize the relevant evidence to argue that the time has come to investigate the neurobiological effects of cannabis in patients with psychotic disorders. In the first section we summarize evidence from longitudinal studies that controlled for a range of potential confounders of the association of cannabis use with increased risk of developing psychotic disorders, increased risk of hospitalization, frequent and longer hospital stays, and failure of treatment with medications for psychosis in those with established illness. Although some evidence has emerged that cannabis-using and non-using patients with psychotic disorders may have distinct patterns of neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental impairments, the biological underpinnings of the effects of cannabis remain to be fully elucidated. In the second and third sections we undertake a systematic review of 70 studies, including over 3000 patients with psychotic disorders or at increased risk of psychotic disorder, in order to delineate potential neurobiological and neurochemical mechanisms that may underlie the effects of cannabis in psychotic disorders and suggest avenues for future research.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3745bccb]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions/future directions

Psychosis as a possible adverse outcome of cannabis use remains a major public health concern. This review found that the risk of psychosis is significantly elevated with frequent, i.e. at least weekly, cannabis use while not significantly elevated with infrequent consumption. These evidence-based insights require effective translation into public health-oriented cannabis prevention efforts. As cannabis use prevalence continues to grow, including in policy reform settings, and use patterns are evolving, the evidence-base on this issue should be regularly updated. Specifically, future reviews should seek to integrate the role of possible contributing factors (e.g. cannabis potency, genetics, age of exposure) to better define risk-thresholds for psychosis development and extend these to other adverse outcomes toward improved public health-oriented interventions for cannabis use.

Effects on Mental Health

Disruptions of the cannabinergic system may have important implications for a number of neurobehavioral processes. There is evidence of an association between cannabis use and both acute and chronic mental illness and psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and an amotivational state. However, given the variation in the disease process, as well as inconsistent cannabis dosing and composition, the full nature of the associations remains to be clarified.

In studies of cannabis use and bipolar disorder, it appears that cannabis use may exacerbate or trigger manic symptoms among individuals previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Gibbs et al. found a 3-fold increase in risk for onset of manic symptoms after cannabis use. However, there does not seem to be evidence that cannabis use is a risk factor for developing bipolar disorder. Mixed findings are found when examining the relationship between cannabis use and depression and anxiety. There is some evidence that cannabis use and cannabis withdrawal may result in acute depressed mood. Similarly, studies suggest that cannabis may increase acute anxiety. The picture of chronic anxiety and depression and cannabis use is more complicated, in part because frequent cannabis users have both a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, and individuals with anxiety have high rates of cannabis use. The fact that individuals who initiate cannabis use in adolescence may develop depression and anxiety that persists after cessation may also influence this relationship. Furthermore, interpreting causality is complicated by the fact that a low concentration of THC may have anxiolytic effects, whereas higher concentrations produce anxiogenic effects, and the evidence that CBD may mitigate the effects of THC in animal models of anxiety.

A significant portion of the literature dedicated to cannabis use and mental health focuses on the relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia and psychosis. A number of studies suggest that acute cannabis exposure may induce temporary psychosis. Additionally, chronic cannabis use may trigger psychosis and schizophrenia in individuals with a predisposition or genetic susceptibility to mental illness. This appears to occur in a dose-dependent manner, such that heavy cannabis use, longer duration, greater potency, and early onset of use may be more closely aligned with disease trajectory, often significantly advancing the first psychotic episode and development of schizophrenia. Additionally, lifetime cannabis use has been associated with higher schizotypy scores, and cannabis may exacerbate pre-existing symptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia. Furthermore, individuals with psychosis may be more vulnerable to brain volume loss, which has been suggested as a result of cannabis exposure.

### Cannabis use and mania symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8ce3ca12]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Whilst cannabis use appears to be a causal risk factor for the development of schizophrenia-related psychosis, associations with mania remain relatively unknown. This review aimed to examine the impact of cannabis use on the incidence of manic symptoms and on their occurrence in those with pre-existing bipolar disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the scientific literature using the PRISMA guidelines. PsychINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase and MEDLINE databases were searched for prospective studies.

Results

Six articles met inclusion criteria. These sampled 2391 individuals who had experienced mania symptoms. The mean length of follow up was 3.9 years. Studies support an association between cannabis use and the exacerbation of manic symptoms in those with previously diagnosed bipolar disorder. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of two studies suggests that cannabis use is associated with an approximately 3-fold (Odds Ratio: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.80–4.90) increased risk for the new onset of manic symptoms.

Limitations

We were only able to identify a small number of studies of variable quality, thus our conclusions remain preliminary.

Conclusions

Our findings whilst tentative, suggest that cannabis use may worsen the occurrence of manic symptoms in those diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and may also act as a causal risk factor in the incidence of manic symptoms. This underscores the importance of discouraging cannabis use among youth and those with bipolar disorder to help prevent chronic psychiatric morbidity. More high quality prospective studies are required to fully elucidate how cannabis use may contribute to the development of mania over time.

### Gene-environment interplay between cannabis and psychosis [^f20cb718]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Cannabis use is considered a contributory cause of schizophrenia and psychotic illness. However, only a small proportion of cannabis users develop psychosis. This can partly be explained by the amount and duration of the consumption of cannabis and by its strength but also by the age at which individuals are first exposed to cannabis. Genetic factors, in particular, are likely to play a role in the short- and the long-term effects cannabis may have on psychosis outcome. This review will therefore consider the interplay between genes and exposure to cannabis in the development of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia. Studies using genetic, epidemiological, experimental, and observational techniques will be discussed to investigate gene-environment correlation gene-environment interaction, and higher order interactions within the cannabis-psychosis association. Evidence suggests that mechanisms of gene-environment interaction are likely to underlie the association between cannabis and psychosis. In this respect, multiple variations within multiple genes — rather than single genetic polymorphisms — together with other environmental factors (eg, stress) may interact with cannabis to increase the risk of psychosis. Further research on these higher order interactions is needed to better understand the biological pathway by which cannabis use, in some individuals, may cause psychosis in the short- and long term.

### Cannabis as a risk factor for psychosis: systematic review [^90a92a8a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Various lines of evidence suggest an association between cannabis and psychosis. Five years ago, the only significant case-control study addressing this question was the Swedish Conscript Cohort. Within the last few years, other studies have emerged, allowing the evidence for cannabis as a risk factor to be more systematically reviewed and assessed. Using specific search criteria on Embase, PsychINFO and Medline, all studies examining cannabis as an independent risk factor for schizophrenia, psychosis or psychotic symptoms, published between January 1966 and January 2004, were examined. Additional studies were also reviewed from references found in retrieved articles, reviews, and a cited reference search (ISI-Web of Science). Studies selected for meta-analysis included: (i) case-control studies where exposure to cannabis preceded the onset of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis and (ii) cohort studies of healthy individuals recruited before the median age of illness onset, with cannabis exposure determined prospectively and blind to eventual diagnosis. Studies of psychotic symptoms were also tabulated for further discussion. Eleven studies were identified examining the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis. Seven were included in the meta-analysis, with a derived odds ratio (fixed effects) of 2–9 (95% confidence interval = 2.4–3.6). No evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity was found. Early use of cannabis did appear to increase the risk of psychosis. For psychotic symptoms, a dose-related effect of cannabis use was seen, with vulnerable groups including individuals who used cannabis during adolescence, those who had previously experienced psychotic symptoms, and those at high genetic risk of developing schizophrenia. In conclusion, the available evidence supports the hypothesis that cannabis is an independent risk factor, both for psychosis and the development of psychotic symptoms. Addressing cannabis use, particularly in vulnerable populations, is likely to have beneficial effects on psychiatric morbidity.

### Cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia: a mendelian randomization study [^9d419d48]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis is the most widely misused illicit drug with an estimated 182 million consumers in 2013 globally. Several high-profile observational studies have reported a positive, dose-dependent association between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia, especially in young people in whom cannabis use is particularly high. The lifetime risk of schizophrenia is ∼0.7%, and the natural history of disease carries a high risk of long-term symptoms and disability together with a reduced life expectancy. In addition, schizophrenia represents a high economic burden with an estimated cost of $63 billion per year in the United States. Clarifying the causal role between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia is therefore important to understanding the health impacts of cannabis exposure and to inform on potential preventative strategies to alleviate the burden of disease from schizophrenia.

A substantial body of observational evidence supports the hypothesis that cannabinoids play a role in the development of schizophrenia. Prospective observational studies, with decades of follow-up and accounting for a large number of potential confounding factors (such as demographic, family history, personal history, socioeconomic or other environmental markers) have consistently demonstrated that exposure to cannabis is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia or related disorders. These findings have been reinforced by basic research experiments that point to cannabis altering various neurotransmission pathways linked to pathogenesis of psychotic disorders and by interfering with neurodevelopment in adolescents. Despite this, any causal link between cannabis use and psychotic disorders remains controversial as observational findings can always be hampered by confounding (where another risk factor associated with cannabis actually causes the disease) and/or reverse causality bias (where individuals affected by schizophrenia may be more prone to consume cannabis). Moreover, cannabis use is strongly associated with tobacco consumption and the latter has been observationally related to risk of schizophrenia meaning smoking could confound the link between cannabis and schizophrenia.

### Assessing causality in associations between cannabis use and schizophrenia risk: a two-sample mendelian randomization study [^af018ee8]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is clear from human experimental studies that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intoxication can induce transient psychotic experiences (D'Souza et al.). However, whether chronic cannabis use is causally associated with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia is harder to ascertain (Gage et al.). A systematic review and meta-analysis (Moore et al.) of longitudinal studies found evidence for a modest association between cannabis and later psychotic outcomes. However, the authors noted that the studies that adjusted for more potential confounding factors found that the point estimates attenuated to a greater degree than those adjusting for fewer, indicating that residual confounding could still be present. Some studies (Callaghan et al; Rossler et al.), although not all (Gage et al.), conducted since this meta-analysis have also found evidence of an association between cannabis use and later psychotic experiences or schizophrenia. As well as these observational studies, studies have been undertaken to investigate the genetic relationships between cannabis and schizophrenia. Power et al. found that a genetic risk score for schizophrenia predicted cannabis use in a sample of 2082 healthy individuals. Verweij et al. used linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to investigate this association, and found evidence of a genetic correlation between lifetime cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia. This could be interpreted as shared genetic aetiology, but could also reflect a causal association between schizophrenia and risk of cannabis use (Gage et al.).

### Cannabis and psychosis: a critical overview of the relationship [^61013a79]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Interest in the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis has increased dramatically in recent years, in part because of concerns related to the growing availability of cannabis and potential risks to health and human functioning. There now exists a plethora of scientific articles addressing this issue, but few provide a clear verdict about the causal nature of the cannabis-psychosis association. Here, we review recent research reports on cannabis and psychosis, giving particular attention to how each report provides evidence relating to two hypotheses: (1) cannabis as a contributing cause and (2) shared vulnerability. Two primary kinds of data are brought to bear on this issue: studies done with schizophrenic patients and studies of first-episode psychosis. Evidence reviewed here suggests that cannabis does not in itself cause a psychosis disorder. Rather, the evidence leads us to conclude that both early use and heavy use of cannabis are more likely in individuals with a vulnerability to psychosis. The role of early and heavy cannabis use as a prodromal sign merits further examination, along with a variety of other problem behaviors (e.g., early or heavy use of cigarettes or alcohol and poor school performance). Future research studies that focus exclusively on the cannabis-psychosis association will therefore be of little value in our quest to better understand psychosis and how and why it occurs.

### Cannabis use in youth is associated with chronic inflammation [^e23787bf]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The impact of cannabis use on the development of serious and enduring mental illness has been a focus of research for over 120 years (Power, Healy, Murray, & Cannon). Cannabis use in youth has been linked to a range of deleterious neurodevelopmental outcomes including accelerated cortical thinning, declines in verbal intelligence and the development of psychotic disorders (Albaugh et al; Power et al.). A recent umbrella review concluded that childhood trauma and cannabis use are the only two potentially modifiable risk factors associated with later psychosis that have strong prospective evidence (Arango et al.). The potential mechanisms linking early cannabis use to later psychosis remain poorly understood although epidemiological evidence increasingly points toward the association being causal (Gage et al; Power et al.). There are some conflicting lines of evidence within the available literature concerning long-term cannabis use and psychosis. Chronic cannabis use has been associated with decreased synthesis of dopamine in the striatum while increased dopamine synthesis in the striatum is generally accepted to be a neurobiological substrate of acute psychotic episodes (Bloomfield, Ashok, Volkow, & Howes; Murray et al.).

### The endocannabinoid system as a putative target for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses [^2b6fe09a]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While many advocacy and patient-oriented groups have argued for the use of whole cannabis as a therapeutic approach, there are several key issues that should be addressed. First, cannabis is a complex plant with varying chemical compositions across different strains or chemovars, most of which have largely unknown biological actions. More so, the interactions that could occur through the co-exposure to these molecules represent an unknown that makes the medical community generally wary of this approach. Typical medications come in standardized dosing and formulations for consistency across time and patients, and currently this is virtually impossible to do with cannabis. Second, approximately 19% of individuals who use cannabis develop a cannabis use disorder (CUD) (Hasin,) and therefore this risk must be factored into any therapeutic approach when considering the benefit v. the potential harms. To date, the few studies that have looked at therapeutic effect of cannabis itself have not found robust outcomes associated with cannabis, and as such the overwhelming view is that the potential harms associated with cannabis itself may likely outweigh its potential to provide therapeutic benefit. Third, chronic use of cannabis is known to be associated with alteration of components of the eCB system (Ceccarini et al.). This indicates that there is potential for excess use of cannabis to compromise normative eCB function, which in turn could ultimately make a disease process worse if the pathology of that disease already involves dysfunction of the eCB system. Fourth, cannabis use exhibits clear relationships with either the development or worsening of psychiatric conditions (De Aquino et al.), particularly schizophrenia and possibly depression (Sideli, Quigley, La Cascia, & Murray). While the nature of these relationships is still not entirely clear (Hill,), these risks contribute to the potential harms of utilizing cannabis itself as a therapeutic approach. Thus, the notion that cannabis will become a therapeutic tool that is accepted by the broad medical community seems highly unlikely given the adverse effects and risks for harm described above. Contrastingly, there is a wide-spread recognition that there is a biological basis by which cannabis benefits many individuals, which has led to the perspective that there may be differential ways to target the eCB system independent of cannabis, which could still harness the therapeutic potential of the eCB system, without the potential risks and harms associated with cannabis itself. As such, the aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date discussion of pharmacological approaches targeting the eCB system and the current state of knowledge of how these approaches are being tested for certain psychiatric conditions, with a focus on substance use disorders, trauma related disorders, and autism.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f8ff5857]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent reviews have confirmed a moderately significant association between cannabis use and psychosis (Kiburi, Molebatsi, Ntlantsana, & Lynskey; Polkosnik, Sorkhou, & George; van der Steur, Batalla, & Bossong). The association between cannabis use and mental health problems, most notably psychosis, receives prominent attention in policy debates, even though other adverse outcomes (e.g. cannabis-impaired driving, CUD) are more common and make greater contributions to the cannabis-attributable burden-of-disease (DeVylder, Mittal, & Schiffman; Hall & Degenhardt; Imtiaz et al; Leyton). Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, are severe clinical and usually chronic events, entailing extensive health and societal costs (de Oliveira, Cheng, Rehm, & Kurdyak; DeVylder et al; Hasin & Walsh). The relationship between cannabis use and psychosis is multi-directional, with psychosis caused by cannabis use being just one possible pathway. The exact mechanisms underlying this relationship continue to be debated (Murray & Hall; Wright, Cather, Gilman, & Evins). The proportion of first-episode psychosis (FEP) attributable to cannabis use was estimated to be 12% in five national European sites (Di Forti et al.). Current evidence however, suggests that the legalization of non-medical cannabis use may lead to an increased incidence of psychosis (Hamilton & Monaghan; Ksir & Hart; Murray & Hall). Therefore, evidence-based methods to reduce cannabis-attributable psychosis outcomes are crucially important for individual users and public health protection, especially in liberalized policy environments for cannabis.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^81c1d487]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiological studies show a dose-response association between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis. This review aimed to determine whether there are identifiable risk-thresholds between the frequency of cannabis use and psychosis development.

Methods

Systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science for relevant studies (1 January 2010–26 April 2021). Case-control or cohort studies that investigated the relationship between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis development that reported effect estimates [odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR), risk ratios (RR)] or the raw data to calculate them, with information on the frequency of cannabis consumption were included. Effect estimates were extracted from individual studies and converted to RR. Two-stage dose-response multivariable meta-analytic models were utilized and sensitivity analyses conducted. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies.

Results

Ten original (three cohorts, seven case-control) studies were included, including 7390 participants with an age range of 12–65 years. Random-effect model meta-analyses showed a significant log-linear dose-response association between cannabis use frequency and psychosis development. A restricted cubic-splines model provided the best fit for the data, with the risk of psychosis significantly increasing for weekly or more frequent cannabis use [RR = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.11 yearly; RR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.97–1.25 monthly; RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.19–1.52 weekly; RR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.47–2.12 daily].

Conclusion

Individuals using cannabis frequently are at increased risk of psychosis, with no significant risk associated with less frequent use. Public health prevention messages should convey these risk-thresholds, which should be refined through further work.

### Mental health… [^9c06d283]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Mental HealthEspañol Marijuana use, especially frequently and in high doses, can cause disorientation and sometimes unpleasant thoughts or feelings of anxiety and paranoia. 1 People who use marijuana are more likely to develop temporary psychosis and long-lasting mental disorders, including schizophrenia. 2 The association between marijuana and schizophrenia is stronger in people who start using marijuana at an earlier age and use marijuana more frequently. Marijuana use has also been linked to depression; social anxiety; and thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of chronic peri-adolescent cannabinoid exposure on schizophrenia-like behaviour in rodents [^5aa6f93c]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis is one of the oldest and most widely used psychoactive substances in human history. The latest UN report estimated that the global number of cannabis users reached 209 million in 2020, representing a 23% increase from 2010. The increasing popularity of cannabis use may be influenced by several factors, such as the legalisation of medicinal and recreational cannabis in some countries, the increased availability and social acceptance, and the perception that cannabis has low health risks. However, epidemiological studies have consistently shown a link between frequent cannabis use and psychosis. Recent evidence showed that daily cannabis users had a three-fold higher risk of developing psychosis than non-users. The risk increases with the use of high-potency cannabis that contains high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Furthermore, evidence suggested that earlier adolescent cannabis initiation may also confer greater psychosis vulnerability. Despite this knowledge, the biological mechanisms underlying this relationship, and the role of genetics have not been conclusively elucidated.

Human studies on cannabis and psychosis face considerable challenges in controlling for genetics, cannabis type, consumption patterns and social contexts. In contrast, rodent models enable controlled examination of cannabis exposure effects on the brain and behaviour. Given the conserved nature of brain circuits between humans and rodents, animal models hold promise for probing the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cannabis effects relevant to humans.

Over the years, a growing body of research has investigated the impact of cannabinoids on schizophrenia-like behaviours in rodents. While providing useful preliminary evidence, these studies have substantial variability in factors like cannabinoid type and dosage, timing of exposure, sex, and species of animals used. Additionally, while numerous behavioural aspects have been reported to be impacted by cannabis exposure in rodents, the validity and sensitivity of the individual tests used to model complex schizophrenia-like behaviour in rodents remain unclear.

### Meta-analysis of the association between the level of cannabis use and risk of psychosis [^50dfa8ce]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Cannabis use has been reported to induce long-lasting psychotic disorders and a dose-response relationship has been observed. We performed a systematic review of studies that investigate the association between the degree of cannabis consumption and psychosis and a meta-analysis to quantify the magnitude of effect. Published studies were identified through search of electronic databases, supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies. Studies were considered if they provided data on cannabis consumption prior to the onset of psychosis using a dose criterion (frequency/amount used) and reported psychosis-related outcomes. We performed random effects meta-analysis of individual data points generated with a simulation method from the summary data of the original studies. From 571 references, 18 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria for the systematic review and 10 were inserted in the meta-analysis, enrolling a total of 66 816 individuals. Higher levels of cannabis use were associated with increased risk for psychosis in all the included studies. A logistic regression model gave an OR of 3.90 (95% CI 2.84 to 5.34) for the risk of schizophrenia and other psychosis-related outcomes among the heaviest cannabis users compared to the nonusers. Current evidence shows that high levels of cannabis use increase the risk of psychotic outcomes and confirms a dose-response relationship between the level of use and the risk for psychosis. Although a causal link cannot be unequivocally established, there is sufficient evidence to justify harm reduction prevention programs.

### Genetic predisposition to schizophrenia associated with increased use of cannabis [^08c9597b]. Molecular Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide. With debate surrounding the legalization and control of use, investigating its health risks has become a pressing area of research. One established association is that between cannabis use and schizophrenia, a debilitating psychiatric disorder affecting ~1% of the population over their lifetime. Although considerable evidence implicates cannabis use as a component cause of schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether this is entirely due to cannabis directly raising risk of psychosis, or whether the same genes that increases psychosis risk may also increase risk of cannabis use. In a sample of 2082 healthy individuals, we show an association between an individual's burden of schizophrenia risk alleles and use of cannabis. This was significant both for comparing those who have ever versus never used cannabis (P = 2.6 × 10(-4)), and for quantity of use within users (P = 3.0 × 10(-3)). Although directly predicting only a small amount of the variance in cannabis use, these findings suggest that part of the association between schizophrenia and cannabis is due to a shared genetic aetiology. This form of gene-environment correlation is an important consideration when calculating the impact of environmental risk factors, including cannabis use.

### Cannabis use and the risk of developing a psychotic disorder [^93a95597]. World Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

WE BRIEFLY REVIEW THE EVIDENCE THAT CANNABIS USE IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULTHOOD IS A CONTRIBUTORY CAUSE OF SCHIZOPHRENIFORM PSYCHOSES, BY SUMMARISING LONGITUDINAL STUDIES THAT: a) have examined relationships between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis or psychotic symptoms; and b) have controlled for potential confounders, such as other forms of drug use and personal characteristics that predict an increased risk of psychosis. There is now reasonable evidence from longitudinal studies that regular cannabis use predicts an increased risk of schizophrenia and of reporting psychotic symptoms. These relationships have persisted after controlling for confounding variables such as personal characteristics and other drug use. The relationships did not seem to be explained by cannabis being used to self-medicate symptoms of psychosis. A contributory causal relationship is biologically plausible because psychotic disorders involve disturbances in the dopamine neurotransmitter system with which the cannabinoid system interacts, as has been shown by animal studies and a human provocation study. We briefly explore the clinical and public health implications of the most plausible hypothesis, that cannabis use precipitates schizophrenia in persons who are vulnerable because of a personal or family history of schizophrenia.

### Association between cannabis use and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: an individual participant data meta-analysis on 3053 individuals [^22164c85]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis is a widely used psychotropic substance, with a highly prevalent usage in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Specifically, 42% of people with schizophrenia present a lifetime use of cannabis, and 26% suffer from a comorbid cannabis use disorder (CUD). Among people with a First-Episode Psychosis (FEP), the estimated rate of cannabis use is 38%. Cannabis use was shown to precipitate schizophrenia onset, where cannabis-users have a disease onset 2–3 years earlier than non-users. Cannabis use is also associated with a two-fold risk of developing psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and with a poorer prognosis in individuals with an established vulnerability to psychotic disorders.

At the symptom level, an association between cannabis use and higher severity of positive symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations) is well documented. This has been reported in people with schizophrenia, as well as people with recent onset psychosisand in individuals with schizotypal traits. A recent review of existing meta-analyses and reviews has confirmed the potentiating role of cannabis use on the severity of positive symptoms. Regarding negative symptoms (e.g. blunted affect and avolition), a consensus has been more difficult to reach. In individuals with schizophrenia, results appear inconsistent. Although one study on 3500 participants reported a positive association between cannabis use and negative symptoms severity, other large studies found no association, or even a negative association, where patients using cannabis presented less severe negative symptoms(11 studies). Similarly, a study on 18 patients with FEP found that CUD was associated with lower negative symptoms severity.

### Cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia: a mendelian randomization study [^996e76df]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using a genetic approach, this study provides additional evidence that cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of schizophrenia. This finding corroborates many previous prospective observational studies that identified cannabis users to be at increased risk of schizophrenia. As cannabis is the leading drug of misuse, this finding is timely to draw attention to the potential mental health consequences of cannabis use and to provide more robust scientific evidence to inform the public health debate on cannabis legalization.

During the past 30 years, epidemiological observations have consistently demonstrated a strong, positive and dose-dependent association between cannabis use and risk of psychotic disorders. The direction and the strength of the association persisted after adjusting for measured confounders and with long periods (∼25 years) of follow-up (to attempt to minimize confounding and reverse causality bias, respectively). Our meta-analysis of prospective observational studies confirmed these findings in a magnitude that tallies remarkably closely with previous reports. Despite the consistency of observational data, clarifying whether or not cannabis use causally influences risk of schizophrenia has remained challenging. This is because observational studies, even accounting for confounding factors, can be affected by biases that undermine the validity (such as residual confounding). As such, the ability to answer the question on causality has been at an impasse, as a randomized controlled trial (considered the gold standard to test a hypothesis) is not possible for ethical reasons, as it would involve exposing participants to a potentially harmful exposure (a similar scenario to examining whether alcohol protects against risk of cardiovascular disease). In this setting, an MR approach can provide pivotal information on causality that can be of public health importance and inform guidelines. Our findings strongly support the large body of evidence from observational studies that exposure to cannabis plays a causal role in the development of schizophrenia.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^668f9bde]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Adolescent and young adult substance use — psychosis risk and early management highlights that psychosis risk is relevant across substances and especially with cannabis; longitudinal studies note that early-onset cannabis use before age 16 years, chronic/persistent, high-frequency, and high–THC potency can precipitate or exacerbate psychosis, and meta-analyses conclude heavy cannabis use increases the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Caution is warranted in assigning a new psychotic diagnosis during substance withdrawal because symptoms can last for weeks to months after discontinuation, and when symptoms are observed only in intoxication or withdrawal they are likely to diminish and disappear within a week to a month of abstinence; the recommendation in the first month of abstinence is to recognize and treat these symptoms with cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT)–based approaches and supportive medications for withdrawal symptoms and monitoring, rather than giving a separate psychiatric diagnosis with pharmacological treatment. Observational studies and clinical trials show that mental health problems increase with increased alcohol and cannabis use and that abstinence from and reduction in alcohol and cannabis use are associated with improvements in mental health symptoms, including in youth.

### Comorbidity of severe psychotic disorders with measures of substance use… [^04feab27]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Frequency of alcohol use, smoking, marijuana use, and other drug use contrasted among subgroups. The odds ratios correspond to the odds of the prevalence of the symptom among cases with chronic psychotic illness vs control individuals. The ORs are contrasted with one another. Main Outcomes and Measures Smoking, heavy alcohol use, heavy marijuana use, and recreational drug use. Results. Relative to the general population, individuals with severe psychotic disorders have increased risks for smoking, heavy alcohol use, heavy marijuana use, and recreational drug use.

All races/ethnicities and both sexes have greatly elevated risks for smoking and alcohol, marijuana, and drug use. Of specific concern, recent public health efforts that have successfully decreased smoking among individuals younger than age 30 years appear to have been ineffective among individuals with severe psychotic illness. Conclusions and Relevance In the largest assessment of substance use among individuals with severe psychotic illness to date, we found the odds of smoking and alcohol and other substance use to be dramatically higher than recent estimates of substance use in mild mental illness. Individuals with severe mental illness die approximately 25 years earlier than the general population, and the cause of this early death is largely owing to medical illness that can be attributed to substance use disorders.

1–3 For example, although suicide and injury are more common among individuals with chronic mental illness, 60% of premature deaths in persons with schizophrenia are due to medical conditions including heart and lung disease and infectious illness caused by modifiable risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and intravenous drug use. 1 In addition to early mortality, the severity and prognosis of the primary mental illness are worsened in the context of substance dependence. 4, 5. The 2009–2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health identified adults with mental illness and found that 36% of adults with mental illness are current smokers relative to 21% of adults without mental illness. 6 In addition, it found that adult smokers with mental illness are less likely to quit than adult smokers without mental illness.

This discrepancy highlights the public health disparity in the mentally ill, a uniquely vulnerable population. The prevalence of various measures of substance use was much higher among individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychotic features. For ease of interpretation, we classified individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, and bipolar disorder with psychotic features as cases with severe psychotic disorder, and we analyzed substance use with respect to case/control status. The prevalence of these measures was uniformly high in individuals with severe psychotic illness relative to the control populations. The odds ratio of cases vs control individuals for each measure of substance use is given in Table 3. Overall, the smoking measures were more strongly associated with case/control status than alcohol or other drugs, with estimated ORs of 4.

### Marijuana use in the immediate 5-year premorbid period is associated with increased risk of onset of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders [^cf3ef9a9]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Several studies suggest that adolescent marijuana use predicts earlier age at onset of schizophrenia, which is a crucial prognostic indicator. Yet, many investigations have not adequately established a clear temporal relationship between the use and onset.

Methods

We enrolled 247 first-episode psychosis patients from six psychiatric units and collected data on lifetime marijuana/alcohol/tobacco use, and ages at onset of prodrome and psychosis in 210 of these patients. Cox regression (survival analysis) was employed to quantify hazard ratios (HRs) for effects of diverse premorbid use variables on psychosis onset.

Results

Escalation of premorbid use in the 5years prior to onset was highly predictive of an increased risk for onset (e.g., increasing from no use to daily use, HR = 3.6, p < 0.0005). Through the analysis of time-specific measures, we determined that daily use approximately doubled the rate of onset (HR = 2.2, p < 0.0005), even after controlling for simultaneous alcohol/tobacco use. Building on previous studies, we were able to determine that cumulative marijuana exposure was associated with an increased rate of onset of psychosis (p = 0.007), independent of gender and family history, and this is possibly the reason for age at initiation of marijuana use also being associated with rate of onset in this cohort.

Conclusions

These data provide evidence of a clear temporal relationship between escalations in use in the five years pre-onset and an increased rate of onset, demonstrate that the strength of the association is similar pre- and post-onset of prodromal symptoms, and determine that early adult use may be just as important as adolescent use in these associations.

### Balancing risks and benefits of cannabis use: umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^b16df6d4]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

These associations are of particular concern given the epidemiology and age pattern of cannabis use disorders, and the population attributable fraction of cannabis for schizophrenia, which is almost 10%. According to the Global Burden of Disease 2019, cannabis use disorders are associated with 690 000 (95% uncertainty interval 421 000–1 080 000) disability adjusted life years per 100 000 individuals globally. Prevalence and disability related to cannabis start to be measurable at ages 10–14 years (11 900 disability adjusted life years), peak at ages 20–24 years (163 000 disability adjusted life years), then gradually decrease. The age pattern of cannabis use disorders coincide with the peak age at onset of mental health disorders. According to the largest meta-analysis on the age at onset of mental disorders published to date, which pooled 192 studies and 708 561 individuals, around 34.6% of mental health disorders have onset by age 14 years, 48.4% by 18 years, and 62.5% by 25 years; the age that any mental health disorder onset peaks is at 14.5 years. For cannabis use disorders, 66% of people will have onset by age 25 years, with age of peak onset 20.5 years. Of note, age at peak onset of schizophrenia spectrum disorders is also in the early 20s, with a slightly lower proportion of people with onset by 25 years (47.8%). In addition to the association between cannabis and psychosis, cannabis is also associated with a worse outcome after onset, including poorer cognition, lower adherence to antipsychotics, and higher risk of relapse. In other words, use of cannabis when no psychotic disorder has already occurred increases the risk of its onset, and using cannabis after its onset, worsens clinical outcomes. Mood disorders also have their peak of onset close to that for cannabis use, which is of concern given the associations shown in this work between cannabis and depression, mania, and suicide attempt. Moreover, high tetrahydrocannabinol content cannabis could serve as a so-called gateway to other substances, particularly in younger people: this effect has been shown in humansand animal models, strengthening the recommendation to avoid cannabis use in adolescents and young adulthood.

### Multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of cannabis use disorder yields insight into disease biology and public health implications [^d84ed01f]. Nature Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Main

Cannabis is a psychoactive substance with a long history of use and dependence. Recently within the United States, 37 states have approved what is termed medical cannabis use, and 19 states, 2 territories and the District of Columbia allow possession of cannabis for recreational purposes. In Europe, only Malta has fully legalized recreational cannabis, although many other countries have decriminalized possession of small amounts of cannabis and have enabled medical allowances. It was recently legalized in Thailand but remains prohibited in many parts of Asia, the Middle East and South America. The status in many of these places may be subject to change in the near future. More than a third of individuals who use cannabis develop cannabis use disorders (CanUD), and evidence regarding the impact of legalization on escalating use and use disorders is mixed. Substantial negative health outcomes associated with chronic cannabis use include various cancers associated with inhaling combustion products, declines in cognitive capacity and motivation and increased schizophrenia (SCZ) risk. Individual and societal complications that result from CanUD include decreased productivity and accidents related to intoxication. The full range of risks and negative outcomes associated with cannabis use and CanUD may not be appreciated widely. Considering the gradually increasing permissiveness surrounding its use, understanding various sources of risk that influence CanUD is both necessary and timely.

### Cannabinoids and schizophrenia: risks and therapeutic potential [^d48b2092]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

A convergence of evidence shows that use of Cannabis sativa is associated with increased risk of developing psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, and earlier age at which psychotic symptoms first manifest. Cannabis exposure during adolescence is most strongly associated with the onset of psychosis amongst those who are particularly vulnerable, such as those who have been exposed to child abuse and those with family histories of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia that develops after cannabis use may have a unique clinical phenotype, and several genetic polymorphisms may modulate the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis. The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in psychosis both related and unrelated to cannabis exposure, and studying this system holds potential to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Anandamide signaling in the central nervous system may be particularly important. Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis can cause symptoms of schizophrenia when acutely administered, and cannabidiol (CBD), another compound in cannabis, can counter many of these effects. CBD may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of psychosis following cannabis use, as well as schizophrenia, possibly with better tolerability than current antipsychotic treatments. CBD may also have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Establishing the role of CBD and other CBD-based compounds in treating psychotic disorders will require further human research.

### Are cannabis-using and non-using patients different groups? Towards understanding the neurobiology of cannabis use in psychotic disorders [^0e256627]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

A further important consideration is a shared vulnerability for psychotic disorders and use of cannabis through genetic vulnerability or stress. An important methodological limitation of observational studies that precludes against definitive conclusions being drawn is inadequate adjustment for the plethora of potential confounders: around 60 different confounders have been identified, and Moore and colleagues noted that residual confounders can never be completely eliminated. A more recent review noted that an increased risk of psychosis in cannabis users remains when extensive confounders are adjusted for (such as age, sex, substance misuse, tobacco use), although certain confounders such as childhood trauma and genetic variability have been more infrequently looked at. Large-scale studies demonstrate higher polygenic risk of schizophrenia to be associated with cannabis, supporting shared genetic vulnerability, but this accounts for a small fraction of the variance of cannabis use overall (0.47–0.49%). Evidence from studies that have used statistical modelling and sibling-pair design suggests that the association between cannabis use and psychosis is unlikely to be explained by residual confounding factors such as shared vulnerability (e.g. genetic) that may not have been measured in longitudinal studies.

It has been therefore argued that cannabis represents a component cause for enduring psychotic disorder, that is, by itself neither necessary nor sufficient to cause disorder but implicated in the patho-aetiology of illness alongside other factors which increase psychosis risk. One approach is to consider whether transition to psychosis occurs in enriched samples, that is, those at higher risk of developing disorder in cannabis users as opposed to non-users. This approach is made complicated by the fact that at least one study has shown that those who self-present at clinical high risk are likely to stop using cannabis due to the distressing nature of the symptoms. Although earlier studies had not shown an association between cannabis use and psychosis transition, more recent larger studies considering abuse or cannabis-induced attenuated psychotic symptoms have shown an association between cannabis and psychosis transition, although in Auther et al. this only remains at the trend level (p = 0.064) after adjusting for alcohol use.

### Associations of comorbid substance use disorders with clinical outcomes in schizophrenia using electronic health record data [^20190d7a]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental illness with a global prevalence of 1% and defined by the National Institute of Mental Health as a "mental disorder characterized by impairments in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions". Patients with schizophrenia experience disabling symptoms and reduced functioning, resulting in treatment costs that are a major economic burden on US healthcare systems and estimated at $155.70 billion per year. This is, in part, due to high rates of psychiatric comorbidity associated with schizophrenia. It has been estimated that 50% of patients who received a diagnosis of schizophrenia suffer from at least one additional comorbid psychiatric disorder. The most prevalent comorbidity is substance use disorder (SUD), impacting 42–49% of patients. The most common SUDs include nicotine (60–95%), alcohol (20–86%), cannabis (12–80%), and cocaine (15–50%). In addition, polysubstance use disorder has been identified as a common feature in patients, where alcohol, cannabis, and other substances were likely to be used concurrently with each other.

### Association between cannabis use and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: an individual participant data meta-analysis on 3053 individuals [^234595ac]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Considering previous knowledge along with the current findings on positive and excitement dimensions, raising public health awareness on the harmful effects of cannabis is appropriate. Indeed, a high severity of these symptoms tends to disrupt the therapeutic alliance and puts individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who are using cannabis especially at-risk for the discontinuation of their treatment and poor clinical outcomes. However, the lower severity of negative symptoms for cannabis-users cannot be ignored. The presented results support both the self-medication and toxicity hypotheses of cannabis use, with differential effects on positive and negative symptoms. More longitudinal designs are needed to fully understand the role of cannabis use on symptom dimensions. In addition, the composition of cannabis needs to be acknowledged as its two main components, THC and CBD, were shown to have differential impacts on healthy individuals, THC inducing both positive and negative symptoms. A recent review highlighted the need for trials to investigate this issue among patients with schizophrenia, as the few available trials are insufficient to bring evidence for an effect of THC or CBD on the global symptomatology in this population mainly due to the high heterogeneity between trials (e.g. in dose, length of treatment). The presented findings reflect the complexity of the interaction between cannabis use and the symptomatology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and allowed to disentangle its association with multiple symptom dimensions. Its opposite association regarding negative and positive symptoms provides interesting perspectives for future longitudinal designs and clinical trials.

### Psychosis spectrum symptoms before and after adolescent cannabis use initiation… [^62dbbd52]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Osborne KJ, Barch DM, Jackson JJ, Karcher NR. Psychosis Spectrum Symptoms Before and After Adolescent Cannabis Use Initiation. JAMA Psychiatry. 2025; 82: 181–190. doi: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2024.3525 Question Does adolescent cannabis initiation contribute to changes in psychosis spectrum symptoms, reflect a shared vulnerability for both cannabis use and psychosis risk, or suggest efforts to self-medicate symptoms. Findings. This cohort study of 11 868 adolescents found that adolescents who used cannabis at any point during the study period reported a greater number of psychosis spectrum symptoms and more distress from symptoms relative to those who never used cannabis, providing evidence for shared vulnerability.

Additionally, consistent with a self-medication hypothesis, the number of psychosis spectrum symptoms and distress from symptoms increased in the time leading up to cannabis initiation, whereas mixed evidence was observed for an increase in psychosis symptoms after cannabis initiation. Meaning These findings underscore the importance of accounting for shared vulnerability and self-medication effects when modeling cannabis–psychosis risk associations, particularly in adolescence. Importance Adolescent cannabis use has been consistently posited to contribute to the onset and progression of psychosis. However, alternative causal models may account for observed associations between cannabis use and psychosis risk, including shared vulnerability for both cannabis use and psychosis or efforts to self-medicate distress from psychosis spectrum symptomology.

Objective To test 3 hypotheses that may explain cannabis–psychosis risk associations by modeling psychosis spectrum symptom trajectories prior to and after cannabis initiation across adolescent development. Design, Setting, and Participants. This cohort study used data from 5 waves across 4 years of follow-up from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. The ABCD study is an ongoing large-scale, longitudinal study of brain development and mental and physical health of children in the US launched in June 2016. Data are collected from 21 research sites. The study included data from 11 868 adolescents aged 9 to 10 years at baseline. Three participants were excluded from the present analysis owing to missing data. Data analysis was performed from September 2023 to July 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures Discontinuous growth curve modeling was used to assess trajectories of psychosis spectrum symptoms before and after cannabis initiation.

Control variables considered for this investigation were age, sex, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, socioeconomic status, parental mental health, and other substance use. Results. Among the 11 858 participants at wave 1, the mean age was 9. 5 years; 6182 participants were male. Consistent with a shared vulnerability hypothesis, adolescents who used cannabis at any point during the study period reported a greater number of psychosis spectrum symptoms and more distress from psychosis spectrum symptoms relative to those who never used cannabis. Additionally, consistent with a self-medication hypothesis, the number of psychosis spectrum symptoms and distress from psychosis spectrum symptoms increased in the time leading up to cannabis initiation.

### Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study [^18b68288]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

The mechanism behind the association

We investigated the association between cannabis use and risk of psychosis by analysing the expression of psychotic experiences. Psychotic experiences share many characteristics with clinically relevant psychosis, such as demographic, environmental, and genetic risks, and are thought to represent a behavioural marker for psychosis liability. Psychotic experiences are a common and generally transitory phenomenon in the general population, that, nevertheless, might become abnormally persistent and progress to clinical psychotic disorder if combined with exposure to environmental risks. Our study confirmed cannabis as an environmental risk factor, impacting on risk of psychosis by increasing the risk of incident psychotic experiences, and, if use continues over time, increasing the risk of persistent psychotic experiences.

The finding that longer exposure to cannabis was associated with greater risk for persistence of psychotic experiences is in line with an earlier study showing that continued cannabis use over time increases the risk for psychosis in a dose-response fashion. This is also in agreement with the hypothesis that a process of sensitisation might underlie emergence and persistence of psychotic experiencesas an indicator of liability to psychotic disorder. Sensitisation refers to the phenomenon that repeated exposure to an (environmental) stressor leads to progressively greater responses over time. In rats, repeated exposure to THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive component of cannabis) induces behavioural sensitisation: rats pre-treated with increasing doses of THC show greater behavioural (locomotor) responses to a THC challenge after a 14 day washout period than THC naive rats. In humans, however, direct evidence for cannabis sensitisation is lacking. As our study showed that the risk of persistent psychotic experiences increases with longer periods of cannabis exposure, we suggest that a process of sensitisation underlies the association between cannabis and psychosis.

### A systematic review of neuroimaging and acute cannabis exposure in age-of-risk for psychosis [^b6aac4e6]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Psychoses generally emerge earlier for men (mean age of first episode: 24.2, mean age of first negative symptom: 26.5) than for women (mean age of first episode: 27.4, mean age of first negative symptom: 41.6). There is a higher incidence of schizophrenia among men (1.4:1); however, prevalence rates are similar, and women predominate at older onset. Although the cause of the discrepancy is unknown, it has been suggested that sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, may contribute to the sex differences. Given that females are typically more sensitive to the effects of cannabis use as they relate to psychosis, it is important to examine sex differences in cannabis response as a means to better understand this differential susceptibility

In this review, we examine studies that administer cannabinoids to better understand how mechanisms of acute exposure during adolescence and young adulthood may be implicated in changing of brain circuitry, thereby increasing risk for the emergence of psychoses. While understanding the impact of chronic use is critical, habituation makes it difficult to tease apart how cannabis alters specific brain circuits. Studies investigating chronic use are limited by confounding variables, such as concomitant tobacco, alcohol, and polydrug use, as well as shared genetic risk for psychosis and cannabis use. By focusing on acute studies, this review reduces the confounding effects associated with repeated cannabis use. To mitigate the chance that genetic background may increase psychosis-proneness and cannabis use, we examine studies that use neuroimaging techniques to investigate how brain circuits and behavioural responses are altered following acute cannabis exposure. The alterations may reflect underlying alterations to the GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic systems that undergo refinement during adolescence. To capture the state of cannabis research, this review includes THC, CBD, as well as homologues of these molecules, such as tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCv). We synthesize the neuroimaging studies in humans and animal models that examine the effects of cannabinoid administration, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally in an age group coincident with the typical age-of-onset of psychosis (20–22; however there are additional spikes reported around 40 for women, and even some accounts of a third spike for women around 80), to better understand the impact of cannabinoids on the brain during these sensitive periods.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e184fd7a]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Random effect model

The REM showed a significant log-linear dose–response association between the frequency of cannabis use category and risk of psychosis development (p < 0.0001). The risk of psychosis development increased with greater cannabis use frequency (Table 2), from RR:1.25 (95% CI 1.10–1.20) for yearly use, to RR:1.32 (95% CI 1.21–1.44) for monthly use, RR:1.51 (95% CI 1.32–1.72) for weekly use, and RR:1.71 (95% CI 1.45–2.06) for daily/near-daily use. Each category increase in cannabis consumption was associated with a 1.15-times (14.7%; 95% CI 9.8%-19.8%) increase in the risk of psychosis development.

### Cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia: a mendelian randomization study [^fb0a82a2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Cannabis use is observationally associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia, but whether the relationship is causal is not known. Using a genetic approach, we took 10 independent genetic variants previously identified to associate with cannabis use in 32 330 individuals to determine the nature of the association between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia. Genetic variants were employed as instruments to recapitulate a randomized controlled trial involving two groups (cannabis users vs nonusers) to estimate the causal effect of cannabis use on risk of schizophrenia in 34 241 cases and 45 604 controls from predominantly European descent. Genetically-derived estimates were compared with a meta-analysis of observational studies reporting ever use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia or related disorders. Based on the genetic approach, use of cannabis was associated with increased risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio (OR) of schizophrenia for users vs nonusers of cannabis: 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–1.67; P-value = 0.007). The corresponding estimate from observational analysis was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.19–1.67; P-value for heterogeneity = 0.76). The genetic markers did not show evidence of pleiotropic effects and accounting for tobacco exposure did not alter the association (OR of schizophrenia for users vs nonusers of cannabis, adjusted for ever vs never smoker: 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09–1.83). This adds to the substantial evidence base that has previously identified cannabis use to associate with increased risk of schizophrenia, by suggesting that the relationship is causal. Such robust evidence may inform public health messages about cannabis use, especially regarding its potential mental health consequences.

Materials and methods

Observational analysis between ever use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia

Observational studies reporting an association between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia were selected from a recent and comprehensive review of the literature (published in 2016) and a meta-analysis from 2007 reporting prospective studies of cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia. As only one study reported schizophrenia as an outcome, we slightly broadened our inclusion criteria to also include studies reporting related disorders (schizophreniform disorder and psychotic symptoms). To identify additional studies that may be eligible for inclusion since the meta-analysis from 2007, we conducted a PubMed search (Supplementary Figure S1).

To compare with the causal estimate (see below), we restricted to studies that reported ever use of cannabis (compared with never users of cannabis) as an exposure and a corresponding risk estimate for schizophrenia or related disorders. We identified four studies that met these criteria. We found one additional study in which the definition of the exposure was similar (any use of cannabis, provided that individuals have consumed cannabis ⩾5 times) and also included it in the analysis. The pooled effect estimate was derived using a random-effects meta-analysis of study summary estimates. Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 summarize the main characteristics of included and excluded studies, respectively.

Genetic markers associated with ever use of cannabis

We used the 10 leading SNPs from a recent GWAS (contributing studies outlined in Supplementary Table S3), comprising data of participants from European ancestry predominantly, on cannabis use (phenotype defined as ever use of cannabis during participants' lifetime) to obtain the gene–exposure (SNP–cannabis) association estimates and their corresponding standard errors (s.e.) values (Supplementary Table S4). Although none of the SNPs surpassed a conventional genome-wide significance threshold (P -values were between 4.6 × 10 −7 and 3.1 × 10 −6 in the discovery analysis), estimates were directionally consistent across the vast majority of contributing studies (Supplementary Table S4), and these SNPs can individually, and cumulatively, be considered as valid instruments for MR analysis.

### Cannabis and mental health… [^bf22a668]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points Cannabis use can cause disorientation and sometimes unpleasant thoughts or feelings of anxiety and paranoia. Mental health Cannabis use can cause disorientation and sometimes unpleasant thoughts or feelings of anxiety and paranoia. People who use cannabis are more likely to develop psychosis and long-lasting mental disorders, including schizophrenia. The association between cannabis and schizophrenia is stronger in people who start using cannabis at an earlier age and use cannabis more frequently. Cannabis use is also associated with depression; social anxiety; and thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f1a549cb]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were included in this review if they: (1) investigated the relationship between cannabis use and risk of psychosis development, (2) were of case–control or cohort design, (3) included hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) or the data required to calculate them, and (4) included quantified information on the frequency of cannabis consumption, and specifically allowed attribution to at least three frequency categories (i.e. 'monthly', 'weekly', 'daily/near-daily') because at least three categories were required to complete the dose–response analysis.

Studies were excluded if: (1) they included participants with a pre-existing psychotic condition prior to the initiation of cannabis use, diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association,) or International Classification of Diseases 11th Edition (ICD-11) (World Health Organization,)criteria, (2) investigated cannabis use primarily for medicinal purposes, and (3) included synthetic cannabinoids in their scope.

Only studies published in 2010 onward were considered for inclusion. This cut-off was chosen in part because cannabis potency as a known predictor of use-related psychosis outcomes and has steadily increased in recent years (Sideli et al.). For example, the potency of cannabis in Europe has been reported to have doubled from 8.9% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in 2008 to over 17% THC in 2017, while cannabidiol (CBD) levels remained stable (Chandra et al.). No restrictions were placed on participants age or publication language. Grey literature, such as conference abstracts and dissertations were not excluded from database searches (e.g. Web of Science Core Collection). Additional sources of grey literature, such as government websites and clinical trial repositories, were not considered for this review due to the fact that randomized trials and organizational reports would not contain the type of data required for this analysis. Case–control studies with less than ten matched-pairs were excluded due to the increased risk of bias (RoB) encountered in studies with sample sizes below this threshold (Dekkers et al.).

### Understanding and treating "first-episode" schizophrenia [^ae90dd1c]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

"First-episode schizophrenia" is a clinical and research term that often is used to emphasize the special issues that arise when working with this patient population. The notion that schizophrenia has an inexorable downhill course or is a deteriorating illness is being challenged by more sophisticated understanding of what happens before the initial episode and new understanding of the interactions between biologic vulnerabilities and specific environmental risk during adolescence and early adulthood, such as marijuana use. While the incidence rate of "first-episode" will make this a relatively small percentage of a usual clinical caseload, it is a critically important time for the future course of the illness. The hope is that proper management during this critical period will favorably influence the long-term trajectory of outcome for this individual patient. A growing body of evidence suggests that certain approaches and interventions are more helpful than others, such as understanding of the overwhelming nature of the experience to patients and families, aiming to achieve a full and broad pharmacologic response to initial antipsychotic therapy, while also being on the lookout for vulnerability and extreme sensitivity to side effects, and to anticipate a high likelihood of premature medication discontinuation. Clinicians and treatment services should try to identify "first-episode" patients in time to be able to anticipate and address these issues.

### Cannabis, psychosis and schizophrenia: unravelling a complex interaction [^a0f00409]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

The relationship between cannabis and psychosis and schizophrenia has tested the field of addiction for decades, and in some ways serves as measure of our ability to provide a credible contribution to public health. As cannabis is used widely, many people are interested in the risks the drug poses to mental health. This paper focuses upon a seminal study examining this, the trajectory of subsequent research findings and what this has meant for understanding and communicating risk factor information. These studies provided evidence of a dose-response relationship between cannabis and psychosis, and that for those individuals with schizophrenia cannabis exacerbated their symptoms. The findings fit with a multi-causal model in which vulnerability interacts with a precipitating agent to produce a disease outcome. Even though this is a common model in epidemiology, it has proved difficult to communicate it in this case. This may be because at a population level the increased risk is weak and the vulnerabilities relatively rare. It may also be because people bring strongly held preconceptions to interpreting a complex multi-causal phenomenon.

### Assessing rates and predictors of cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms across observational, experimental and medical research [^f08635bc]. Nature: Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Implications for research on cannabis use and psychosis

This work has a number of implications for future research avenues. First, experimental studies administering THC constitute the most stringent available causal inference method when studying risk of CAPS. Future studies should therefore capitalize on experimental designs to advance our understanding of the acute pharmacological effects of cannabis, in terms of standard cannabis units, dose–response risk profiles, the interplay of different cannabinoids, and building on recent work.

Despite the value of experimental studies in causal inference, observational studies are essential to identify predictors of CAPS that cannot be experimentally manipulated (for example, age, long-term/chronic exposure to cannabis) and to strengthen external validity. However, a particular challenge for inference from observational studies results from bias due to confounding and reverse causation. Triangulating and comparing findings across study designs can therefore help to identify potential sources of bias that are specific to the different study designs. For example, we observed that, despite THC dosing being robustly associated with CAPS in experimental studies, we did not find an association between cannabis use patterns (for example, high-THC cannabis strain) in observational and quasi-observational studies. This apparent inconsistency may result from THC effects that are blunted by long-term, early-onset and heavy cannabis use. For other designs, reverse causation may bias the association between cannabis use patterns and CAPS: as individuals may reduce cannabis consumption as a result of adverse acute effects, the interpretation of cross-sectional estimates concerning different cannabis exposure and risk of CAPS is particularly challenging. Future observational studies should therefore exploit more robust causal inference methods (for example, THC administration in naturalistic settingsor within-subject comparisons controlling for time-invariant confounds) to better approximate the experimental design. In particular, innovative designs that can provide a higher temporal resolution on cannabis exposures and related experiences (for example, experience sampling, assessing daily reactivity to cannabis) are a valuable addition to the causal inference toolbox for cannabis research. Applying genetically informed causal inferences such as Mendelian randomization analysescan further help to triangulate findings, which would be possible once genome-wide summary results for both different cannabis use patterns and CAPS become available.

### The association between cannabis abuse and subsequent schizophrenia: a Swedish national co-relative control study [^13e44371]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence supporting causality, according to 'Hill's Postulates' (Hill & Hill; Goodman & Phillips,), includes specificity of association (van Os et al; Zammit et al.) and a dose-related response (Arseneault et al; Veling et al; Di Forti et al; McGrath et al.), with heavy cannabis users (cannabis abusers) having a sixfold increase in risk of future diagnosis of schizophrenia (Andreasson et al; Zammit et al.).

Of all the suggested causal criteria, however, only temporality is labeled 'essential'; that is, exposure must occur prior to disease onset (Hill & Hill; Goodman & Phillips). Prodromal effects common to schizophrenia could make temporality difficult to establish; affected individuals may suffer from a variety of non-specific symptoms (anxiety, depression, concentration problems, etc.) that occur months to years prior to the manifestation of full schizophrenic illness (Klosterkotter et al; Cornblatt et al.). During this time, individuals may use cannabis either as a result of the prodromal illness or in an attempt to treat their emerging symptoms. One review assessed current evidence of association between cannabis use and psychosis/schizophrenia alongside Hill's causal criteria and concluded that '[this observed] association may reflect a causal relationship' (McLaren et al.). However, the same review recognized the need for future research '[to] control for important environmental and biological confounding factors'.

Cannabis use and psychotic relapse

In addition to increasing the risk of onset of psychosis, cannabis use also has an adverse effect on outcome in those who develop psychosis. Of the 50089 participants of the Swedish conscript study, 401 (0.8%) had schizophrenia-related inpatient admissions in the subsequent 34 years. Of those in whom baseline cannabis data were available, 78/357 (20%) had a history of cannabis use. This group had had more hospital admissions compared with never users over the 34-year period (10 vs. four) and had spent a year longer in hospital compared with the never users (547 days vs. 184).

Other studies confirm adverse prognostic features of cannabis use. In patients with an established psychotic illness, continued cannabis use has been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes. A recent meta-analysis using pooled data from over 16500 patients with psychosis, who were at various stages of psychotic illness, demonstrated that continued cannabis use is associated with greater risk of relapse, hospitalization and longer inpatient admissions. Discontinuing cannabis use appeared to decrease the risk of relapse to a level that was similar to patients who had never used cannabis. That cannabis use at presentation with first-episode psychosis (FEP) is associated with increased risk of relapse subsequently was further independently confirmed by 5-year follow-up of over 2000 FEP patients in South London. This study suggested that those with cannabis use at onset of FEP spent on average 35 additional days in hospital over 5 years compared with those without history of cannabis use. However, not all patients who develop psychosis following cannabis use continue using the drug following onset of their illness. This was investigated in a separate study, which demonstrated that outcomes are worse in those reporting frequent and continued use of high-potency cannabis compared with those who had stopped, also suggesting a dose-response relationship.

### Cannabis and psychosis: are we any closer to understanding the relationship? [^a85d90aa]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

This aspect is rarely assessed; even when potency or strength is investigated, the categories used to describe this factor are inconsistent and sometimes too generic to allow replication or translation. The increasing potency of cannabis that is available is thought to play a role in the risk of developing psychosis and other cannabis use disorders. This leads onto a further problem namely the qualifying period of experiencing psychosis that is required to qualify for a diagnosis of cannabis-induced psychosis. Some people will have a short-lived acute reaction to cannabis while others will go on to develop a longer-term problem. This offers the potential of over counting or under counting cases depending on where the individual presents to, how long they are assessed for and the depth and quality of the assessment conducted at that point in time.

The third hypothesis which proposes a common cause such as a shared genetic liability is responsible for the link between cannabis and schizophrenia. This has been explored more recently using sophisticated methods of analysis to try and untangle the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia. One example used Mendelian randomisation to investigate the direction of the relationship in a study using a genome database. This reported that there is a slightly increased risk of developing schizophrenia following initiation of cannabis with stronger evidence that schizophrenia predicts cannabis initiation.

So far, genetic orientated research has failed to provide a plausible explanation involving a purely biological or genetic factor that makes clear the direction of the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia. Although it is possible that there is a relationship and even if that were to emerge as causal, it would be influenced significantly by the individual's environment. Most research in this field relies on animal studies which have their own limitations, but they still have a contribution to theoretical modelling.

### Association of combined patterns of tobacco and cannabis use in adolescence with psychotic experiences [^cea22001]. JAMA Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, we have previously found that a substantial proportion of people who smoke cigarettes most heavily also use cannabis, and thus the cigarette-only class might not include those who have been most heavily exposed to tobacco. As the cannabis use group in our study included occasional (1–3 times in the past 6 months) and frequent (daily) users, we were unable to differentiate whether our findings are mainly driven by frequent users; including frequency of substance use data resulted in an unstable model. Our study was also not able to examine associations of longer-term cumulative cannabis and tobacco use and psychosis outcomes, although these analyses may become tractable in the future.

While psychotic experiences in the population are relatively poor predictors of psychotic disorder, they represent the key characteristic of such disorders, and understanding their etiology almost certainly has relevance to understanding the etiology of clinically defined psychosis. However, we were not adequately powered to investigate the effects of cannabis or cigarette use on psychotic disorders and cannot rule out different effects of these substances on other psychosis-related psychopathology, such as negative symptoms. We were also unable to tease out associations of cannabis with chronic vs acute psychotic outcomes, although excluding individuals who reported psychotic experiences only ever occurring within 2 hours of using drugs had minimal effect on our results. Nevertheless, given the long half-life of THC, the only way of determining whether cannabis use can lead to chronic psychotic disorders that persist long after potential effects of exogenous cannabinoids is to study regular users of cannabis who subsequently become abstinent.

The one longitudinal study of which we are aware that examined this relationship reported only weak evidence of association between ex–cannabis use and psychotic experiences, although there were relatively few ex–cannabis users. Given the age of the participants over the course of our study, we were not able to identify a class of ex–cannabis users to clarify this relationship; however, long-term follow-up of this cohort may enable us to address this question more robustly.

### Safety and toxicology of cannabinoids [^ed22ac43]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Although there is strong evidence that early cannabis use among at-risk individuals may increase the likelihood of developing schizophrenia or psychosis at a later time point, additional research is necessary to parse out the intricacies of the interaction between THC and CBD on the cannabinergic system. For example, several systematic reviews found that while cannabis use may increase subclinical symptoms of psychosis, the findings to date do not support an association between cannabis use and first psychosis. Additionally, there is some evidence that cannabis with a high CBD and low THC content may mitigate psychosis.

Public Health and Safety

In addition to the physical, psychological, and cognitive effects of cannabis, there are clear concerns about public health and safety. A potentially serious public health effect of cannabis use is a high incidence of drugged driving and motor vehicle accidents. Moreover, driving impairment occurs in a dose-dependent fashion, and individuals driving under the influence of cannabis are anywhere from 2 to 7 times more likely to be involved in both fatal and nonfatal motor vehicle collisions.

Another risk associated with cannabis use is addiction and cannabis dependence. Nine to ten percent of individuals who initiate cannabis use will become addicted. That number increases to 16–17% among individuals who initiate use as an adolescent and 25–50% among individuals who use cannabis daily. The risk for addiction appears to wane as the individual ages, such that it is rarely addictive if use begins after the age of 25 years. However, currently 6.5% of twelfth graders in the USA report daily cannabis use, and there is evidence to suggest that as perception of harm decreases, prevalence of use increases. This is particularly important because early exposure to cannabinoids may alter the reactivity of the dopamine reward centers in the brain, thereby increasing vulnerability to abuse of and addiction to other substances, and adding support to the gateway hypothesis. Furthermore, heavy cannabis use may be linked to negative consequences downstream, including lower income, greater need for socioeconomic assistance, unemployment, and lower life satisfaction.

There is also evidence of negative impacts on maternal and child health. Cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with poor physical outcomes, including birth defects, low birth weight, and an increased risk of childhood cancer, as well as poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including aggressive behavior and attention problems in girls. For example, children who were exposed to marijuana prenatally are more likely to demonstrate decreased problem-solving skills, as well as poor memory and attention. Similarly, babies exposed to marijuana prenatally show traits indicative of neurological development problems.

### Association between formal thought disorder and cannabis use: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2a1fe59b]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Previous studies found that cannabis use was associated with more severe positive symptoms of psychosis, within an epidemiological continuum ranging from the general population to schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Moreover, accumulating pieces of evidence suggest a causal role of cannabis in triggering and aggravating positive symptoms, particularly in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Since FTD has been suggested to constitute a core symptom of schizophrenia, it was theoretically expected that cannabis use would be associated with exacerbated FTD. The results presented in this meta-analysis tend to support this association, and the effect of cannabis use on FTD seems consistent along the psychosis continuum, regardless of the severity of the psychotic disorder. Intermediary factors need to be controlled for in future research on this issue. These findings encourage future research to assess FTD using specific scales and support the clinical relevance of assessing FTD in early stages of the psychosis continuum, specifically among individuals using cannabis.

### Schizophrenia: a tale of two critical periods for prefrontal cortical development [^e601dde1]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Cannabis use

Another factor linked to an increased risk for schizophrenia is cannabis use. Cannabis use, especially if heavy and prolonged, has been associated with persistent psychosis unrelated to cannabis intake and an elevated risk for developing schizophrenia. Cannabis use in those predisposed to mental illness is associated with higher outcomes of psychosis and schizophreniform illness than in those not at risk. However, controlled studies show that even in healthy individuals intravenous administration of the principal active ingredient in cannabis can produce transient psychotic symptoms and cognitive deficits that resemble those observed in schizophrenia subjects. Moreover, growing evidence indicates that outcome is related to the age at which cannabis use commences. For example, one study found that adolescents who engage in cannabis use before the age of 15 may be at greater risk of developing schizophrenic symptoms than those who begin using cannabis after age 15 but before age 18. These disturbing findings suggest either that early adolescence is a particularly vulnerable time for cannabis-associated insult to the developing brain or that exposure to cannabis throughout adolescence is more deleterious than exposure only during late adolescence. Apart from overt psychosis, adolescent cannabis use has a range of detrimental effects on cognition that may be related to impaired prefrontal cortical function, for example, diminished sustained attention, impulse control and executive functioning. Animal studies reaffirm the observations in human subjects, demonstrating that administration of cannabinoid substances in adolescence but not adulthood is associated with an array of behavioral and cognitive symptoms akin to those associated with schizophrenia. Cannabis use in human subjects before age 17 is also associated with smaller whole-brain volumes and smaller percentages of gray matter volume, perhaps linking cannabis to exuberant loss of synapses during the adolescent period of maturation.

### Understanding the link between cannabinoids and psychosis [^7684e38d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The changing legal landscape surrounding cannabis is likely a contributing factor to the increasing rates of cannabis use worldwide. Accordingly, consequences of cannabis use translate into sizeable public health implications. While the medicinal purposes of cannabis are often sensationalized, information regarding its harmful effects is largely confined to the scientific community. Therefore, educational campaigns informing the public about the links between cannabinoids and psychosis are urgently needed.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^64a98d27]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic, with thresholds assessed according to standard recommendations (Deeks, Higgins, & Altman). Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots, whereby regression/mixed-effects models and variance/standard errors assessed funnel plot asymmetry (Sterne & Egger).

Methodological quality and certainty-in-findings assessments

The RoB of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale versions for both cohort and case–control studies (Wells et al.). Bias for case selection, comparability of cases and controls, and exposure were examined. RoB assessments were completed in duplicate by two independent reviewers and disagreements resolved through consensus discussions. All studies assessed were included in this review, regardless of their methodological quality. Certainty-in-findings for the primary review outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach (Schunemann, Brozek, Guyatt, & Oxam,) and reported through the online GRADEPro tool.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4322882c]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While more frequent cannabis use to be appears associated with an elevated risk of psychosis, this risk is likely further influenced by other risk-factors (e.g. genetics, family history, cannabis potency) that require additional consideration for and incorporation into prevention messaging beyond mere frequency-of-use factors (Di Forti et al; Hamilton & Sumnall; Kiburi et al; van der Steur et al.). For example, persons who have a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with a psychosis condition have a 10-fold higher risk of psychosis development; if the risk of daily cannabis use is multiplicative, their risk would increase 20-fold.

Cannabis users, however, should be explicitly advised by evidence-based prevention messaging to keep their cannabis use infrequent in order for their risks for cannabis-attributable psychosis development to be meaningfully lowered. Such exposure-stepped, evidence-based prevention messaging about risk-thresholds for cannabis use and psychosis may be controversial in some realms. However, it is analogous to evidence-based alcohol-related health guidelines where the risk for specific adverse (e.g. cardio-vascular) outcomes is low/absent below certain consumption levels and 'moderate' use is recommended (Furtwaengler & de Visser; Holmes et al; Wood et al.). Beyond, evidence-based, ideally quantified, risk-thresholds for cannabis use exposure (e.g. frequency, a potency of use) toward other key adverse outcomes (e.g. CUD) should be assessed toward informing public health-oriented prevention efforts (Fischer et al.).

### Non-genetic factors in schizophrenia [^d0eca9dd]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Cannabis and Other Substance Use

Substance use is highly prevalent in psychotic patients. There is good evidence that psychostimulants (such as amphetamines and cocaine) can induce psychosis. There also have been a few suggestions that alcohol misuse and psychosis might be associated, and recently, a meta-analysis raised the question of whether tobacco use could be a risk factor for psychosis. However, much greater evidence points to an important aetiological role for cannabis use. Prospective epidemiological studies consistently report an association between cannabis use and schizophrenia with an estimated two- to threefold increased risk. A dose–response relationship between extent of use and risk of psychosis has been shown in a meta-analysis. The association is stronger in those individuals who used cannabis earlier, and who used high potency tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis or/and more frequently. Indeed, the EU-GEI study has found that if high-potency cannabis was no longer available, around 12% of first-episode psychosis cases across 11 Europe-wide sites could be prevented, rising to 30% in London and 50% in Amsterdam. The age at which cannabis use begins appears to correlate with the age at onset of psychosis while persistent cannabis use after a first episode is associated with poorer prognosis, higher relapse rates, longer hospitalizations, and severe positive symptoms.

Cognitive Impairments and Brain Structural Abnormalities

Although schizophrenia usually manifests in adolescence and early adult life, numerous reports suggest that many patients with schizophrenia have a history of delayed developmental milestones in the first year of life, lower IQ in childhood, hearing impairment, emotional problems, and interpersonal difficulties early in life. Those people who develop psychosis following heavy cannabis use show less evidence of such neurodevelopmental deviance. In particular, they have higher premorbid IQ and better social functioning in childhood than psychotic patients who do not use cannabis. Perhaps being smarter and more sociable enables them to find cannabis dealers and obtain the money for the drug!

### DSM-V research agenda: substance abuse / psychosis comorbidity [^2d33d5fd]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

For diagnosis of patients with comorbid psychotic symptoms and substance use disorders (SUDs), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, makes clear distinctions between independent psychotic disorders (eg, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) and substance-induced syndromes (eg, delirium, dementias). Most substance-induced psychotic symptoms are considered to be short lived and to resolve with sustained abstinence along with other symptoms of substance intoxication and withdrawal. These guidelines are challenged by practical difficulties in distinguishing between substance-induced and independent psychoses and by mounting evidence that marijuana use may be a contributing cause of schizophrenia. To inform the diagnostic distinction between substance-induced vs independent psychotic symptoms, 2 kinds of information could be sought from longitudinal research: (a) identification of early markers that clearly differentiate the 2 conditions and (b) more precise information about duration of psychotic symptoms induced by different substances. Evidence of this type could emerge from reanalysis of existing data from large-scale longitudinal studies of community samples. To inform possible nosological changes related to the possible schizophrenia-inducing role of marijuana (eg, designating a "cannabis-induced" subtype), a wide range of research evidence will be needed to clarify the relationship between effects of cannabis and schizophrenia symptoms. Ultimately, the ideal psychiatric nomenclature will define syndromes on the basis of established etiology and/or pathophysiology. Given the strong association between SUDs and psychotic disorders, research on the neurobiology of psychotic disorders could fruitfully include subjects with comorbid SUDs to shed light on shared etiology and pathophysiology.

### Association of cannabis legalization with prevalence of schizophrenia… [^61b5f3d6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gilman JM. Association of Cannabis Legalization With Prevalence of Schizophrenia — Challenges of Attributing Biological Causality to Policy Change. JAMA Netw Open. 2025; 8: e2457876. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.57876 Nearly 40 years of evidence from longitudinal epidemiologic studies has shown that cannabis use, particularly heavy use of high-potency cannabis products by adolescents, is associated with increased risk of developing schizophrenia, 1 with clear dose effects. 2 Although a causal relationship is still debated, 3 these associations have caused concerns that there would be a marked increase in the prevalence of schizophrenia after the legalization and subsequent commercialization of high-potency cannabis products. Myran and colleagues4 conducted a population-based cohort study using electronic medical records of more than 13.

5 million individuals in Ontario, Canada, over 16 years, spanning the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes in 2015 and for recreational purposes in
2018. The authors investigated the association of cannabis use disorder with the development of schizophrenia and psychosis not otherwise specified, a diagnosis used when psychotic symptoms are present but do not yet meet the full criteria for schizophrenia. The first main finding of this study is that the population-attributable risk fraction for CUD associated with schizophrenia and psychosis NOS increased significantly over time, with the highest increase seen among men aged 19 to 24 years and a small but significant increase among women of the same age range.

This finding adds further support for mounting evidence on the association between cannabis use and increased risk for psychosis, and it shows that this association is most robust among young adults who are developmentally vulnerable to both the neurologic effects of cannabis and developing psychosis. The second finding of this study is that the PARF for CUD associated with psychosis NOS, but not schizophrenia, accelerated further with the legalization of cannabis for medical but not recreational purposes. These mixed findings should not make us doubt the association between cannabis use and psychosis; rather, they highlight the methodological challenges of linking the biological causality of a complex psychiatric illness, such as schizophrenia, with a cannabis policy change. These challenges may lead to underestimates of biological effects and inflated type II errors, biasing these types of studies toward the null hypothesis.

Three of the most critical challenges of using large-scale EMR studies to assess mental health consequences of cannabis policy changes are discussed here. The first critical challenge is determining the most relevant time point for evaluating the associations of legalization with mental health outcomes. The process of legalization is often not summed up by a single date or year. Rather, legalization is a moving target, as implementing laws, issuing licenses, and opening retail dispensaries take time, and it is often years between the passage of a law and a functioning commercial market. Even after a commercial market is functioning, it takes time for individuals to start using commercial cannabis, and it may be years before some individuals develop problematic use patterns. Should problematic use be linked with emergence of new psychiatric illness, this process would also take time and may not be detectable during the first few years of legalization.

### Development over time of the population-attributable risk fraction for cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia in Denmark [^db36cd85]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Cannabis use and potency of cannabis have increased during the past 2 decades. If the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia is causal, this should be reflected in an increase in the proportion of cases of schizophrenia being attributable to cannabis, the population-attributable risk fraction (PARF).

Objective

To determine whether the PARF for cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia has increased over time.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide, register-based historical prospective cohort study included all people in Denmark born before December 31, 2000, who were alive and 16 years or older at some point from January 1, 1972, to December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from August 2020 to April 2021.

Exposure

Diagnosis of cannabis use disorder.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnosis of schizophrenia, with estimated PARF of cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia from 1972 to 2016.

Results

A total of 7 186 834 individuals were included in the analysis, including 3 595 910 women (50.0%) and 3 590 924 men (50.0%). The adjusted hazard ratio for schizophrenia fluctuated at approximately 4 (with 95% CIs ranging from approximately 3 to 6) throughout most of the study period when people diagnosed with cannabis use disorder were compared with those without cannabis use disorder. The PARF of cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia also fluctuated, but with clear evidence of an increase from 1995 (when the PARF was relatively stable around 2.0%, with a 95% CI of approximately 0.3% to either side) until reaching some stability around 6.0% to 8.0% (with a 95% CI of approximately 0.5% to either side) since 2010.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results from these longitudinal analyses show the proportion of cases of schizophrenia associated with cannabis use disorder has increased 3- to 4-fold during the past 2 decades, which is expected given previously described increases in the use and potency of cannabis. This finding has important ramifications regarding legalization and control of use of cannabis.

### Cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia: a mendelian randomization study [^ff3cf577]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Observational association between ever use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia and related disorders

One prospective study met our primary research criteria and reported that ever use of cannabis (compared with no use) was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for schizophrenia of 1.50 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10–2.00). When meta-analysing this estimate with other prospective observational studies reporting related traits, including schizophreniform disorder and psychotic symptoms (encompassing a total of 1326 cases and 58 263 controls), ever use of cannabis was associated with a 43% increase in the risk of schizophrenia or related disorders (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.19–1.67; I² = 0%) using random-effects modelling (Figure 1).

Causal effect of ever use of cannabis on risk of schizophrenia

The 10 SNPs associated with ever use of cannabis explained 1% of its variance. There was a positive estimated effect between ever use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia (Supplementary Figure S3). In MR analysis based on 34 241 cases of schizophrenia and 45 604 controls, ever use of cannabis was causally associated with risk of schizophrenia (OR per-1-log unit increase in ever use of cannabis (derived by fixed-effect meta-analysis of individual causal effects estimates of the SNPs), 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.14; P -value = 0.007; Figure 2). Random-effects meta-analysis yielded similar results (OR per-1-log unit increase in ever use of cannabis, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02–1.16; P -value = 0.010). Applying population-based estimates, this translated to a 37% increase in the risk of schizophrenia (OR for users vs non-users of cannabis, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.09–1.67; Figure 3). The MR estimate was consistent with estimates derived from observational analyses restricted to schizophrenia alone (test for heterogeneity, χ² = 0.23; P -value = 0.634) or schizophrenia and related disorders combined (test for heterogeneity, χ² = 0.10; P -value = 0.755; Figure 3).

### Cannabis use and clinical outcome in people with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders over 24 months of treatment [^0ab06f19]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Cannabis use is associated with an unfavourable course of illness in schizophrenia, although several factors may confound this association. In this longitudinal study, we explored the influence of cannabis use on baseline symptom severity and treatment outcomes in 98 patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders treated with a long acting injectable antipsychotic over 24 months. Using mixed models for repeated measures, we compared visit-wise changes in psychopathology, social and occupational functioning and quality of life between recent/current cannabis users (n = 45) and non-users (n = 53). There were no significant group by time interactions for any of our outcomes, and with the exception of poorer functionality in cannabis users at baseline, no significant differences in these domains at baseline or month 24. Also, remission rates were similar. However, more cannabis users met our operationally defined relapse criteria compared to non-users, and more frequent cannabis use over the course of treatment, as assessed by positive urine toxicology testing, predicted relapse. Our results suggest that cannabis users do not have poorer treatment response than non-users in terms of symptom reduction over the 24 months of treatment. However, dose-related risk of relapse remains with ongoing cannabis use, possibly by directly reducing the threshold for psychotic breakthrough.

### Assessing causality in associations between cannabis use and schizophrenia risk: a two-sample mendelian randomization study [^3e49361f]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our results provide some evidence in support of the hypothesis that cannabis initiation increases the risk of schizophrenia, although the size of the causal estimate is small. Our findings therefore do not contradict the current observational literature suggesting an association between cannabis initiation and schizophrenia of a moderate size, and may suggest any true causal effect size is smaller still. Given the small effect sizes generally seen in the observational data (Moore et al.) particularly when considering cannabis initiation phenotypes, and in these results using a different methodology, this converging evidence supports the theory that although cannabis use might be a risk factor for schizophrenia, any effect cannabis initiation has is likely to be small. For example, based on the upper bound of the 95% CI from our primary analysis, an individual who is more likely to smoke cannabis (50% probability of initiation) has at most a 24% higher relative risk of suffering from schizophrenia compared with an individual with a low probability of smoking cannabis (10% probability of initiation). However, these results are unlikely to be directly comparable to the observational studies in terms of comparing effect sizes, particularly with regard to heavier use of cannabis, or use of different strains of cannabis where ratios of cannabinoids may differ. The ratio of THC and cannabidiol (CBD) is likely to be particularly important in determining the psychotomimetic properties of cannabis (D'Souza et al; Iseger & Bossong,), although genetic variants that index the strength of cannabis used have not been identified as yet.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^435c37cc]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis found a dose–response relationship between the frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis, as shown by previous reviews (Hasan et al; Kiburi et al; Marconi et al; Moore et al; Polkosnik et al; van der Steur et al.). Prior meta-analyses specifically documented a higher risk among daily users, mostly as compared to no or lower frequency use, with ORs ranging from 2.09 to 3.90 (Kiburi et al; Marconi et al; Moore et al.). One systematic review and meta-analysis (2016) failed to find a statistically significant relationship between cannabis use and the odds of developing psychosis (Kraan et al.) but only considered lifetime cannabis use, likely entailing associations too weak for detection.

Importantly, this review identified discernable risk-thresholds by cannabis use at a higher frequency for psychosis development. Specifically, weekly cannabis use was associated with a 35% (RR 1.35) increase in risk, and daily/near-daily use was associated with a 76% (RR 1.76%) increase in the risk of psychosis development compared to no use, according to the model of best-fit (restricted cubic-splines). Conversely, there were no significant increases in risk associated with monthly and yearly use in this model, suggesting an absence of increased risk for lower frequency use.

The role of cannabis use in the incidence of psychotic outcomes as a causal contributor is complex, because their causes are known to be multifactorial, being influenced by the environment, genes and their interactions (Ben Amar & Potvin; Hall & Degenhardt; Hamilton; Wright et al.). Recent research has confirmed the importance of genetic influences, specifically polymorphisms on specific genes (e.g. COMT, AKT1) that make affected individuals more vulnerable to the psychogenetic effects of cannabis (Misiak et al; Polkosnik et al; van der Steur et al.). The present review further compounds the evidence that specific (frequent) cannabis exposure patterns appear to significantly contribute to the multifactorial interplay toward psychosis outcomes.

### Convergence of cannabis and psychosis on the dopamine system [^0cc5e822]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a common problem that is of particular concern due to the association between cannabis and psychosis. In healthy individuals, administration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, induces positive psychotic symptoms, such as suspiciousness, delusions, and altered perception, and negative symptoms, including blunted affect and amotivation. Higher levels of cannabis use are consistently associated with an increased risk of psychosis; this dose-response relationship supports a causal influence. Individuals with psychosis who use cannabis report an earlier illness onset compared with those who do not. However, the mechanism through which cannabis may contribute to psychotic symptoms remains unclear and much debated, especially as cannabis use is neither sufficient nor necessary to cause persistent psychotic disorders. One possibility is that cannabis affects the same final common pathway of dopaminergic excess in psychosis. Importantly, given its association with psychotic relapses in patients with schizophrenia, its effect on dopamine may be dose dependent and sustained when use is continued.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab685e00]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This review includes some limitations. First, most of the included studies did not report data on potential contributor factors for outcomes, which therefore could not be controlled for. For example, the use of high-potency cannabis also increases the risk of a psychotic disorder (van der Steur et al.), yet many studies do not report information on the potency of cannabis used by participants, which can differ greatly across products (e.g. skunk, concentrates) and by geographical location. Additionally, half of the included studies either did not control for the possible co-use of alcohol, tobacco, or other recreational substances in their analysis or it was unclear whether these factors were controlled for. All included studies utilized self-report measures of cannabis use frequency, which may be prone to recall bias. While including only studies with multiple use frequency categories, classification of risk into categories may lead to information loss by treating every within-category participant as equal for risk (Wynants et al.). The identification of risk-thresholds was limited to the a-priori defined frequency categories. Differences in design and number of (e.g. numbers of use frequency categories) of included studies also limited our ability to conduct sub-group analyses, such as by year of study or study design. While included studies were rated as having a low RoB according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale, it is important to note that all included studies are observational designs and therefore overall study quality is lower and the potential RoB higher than if randomized trials were utilized.

### Association between cannabis use and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: an individual participant data meta-analysis on 3053 individuals [^0b6d2cab]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis used IPD to provide refined results on the association between cannabis use and the psychopathology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Using two empirically validated PANSS structures, cannabis use was found to be associated with a higher severity of positive symptoms. This observation strengthens previous reports showing the same association between cannabis use and positive symptoms. A review of longitudinal studies investigated the causal role of cannabis on the higher severity of positive symptoms and highlighted the consistent findings supporting this causal role. However, it was also mentioned that the magnitude of this effect could be overstated in some studies, for example when not accounting for confounding variables. The presented results showed a decrease in the effect size when adjusting for confounding variables, in line with this observation. However, considering the consistent effect found in cross-sectional and longitudinal reviews, it supports the hypothesis of cannabis use being one of the causes of the higher severity of positive symptoms.

Similarly, negative symptoms in both PANSS structures were found to be decreased for cannabis-users, in accordance with two previous studies, but divergent from a larger number of published reviews. In line with the already mentioned review of longitudinal studies, confounding variables were shown to impact the results. The difference between unadjusted and adjusted analyses showed that adding these variables increased the negative association of cannabis use with negative symptoms severity, suggesting that omitting these variables could understate the association. Again, no causal role of cannabis can be implied from the current results. The lower severity of negative symptoms among cannabis-users supports both the self-medication hypothesis and the possibility that patients with fewer negative symptoms are more prone to substance use. To date, no study can provide a definitive answer to this question. A recent longitudinal study reported that cannabis could be causally linked to detrimental effects on diminished expression but not apathy, two subdimensions of negative symptoms. More studies employing longitudinal designs are needed to ascertain the causal role of cannabis on global negative symptoms.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were eligible if: 1) CUD was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD); or data on cannabis use was collected using validated tools such as questionnaires (Appendix, Scales and Questionnaires, p.5); 2) participants were diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (i.e. schizophrenia and subtypes such as paranoid, undifferentiated, disorganized; schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified) or FEP according to DSM or ICD criteria, with no restriction on age; 3) individual data could be divided into two groups, i.e. patients using and not-using cannabis at assessment; 4) symptoms were assessed using the PANSS. Studies were not eligible if: 1) cannabis use was not investigated; 2) subcomponents of cannabis were administered to individuals as part of the protocol; 3) publication was not in English language. If a study reported data for several groups of patients with multiple diagnoses (e.g. patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, depression), only the data concerning the groups of interest were requested (i.e. patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders). In cases of follow-up studies, only the baseline data was retrieved to avoid the influence of any interventions realized as part of the study protocol.

At the patient-level, the criteria for being included in the cannabis-using group were: 1) Diagnosis of CUD; or 2) frequency of use of at least twice a week; or 3) presenting an "at-risk" consumption as assessed via questionnaires. Criteria for belonging to the non-using group was no or sporadic cannabis use (less than twice a week) during the three previous months.

### Assessing causality in associations between cannabis use and schizophrenia risk: a two-sample mendelian randomization study [^094d1ac9]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We found strong evidence in support of the reverse causation hypothesis, that schizophrenia risk predicts likelihood of cannabis initiation. These findings are consistent with a recent study that showed genetic predisposition for schizophrenia was associated with increased use of cannabis (Power et al.). The authors of that study interpreted their findings as evidence for shared genetic aetiology between cannabis use and schizophrenia; however, an alternate interpretation, supported by the more directional analyses reported here, is that schizophrenia risk increases the risk of cannabis use. Our study cannot provide information about potential mechanisms through which this could happen. Causation could be via either biological or social mechanisms. For example, people with a higher genetic risk for schizophrenia could be more predisposed to try cannabis because they experience more pleasurable or positive effects of intoxication, or because they are more likely to associate with people who use cannabis (Nordsletten et al.). However, these explanations remain speculative, although could be tested in further research, for example using a recall-by-genotype design. The findings from the positive and negative control analyses were broadly consistent with our prediction; our results suggest that cannabis initiation is associated with fewer years in education (although with weaker evidence than predicted), while cannabis initiation does not predict height.

### Association between cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia stronger in young males than in females [^bb28ee30]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have indicated that partial genetic confounding factors likely exist on the association between CUD and schizophrenia, i.e.g.enes shared between these conditions may account for some but not all of the association (Gillespie & Kendler). However, genetic confounding factors would be unlikely to explain the steeper increases in the PARFs of CUD on schizophrenia that we identified for males than females, as changes in the genetic risk-profile of an entire population would have to occur over generations. Both preclinical and clinical studies have provided evidence of significant differences between the sexes in response to the acute and long-term effects of cannabis (Cooper & Craft). We were able to adjust for alcohol and other specific drug use disorders in our study, but not for tobacco use or tobacco use disorder, which has also been linked to psychosis in some (Gurillo, Jauhar, Murray, & MacCabe,) but not all studies (Fergusson, Hall, Boden, & Horwood). Thus, future research is needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the higher vulnerability of young males to the effects of cannabis on schizophrenia than that of young females.

This study adds to the evidence suggesting a relationship between intense use of cannabis and risk of developing schizophrenia (Marconi et al; Urits et al; Volkow et al.). At the individual level, this increased risk occurs in both sexes, but especially appears higher in young males. At the population level, this translates to CUD being a major modifiable risk factor for schizophrenia, particularly among males. Notably, an increasing proportion of cases with schizophrenia may be avertible by preventing CUD, and this increase is likely linked to the increase in THC concentration in cannabis as has been observed in confiscated samples in Denmark (Freeman et al; Thomsen et al.). This apparent of schizophrenia conferred by CUD, in combination with observations that cannabis use among youth is associated with impaired cognition and reduced academic achievement (Lorenzetti, Hoch, & Hall,), highlights the need to prevent cannabis use among youth and young adults. Interestingly, it has previously been shown that the association between cannabis and schizophrenia may be bidirectional (Ferdinand et al; Petersen, Toftdahl, Nordentoft, & Hjorthøj,), and further investigation of the reverse association, schizophrenia being a risk factor for future cannabis use, by sex and over time warrants further study.

### Traditional marijuana, high-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids: increasing risk for psychosis [^490f25a5]. World Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiological evidence demonstrates that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic outcomes, and confirms a dose-response relationship between the level of use and the risk of later psychosis. High-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids carry the greatest risk. Experimental administration of tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient of cannabis, induces transient psychosis in normal subjects, but this effect can be ameliorated by co-administration of cannabidiol. This latter is a constituent of traditional hashish, but is largely absent from modern high-potency forms of cannabis. Argument continues over the extent to which genetic predisposition is correlated to, or interacts with, cannabis use, and what proportion of psychosis could be prevented by minimizing heavy use. As yet, there is not convincing evidence that cannabis use increases risk of other psychiatric disorders, but there are no such doubts concerning its detrimental effect on cognitive function. All of the negative aspects are magnified if use starts in early adolescence. Irrespective of whether use of cannabis is decriminalized or legalized, the evidence that it is a component cause of psychosis is now sufficient for public health messages outlining the risk, especially of regular use of high-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids.

### Temporal association of cannabis use with symptoms in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis [^1fe705f2]. Schizophrenia Research (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis use is reported to increase the risk for psychosis, but no prospective study has longitudinally examined drug use and symptoms concurrently in clinical high risk cases.

Method

We prospectively followed for up to 2 years 32 cases who met research criteria for prodromal psychosis to examine the relationship between substance use and clinical measures.

Results

Cases with a baseline history of cannabis use (41%) were older, but did not differ in clinical measures. Longitudinal assessments showed these cases had significantly more perceptual disturbances and worse functioning during epochs of increased cannabis use that were unexplained by concurrent use of other drugs or medications.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that cannabis use may be a risk factor for the exacerbation of subthreshold psychotic symptoms, specifically perceptual disturbances, in high risk cases.

### Association between cannabis use and schizotypal dimensions – a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies [^3397ed6d]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Cannabis consumption can cause abuse and dependence and increase risk of developing psychiatric and somatic disorders. Several literature reviews explored the link between cannabis consumption and schizophrenia but none summarized the rich literature on cannabis and psychometric schizotypy. The aim of our review is to synthesize data from studies that explored the association between cannabis consumption and schizoptypal dimensions. A systematic review of the literature and, when needed, contact with the authors, allowed us to gather data from 29 cross-sectional studies. We compared schizotypy scores between subjects that never used cannabis and subjects that used it at least once ("never vs. ever") and between current users and subjects that do not use cannabis currently ("current vs. other"). We conducted separate analyses for total schizotypy score and each of the three classical schizotypal dimensions (positive, negative, disorganized). For all eight comparisons, the cannabis group ("ever" or "current") had higher schizotypy scores. Differences were in the small or medium range and, with the exception of the negative score in the current vs. other comparison, statistically significant. Cannabis consumption is associated with increased schizotypal traits. More research, using different approaches (e.g. longitudinal studies) is needed to explore the cause of this association.

### Association between cannabis use and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: an individual participant data meta-analysis on 3053 individuals [^b4006166]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Although numerous studies have investigated the influence of cannabis use on positive or negative symptoms, only few studies have investigated the influence of cannabis use on other symptom dimensions in schizophrenia. However, there is evidence that cannabis use is associated with higher severity of disorganization, depression, and excitement. Besides disorganization, these associations have never been investigated in individuals with schizophrenia. In addition, psychotic symptoms may be also influenced by many other factors than just cannabis use such as sex, illness duration, long exposure to stimulants, childhood trauma, etc. The main goal of the current study is to thoroughly investigate the influence of cannabis across the global psychopathology and take into account other variables that may influence symptoms severity using a meta-analytic approach with individual participant data (IPD) on a large sample of individual-level data collected from previously published studies. Given the widespread use of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to parse and measure psychotic symptoms, we specifically selected studies using the PANSS as to maximize data homogeneity. This allows to better capture the influence of cannabis on the complex symptomatology of psychosis using the 3-factor as well as the 5-factor structure of the PANSS at the individual level.

### Insights into the role of cannabis in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^be6fdf4a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Long term

Prolonged cannabis has been associated with a number of long-term neurocognitive side effects. One of the main long-term consequences is the risk of addiction. Among individuals who experiment with cannabis, 9% became dependent, with higher rates of dependence if initially consumed as a teenager. As with other addictive substances, attempting to stop may lead to withdrawal symptoms, which makes cessation difficult. Cannabis has also been labeled a gateway drug, with increased susceptibility to other drug addictions.

Although long-term memory impairments have been reported, confounding factors such as baseline cognitive function, concurrent use of other cognitively impairing substances, mental health comorbidities, and age of use make a causal relationship difficult to establish. Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated subtle differences in brain activity between cannabis users and controls; however, the clinical implications of these differences are difficult to determine. Use during adolescence, a period of brain development, is associated with reduced functional connectivity of the brain. This is reflected in a significant decline in IQ scores in adolescents that frequently use cannabis, with a greater decline in more persistent users.

Cannabis use has been associated with a number of mental health issues. Epidemiological research suggests chronic use increases the risk of psychoses and may exacerbate the clinical course of patients with schizophrenia. There has also been an association with anxiety and depression. –

Prolonged cannabis use is associated with a number of physiological effects. Cannabis has also been demonstrated to have detrimental effects on male and female fertility, and may also impact fetal neurodevelopment. – There has also been an association with increased cardiovascular risks, including ischemic strokes and myocardial infarctions, particularly with larger doses of cannabis. Smoking cannabis has also been associated with chronic bronchitis and increased rates of respiratory infection.

The most commonly reported gastrointestinal side effect is the development of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. This syndrome, seen in chronic cannabis users, is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe nausea, intractable vomiting, and abdominal pain, with a diagnosis based on the Rome IV criteria. The pathophysiology of the syndrome remains unknown; however, there may be an underlying genetic predisposition. Symptomatic relief may be achieved by taking a hot shower, with resolution of the problem with cannabis cessation.

As with any medical therapy, the use of cannabis is associated with risks and adverse effects. Physicians should be aware of these potential risks. The limited studies in IBD have not reported any serious side effects but the follow-up duration was limited. Further studies are required to determine the long-term safety profile of cannabis in the management of IBD.

### Association between age at onset of psychosis and age at onset of cannabis use in non-affective psychosis [^50f47574]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several studies have associated cannabis use with the development of schizophrenia. However, it has been difficult to disentangle the effects of cannabis from that of other illicit drugs, as previous studies have not evaluated pure cannabis users. To test whether the onset of cannabis use had an effect on the initiation of psychosis, we examined the time relationship between onset of use and onset of psychosis, restricting our analysis to a cohort of individuals who only used cannabis and no other street drugs.

Methods

Fifty-seven subjects with non-affective psychoses who used cannabis prior to developing a psychosis were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS). The Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS) was also used to interview a family informant about psychiatric illness in the patient and the entire family. Multiple linear regression techniques were used to estimate the association between variables.

Results

After adjusting for potential confounding factors such as sex, age, lifetime diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence, and family history of schizophrenia, the age at onset of cannabis was significantly associated with age at onset of psychosis (β = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1–0.7, p = 0.004) and age at first hospitalization (β = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1–0.8, p = 0.008). The mean time between beginning to use cannabis and onset of psychosis was 7.0 ± 4.3. Age at onset of alcohol use was not associated with age at onset of psychosis or age at first hospitalization.

Conclusion

Age at onset of cannabis is directly associated with age at onset of psychosis and age at first hospitalization. These associations remain significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors and are consistent with the hypothesis that cannabis could cause or precipitate the onset of psychosis after a prolonged period of time.

### Premorbid cannabis use is associated with more symptoms and poorer functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorder [^925845ba]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis use disorder is associated with an earlier age at onset and a more severe outcome of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The role of cannabis use before the onset of illness (premorbid cannabis use) has not been fully investigated. We here examined how amount and type of premorbid cannabis use was associated with the later course of illness including current substance use, symptoms and level of functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorder.

Method

We used a naturalistic sample of patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorders with a comprehensive history of illness and substance use. Data on premorbid substance use was obtained from comprehensive self-report. The relationship to outcome was investigated using regression models that included current substance use and premorbid functioning.

Results

Pre-schizophrenia cannabis use was significantly associated with more severe psychotic symptoms and impaired functioning. Higher levels of premorbid cannabis use were associated with higher levels of current psychotic symptoms. These associations were independent of current substance use and premorbid functioning. Early use of cannabis (age < 17 years) was associated with earlier age at onset of psychosis, independently of potential confounders.

Conclusions

Pre-psychosis cannabis use affects illness outcome in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and is associated with lower age at onset of psychosis. These findings of independent negative effects of premorbid cannabis use in schizophrenia suggest that a limitation of the general use of cannabis may have beneficial health effects.

### Collaborative care in the identification and management of psychosis in adolescents and young adults [^1721d5bb]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Marijuana and tobacco exposure in adolescence — risk links to psychosis are summarized: Meta-analyses have demonstrated that daily tobacco use is associated with increased psychosis risk and earlier age when psychotic symptoms begin, with authors concluding that a causal link between tobacco smoking and development of psychosis should be considered. Most studies suggest a consistent association between marijuana use in adolescence and development of psychosis, and persistent use after an initial psychotic episode is associated with poorer prognoses. Earlier age at first marijuana use correlates with earlier age at onset of psychotic symptoms, and cannabis use is a preventable risk factor in psychosis. A multisite study in Europe and Brazil found daily cannabis use and use of high-potency cannabis were the strongest independent predictors of having a psychotic disorder, with odds 3.2 times higher for daily users versus never-users and 1.6 times higher for high-potency users versus never-users; the association varied by location depending on how and what kind of cannabis is used in that region.

### No evidence of associations between genetic liability for schizophrenia and development of cannabis use disorder [^cf060278]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) is increased in patients with schizophrenia. It is important to establish if this is explained by non-causal factors, such as shared genetic vulnerability. We aimed to investigate whether the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders would predict CUD in controls, patients with schizophrenia, and patients with other psychiatric disorders.

Methods

We linked nationwide Danish registers and genetic information obtained from dried neonatal bloodspots in an observational analysis. We included people with schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders, and controls. The exposures of interest were the PRS for schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) autism spectrum disorder, and anorexia nervosa. The main outcome of interest was the diagnosis of CUD.

Results

The study included 88 637 individuals. PRS for schizophrenia did not predict CUD in controls [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI 0.95–1.43 per standard-deviation increase in PRS, or HR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.72–3.00 comparing highest v. remaining decile], but PRS for ADHD did (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.50 per standard-deviation increase, or HR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.27–3.22 for the highest decile of PRS). Among cases with schizophrenia, the PRS for schizophrenia was associated with CUD. While CUD was a strong predictor of schizophrenia (HR = 4.91, 95% CI 4.36–5.53), the inclusion of various PRS did not appreciably alter this association.

Conclusion

The PRS for schizophrenia was not associated with CUD in controls or patients with other psychiatric disorders than schizophrenia. This speaks against the hypothesis that shared genetic vulnerability would explain the association between cannabis and schizophrenia.

### Association between cannabis use and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: an individual participant data meta-analysis on 3053 individuals [^e8c49ee5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The association between cannabis use and positive symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders is well documented, especially via meta-analyses. Yet, findings are inconsistent regarding negative symptoms, while other dimensions such as disorganization, depression, and excitement, have not been investigated. In addition, meta-analyses use aggregated data discarding important confounding variables which is a source of bias.

Methods

PubMed, ScienceDirect and PsycINFO were used to search for publications from inception to September 27, 2022. We contacted the authors of relevant studies to extract raw datasets and perform an Individual Participant Data meta-analysis (IPDMA). Inclusion criteria were: psychopathology of individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); cannabis-users had to either have a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder or use cannabis at least twice a week. The main outcomes were the PANSS subscores extracted via the 3-factor (positive, negative and general) and 5-factor (positive, negative, disorganization, depression, excitement) structures. Preregistration is accessible via Prospero: ID CRD42022329172.

Findings

Among the 1149 identified studies, 65 were eligible and 21 datasets were shared, totaling 3677 IPD and 3053 complete cases. The adjusted multivariate analysis revealed that relative to non-use, cannabis use was associated with higher severity of positive dimension (3-factor: Adjusted Mean Difference, aMD = 0.34, 95% Confidence Interval, CI = [0.03; 0.66]; 5-factor: aMD = 0.38, 95% CI = [0.08; 0.63]), lower severity of negative dimension (3-factor: aMD = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.90; -0.09]; 5-factor: aMD = -0.50, 95% CI = [-0.91; -0.08]), higher severity of excitement dimension (aMD = 0.16, 95% CI = [0.03; 0.28]). No association was found between cannabis use and disorganization (aMD = -0.13, 95% CI = [-0.42; 0.17]) or depression (aMD = -0.14, 95% CI = [-0.34; 0.06]).

Interpretation

No causal relationship can be inferred from the current results. The findings could be in favor of both a detrimental and beneficial effect of cannabis on positive and negative symptoms, respectively. Longitudinal designs are needed to understand the role of cannabis is this association. The reported effect sizes are small and CIs are wide, the interpretation of findings should be taken with caution.

Funding

This research did not receive any specific grant or funding. Primary financial support for authors was provided by Le Vinatier Psychiatric Hospital.

### Association between continued cannabis use and risk of relapse in first-episode psychosis: a quasi-experimental investigation within an observational study [^e4352b52]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cannabis use after first-episode psychosis is associated with poor outcomes, but the causal nature of this association is unclear.

Objective

To examine the precise nature of the association between continued cannabis use after the onset of psychosis and risk of relapse of psychosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study followed up for at least 2 years after the onset of psychosis 220 patients who presented to psychiatric services in South London, England, from April 12, 2002, to July 26, 2013, with first-episode psychosis. Longitudinal modeling (fixed-effects analysis, cross-lagged path analysis) was used to examine whether the association between changes in cannabis use and risk of relapse over time is the result of shared vulnerability between psychosis and cannabis use, psychosis increasing the risk of cannabis use (reverse causation), or a causal effect of cannabis use on psychosis relapse.

Interventions

Exposure to cannabis within the first and second years after onset of psychosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome measure was relapse of psychosis, defined as subsequent hospitalization for psychosis. Effect of cannabis use status in the first year (Ct1) and second year (Ct2) and pattern of cannabis use continuation in the first year and second year were modeled for risk of relapse in the first year (Rt1) and risk of relapse in the second year (Rt2) after psychosis onset.

Results

A total of 220 patients with first-episode psychosis were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 28.62 [8.58] years; age range, 18–65 years; 90 women [40.9%] and 130 men [59.1%]). Fixed-effects models that adjusted for time-variant (other illicit drug use, antipsychotic medication adherence) and time-invariant (eg, genetic or premorbid environment) unobserved confounders revealed that there was an increase in the odds of experiencing a relapse of psychosis during periods of cannabis use relative to periods of no use (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03–1.24). Change in the pattern of continuation significantly increased the risk (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02–1.13), suggesting a dose-dependent association. Cross-lagged analysis confirmed that this association reflected an effect of cannabis use on subsequent risk of relapse (Ct1→Rt2: β = 0.44, P = 0.04) rather than an effect of relapse on subsequent cannabis use (Rt1→Ct2: β = -0.29, P = 0.59).

Conclusions and Relevance

These results reveal a dose-dependent association between change in cannabis use and relapse of psychosis that is unlikely to be a result of self-medication or genetic and environmental confounding.

### Associations between cannabis use, polygenic liability for schizophrenia, and cannabis-related experiences in a sample of cannabis users [^7f3b6156]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between cannabis use and psychosis has long been a question of interest. Heavy cannabis use itself has been linked to features of schizophrenia, notably psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), cognitive difficulties, and negative symptoms such as social withdrawal and depressed mood. In challenge paradigms, it has been shown that administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; the principal psychoactive constituent in cannabis) can induce acute, transitory PLEsthat often include forms of unusual thought content, paranoia, and disorganized thinking; auditory and visual hallucinations are rarer. While self-reported PLEs are often transitory, subclinical, and much more common in the general population than psychotic disorders, they are considered indices of psychopathology and are associated with impairment. Some risk factors appear to make it more likely that cannabis users will report these PLEs, including early age of cannabis initiation, heavy cannabis use, and consumption of high-potency strains of cannabis.

Risk for cannabis use and schizophrenia is influenced by genetic factors, and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and polygenic risk score (PRS) studies have shown that cannabis use and schizophrenia share genetic overlap. There is also evidence that genetic factors contribute to risk for PLEs, and studies have found that cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (eg, disorganized thought patterns) show the most robust associations with polygenic risk for schizophrenia. Furthermore, a recent study from Wainberg et al.showed that the relationship between cannabis use and PLEs in the UK Biobank was moderated by a schizophrenia PRS, with cannabis use having a larger influence on the risk of PLEs for individuals with a higher genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia. It is plausible that individuals with greater polygenic vulnerability to schizophrenia may be particularly sensitive to the psychotomimetic and mood-altering effects of THC and thus, are at greater likelihood of experiencing schizophrenia-related symptoms after cannabis use — including PLEs and cognitive difficulties. Empirical evidence on the association between genetic risk for schizophrenia and cannabis-related experiences, including paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive difficulties, is scarce. Our study sought to understand whether genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, even in individuals without schizophrenia, could contribute to how individuals respond to cannabis.

### How do established developmental risk-factors for schizophrenia change the way the brain develops? [^9cc6b30a]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder leading to psychosis, severe impairments in cognition and social interaction. Like all complex psychiatric conditions, its aetiology remains unknown. Without the benefit of a clear pathology, treatments have been limited largely to symptom control. Whilst antipsychotic drugs can largely treat the psychotic symptoms in most patients the so-called negative and cognitive symptoms remain and the use of antipsychotic drugs comes with a substantial side-effect burden. Clearly, a better aetiological understanding is needed to develop more effective therapies. One longstanding hypothesis regarding the origins of schizophrenia is that it is a disorder of brain development. The epidemiological landscape of schizophrenia suggests exposure to a wide variety of environmental risk factors (RF) during either foetal or early postnatal life leads to a modest increase in schizophrenia incidence. There are also well-described exposures during late adolescence such as exposures to drugs of abuse such as cannabisor to various social stressors that also increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. Whilst such late adolescent exposures are an important component contributing to overall disease risk, they are not the focus of this review.

### Non-genetic factors in schizophrenia [^753155d6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

New data provide intriguing evidence of an association between migration, hearing impairment, childhood abuse, low parental care, and elevation in striatal dopamine synthesis. Acute administration of THC, the active ingredient of cannabis, has been reported to increase dopamine release. However, paradoxically, chronic cannabis use and also difficult premature birth are associated with decreased striatal dopamine. Perhaps DA receptor sensitivity or dysregulation in response to stress may be one pathway through which the different exposures interact with genetic vulnerability to confer a higher risk of schizophrenia.

A compelling case is made for the role of glutamate/NMDA receptors in schizophrenia, originally suggested as a mechanism underlying the psychotogenic effects of PCP and ketamine. There is now strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that hypofunction of NMDA receptors contributes to the symptoms of schizophrenia; some reports suggest that dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia may be secondary to glutamatergic dysfunction in some cases at least. Furthermore, glutamatergic neurotransmission has been shown to mediate the effects of both acute and chronic stress.

### Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study [^a0778c09]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world, particularly among adolescents. The use of cannabis is consistently associated with mental illness, in particular psychotic disorder. It remains a matter of debate, however, whether the association between cannabis and psychosis is causal, or whether early psychotic experiences might in fact prompt cannabis use as a means of self medication. This issue can be resolved only if incident cannabis use is investigated in relation to later incident psychotic symptoms or disorder. Rarely have studies been able to examine the longitudinal relation between cannabis use and psychosis in this fashion.

The issue of self medication was addressed by Henquet and colleagues, using data from the German prospective early developmental stages of psychopathology study. The authors investigated the association between cannabis use at baseline and subsequent development of psychotic symptoms at four year follow-up and reported that after adjustment for pre-existing psychotic symptoms, cannabis use at baseline still remained significantly associated with psychotic symptoms at follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect of self medication as pre-existing psychotic symptoms did not significantly predict later cannabis use. Ferdinand and co-workers investigated the role of pre-existing self reported psychotic symptoms and showed a bi-directional association between cannabis and psychotic symptoms over a 14 year follow-up study in the general population. They showed that cannabis use predicted later psychotic symptoms in individuals with no evidence of psychotic symptoms before starting to use cannabis and that the reverse was also true, in that psychotic symptoms predicted cannabis use in those who had not used cannabis before the onset of those symptoms. A prospective population based cohort study also found evidence for a self medication effect. Individuals with self reported hallucinations at the age of 14 had a higher risk of using cannabis on a daily basis at the age of 21. In a sibling pair analysis, however, this study also suggested an independent effect of cannabis use on self reported delusional ideation later in life. Thus, although the cannabis-psychosis link has been investigated in many studies, results on the temporal association between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms remain conflicting. Longitudinal cohort studies with multiple repeated interview based measures of cannabis use and psychotic symptoms are needed to clarify this issue. The EDSP study, which completed its recent 10 year follow-up representing the fourth assessment (assessments at baseline, T1, T2, and T3, see also fig 1), is uniquely suitable for the investigation of the temporal association between cannabis and psychosis.

### Risk-thresholds for the association between frequency of cannabis use and the development of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^65306451]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analyses tested for potential non-linearity of associations. The log-linear assumption between cannabis use and risk of psychosis development was relaxed using a quadratic-trend and flexible non-linear model with restricted cubic-splines. In the quadratic-trend model, the risk of psychosis development varied according to cannabis use frequency; it increased from RR:1.01 (95% CI 0.95–1.07) for 'yearly' and RR:1.11 (95% CI 1.03–1.20) for monthly use, to RR:1.35 (95% CI 1.22–1.48) for 'weekly', and RR:1.76 (95%CI 1.29–2.13) for 'daily/near-daily' use (Table 2). The deviation from log-linearity was significant (Wald test p < 0.05, χ² = 42.48).

The restricted cubic-splines-model demonstrated that the most conservative model had the best data-fit, with similar RRs to the quadratic-trend model. In this model, the risk of psychosis increased from RR:1.01 (95% CI 0.93–1.11) for 'yearly' and RR:1.10 (95% CI 0.97–1.25) for 'monthly' use, to RR:1.35 (95% CI 1.19–1.52) for 'weekly' and RR:1.76 (95% CI 1.47–2.12) for 'daily/near-daily' use. The deviation from log-linearity was statistically significant (p < 0.05, χ² = 37.79).

### Recent cannabis use affects the association between baseline immune markers and long-term outcomes in psychosis [^c9d6d564]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The findings of the current study provide only weak support for a general predictive value of various immune markers for the long-term course of psychotic symptoms but highlight the influence of cannabis use on this relationship. In light of the known interplay between the immune and the endocannabinoid system and the high prevalence of cannabis use in psychotic disorders, the number of studies investigating the effect of cannabis use on immune markers in individuals with psychosis is strikingly low. Additional research, both of cross-sectional and longitudinal nature, is urgently needed in this area.

The findings further cast doubt on the idea that increased inflammation per se is causally linked to a more severe long-term course of psychotic symptoms. Within cannabis users, mainly reverse associations were observed, with lower inflammation indicating a higher risk for selected adverse psychosis outcomes. Such observations might suggest that cannabis use-related dysregulation in immune responses, and not increased inflammation per se, could carry a certain risk for psychotic relapse. However, they may also be attributable to unmeasured factors such as particular use patterns, and the observed associations may not be causal. Observations of association patterns in non-users also mostly suggest an absence of any associations between immune markers and psychosis outcomes. It is possible that such associations emerge primarily over shorter timespans, e.g. leading up to a psychotic relapse, or that they are more prevalent in specific subgroups.

### Cannabis use before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery: literature review [^6a0e93cc]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Cannabis and mental health disorders — evidence synthesis: A National Academies review reports moderate evidence that cannabis use is associated with increased risk for the development of depression and social anxiety disorder — but not other anxiety disorders; limited evidence links cannabis use with increased severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms, and it supported a dose-response effect on suicidality while high quality research on PTSD development or depressive disorder course was found to be lacking. Evidence appears strongest for associations with psychotic symptoms or disorders, particularly among individuals with a genetic predisposition, with a 2014 review rating the cannabis–schizophrenia relationship as "medium" and a synthesis of five fair-to-high quality reviews suggesting a "moderate to large" dose-dependent association with psychotic disorder development. Acute adverse effects — particularly among naive users — may include anxiety, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, and/or panic, are likely exacerbated by higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, may account for up to 25–30% of cannabis-related emergency department visits, and anxiety and depression may also be reported with cannabis withdrawal.

### Association of combined patterns of tobacco and cannabis use in adolescence with psychotic experiences [^f2b0ffaa]. JAMA Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cannabis and tobacco are frequently used together, identifying their individual associations on mental health is difficult but important, as this can advance understanding of causal mechanisms and help target preventive interventions.

Individuals who use cannabis regularly have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of a psychotic outcome. Tobacco use is also associated with an increased incidence of psychotic disorders, in cohort studies, and (less consistently) with subclinical psychotic symptoms, with hypothesized casual mechanisms including nicotine increasing dopamine release and inducing D 2 -receptor supersensitivity.

However, while a recent systematic review reported a meta-analysis estimate for daily smoking and psychosis that was similar to that for regular cannabis use, the estimate was based on results unadjusted for confounders, unlike that for cannabis. While concern about confounding leading to overestimation of association on psychosis also exists for cannabis, support for causal effects of cannabis also comes from experimental studies showing an increase in psychotic experiences following exposure to intravenous Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In contrast, experimental studies of nicotine administration do not support the acute onset of psychotic experiences.

The strongest evidence of a causal effect of tobacco on psychosis is that a genetic locus associated with heaviness of smoking (within the nicotinic receptor CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster) is 1 of the loci most strongly associated with schizophrenia. However, this is also theoretically consistent with either confounding by shared genetic effects (biological pleiotropy) or, perhaps less plausibly, reverse causality (ie, biological risk of schizophrenia causing smoking behavior).

Associations between genetic risk for psychosis and both cannabis use and heaviness of cigarette use are also consistent with causal effects, reverse-causal effects, and pleiotropy explanations.

As most people who use cannabis also smoke cigarettes, teasing out potentially causal effects of cannabis from those of tobacco is difficult, particularly as individuals usually mix their cannabis with tobacco, even when classing themselves as nonsmokers. Measurement error can lead to incorrect estimates of causal effects (see Gage et aland Munafò et alfor examples of the impact of measurement error on confounding and main effects) and is particularly likely when using single–time point assessments of exposure status. Thus, other methods for teasing out causal effects of cannabis as distinct from tobacco are required.

To examine possible causal linkages between cannabis use and psychosis using data gathered over the course of a 25-year longitudinal study.

Design

A 25-year longitudinal study of the health, development and adjustment of a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand children (635 males, 630 females).

Setting

The Christchurch Health and Development Study, a general community sample.

Participants

A total of 1055 participants from the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) cohort for whom data on cannabis use and psychotic symptoms were available on at least one occasion from 18, 21 and 25 years.

Measurements

As part of this study, data were gathered on frequency of cannabis use and psychotic symptoms at ages 18, 21 and 25 years.

Findings

Regression models adjusting for observed and non-observed confounding suggested that daily users of cannabis had rates of psychotic symptoms that were between 1.6 and 1.8 times higher (P < 0.001) than non-users of cannabis. Structural equation modelling suggested that these associations reflected the effects of cannabis use on symptom levels rather than the effects of symptom levels on cannabis use.

Conclusions

The results of the present study add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that regular cannabis use may increase risks of psychosis. The present study suggests that: (a) the association between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms is unlikely to be due to confounding factors; and (b) the direction of causality is from cannabis use to psychotic symptoms.

### Cannabis and psychosis: are we any closer to understanding the relationship? [^f4752b48]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

The second hypothesis suggests individuals who are predisposed to schizophrenia are drawn to cannabis to mitigate the early signs of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Although plausible, it should be stressed that several studies show how this is not the main reason these individuals consistently give as their motivation to use cannabis. Pleasure and recreation are the main reasons given by patients. Although these reasons are clearly subjective and based on individual perception, they are important to understand particularly in the clinical setting as they provide an insight to the patients' motivation for using cannabis even if this use is detrimental to their mental health.

An interesting and promising avenue of research is the potential that cannabis or rather the role a group of compounds found in cannabis might offer in treating schizophrenia. Cannabidiols have been shown to provide therapeutic value in the treatment of schizophrenia with a relatively low risk of adverse effects. This might add credibility to the second hypothesis as individuals could be benefiting from using cannabis that contains these compounds. Mitigating factors here, however, include the emerging evidence that the composition of cannabis in recent years has been changing. These changes revolve around the ratios of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiols (CBD), some of the more prominent compounds in cannabis. Higher potency strains are higher in THC and lower in CBD.

A further prospective study across five UK sites (n = 1027) following FEP patients for a year after referral to Early Intervention Services also demonstrated poorer outcome in cannabis-using patients which remained after adjusting for other substance misuse. However, the authors did note that they could not completely exclude the possibility that increases in symptomatology led to increases in use. Furthermore, all of these studies also did not adjust for treatment compliance. This is particularly important, as a recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that history of cannabis use may be associated with 150% increase in the risk of treatment non-adherence, consistent with independent evidence as well as evidence that impaired treatment adherence may mediate the association between cannabis use and poor outcome in those with FEP.

Similar to the association between cannabis use and psychotic onset, the association between cannabis use and psychotic relapse must adjust for a plethora of potential confounders, including tobacco smoking, other substance misuse, medication non-adherence, personality and genetic traits which may aggregate in the cannabis-using group. The difficulty in ensuring this across all studies relates to the limitations of observational methods in disentangling known and unknown confounders. Evidently, due to ethical reasons, one cannot administer cannabis in double-blind randomized controlled trials to determine psychosis outcome. However, recent evidence employing a quasi-experimental design within a longitudinal design demonstrates that alternative explanations and residual confounders do not fully explain the relationship between cannabis and psychotic relapse, and suggest that increased risk of relapse is contributed to by the cannabis itself. In particular, this study demonstrated that even after controlling for the effect of the most important factors that vary over the course of illness and may potentially affect outcome (such as adherence to medication for psychosis and use of other illicit drugs following onset of psychosis), as well as for premorbid confounding factors that remained stable over the course of illness (such as shared familial and genetic vulnerability, personality traits, history of childhood trauma, duration of untreated psychosis, expressed emotion and cannabis use history before the onset of psychosis), cannabis use remained a significant risk factor relapse. By comparing periods of cannabis use with periods of no use within the same individual, this study demonstrated that both change in cannabis use status (e.g. from being an user to a non-user or vice versa) and change in the pattern of cannabis use (e.g. from intermittent use to more regular cannabis use) adversely affects outcome in established psychosis, suggesting the existence of a biological gradient (dose-response relationship). Furthermore, the authors were able to rule out the possibility of reverse causality by demonstrating that cannabis use status and change in pattern of cannabis use predicted subsequent relapse and not vice versa.

Epidemiology and environmental risk factors

Schizophrenia occurs worldwide, and for decades it was generally believed to have a uniform lifetime morbid risk of 1% across time, geography, and gender. This implied either that environmental factors are not important in conferring risk or that the relevant exposures are ubiquitous across all populations studied. It was not until relatively recently that this uniform view of risk was efficiently dismantled in a series of meta-analyses by McGrath and colleagues. They provided central estimates of an incidence per 100.000 population per year of approximately 15 in males and 10 in females, a point prevalence of 4.6 per 1000, and a lifetime morbid risk of app 0.7%. These rates are based upon relatively conservative diagnostic criteria and, when broader criteria including other psychotic disorders such as delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder and psychosis not otherwise specified are applied, the rates are 2–3 fold higher. However, more importantly, McGrath and colleagues documented a large variation across studies, five-fold or more, that could not be ascribed to diagnostic or other methodological differences, but which pointed towards real differences in occurrence and exposure to etiological factors. These findings have revitalized schizophrenia epidemiology and the resulting new wave of studies, together with advances in genetics, have begun to cast light on how the disorder might arise.

The dominant paradigm for understanding the environmental contributions to schizophrenia etiology has for over three decades been the neurodevelopmental hypothesis. This directs attention towards established risk factors for schizophrenia affecting early neurodevelopment during pregnancy. These include maternal stress, maternal infections, nutritional deficiencies, intrauterine growth retardation, and pregnancy and birth complications. However, socio-economic factors, – childhood adversity, and first- and second-generation immigrant background, have also been associated with schizophrenia. There are also consistent reports of higher rates of schizophrenia in individuals born in late winter or early spring, in individuals born and/or raised in cities, and in individuals where the father was relatively old, but also an association with young parents has been found. The association with advanced paternal age has been ascribed to the increased rate of de novo mutations in their offspring, but alternative or complementary explanations have been proposed. More recently, evidence has accumulated implicating cannabis use in adolescence, in particular misuse of compounds with high THC content. Also, several other factors such as head injury, epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and severe infections – have been associated with increased risk.

### Age-dependent association of cannabis use with risk of psychotic disorder [^8d088524]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic research suggests that youth cannabis use is associated with psychotic disorders. However, current evidence is based heavily on 20th-century data when cannabis was substantially less potent than today.

Methods

We linked population-based survey data from 2009 to 2012 with records of health services covered under universal healthcare in Ontario, Canada, up to 2018. The cohort included respondents aged 12–24 years at baseline with no prior psychotic disorder (N = 11 363). The primary outcome was days to first hospitalization, ED visit, or outpatient visit related to a psychotic disorder according to validated diagnostic codes. Due to non-proportional hazards, we estimated age-specific hazard ratios during adolescence (12–19 years) and young adulthood (20–33 years). Sensitivity analyses explored alternative model conditions including restricting the outcome to hospitalizations and ED visits to increase specificity.

Results

Compared to no cannabis use, cannabis use was significantly associated with psychotic disorders during adolescence (aHR = 11.2; 95% CI 4.6–27.3), but not during young adulthood (aHR = 1.3; 95% CI 0.6–2.6). When we restricted the outcome to hospitalizations and ED visits only, the strength of association increased markedly during adolescence (aHR = 26.7; 95% CI 7.7–92.8) but did not change meaningfully during young adulthood (aHR = 1.8; 95% CI 0.6–5.4).

Conclusions

This study provides new evidence of a strong but age-dependent association between cannabis use and risk of psychotic disorder, consistent with the neurodevelopmental theory that adolescence is a vulnerable time to use cannabis. The strength of association during adolescence was notably greater than in previous studies, possibly reflecting the recent rise in cannabis potency.
