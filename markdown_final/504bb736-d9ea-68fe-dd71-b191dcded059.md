## Question

What are the primary functions of the respiratory system?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the primary functions of the respiratory system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources that define core respiratory physiology. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of functions and distinguish primary from secondary roles. Next, I will extract and synthesize the key functions with supporting citations. Finally, I will double-check for any nuances or exceptions and ensure the conclusion aligns with high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational sources that frame respiratory physiology. The SEER training module provides a concise, authoritative overview of respiration as a sequence of events including ventilation, external respiration, gas transport, internal respiration, and cellular respiration, which establishes the core functional framework I should rely on [^84dcb74e]. I should also anchor gas exchange and acid–base balance to critical care physiology, where the primary goal of the respiratory system is explicitly stated as gas exchange, especially oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination, with CO₂ handling central to acid–base homeostasis. Additionally, the CDC toxicology portal summarizes that the lungs place oxygen into blood and remove carbon dioxide and water, while the tract warms, humidifies, filters, and regulates airflow, which supports both gas exchange and conditioning roles [^a29802ca].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what counts as "primary". I need to distinguish primary from secondary or supportive functions. Gas exchange is consistently described as the principal purpose across sources, with acid–base regulation via CO2 elimination as a closely linked, essential role, whereas air conditioning, filtration, and immune defense are vital but generally categorized as secondary or supportive functions rather than the system's primary purpose [^84dcb74e] [^a29802ca]. Let me verify that this hierarchy is consistent with authoritative summaries; yes, both SEER and critical care sources prioritize gas exchange and acid–base balance, while acknowledging conditioning and defense as integral but secondary roles [^84dcb74e] [^a55338ea].

> I will now examine the first primary function: gas exchange. External respiration occurs when oxygen diffuses from alveolar air into pulmonary capillary blood and carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction, a process that must proceed uninterrupted for survival and is the defining task of the respiratory zone [^84dcb74e] [^a29802ca]. Wait, let me verify the clinical framing; in critically ill patients, the primary goal of the respiratory system is gas exchange, and ventilatory support is fundamentally aimed at restoring adequate oxygenation and CO2 removal, reinforcing that this is a primary function in both health and disease [^a55338ea].

> Next, I should review the second primary function: acid–base homeostasis. Carbon dioxide elimination via ventilation determines arterial pH through the bicarbonate buffer system, so the respiratory system directly regulates acid–base balance in concert with renal mechanisms [^a55338ea]. Let me consider whether this is truly primary; yes, because even small changes in alveolar ventilation can shift pH, and ventilatory control is tightly linked to CO2/pH chemoreflexes, underscoring its primacy alongside oxygenation [^a55338ea].

> Now, I need to check the secondary but essential functions. Air conditioning — warming, humidifying, and filtering inspired air — protects delicate distal airways and alveoli and is a consistent feature across summaries of respiratory tract function, even though it is not the system's primary purpose [^a29802ca] [^158df2f0]. Let me verify the mechanism; nasal vasculature and mucosa dynamically regulate airflow resistance and conditioning via capacitance vessels and epithelial functions, which supports the filtration and conditioning roles described [^4e22b0c4].

> I should confirm the defense and immune functions. The respiratory tract acts as a physical and immunologic barrier: mucociliary clearance removes pathogens and particles, and regional immune specializations provide surveillance and response to inhaled antigens, maintaining homeostasis while preventing infection and injury [^f267b8b0] [^10ce5cbe]. Hold on, I should verify that this is framed as supportive rather than primary; yes, authoritative immunology reviews emphasize barrier and homeostatic roles that enable the primary gas exchange function rather than replace it [^f267b8b0] [^10ce5cbe].

> Let me consider the mechanical and ventilatory aspects. Ventilation moves air to and from the alveoli, enabling gas exchange; the respiratory muscles, especially the diaphragm, generate the pressures required for inspiration and expiration, and their function is essential to sustain ventilation and, by extension, gas exchange and acid–base balance [^a8e4d672] [^b2efbbcc]. I should double-check that this is tied back to primary function; indeed, ventilatory mechanics are the means by which gas exchange is achieved, reinforcing their foundational importance even if they are sometimes described within the "how" rather than the "what" of primary function [^a55338ea].

> But wait, what if there are additional "primary" functions I'm overlooking? Some sources mention vocalization and olfaction as respiratory tract functions; however, these are typically considered specialized, non-respiratory roles of shared anatomic structures rather than core respiratory system functions, so I should not elevate them to primary status in this context [^4e22b0c4]. I should also confirm that I am not conflating disease-specific adaptations with normal physiology; for example, while exercise can stress ventilatory capacity in elite athletes, the pulmonary system is generally considered overbuilt for typical demands, which underscores that its primary task remains gas exchange rather than performance adaptation per se [^26346717].

> In summary, after verifying across sources, the primary functions of the respiratory system are twofold: gas exchange (oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination) and acid–base homeostasis via CO2 removal, both of which are essential for survival and are tightly regulated by ventilatory control [^a55338ea] [^84dcb74e]. Secondary, yet critical, functions include air conditioning (warming, humidifying, filtering), host defense and immune surveillance, and the mechanical act of ventilation enabled by respiratory muscles, all of which support the uninterrupted execution of gas exchange and acid–base regulation [^a29802ca] [^f267b8b0] [^a8e4d672].

---

The primary functions of the respiratory system are **gas exchange** (oxygen in, carbon dioxide out) [^a55338ea] and **acid–base balance** (CO₂ removal to maintain pH) [^a55338ea]. Additional essential roles include **air conditioning** (warming, humidifying, filtering) [^a29802ca], **immune defense** (mucociliary clearance, antimicrobial peptides, immune surveillance) [^f267b8b0] [^e3736146], and **ventilation** (mechanical movement of air via diaphragm and intercostals) [^b2efbbcc]. These functions are tightly regulated by the brainstem and chemoreceptors to match metabolic needs and protect the lungs [^a55338ea].

---

## Gas exchange

Gas exchange is the **core function**: oxygen diffuses from alveoli into blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses from blood into alveoli for exhalation [^a29802ca]. This process sustains cellular metabolism and is highly efficient due to the large alveolar surface area and thin diffusion barrier [^f267b8b0].

---

## Acid–base balance

The respiratory system maintains **acid–base homeostasis** by regulating CO₂ elimination; CO₂ combines with water to form carbonic acid, so alveolar ventilation directly affects pH [^a55338ea]. Chemoreceptors sense CO₂/H⁺ and adjust ventilation to keep pH near 7.4 [^a55338ea].

---

## Air conditioning

Incoming air is conditioned to protect delicate lung tissues: the upper airway **warms and humidifies** air to body temperature and near-saturation humidity, while mucus and cilia filter particles and pathogens [^a29802ca] [^4e22b0c4]. This conditioning prevents epithelial damage and optimizes gas exchange conditions [^a29802ca].

---

## Immune defense

The respiratory tract has robust defenses: **mucociliary clearance** sweeps trapped particles upward for swallowing or expulsion [^ad0ba8db], antimicrobial peptides and enzymes in airway lining fluid inhibit pathogens, and resident immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes) provide surveillance and rapid responses [^f267b8b0] [^10ce5cbe]. The microbiome also supports barrier integrity and pathogen resistance [^e3736146] [^0ab8ee53].

---

## Ventilation

Ventilation is the **mechanical movement of air** into and out of the lungs, driven by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles with brainstem control [^a8e4d672]. It ensures a continuous supply of fresh gas to the alveoli for gas exchange and is adjustable to metabolic demands (e.g. during exercise or sleep) [^a55338ea].

---

## Regulation and coordination

Respiratory function is precisely regulated by the **brainstem respiratory centers** and chemoreceptors that monitor CO₂, O₂, and pH, adjusting ventilation to maintain homeostasis [^a55338ea]. This coordination integrates voluntary control, reflexes, and feedback from lungs and muscles to match breathing to metabolic needs [^a55338ea].

---

The respiratory system's primary roles are **gas exchange and acid–base balance**, with essential support from air conditioning, immune defense, and ventilation, all under tight neural and chemical control [^a55338ea].

### The microbiota of the respiratory tract: gatekeeper to respiratory health [^e3736146]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2017). Medium credibility.

The respiratory tract is a complex organ system that is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The human respiratory tract spans from the nostrils to the lung alveoli and is inhabited by niche-specific communities of bacteria. The microbiota of the respiratory tract probably acts as a gatekeeper that provides resistance to colonization by respiratory pathogens. The respiratory microbiota might also be involved in the maturation and maintenance of homeostasis of respiratory physiology and immunity. The ecological and environmental factors that direct the development of microbial communities in the respiratory tract and how these communities affect respiratory health are the focus of current research. Concurrently, the functions of the microbiome of the upper and lower respiratory tract in the physiology of the human host are being studied in detail. In this Review, we will discuss the epidemiological, biological and functional evidence that support the physiological role of the respiratory microbiota in the maintenance of human health.

### Defining and promoting pediatric pulmonary health: assessing lung function and structure [^fc36a8bd]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifelong respiratory health is rooted in the structural and functional development of the respiratory system in early life. Exposures and interventions antenatally through childhood can influence lung development into young adulthood, the life stage with the highest achievable lung function. Because early respiratory health sets the stage for adult lung function trajectories and risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, understanding how to promote lung health in children will have far reaching personal and population benefits. To achieve this, it is critical to have accurate and precise measures of structural and functional lung development that track throughout life stages. From this foundation, evaluation of environmental, genetic, metabolic, and immune mechanisms involved in healthy lung development can be investigated. These goals require the involvement of general pediatricians, pediatric subspecialists, patients, and researchers to design and implement studies that are broadly generalizable and applicable to otherwise healthy and chronic disease populations. This National Institutes of Health workshop report details the key gaps and opportunities regarding lung function and structure.

Disorders of Control of Breathing and the Neuromuscular Breathing Apparatus

For many patients with COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure, invasive mechanical ventilation is required to prevent further deterioration in gas exchange, respiratory muscle fatigue, organ failure, and death. Prolonged periods of invasive mechanical ventilation (up to several weeks) have been reported. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 and prolonged mechanical ventilation on respiratory muscle structure and function are yet unknown but might be potentially detrimental and clinically important. The diaphragm is the main inspiratory muscle, and, compared with peripheral muscles, appears to be more affected by critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Diaphragm function may further deteriorate in ventilator-bound ICU patients. This is associated with difficult ventilator liberation, increased risks of ICU and hospital readmission, and increased risk for death.

### The physiological basis of respiratory support [^c124b0b8]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

The complex interplay between the characteristics of the respiratory system, its changes as a result of respiratory disease and the effects of mechanical ventilation makes it important to analyse the physiology of the respiratory system in any given clinical situation. Key variables to be considered are the elastic recoil, resistance and time constant of the respiratory system, as well as the characteristics of the respiratory pump. The effects of respiratory support on the intrathoracic organs and lung perfusion must be taken into account. Respiratory support modes can then be tailored to provide maximum benefit and a minimum of negative effects. When the relatively few basic principles that underlie the mechanical behaviour of the respiratory system in most circumstances are kept in mind, the challenge of optimal support seems solvable for most children with respiratory insufficiency.

### Lung function trajectories in health and disease [^7302a25b]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The normal lung function trajectory from birth to death has three phases: a growth phase (from birth to early adulthood), a plateau phase (that lasts for a few years), and a decline phase resulting from physiological lung ageing. Numerous genetic and environmental factors can alter one or more of these phases. Evidence shows that several lung function trajectories exist throughout the life course and, importantly, that some of them are associated with substantial implications for health and disease. Here, we review the evidence, formulate a series of questions, and identify various challenges that need to be addressed to identify potential opportunities to promote respiratory health.

### Regional specialization within the mammalian respiratory immune system [^10ce5cbe]. Trends in Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The respiratory tract is exposed to infection from inhaled pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. So far, a comprehensive assessment that integrates common and distinct aspects of the immune response along different areas of the respiratory tract has been lacking. Here, we discuss key recent findings regarding anatomical, functional, and microbial factors driving regional immune adaptation in the mammalian respiratory system, how they differ between mice and humans, and the similarities and differences with the gastrointestinal tract. We demonstrate that, under evolutionary pressure, mammals evolved spatially organized immune defenses that vary between the upper and lower respiratory tract. Overall, we propose that the functional specialization of the immune response along the respiratory tract has fundamental implications for the management of infectious or inflammatory diseases.

### The influence of the microbiome on respiratory health [^0ab8ee53]. Nature Immunology (2019). High credibility.

The revolution in microbiota research over the past decade has provided invaluable knowledge about the function of the microbial species that inhabit the human body. It has become widely accepted that these microorganisms, collectively called 'the microbiota', engage in networks of interactions with each other and with the host that aim to benefit both the microbial members and the mammalian members of this unique ecosystem. The lungs, previously thought to be sterile, are now known to harbor a unique microbiota and, additionally, to be influenced by microbial signals from distal body sites, such as the intestine. Here we review the role of the lung and gut microbiotas in respiratory health and disease and highlight the main pathways of communication that underlie the gut-lung axis.

### Who puts the tubercle in tuberculosis? [^c9f54843]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2007). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB), an illness that mainly affects the respiratory system, is one of the world's most pernicious diseases. TB currently infects one-third of the world's population and kills approximately 1.7 million people each year. Most infected individuals fail to progress to full-blown disease because the TB bacilli are 'walled off' by the immune system inside a tissue nodule known as a granuloma. The granuloma's primary function is one of containment and it prevents the dissemination of the mycobacteria. But what is the role of the TB bacillus in the progression of the granuloma? This Review explores how Mycobacterium tuberculosis influences granuloma formation and maintenance, and ensures the spread of the disease.

### Emerging role of extracellular vesicles in the respiratory system [^b0c9ed77]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) present numerous biomedical ways of studying disease and pathology. They function as protective packaging for the delivery of controlled concentrations of miRNAs and effector molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, genetic material, and small signaling molecules. Previous studies of EVs have yielded valuable insights into pathways of intercellular communication that affect a variety of biological processes and disease responses. The roles of EVs, specifically microRNA-containing EVs (EV-miRNAs), in either mitigating or exacerbating pulmonary disease symptoms are numerous and show promise in helping us understand pulmonary disease pathology. Because of their well-documented involvement in pulmonary diseases, EVs show promise both as possible diagnostic biomarkers and as therapeutic agents. This review surveys the physiological functions of EVs in the respiratory system and outlines the pulmonary disease states in which EVs are involved in intercellular crosstalk. This review also discusses the potential clinical applications of EV-miRNAs in pulmonary diseases.

### Physiology of the respiratory drive in ICU patients: implications for diagnosis and treatment [^a55338ea]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The primary goal of the respiratory system is gas exchange, especially the uptake of oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide. The latter plays an important role in maintaining acid-base homeostasis. This requires tight control of ventilation by the respiratory centers in the brain stem. The respiratory drive is the intensity of the output of the respiratory centers, and determines the mechanical output of the respiratory muscles (also known as breathing effort).

Detrimental respiratory drive is an important contributor to inadequate mechanical output of the respiratory muscles, and may therefore contribute to the onset, duration, and recovery from acute respiratory failure. Studies in mechanically ventilated patients have demonstrated detrimental effects of both high and low breathing effort, including patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI), critical illness-associated diaphragm weakness, hemodynamic compromise, and poor patient-ventilator interaction. Strategies that prevent the detrimental effects of both high and low respiratory drive might therefore improve patient outcome.

Such strategies require a thorough understanding of the physiology of respiratory drive. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the (patho)physiology of respiratory drive, as relevant to critically ill ventilated patients. We discuss the clinical consequences of high and low respiratory drive and evaluate techniques that can be used to assess respiratory drive at the bedside. Finally, we propose optimal ranges for respiratory drive and breathing effort, and discuss interventions that can be used to modulate a patient's respiratory drive.

### Effects of childhood respiratory diseases on the anatomical and functional development of the respiratory system [^89e6ff5d]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The anatomical and functional development of the lung appears especially vulnerable to a whole range of insults during gestation and the first few years of life. A significant proportion of adult lung disease originates in utero or early infancy. Most publications on this topic are descriptive retrospective studies. An important limitation of these is that structural changes may precede abnormalities in lung function and development of symptoms. Little is known with certainty with respect to the long-term effects of early insults to the respiratory system. Furthermore, the reversibility of the functional and/or structural defects is hardly ever adequately investigated and it is probably not correct to extrapolate findings from adult studies to paediatric pulmonary diseases. Promoting or facilitating optimal lung growth in fetuses and infants and reducing the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in infancy may reduce the incidence of adult chronic lung disease in generations to come.

### Physiological basis of respiratory signs and symptoms [^c167da26]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

An understanding of the physiological processes underlying respiratory function in the healthy individual is essential in recognising and understanding disease processes. Departure from the normal pattern of tidal breathing is an early and reliable sign of respiratory disease. Understanding the normal distributions of pressures within the thoracic cage, airways and lungs allows one to predict the site of airway obstruction. Respiratory signs and symptoms are based on alterations of normal physiology by the disease process. Unfortunately, these basic principals are rarely emphasised in current teaching programs.

Conclusion

EVs are now considered a critical biological factor in the respiratory system. In addition to being a controlled mechanism of effector delivery, they have proven to be integral in both the pathogenesis and amelioration of lung diseases. Trials in intratracheally delivered EVs not only suggest their importance in these diseases but also show immense promise as a breakthrough medical tool to deliver medicine and effector miRNAs. EVs have opened up a whole new world of possibilities in pulmonary medicine and have opened the door to further exploration of pulmonary diseases and their mechanisms. However, there is still much more work to be done to understand and utilize EVs for the betterment of medicine. For example, the mechanisms by which mesenchymal stem cells and lung epithelial cells release EVs still need better elucidation, and better characterization of EV-miRNAs and their targets is needed, especially to identify them as fully dependable biomarkers. Further lines of research will clarify the way for improved medicine and diagnostics in pulmonary diseases.

### COVID-19 and respiratory system disorders: current knowledge, future clinical and translational research questions [^b5fb5dc1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

COVID-19 affects all components of the respiratory system, including the neuromuscular breathing apparatus, the conducting airways, the respiratory airways and alveoli, the pulmonary vascular endothelium, and pulmonary blood flow. As of this writing, after fewer than 6 months of clinical experience and research into the disease, many publications have described gross and histological pathology, radiographic changes, and clinical manifestations of the disease. Few data, however, convincingly combine these observations into a more complete mechanistic model of the disease that permits researchers and clinicians to identify cause-and-effect relationships that can be targeted safely and effectively to improve clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, the accumulated data to this point identify several tantalizing avenues for investigation that may successfully lead to a fuller understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of viable therapeutic targets. Although COVID-19 of the respiratory system appears to be a complex disease that may resist finding a single silver bullet intervention, these observations provide promising avenues to pursue. This review summarizes much of the known data on COVID-19–induced disorders of the respiratory system, offering researchers and clinicians an early and rough sketch of the challenges that confront us.

### Regulation of immunological homeostasis in the respiratory tract [^f267b8b0]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

The respiratory tract has an approximate surface area of 70 m² in adult humans, which is in virtually direct contact with the outside environment. It contains a uniquely rich vascular bed containing a large pool of marginated T cells, and harbours a layer of single-cell-thick epithelial tissue through which re-oxygenation of blood must occur uninterrupted for survival. It is therefore not surprising that the respiratory tract is never more than a short step away from disaster. We have only a partial understanding of how immunological homeostasis is maintained in these tissues, but it is becoming clear that the immune system has evolved a range of specific mechanisms to deal with the unique problems encountered in this specialized microenvironment.

### Respiratory physiology: adaptations to high-level exercise [^26346717]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Most exercise scientists would agree that the physiological determinants of peak endurance performance include the capacity to transport oxygen to the working muscle, diffusion from the muscle to the mitochondria, energy production and force generation, all influenced by signals from the central nervous system. In general, the capacity of the pulmonary system far exceeds the demands required for ventilation and gas exchange during exercise. Endurance training induces large and significant adaptations within the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and haematological systems. However, the structural and functional properties of the lung and airways do not change in response to repetitive physical activity and, in elite athletes, the pulmonary system may become a limiting factor to exercise at sea level and altitude. As a consequence to this respiratory paradox, highly trained athletes may develop intrathoracic and extrathoracic obstruction, expiratory flow limitation, respiratory muscle fatigue and exercise-induced hypoxaemia. All of these maladaptations may influence performance.

### Physical activity and exercise in lung cancer care: will promises Be fulfilled? [^b376244b]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary Function

The assessment of respiratory functionality by a global spirometry test is a crucial step to define therapeutic perspectives in lung cancer. In particular, the predicted postoperative of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) and the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) are the most utilized parameters to evaluate the surgical risk 56 and are associated with the prognosis of patients with lung cancer 57, 58. Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and comorbidities (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) may be harmful for the pulmonary system, reducing respiratory functionality 59, 60, 61. Historically, the respiratory system is defined as overbuilt for exercise, and therefore training does not appear to confer a significant adaptation in lung of healthy human subjects 62. Nevertheless, the role of EX is still controversial in pulmonary diseases. EX in patients with COPD is largely studied, and a recent meta‐analysis including 21 randomized controlled trials has analyzed the role of whole‐body exercise on pulmonary function in adult participants with chronic lung diseases (mainly COPD). The results demonstrated a small but significant improvement in spirometry values in the EX group as compared with controls, suggesting that in certain conditions the respiratory system may adapt in response to training 63.

### Respiratory microphysiological system in respiratory research: recent advances and future prospects [^96cb2a31]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

However, despite their promising applications, respiratory MPS still faces several critical challenges that need to be addressed. The first challenge is the complex physiological structure of the lung. Its intricate structure, including alveoli, airways, and vascular components, is difficult to replicate in MPS. Achieving a realistic 3D arrangement that mimics natural lung tissue is a significant challenge. The second challenge pertains to cell heterogeneity. The lung consists of various cell types, each with unique functions. Accurately modeling this heterogeneity in organoids or chips is essential but difficult, as many systems struggle to incorporate multiple cell types effectively. The third challenge involves functional maturity. Many lung organoids and chips lack the maturity of native lung tissue, which can lead to discrepancies in drug response, pathogen interaction, and physiological functions. The fourth challenge relates to mechanical and physiological stimulation. The lung undergoes mechanical stretching during breathing and experiences fluid flow and gas exchange. Incorporating these dynamic stimuli into microphysiological models remains a challenge. The fifth challenge is reproducibility and standardization. Integration of automated systems for high-throughput screening could facilitate large-scale drug testing and toxicology studies, increasing the utility of respiratory MPS in pharmaceutical research. The sixth challenge is the integration with other organ systems. The lung interacts closely with other organs, particularly in disease states. Developing systems that can mimic these interactions (e.g. lung-heart interactions) is a significant hurdle. Lastly, the seventh challenge is scalability. For widespread application in drug testing or personalized medicine, scalable production methods for organoids and chips must be developed.

### Obesity and its impact on the respiratory system [^ddc23f3e]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Obesity has complex and incompletely understood effects upon the respiratory system in childhood, which differs in some aspects to those seen in adults. There is increasing evidence that excess adiposity will impact negatively upon static and dynamic respiratory function as measured through lung volumes, lung compartment mechanics, measures of airway function and exercise capability to varying degrees. Further information is needed to better understand the effects in children, and the importance of onset and duration of obesity on subsequent outcomes. Consensus about how best to express adiposity is also an essential part of this process and fat distribution is another important factor. From a clinical standpoint this creates challenges in distinguishing a deconditioned obese young person from a non-atopic asthmatic because of symptom overlap and lung function testing results, including responses seen during airway challenges. There is evidence to support the role of weight loss in achieving normalisation of lung function parameters, but as always with obesity there are enormous challenges in realising this goal for many subjects.

### The role of leptin in the respiratory system: an overview [^8b7f9ba8]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the past years, a growing number of studies have examined the potential role of leptin in the respiratory system. Accumulative data have identified foetal and adult lung tissue as leptin responsive and producing organs, while leptin's involvement in pulmonary homeostasis has become increasingly evident (Table 1). On the basis of this conception, researchers have sought to determine the impact of leptin on specific respiratory disorders, including obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. We review herein the current understanding on the actions of leptin in the lung, and summarize the recent advances on its role in the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases.

### Lung function in obese children and adolescents without respiratory disease: a systematic review [^d8916ee1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a dysfunction that interferes with systems of the body and whose prevalence increases in epidemic proportion. The comprehensive impact of obesity prompts researchers to reflect on its deleterious effects, which progressively worsen the quality of life of increasingly younger individuals, leading children and adolescents to suffer from impairments that had been previously observed in adults only.

The respiratory system is one of the systems affected by obesity. Among adults, the most frequent findings in the comparison of lung function of healthy individuals versus individuals affected by obesity are the reduction in functional residual capacity (FRC) and expiratory reserve volume (ERV). One of the main reasons for these changes is the impairment of the respiratory mechanics. Excessive adipose tissue, mainly in the thorax and abdomen, causes an increase in the intra-abdominal pressure on the diaphragm and in the pressure of the fat tissue on the rib cage, hindering thoracic expansion and, consequently, lung compliance. This change leads to a reduction in lung volumes and capacities and is characteristic of a restrictive lung disease.

Respiratory mechanics are not the only way of compromising lung function in obesity. There is also an inflammatory component that causes obstructive pulmonary disorders. Adipose tissue macrophages produce proinflammatory substances and adipocytes secrete hormones (adipokines), which reach the systemic circulation, and are able to act directly on the respiratory system or alter the immune response. The entire pathophysiological process favors the induction of bronchial hyperreactivity and may compromise pulmonary air flow.

The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide, and although it is a relevant public health problem that affects all age groups, the role and methods to evaluate its impact on lung function in children and adolescents is still unclear, and full understanding of the topic is still far from being attained.

As the obesity and lung function are complex phenotypes and their interaction has not been well understood, we included Fig. 1 that summarizes the mechanisms of lung function impairment due to obesity. Despite the relevance of the topic, it is still not well-established when lung function damages related to obesity start. Studies with children and adolescents diverge in their conclusions. Body changes during childhood and adolescence, variations in age range as well as in ethnic/environmental/genetic specificities make understanding of the cause-effect relationship between obesity and lung function more difficult.

### The role of leptin in the respiratory system: an overview [^61844575]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Since its cloning in 1994, leptin has emerged in the literature as a pleiotropic hormone whose actions extend from immune system homeostasis to reproduction and angiogenesis. Recent investigations have identified the lung as a leptin responsive and producing organ, while extensive research has been published concerning the role of leptin in the respiratory system. Animal studies have provided evidence indicating that leptin is a stimulant of ventilation, whereas researchers have proposed an important role for leptin in lung maturation and development. Studies further suggest a significant impact of leptin on specific respiratory diseases, including obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, asthma, COPD and lung cancer. However, as new investigations are under way, the picture is becoming more complex. The scope of this review is to decode the existing data concerning the actions of leptin in the lung and provide a detailed description of leptin's involvement in the most common disorders of the respiratory system.

### What is the clinical relevance of different lung compartments? [^71e15206]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

All the presented compartments of the lung are essential for the immune control of the whole organ. However, three compartments need to be studied with priority. These "master compartments" of the lung during immune response or host defense are: A) The intravascular pool of leukocytes. This is because of its interaction with lung vessels and capillaries, which controls the entry of leukocytes into different lung compartments and also the integrity of the alveolo-capillary barrier. B) The bronchial mucosa of the conducting airways, which is the first line of defense if microbes or allergens enter the lung. C) The periarterial space, because periarterial inflammation is an important part of the intrapulmonary immune response and a mechanism which keeps the alveoli and therefore the gas exchange area functional. All lung compartments contribute to the innate and the adaptive immune response. The most important questions might be: How is the influx of leucocytes into lung compartments regulated? Which patterns of migration between those compartments are important for immune control? What are the mechanisms for the initiation of perivascular inflammation and -at least equally important - its cessation and how could all these processes be blocked or stimulated by drugs?

### The APGAR cycle: a new view of a familiar scoring system [^38bc56de]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Apgar scores are universally recorded, but they should no longer be used to guide resuscitation; thus, some authorities have suggested that the scores should be abandoned. However, the physiological relationships underlying the elements of the Apgar scoring system can be conceptualised as a cycle, wherein the five functions are linked by cardiorespiratory reflexes and metabolically supported by the oxygen pathway. Respiratory effort represents both the main input into the system and its functional output (sustained respirations). The progressive deterioration of functions during asphyxia, and their recovery during resuscitation, are readily understood within the sequence. This depiction helps in learning concepts such as primary and secondary apnoea and bradycardia. The visual model harmonises the pedagogical and practical values of the Apgar scoring system, by placing the rapid assessment of respirations, heart rate and colour during neonatal resuscitation (as taught in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program) in its broader physiological context. The understanding imparted by the Apgar cycle may directly enhance patient care during resuscitation, apart from the attribution of numerical scores.

### The interplay between airway epithelium and the immune system – A primer for the respiratory clinician [^37758736]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

The respiratory epithelium is one of the primary interfaces between the body's immune system and the external environment. This review discusses the innate and adaptive immunomodulatory effects of the respiratory epithelium, highlighting the physiologic immune responses associated with health and the disease-causing sequelae when these physiologic responses go awry. Airway macrophages, dendritic cells, and innate lymphoid cells are discussed as orchestrators of physiological and pathological innate immune responses and T cells, B cells, mast cells, and granulocytes (eosinophils and neutrophils) as orchestrators of physiologic and pathologic adaptive immune responses. The interplay between the airway epithelium and the varied immune cells as well as the interplay between these immune cells is discussed, highlighting the importance of the dose of noxious stimuli and pathogens in immune programming and the timing of their interaction with the immune cells that determine the pattern of immune responses. Although each cell type has been researched individually, this review highlights the need for simultaneous temporal investigation of immune responses from these varied cells to noxious stimuli and pathogens.

### Pulmonary dendritic cells in local immunity to inert and pathogenic antigens in the respiratory tract [^c8251b42]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Subsets of dendritic cells form a series of highly developed networks throughout the respiratory tree, and represent the only professional antigen-presenting cells present within the majority of these tissue microenvironments. Work in noninfectious model systems indicates that they function with high efficiency in immune surveillance for inhaled antigens, responding rapidly to local antigenic challenge via mobilization of resident and precursor populations with kinetics equivalent to neutrophils. Their prime function is to rapidly translocate incoming antigenic signals to the lymph nodes draining the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, and as such they are ideally positioned to orchestrate primary and secondary adaptive immunity to all classes of inhaled antigens, in particular those derived from pathogens such as respiratory viruses.

### Respiratory microbiota: addressing clinical questions, informing clinical practice [^b62ec3f4]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

While efforts to identify microbes associated with airways disease are not new, the sophistication of both our conceptual understanding of these systems and the approaches used to characterise them have increased dramatically over the last decade. A point has now been reached where complex microbial systems in the airways and the manner in which they can influence clinical course increasingly represent a central consideration when trying to understand and treat respiratory disease. However, with the application of ever more sophisticated ecological tools, recent additions to the literature have become less accessible to the non-specialist reader. Furthermore, in order to have the greatest beneficial impact, respiratory microbiota studies must be driven by clinical questions, and the insight gained linked directly with improvements in clinical practice. In this article, we set out the key principles underpinning microbiota research in clinical contexts, as well as providing practical guidance on how best such studies can be designed, executed and interpreted. We examine how an understanding of the respiratory microbiota both challenges fundamental assumptions and provides novel clinical insights into lung disease.

Table 1
The key differences among cell cluster, spheroid and organoid

OOC is a synthetic model that combines a microfluidic chip with living cells to mimic the architecture, physiological functions, and biomechanics of human organs. The OOC technology surfaced in 1990s, and shortly after, Shuler's lab introduced the ides of "human-body-on-a-chip" as a means to study human physiology. Benefiting from the advantages of microfluidic chips, such as miniaturization, automation, integrability, compact size, rapid response, flexible structural design, precise control over fluids and physical/chemical factors, OOC technology has enabled the creation of near-physiological microenvironments. This has been achieved through the integration of microelectronics, materials science, chemistry, biology, and engineering.

In this review, we offer a summary of the latest advancements in respiratory MPS, focusing on lung organoids and lung-on-a-chip models. We start with a comprehensive introduction of lung organoid and its application. Next, we describe the lung-on-a-chip respiratory MPS, highlighting its role in disease modeling and drug discovery. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of respiratory MPS in both industrial and clinical applications.

### The "TASK" of breathing: anesthetic relevance of background two-pore domain potassium channels as therapeutic targets for respiratory control [^2c4df06d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background (leak) potassium (K⁺) currents, the main contributors to resting membrane potential in excitable cells, are mediated by channels of the 2-pore domain (K2P) family. In the respiratory system, the TWIK-related acid-sensitive K⁺ channel (TASK) subfamily is proposed to mediate key functions in the carotid body type I glomus cells, central chemoreceptors and respiratory center, pulmonary arteries, and upper airway musculature. K2P channels are also located throughout the central nervous system, notably in the hypoglossal motor neurone pool, regions involved in sleep-wake regulation and pain perception. Being sensitive to general anesthetics, K2P channels may mediate both the adverse respiratory effects and hypnotic actions of many anesthetics. Therefore, they offer potential as pharmacological targets to reverse postoperative respiratory depression, ameliorate anesthetic risks of obstructive sleep apnea, improve ventilation-perfusion matching, and even assist in the active recovery from hypnotic effects of anesthesia during emergence from surgery.

### Cilia dysfunction [^ad0ba8db]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cilia are complex and powerful cellular structures that serve a multitude of functions across many types of organisms. In humans, one of the most critical roles of cilia is defense of the airway. The respiratory epithelium is lined with cilia that normally carry out an integrated and coordinated mechanism called mucociliary clearance. Mucociliary clearance, the process by which cilia transport the viscous mucus blanket of the upper airway to the gastrointestinal tract, is the primary means by which the upper airway clears itself of pathogens, allergens, debris, and toxins. The complex structure and regulatory mechanisms that dictate the form and function of normal cilia are not entirely understood, but it is clear that ciliary dysfunction results in impaired respiratory defense. Ciliary dysfunction may be primary, the result of genetic mutations resulting in abnormal cilia structure, or secondary, the result of environmental, infectious or inflammatory stimuli that disrupt normal motility or coordination.

Mitochondrial function in limb muscle — homeostasis, signaling, and cell death — highlights that maintenance of mitochondrial integrity is crucial for cellular homeostasis; mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation in energy‑demanding tissues including limb muscles; they participate in cellular Ca²⁺ dynamics, modulate signaling and nuclear gene expression through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and are a main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can mediate signaling or dysfunction; under stress or intrinsic dysfunction, mitochondria can trigger apoptotic and necrotic cell death via permeabilization of the double membrane, including opening of the permeability transition pore and/or channels formed by proapoptotic proteins; mitochondrial volume–density and function vary by fiber type and physiological cues such as exercise or inactivity, and defective organelles cause mitochondrial genetic disorders and may contribute to chronic disease pathogenesis across systems.

For bidirectional differentiation of respiratory epithelial cells, Zhou et al. established the first bipotent human respiratory epithelial organoid culture system (Fig. 4 C). This system has the ability to generate of human lung organoids from primary lung tissues that can be passaged, expanded, and cryopreserved. Through induced bidirectional differentiation, the system produces mature alveolar or airway organoids. Experimental findings indicate that the lung organoids can be long-term expansion for more than a year. The differentiated alveolar and airway organoids closely mimic the morphology and function of alveoli and airway, achieving near-physiological levels of human.

Applications of lung organoids

The establishment of lung organoids provides valuable insights into lung development as well as the physiological and pathological processes underlying respiratory health and disease. This information is vital for advancing the prevention and therapy of respiratory-related conditions. In the upcoming sections, we will explore the current and potential applications of lung organoids in modeling early lung development, serving as disease models, and acting as platforms for drug screening.

Fig. 2
The different anatomical divisions of human respiratory system relevant to CF lung disease. Environmental factors such as oxygen and nutrient availability vary significantly in different regions of the human respiratory system and influence disease outcomes. a The airway can be divided primarily into the upper and lower respiratory tract. b Lower respiratory tract is further divided into conductive zone and the respiratory zone. The conducting zones consist of trachea, primary and terminal bronchioles. The conducting zones are secretory in function. The respiratory zones perform the function of air exchange and consist of respiratory bronchioles and alveolar sacs

Studies from animal models suggest that CF patients present with abnormalities in the size and shape of the trachea from birth. Pulmonary imaging of young children with CF indicates early structural defects, even in those with normal pulmonary function test results. It has been observed that the airways of infants and young children with CF have thicker walls, with higher dilation, than those of normal infants. The sinuses in CF form a very well-protected habitat given the complexity of the anatomy and the viscidity of mucus lining it. These make them an excellent reservoir for chronic and relapsing lower respiratory infections. It has been reported that CF patients often present with chronic rhinosinusitis and sinus microbiota in CF is often considered to be predictive of pulmonary disease.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current understanding and future research needs in tobacco control and treatment [^67519008]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

What we know — consequences for the child include early measurable lung function impairment: Measurements of lung function within 2 to 5 days of birth suggest a dose-dependent reduction in both tidal breathing, as estimated by the ratio of time to reach peak tidal expiratory flow to the total expiratory time, and passive respiratory mechanics, such as respiratory system compliance. Studies of lung function measured later in life also suggest that smoking during pregnancy had a substantial detrimental and long-lasting effect, and this pattern suggests that there is a window of susceptibility during pregnancy, within which the influence of maternal smoking on the fetus/child's lung development both in utero and later in life is greatest, supporting the hypothesis of an early origin of risk for adult respiratory disease.

### Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): a review [^025e648a]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders.

Methods

This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections.

Results

This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19.

Conclusion

This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.

### Influence of an inspiratory muscle fatigue protocol on older adults on respiratory muscle strength, muscle oxygen saturation, and functional capacity: a randomized controlled trial [^b2efbbcc]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

As of today, population aging is an increasingly visible reality. For instance, the number of individuals over 65 years old in the European Union is higher in comparative terms than in other regions. This aging, combined with various physiological changes, often leads to the onset of sarcopenia, characterized by muscle mass loss, muscle coordination alterations, decreased strength and contraction speed, and increased muscle fatigue. This process also occurs at the level of respiratory muscles, resulting in a decrease in the strength of the respiratory muscles, which in turn will have a negative impact on pulmonary function, physical fitness, and quality of life.

The inspiratory muscles play a vital role in human life, facilitating gas exchange with the external environment and sustaining essential bodily functions. Among the main inspiratory muscles, the diaphragm stands out, which is capable of producing between 60–80% of the alveolar ventilation through its activation. Secondly, we have the external intercostals. Additionally, there are a series of accessory inspiratory muscles such as the scalenes or the sternocleidomastoid, which allow for the maintenance of this respiratory function in situations that increase the demand for gas exchange and cannot be met solely with the main inspiratory musculature. Contraction of these muscles overcomes pleural pressure, facilitating gas exchange between atmospheric air and the alveolar space, taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Furthermore, this process also regulates the acid–base balance, maintaining pH within normal values. In addition to their respiratory function, inspiratory muscles serve other roles. For instance, the diaphragm, through the production and control of intra-abdominal pressure, as well as its attachment to the lumbar vertebrae, plays a pivotal role in lumbar stabilization and trunk motor control. On the other hand, its relationship with the vagus nerve via its connection to the esophagus allows this muscle to act on the parasympathetic nervous system through breathing, modulating various cardiovascular variables such as heart rate, blood pressure, or heart rate variability. Lastly, concerning its relationship with the lymphatic system, diaphragmatic contraction enables drainage of lymph nodes and vessels, especially those related to the lower limbs, due to the vacuum and suction effect produced during such contraction.

### Disorders of the respiratory muscles [^a8e4d672]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The act of breathing depends on coordinated activity of the respiratory muscles to generate subatmospheric pressure. This action is compromised by disease states affecting anatomical sites ranging from the cerebral cortex to the alveolar sac. Weakness of the respiratory muscles can dominate the clinical manifestations in the later stages of several primary neurologic and neuromuscular disorders in a manner unique to each disease state. Structural abnormalities of the thoracic cage, such as scoliosis or flail chest, interfere with the action of the respiratory muscles-again in a manner unique to each disease state. The hyperinflation that accompanies diseases of the airways interferes with the ability of the respiratory muscles to generate subatmospheric pressure and it increases the load on the respiratory muscles. Impaired respiratory muscle function is the most severe consequence of several newly described syndromes affecting critically ill patients. Research on the respiratory muscles embraces techniques of molecular biology, integrative physiology, and controlled clinical trials. A detailed understanding of disease states affecting the respiratory muscles is necessary for every physician who practices pulmonary medicine or critical care medicine.

### COVID-19 and respiratory system disorders: current knowledge, future clinical and translational research questions [^cc2bc3ac]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, causing a pandemic.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 appears to cause predominantly respiratory disease in the form of viral pneumonia.
Severe cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection can lead to hypoxemic respiratory failure with features of the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection also may increase the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, by mechanisms that are not fully understood.

Coronaviruses are important human pathogens, and research into their behavior is nearly a century old. In late 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, and then spread worldwide. In February 2020, the World Health Organization designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as the name of the human disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was previously known as 2019-nCoV (2019 novel coronavirus). Viral pneumonia is the most frequent serious clinical manifestation of COVID-19, prominently featuring fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography. – Dry cough is more common than a productive cough. Dyspnea appears after a median time of 5 to 8 days. Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure consistent with the Berlin definition of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients who require mechanical ventilation have a high risk of death.

A detailed understanding of the respiratory pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains elusive, however, because comprehensive data from clinical and research tools such as pulmonary artery catheterization or transpulmonary thermodilution, respiratory mechanics, mixed inert gas elimination technique, or electrical impedance tomography remain lacking or under development. – The clinical observations, radiology, and pathology offer clues about the respiratory pathogenesis of COVID-19 and raise interesting research questions. This review will highlight the current knowledge on COVID-19 pathophysiology, with a focus on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on airway and alveolar epithelium, vascular endothelium, and the control of breathing. We present questions that arise from these observations and indicate possible future research directions that will enhance our understanding of COVID-19 clinical pathophysiology and guide the development of future treatments.

### Key4OI recommendations for lung function guidance in osteogenesis imperfecta: based on an internationally performed comprehensive international Consortium for health outcomes measurement procedure [^cba39ecf]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) pulmonary involvement — clinical burden and monitoring needs are highlighted: patients are prone to pulmonary restriction, with respiratory impairment impacting on quality of life and respiratory failure being the main cause of death in OI. Decreased pulmonary function in OI shows a lack of relationship with the severity of scoliosis, and significant respiratory impairment is independent of the degree of scoliosis, the type of OI, or the age of the adult. This emphasizes the need for all patients with OI to have routine evaluation and monitoring of pulmonary function.

### Innate immunity in the lungs [^309e8bef]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Innate immunity is a primordial system that has a primary role in lung antimicrobial defenses. Recent advances in understanding the recognition systems by which cells of the innate immune system recognize and respond to microbial products have revolutionized the understanding of host defenses in the lungs and other tissues. The innate immune system includes lung leukocytes and also epithelial cells lining the alveolar surface and the conducting airways. The innate immune system drives adaptive immunity in the lungs and has important interactions with other systems, including apoptosis pathways and signaling pathways induced by mechanical stretch. Human diversity in innate immune responses could explain some of the variability seen in the responses of patients to bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in the lungs. New strategies to modify innate immune responses could be useful in limiting the adverse consequences of some inflammatory reactions in the lungs.

### Cervical excitatory neurons sustain breathing after spinal cord injury [^24d13885]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Dysfunctional breathing is the main cause of morbidity and mortality after traumatic injury of the cervical spinal cord 1,2 and often necessitates assisted ventilation, thus stressing the need to develop strategies to restore breathing. Cervical interneurons that form synapses on phrenic motor neurons, which control the main inspiratory muscle, can modulate phrenic motor output and diaphragmatic function 3–5. Here, using a combination of pharmacogenetics and respiratory physiology assays in different models of spinal cord injury, we show that mid-cervical excitatory interneurons are essential for the maintenance of breathing in mice with non-traumatic cervical spinal cord injury, and are also crucial for promoting respiratory recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury. Although these interneurons are not necessary for breathing under normal conditions, their stimulation in non-injured animals enhances inspiratory amplitude. Immediately after spinal cord injury, pharmacogenetic stimulation of cervical excitatory interneurons restores respiratory motor function. Overall, our results demonstrate a strategy to restore breathing after central nervous system trauma by targeting a neuronal subpopulation.

### The respiratory system influences flight mechanics in soaring birds [^6d37c472]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The subpectoral diverticulum (SPD) is an extension of the respiratory system in birds that is located between the primary muscles responsible for flapping the wing 1,2. Here we survey the pulmonary apparatus in 68 avian species, and show that the SPD was present in virtually all of the soaring taxa investigated but absent in non-soarers. We find that this structure evolved independently with soaring flight at least seven times, which indicates that the diverticulum might have a functional and adaptive relationship with this flight style. Using the soaring hawks Buteo jamaicensis and Buteo swainsoni as models, we show that the SPD is not integral for ventilation, that an inflated SPD can increase the moment arm of cranial parts of the pectoralis, and that pectoralis muscle fascicles are significantly shorter in soaring hawks than in non-soaring birds. This coupling of an SPD-mediated increase in pectoralis leverage with force-specialized muscle architecture produces a pneumatic system that is adapted for the isometric contractile conditions expected in soaring flight. The discovery of a mechanical role for the respiratory system in avian locomotion underscores the functional complexity and heterogeneity of this organ system, and suggests that pulmonary diverticula are likely to have other undiscovered secondary functions. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the repeated appearance of the SPD in soaring lineages and show that the respiratory system can be co-opted to provide biomechanical solutions to the challenges of flight and thereby influence the evolution of avian volancy.

Trajectories of lung function: development and aging — At birth, the lungs are not fully developed, and they "grow and mature until about 20–25 years of age (earlier in females), when lung function reaches its peak (Figure 1.1)". This is "followed by a short plateau and a final phase of mild lung function decline due to physiological lung aging". The "normal lung function trajectory can be altered by processes occurring during gestation, birth, childhood, and adolescence that affect lung growth… and/or processes shortening the plateau phase and/or accelerating the aging phase".

### Lung homeostasis: influence of age, microbes, and the immune system [^80192552]. Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary immune homeostasis is maintained by a network of tissue-resident cells that continually monitor the external environment, and in health, instruct tolerance to innocuous inhaled particles while ensuring that efficient and rapid immune responses can be mounted against invading pathogens. Here we review the multiple pathways that underlie effective lung immunity in health, and discuss how these may be affected by external environmental factors and contribute to chronic inflammation during disease. In this context, we examine the current understanding of the impact of the microbiota in immune development and function and in the setting of the threshold for immune responses that maintains the balance between tolerance and chronic inflammation in the lung. We propose that host interactions with microbes are critical for establishing the immune landscape of the lungs.

### Aging and the respiratory system [^c307b6b8]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

In the elderly, the chest without evident pathology is characterized by findings that occupy a sort of "no man's land" between the normal and the pathologic. Aging results in physiologic modifications that must be recognized so as not to be interpreted erroneously as pathologies. On the other hand, the elderly tend to become ill more frequently and multipathologies are more frequent. Image diagnostics is a key element in the clarification of often blurry clinical pictures, which may make early diagnosis possible, a great advantage to timely treatment. In this sense, knowledge of heart/lung interactions makes it possible to obtain, from the onset, radiologic and clinical signs of the two physiopathologic models prevalent in the elderly, the "cardiac lung" and the "pulmonary heart".

An exchange segment made up of alveolar duct, atrium, alveolar sac, and alveolus passes oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide and water out of the blood. In summary, the lungs place oxygen from the air into the blood and send carbon dioxide and water back into the air.

### Introduction to pulmonary function [^87325e7d]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a dynamic and complex inflammatory disease. Recent research suggests that it is a manifestation of a systemic disorder of the entire respiratory system including both upper and lower airways. The diagnosis of asthma can be made based on clinical history, physical findings, and pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. In children, spirometry may be difficult; therefore, diurnal changes in peak expiratory flow rate can be used instead to assist in the diagnosis of asthma. Increasing the use of objective pulmonary measures will help better identify and monitor treatment of lower respiratory inflammatory disease.

### Diabetic lung, an underrated complication from restrictive functional pattern to pulmonary hypertension [^da86fcc9]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), respiratory function abnormalities have been reported with regard to lung volumes, pulmonary diffusing capacity, control of ventilation, bronchomotor tone, and neuroadrenergic bronchial innervation. Indeed, the decrease in lung volumes and the impairment of diffusing capacity might have important clinical implications. Furthermore, there is an increasing evidence of a link between DM and pulmonary hypertension (PH) related to an involvement of the pulmonary vascular structures. These findings support the view of the lung as target organ in DM. In this paper, we briefly describe the main derangements of the respiratory system in DM and the inherent mechanisms.

Respiratory system involvement in cystic fibrosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene throughout the sinopulmonary tract result in recurrent infections with a variety of organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Lung disease occurs earlier in life than once thought and ideal methods of monitoring lung function, decline, or improvement with therapy are debated. Treatment of sinopulmonary disease may include physiotherapy, mucus-modifying and antiinflammatory agents, antimicrobials, and surgery. In the new era of personalized medicine, CFTR correctors and potentiators may change the course of disease.

### Whole body physiology model to simulate respiratory depression of fentanyl and associated naloxone reversal [^d5d98462]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory Function

Respiratory depression due to fentanyl administration is produced through the binding of the mu-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system. We simulate this action by reducing the nervous system function in the physiology engine as a function of fentanyl blood concentration. This function in turn, drives the respiratory driver in the physiology engine. Central nervous depression directly depresses the respiratory cadence of the patient, Eqs. 28 and 29, thus inducing a hypoxic state in the patient, Fig. 6. Respiratory rate is properly depressed as a function of the initial dose of the patient, with mu-opioid receptor saturation incurred at doses above 1.5 mg. Number of breaths per minute in the patient drop to 2 from a baseline rate of approximately 16. Oxygen saturation in the physiology engine is computed as a function of blood-gas binding and oxygen diffusion through the alveolar compartment. Because the respiration rate is so dramatically reduced, oxygen saturation rates drop over the scenario duration. Recovery for large doses over 1 mg takes much longer than for lower doses of initial opioid administration. Oscillations seen in the oxygen saturation curves are due to respiratory function and circulatory oscillations seen in the models, as well as delayed interaction with the nervous system model. We note that a common patient response to opioids is irregular breath rhythm and tidal volumes –. The model presented here does show some minor variability in the respiration rate, although not consistent with the pronounced variability seen in many patients. The tidal volume, Supplementary Fig. 3, does display much more erratic variability, possibly due to the pronounced role of the peripheral nervous system response and associated changes in driver pressure during the simulation. Future work could potentially focus on modeling the coupling of the two primary oscillators present that regulate respiration frequency: pre-Botzinger complex and the nearby retro-trapezoid and parafacial respiratory group. There is evidence to show fentanyl acts on only one of these, causing disruptions in the rhythm generated by the dynamic coupling of these oscillators. Finer representation of these neurological actuators and the influence of opioid receptor binding would be an excellent iterative advancement of the models presented here.

The primary cause and effect of fentanyl induced hypoxia are plotted here for varying levels of initial fentanyl bolus doses.

Subfigure a displays oxygen saturation curves over different initial fentanyl doses, and b highlights respiration rate over those same fentanyl doses. The purple line indicates the initial naloxone dose administered during the rescue scenario.

Airway Epithelium

The respiratory tract epithelium is the key entry point for beta-coronaviridae, which includes SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus), and SARS-CoV, into the human host. The airway epithelium acts as a barrier to pathogens and particles, preventing infection and tissue injury by the secretion of mucus and the action of mucociliary clearance while maintaining efficient airflow. Inhaled SARS-CoV-2 particles likely infect different epithelial cell types on their way to the distal lung. Current observations suggest that initial viral contact occurs in the nasal mucosa through binding of the viral S (spike) protein to the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) receptor, followed by cleavage of S protein by TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2). Replication of SARS-CoV-2 within these cells follows. – The ACE2 protein is a type I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin 2 to metabolites, many of which exert vasodilatory properties or interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Whether manipulating ACE2 levels or activity modifies the risk for developing COVID-19 or ARDS is a potential area of investigation. In vitro data from SARS-CoV indicate that the ciliated airway epithelium serves as a primary site for viral infection; however, whether these airway epithelial cells express sufficient ACE2 to permit viral entry is controversial.

The presence of viral particles in the nasal epithelium is the underlying rationale for obtaining nasopharyngeal material for polymerase chain reaction–based detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Current polymerase chain reaction–based diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection lack quantification of viral load and have variable negative and positive predictive values. Therefore, future research should determine whether using more quantitative assessments of viral RNA or alternative methods of detecting viral genetic material (such as fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization) improve the diagnostic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 tests, increase the throughput of testing, inform decisions about isolation and contact tracing of individual patients, and assess viability of viral particles. Although nasal epithelial cells appear to demonstrate the highest level of ACE2 expression, the range of cells that express ACE2 is broad. Understanding qualitative and quantitative patterns of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression could provide important clues about which cell types and organs may provide viral portals of entry, identifying targets for interventions aimed at stopping viral entry and replication.

### Three-dimensional morphologic and molecular atlases of nasal vasculature [^4e22b0c4]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

Main

The nose is an intricate organ with multifaceted functions, including olfaction, clearance of pathogens and chemicals and passage, humidification, warming and filtration of air. To execute these fundamental functions, the nose has a well-equipped epithelium and unique vascular and neural control systems –. The nasal vascular system consists of resistance and capacitance vessels distributed mainly in the respiratory mucosa and dynamically regulated by the autonomic nervous system –. Small arteries, arterioles and arteriovenous anastomoses serve as the resistance vessels for regulating blood flow, and venous sinusoids (VSs) serve as the capacitance vessels for reserving blood before venous return –. The extensive network of VSs is the primary regulator of nasal airflow resistance in the nasal cycle, which is the spontaneous congestion and decongestion of the nasal mucosa after the dilation and constriction of VSs during the day. This cycle is present in 70–80% of healthy adults, with congestion of one side accompanied by reciprocal decongestion of the contralateral side of the nose.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^dee4b819]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Neurophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea — sensory sources and qualities: The report notes that dyspnea involves multiple distinguishable sensations and likely arises from different sensory mechanisms, stating, "Dyspnea comprises several different uncomfortable respiratory sensations that are distinct in the sense that subjects describe them differently, and they can be varied independently with physiological interventions. Thus, we infer that they arise from different sensory mechanisms". Beyond peripheral afferents, central motor signals also inform perception: "In addition to traditionally defined sensory afferents, information on the state of respiration is available from respiratory motor areas of the brain, which can send an ascending copy of their descending motor activity to perceptual areas (corollary discharge)", and "The respiratory motor system, however, is unusual in having both automatic (brainstem) and voluntary (cortical) sources of motor command; corollary discharge from these different sources probably gives rise to different sensations".

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^97730bb6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation exercise training — role and mechanisms notes that exercise capacity in chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is impaired and often limited by dyspnea, which is usually multifactorial due to peripheral muscle dysfunction, dynamic hyperinflation, increased respiratory load, or defective gas exchange. Considered to be the cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation, exercise training is the best available means of improving muscle function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and even patients with severe chronic respiratory disease can often sustain training intensity and duration sufficient for skeletal muscle adaptation; improvements in skeletal muscle function after training lead to gains in exercise capacity despite the absence of changes in lung function.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^72efc42b]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Cough versus breathing regulation and chemosensory influences — cough and breathing can be differentially regulated by primary afferent inputs to the brainstem, indicating regulation of cough is customized to the function of the behavior. During cough, ventilation increases significantly and this alteration is necessary to prevent a loss of respiratory muscle excitability as CO2 falls; the depression of cough induced by hypoxia is less well understood and may reflect a shift in priority of the respiratory muscle control system. The permissive/facilitatory effect of SARs on cough is also not well understood but may help optimize respiratory muscle performance and facilitate expulsive airflows when cough is elicited at higher lung volumes.

### Respiratory muscle function in the newborn: a narrative review [^481bcc25]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Our aim was to summarise the current evidence and methods used to assess respiratory muscle function in the newborn, focusing on current and future potential clinical applications. The respiratory muscles undertake the work of breathing and consist mainly of the diaphragm, which in the newborn is prone to dysfunction due to lower muscle mass, flattened shape and decreased content of fatigue-resistant muscle fibres. Premature infants are prone to diaphragmatic dysfunction due to limited reserves and limited capacity to generate force and avoid fatigue. Methods to assess the respiratory muscles in the newborn include electromyography, maximal respiratory pressures, assessment for thoraco-abdominal asynchrony and composite indices, such as the pressure-time product and the tension time index. Recently, there has been significant interest and a growing body of research in assessing respiratory muscle function using bedside ultrasonography. Neurally adjusted ventilator assist is a novel ventilation mode, where the level of the respiratory support is determined by the diaphragmatic electrical activity. Prolonged mechanical ventilation, hypercapnia and hypoxia, congenital anomalies and systemic or respiratory infection can negatively impact respiratory muscle function in the newborn, while caffeine and synchronised or volume-targeted ventilation have a positive effect on respiratory muscle function compared to conventional, non-triggered or pressure-limited ventilation, respectively. IMPACT: Respiratory muscle function is impaired in prematurely born neonates and infants with congenital anomalies, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Respiratory muscle function is negatively affected by prolonged ventilation and infection and positively affected by caffeine and synchronised compared to non-synchronised ventilation modes. Point-of-care diaphragmatic ultrasound and neurally adjusted ventilator assist are recent diagnostic and therapeutic technological developments with significant clinical applicability.

### Comparison of body composition parameters in the study of the association between body composition and pulmonary function [^7d908eea]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the worldwide prevalence of obesity has almost tripled in the last 40 years. In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight, corresponding to 39% of the world population, and there were 650 million obese individuals, i.e. 13% of the world population. Obesity is considered the main risk factor for respiratory, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, obesity can alter pulmonary function regardless of the presence of respiratory disease.

Excess adiposity is known to interfere with the respiratory system through different mechanisms, including altered respiratory mechanics and pulmonary inflammation. Fat accumulation both in the cavities and in the thoracic and abdominal walls hinders the movement of the respiratory muscles, increases pleural pressure and reduces lung compliance, with a consequent decrease in the compliance of the respiratory system as a whole. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated the influence of adipose tissue on the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and on changes in the pulmonary immune system. These effects are reflected in altered pulmonary function tests, including a reduction in functional residual capacity, expiratory reserve volume, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC).

However, some studies found only a weak association or conflicting results regarding the relationship between obesity and pulmonary function in men and women, mainly because of methodological differences such as the choice of parameter to define obesity. Furthermore, new body composition measurement methods have emerged in recent years, which provided new data for the study of the association between body composition and pulmonary function. These methods range from simple measures such as bioimpedance to more complex tests such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and air-displacement plethysmography (BOD POD). Although they have shown a stronger association between visceral or central fat and pulmonary function, such studies are still scarce. Most of them used small samples or samples restricted to healthy volunteers, making generalization difficult, or they did not control for variables that could interfere with pulmonary function and body composition such as exercise and the presence of comorbidities.

We hypothesized that the relationship between body composition and pulmonary function reduction may depend on the parameter employed to characterize body composition. The present study aimed to evaluate different body composition parameters and their associations with spirometric values.

### Review: introduction to the respiratory system | SEER training… [^df5774be]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Review: Introduction to the Respiratory System Here is what we have learned from Introduction to the Respiratory System:

- The entire process of respiration includes ventilation, external respiration, transport of gases, internal respiration, and cellular respiration.
- The three pressures responsible for pulmonary ventilation are atmospheric pressure, intraalveolar pressure, and intrapleural pressure.
- A spirometer is used to measure respiratory volumes and capacities. These measurements provide useful information about the condition of the lungs.
- The frontal, maxillary, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal sinuses are air-filled cavities that open into the nasal cavity.
- The pharynx, commonly called the throat, is a passageway that extends from the base of the skull to the level of the sixth cervical vertebra.
- The larynx, commonly called the voice box, is the passageway for air between the pharynx above and the trachea below.
- The trachea, commonly called the windpipe, is the main airway to the lungs.
- The trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi, which branch into smaller and smaller passageways until they terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli.
- The two lungs contain all the components of the bronchial tree beyond the primary bronchi.
- The right lung is shorter, broader, and is divided into three lobes.
- The left lung is longer, narrower, and is divided into two lobes.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^a5a9b5b5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society spirometry standards — scope and terminology: The primary signal measured in spirometry is either volume or flow as a function of time, and the most relevant measurements discussed are the FVC, which is the volume delivered during an expiration made as forcefully and completely as possible starting from full inspiration, and the FEV₁, which is the expiratory volume in the first second of an FVC maneuver. These standards also apply to measurements of FEV₁ in airway responsiveness testing and exercise testing and address other spirometric variables derived from the FVC maneuver as well as the measurement of VC from a slow maneuver. In this document, the "operator" is the person conducting the test; the term "patient" is used for the person being tested; and "maneuver" is the term used for the inspiratory and expiratory excursions. The term "must" is used to indicate a requirement for meeting the standards, and "should" is used to indicate actions that may not be mandatory but are considered to be best practices. These standards are the minimum criteria that must be met for clinical spirometry, which may not be sufficient for all settings, such as research or occupational surveillance.

Overall, a total of 27 and 47 candidate genes under selection were detected in at least one of the above tests for MAY and ZMA, respectively. To obtain a global view of the main gene functions under selection, these 2 lists of candidate genes were annotated using IPA software. The main functional categories, in which these genes are involved, are listed in Supplementary Table 3 (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 for an exhaustive list of their functional annotation). For MAY, the top 5 significant functions belonging to the 3 IPA main categories (i.e. Diseases and Disorders, Molecular and Cellular Functions and Physiological System Development and Function) were related to inflammation ("Inflammatory Disease"), cancer and cell death ("Cancer" and "Cell Death and Survival"), gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases ("Hepatic Disease", "Gastrointestinal disease"), nervous system ("Nervous System Development and Function"), organ and tissue development and morphology ("Organismal Injury and Abnormalities", "Cell Morphology", "Cellular development", "Embryonic Development", "Organ development", "Organ morphology", and "Organismal development") and inflammation ("Inflammatory Disease"). For ZMA, the top 5 significant functions were related to cancer, dermatology ("Dermatological Diseases and Conditions"), organ and embryonic development ("Organismal Injury and Abnormalities", "Organismal Development", "Embryonic Development", "Organ Development"), metabolism and gastrointestinal disease ("Molecular Transport", "Lipid Metabolism", "Small Molecule Biochemistry", "Gastrointestinal Disease"), respiratory ("Respiratory System Development and Function") and nervous ("Nervous System Development and Function") systems (Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly, many functional categories or subcategories (nine among the top five significant functions) were found in both populations such as functions related to cancer, nervous system, organ development, and gastrointestinal disease.

### Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung [^7536b3b9]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

B. miRNA in pulmonary physiology and pathology

Role of miRNAs in the lung

The lung has a very specific miRNA expression profile, highly conserved across mammalian species. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung compartment is still limited and it is based mainly on the studies in animal models. MiRNAs have been shown to be involved in 1) the lung development and homeostasis, 2) in inflammation and viral infections and 3) miRNA deregulation may contribute to several pulmonary diseases (Figure 3). Hereby, we summarize the knowledge of the involvement of miRNAs in the lung and current information on their posttranscriptional regulation ongoing in the lung compartment. Besides pathology we pay attention also to physiological lung because understanding miRNA function in normal condition is prerequisite to description of its involvement in disease.

Figure 3
Involvement of miRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in lung. The scheme shows several miRNAs involved in physiological and pathological processes in lung. There has been shown that numerous miRNAs are implicated in maintaining lung homeostasis and development. When deregulation of these miRNAs occurs, pathological processes turn up and may lead to the development of pulmonary diseases.

### Effects of paracentesis on hemodynamic parameters and respiratory function in critically ill patients [^6d02a8fc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this trial we analyzed the effects of paracentesis on hemodynamic parameters and respiratory function in critically ill patients.

According to the results of our study, no relevant impairment of circulatory function was observed whereas renal function in terms of urine output improved following removal of ascites. Furthermore, paracentesis is related to immediate and sustained improvement of respiratory function. The median oxygenation ratio of all patients increased, whereas PaCO₂ remained stable after paracentesis.

Patients with tense ascites often display signs of circulatory dysfunction. Portal hypertension leads to vasodilatation of splanchnic vessels, leading to decreased peripheral resistance, decreased effective central blood volume with consequent arterial hypotension and hyperdynamic circulation. These changes finally result in activation of vasoconstrictor systems, the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system, as well as increased levels of antidiuretic hormone, water retention and renal vasoconstriction, possibly ending in renal failure. Infusion of albumin is recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) for large volume paracentesis (> 5 Liter), because intravenously administered albumin increases the effective arterial blood volume and improves serum sodium concentrations in patients with cirrhosis and severe hyponatremia. However, albumin does not interfere with the main mechanisms of ascites formation and therefore only prevents complications of paracentesis rather than prevents the recurrence of ascites.

### Early respiratory diagnosis: benefits of enhanced lung function assessment [^cc2f9a58]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Background

Respiratory disease is the third biggest cause of death in the UK and affects one in five people in England, with no improvement in respiratory disease mortality rates for over 10 years. In light of this and for the first time, the National Health Service in England (NHSE) has designated respiratory disease as a clinical priority as part of its Long Term Plan. The plan highlights the importance of reaching an earlier and more accurate diagnosis as an objective. To address the shortfalls surrounding time and accuracy of diagnosis, the NHSE Long Term Plan advocates the performance of quality-assured spirometry in the community.

Spirometry is the most common pulmonary function test undertaken and is used worldwide as the first-line diagnostic tool in the primary care setting when attempting to identify lung disease. It is an effective procedure for differentiating obstructive from other lung function abnormalities. The use of quality-assured spirometry is recommended frequently in national and international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) both in primary and secondary care. However, the ability of the respiratory system to exchange gases to and from the cardiovascular system can be impaired despite the presence of normal spirometry. Anecdotally, we were aware of patients presenting with normal spirometry results and yet abnormal gas exchange as measured by the single breath technique. We believe it is important to understand the impact measuring gas transfer might have on our ability to diagnose lung disease that spirometry alone might miss. This would clearly have the potential to influence future strategy on the ability to identify lung disease earlier. Due to alterations in the alveolar-capillary membrane and lung vasculature, the lung diseases that this would impact would include pulmonary vascular disorders, early interstitial lung disease or early emphysema.

Our aim was to investigate what proportion of patients attending our department for their first diagnostic assessment presented with normal spirometry yet abnormal gas transfer. This will impact time to first diagnoses, resulting in a continued protracted pathway and reducing the ability to detect lung disease at the earliest opportunity.

### The effects of low tidal ventilation on lung strain correlate with respiratory system compliance [^b7a2b92e]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to use low tidal volumes in the appropriate patients to avoid the side effects of this intervention. We hypothesized that the risk of exceeding a safe level of strain is lower in the patients with greater respiratory system compliance. Therefore, we performed this study to evaluate the effects of various tidal volumes on lung strain in ARDS patients with different levels of respiratory system compliance with the goal of optimizing the individual tidal volume settings. The primary outcome of our study was that lung strain is a function of the tidal volume in patients with different levels of respiratory system compliance. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of an abstract.

### Introduction to the respiratory system-SEER training modules… [^84dcb74e]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction to the Respiratory System When the respiratory system is mentioned, people generally think of breathing, but breathing is only one of the activities of the respiratory system. The body cells need a continuous supply of oxygen for the metabolic processes that are necessary to maintain life. The respiratory system works with the circulatory system to provide this oxygen and to remove the waste products of metabolism. It also helps to regulate pH of the blood. Respiration is the sequence of events that results in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body cells. Every 3 to 5 seconds, nerve impulses stimulate the breathing process, or ventilation, which moves air through a series of passages into and out of the lungs. After this, there is an exchange of gases between the lungs and the blood. This is called external respiration. The blood transports the gases to and from the tissue cells.

The exchange of gases between the blood and tissue cells is internal respiration. Finally, the cells utilize the oxygen for their specific activities: this is called cellular metabolism, or cellular respiration. Together, these activities constitute respiration.

### Determinants of the cuff-leak test: a physiological study [^c2982a43]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study were as follows. First, because in mechanically ventilated patients the expiratory leak volume is about 30% of the sum of inspiratory and expiratory leaks (total leak), the inspiratory leak significantly affected the results of the cuff-leak test. Second, the cross-sectional area around the endotracheal tube is not the only determinant of cuff-leak test. Third, respiratory system compliance and inspiratory flow affect the test significantly, mainly through an effect on the inspiratory component. Fourth, the expiratory component is slightly influenced by respiratory system resistance.

To avoid the confounding factors of respiratory muscle activity and dynamic hyperinflation on the calculation of cuff-leak volume, the patients were paralyzed and ventilated with settings that permitted the respiratory system to reach passive functional residual capacity at the end of expiration. Similarly, in the lung model the ventilator settings were such that dynamic hyperinflation was not observed. Therefore, for a given experimental condition the inspired tidal volume entirely determined the total expired volume. Finally, contrary to other studies, cuff-leak volume was measured by comparing the expired tidal volume with and without a deflated cuff. In this case the difference between inspired and expired tidal volume due to gas exchange and the different temperature and humidity of inspired and expired gas were not an issue.

### Ciliary functional analysis: beating a path towards standardization [^8783ffae]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an inherited disorder in which respiratory cilia are stationary, or beat in a slow or dyskinetic manner, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance and significant sinopulmonary disease. One diagnostic test is ciliary functional analysis using digital high-speed video microscopy (DHSV), which allows real-time analysis of complete ciliary function, comprising ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and ciliary beat pattern (CBP). However, DHSV lacks standardization. In this paper, the current knowledge of DHSV ciliary functional analysis is presented, and recommendations given for a standardized protocol for ciliary sample collection and processing. A proposal is presented for a quantitative and qualitative CBP evaluation system, to be used to develop international consensus agreement, and future DHSV research areas are identified.

### The effects of diaphragm release on sleep quality: a pilot feasibility study [^debb3256]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep health is a critical determinant of overall well-being, and insufficient or poor-quality sleep has been associated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, impaired cognitive performance, and reduced quality of life. In the long term, inadequate sleep quality has been linked to serious health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, anxiety, and stroke. Multiple factors, including environmental, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and physical influences, can negatively affect sleep. Importantly, poor sleep quality is a widespread issue that impacts individuals across all age groups, from otherwise healthy populations to those living with chronic illnesses.

Respiration is a fundamental aspect of life. As the primary respiratory muscle, the diaphragm plays a crucial role in breathing and physiological regulation. However, its functions extend beyond respiration, as the diaphragm also contributes to vocalisation and swallowing, alongside its primary respiratory function. The motion of the diaphragm during breathing influences the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and motor nerve activities.

Dysfunction of the diaphragm can disrupt physiological equilibrium and the interplay between body systems, leading to impaired breathing patterns. This dysfunction is associated with various disorders, including respiratory insufficiency, exercise intolerance, and sleep disturbance. The parasympathetic nervous system predominantly regulates sleep, with the vagus nerve playing a vital role in its control. Since the phrenic nerve, responsible for innervating the diaphragm and facilitating its functions, connects with the vagus nerve, releasing the diaphragm can potentially increase parasympathetic tone and deepen breathing, thus improving sleep quality. Although direct evidence for manual diaphragm release is lacking, it can be hypothesized that improving diaphragmatic function may exert similar effects to slow deep breathing, which has been shown to reset autonomic balance by inhibiting sympathetic activity and enhancing parasympathetic activation. Importantly, previous studies have also demonstrated that diaphragm release and stretching techniques can improve respiratory function and thoracic mobility by reducing tension on the diaphragm, including increases in maximal respiratory pressure and forced vital capacity. Through these pathways, interventions targeting the diaphragm may positively influence both physiological and psychological aspects of sleep regulation.

### Pathogenetic mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome [^501dbdd2]. Virus Research (2008). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory disease with significant morbidity and mortality. While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main SARS-CoV receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In this review, we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross, cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS. The implications of the proposed pathogenesis for prevention, diagnosis and therapy of the disease are discussed.

### Human respiratory organoids sustained reproducible propagation of human rhinovirus C and elucidation of virus-host interaction [^b53c04c2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Organoids, also called "mini-organs", are three-dimensional (3D) cellular clusters derived from stem cells, including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and organ-specific adult stem cells in primary tissues. They can self-renew and self-organize into complex, functional structures that recapitulate the cellular diversity and physiological functions of corresponding tissues and organs. We have established the first human respiratory organoid culture system –. Organoids are derived from adult stem cells in primary lung tissues with high efficiency and can be stably expanded over half a year. We have developed differentiation protocols to induce maturation in long-term expandable organoids and generate mature airway organoids and alveolar organoids that faithfully simulate the native airway and alveolar epithelium, respectively. Apart from a noninvasive procedure to procure readily accessible nasal cells for organoid derivation, nasal organoids more adequately simulate the upper airway epithelium than airway organoids. In this two-phase organoid culture system, expansion culture provides a stable and long-term expanding source, while differentiation protocols enable us to generate large amounts of physiologically active respiratory epithelial cells (Illustrated in Fig. 1a). Thus, the respiratory organoid culture system allows us to rebuild and propagate the entire human respiratory epithelium in culture plates with excellent efficiency and stability. These respiratory organoids have become robust and popular tools for studying SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

### Inspiratory capacity at inflation hold in ventilated newborns: a surrogate measure for static compliance of the respiratory system [^443babf7]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To study appropriateness of respiratory system compliance calculation using an inflation hold and compare it with ventilator readouts of pressure and tidal volume as well as with measurement of compliance of the respiratory system with the single-breath-single-occlusion technique gained with a standard lung function measurement.

Design

Prospective clinical trial.

Setting

Level III neonatal unit of a university hospital.

Subjects

Sixty-seven newborns, born prematurely or at term, ventilated for a variety of pathologic conditions.

Interventions

A standardized sigh maneuver with a predefined peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cm H₂O, termed inspiratory capacity at inflation hold, was applied. Using tidal volume, exhaled from inspiratory pause down to ambient pressure, as displayed by the ventilator, and predefined peak inspiratory pressure, compliance at inspiratory capacity at inflation hold conditions could be calculated as well as ratio of tidal volume and ventilator pressure using tidal volume and differential pressure at baseline ventilator settings: peak inspiratory pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure.

Measurements and Main Results

For the whole cohort, the equation for the regression between tidal volume at inspiratory capacity at inflation hold and compliance of the respiratory system was: compliance of the respiratory system = 0.052 * tidal volume at inspiratory capacity at inflation hold - 0.113, and compliance at inspiratory capacity at inflation hold conditions was closely related to the standard lung function measurement method of compliance of the respiratory system (R = 0.958). In contrast, ratio of tidal volume and ventilator pressure per kilogram calculated from the ventilator readouts and displayed against compliance of the respiratory system per kilogram yielded a broad scatter throughout the whole range of compliance; both were only weakly correlated (R = 0.309) and also the regression line was significantly different from the line of identity (p < .05). Peak inspiratory pressure at study entry did not affect the correlation between compliance at inspiratory capacity at inflation hold conditions and compliance of the respiratory system.

Conclusions

After a standard sigh maneuver, inspiratory capacity at inflation hold and the derived quantity compliance at inspiratory capacity at inflation hold conditions can be regarded as a valid, accurate, and reliable surrogate measure for standard compliance of the respiratory system in contrast to ratio of tidal volume and ventilator pressure calculated from the ventilator readouts during ongoing mechanical ventilation at respective ventilator settings.

### Lung function before and after COVID-19 in young adults: a population-based study [^2fa02406]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is primarily a respiratory disorder. The major effect on pulmonary function in the acute phase is a decreased diffusion capacity, and this is associated with severity of disease. In hospitalized patients with severe disease, restrictive lung function impairment has been described. A difficulty, however, in evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on lung function measured with spirometry is the wide variability in lung function between individuals; specifically, the lung function of an individual with a habitually higher than average lung function can decline significantly before reaching a pathologic value. Whether spirometric lung function is also affected to an extent not reaching a clinically pathologic value is of interest both at a population level (for future public health consequences) and on an individual level (for better assessment of individual risksand follow-up measures).

Although the abnormalities observed in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 are found to improve during the months after clearance of the infection, the extent of persistently affected lung function in a specific individual is unknown. The available follow-up studies are generally performed on clinic populations, where the patients have been in contact with a health care provider and have in most cases been hospitalized. However, post–COVID-19 symptoms have been reported to affect individuals independent of disease severity, and the degree to which lung function is affected by less severe disease is not known. The availability in our cohort of before– and after–COVID-19 measurements is therefore of great value to assess how COVID-19 disease affects spirometric lung function after recovery from mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

### Molecules in pathogenesis: angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [^b18d71d4]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system is mainly associated with the regulation of blood pressure, but recently many other functions of this system have been described. ACE2, an 805-amino acid monocarboxypeptidase type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was discovered in 2000 and has sequence similarity to two other proteins, namely ACE and collectrin. The ACE2 gene is located on Xp22 and is highly polymorphic. ACE2 is expressed in numerous tissues especially the lung alveolar epithelial cells, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies have found that ACE2 is central in diseases affecting almost all organ systems, among other cardiac, respiratory, renal and endocrine functions. ACE2 was identified as the cellular contact point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the global pandemic (COVID-19), and is a potential drug target. SARS-CoV-2 infection has several effects on the renin-angiotensin system and conversely, regulation of this receptor may affect the progress of infection. We describe the genetics and functions of ACE2, explore its various physiological functions in the renin-angiotensin system and discuss its role in the pathophysiology of disease. ACE2 opposes the vasopressor ACE pathway of the renin-angiotensin system by converting angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang (1–9) and Ang II to Ang (1–7) which initiates the vasodilatory pathway. ACE2 may have a protective effect in the lung and kidney as knockout mice display susceptibility to acute respiratory distress and hypertensive nephropathy. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent fusion and downregulation of this pathway during SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain some of the unusual sequelae seen in COVID-19.

### The effect of azithromycin treatment on respiratory morbidity in children with down syndrome [^0dca6075]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Down syndrome (DS), resulting from trisomy of chromosome 21, is the most common chromosomal syndrome, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 600–800 live births. The syndrome is characterized by distinctive physical features and systemic involvement, primarily affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Structurally and functionally, respiratory involvement constitutes this syndrome's main pathology. Additionally, there is a suboptimal functioning of the immune system in DS, including impaired B-cell and T-cell function, reduced antibody production, and the presence of inflammatory cytokines, leading to recurring infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Children with DS experience about five times more hospitalizations than the general pediatric population.

Respiratory abnormalities in children with Down syndrome stem from a variety of factors associated with their characteristic phenotypes, such as hypotonia, macroglossia, relative hypertrophy of adenoid tissue, and obesity, as well as structural defects like laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and subglottic stenosis. Additionally, congenital heart defects associated with Down syndrome may lead to secondary airway obstruction due to vascular pressure on the airways and/or complications from cardiac surgeries. More than half of all hospitalizations of children with Down syndrome were due to respiratory illness, with 40% specifically attributed to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), making it the leading cause of acute hospitalization in these children.

Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic widely used for various indications, including respiratory infections, has anti-inflammatory effects on the respiratory system. It reduces exaggerated airway responsiveness caused by eosinophilic inflammation, suppresses the production of cytokines such as IL-5, IL-8, and IL-6, and inhibits neutrophil activity on airway epithelial cells. Azithromycin is widely used in people with Cystic fibrosis (PwCF), based on clinical trials demonstrating improved lung function and reduced pulmonary exacerbations. A recent study on monocytes of PwCF highlighted the cellular functions and molecular targets of azithromycin, which improved the uptake of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and restored anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization in PwCF. Biegelman et al. reported that children treated with Azithromycin during an RSV bronchiolitis episode had fewer respiratory symptoms over the subsequent year than those treated with a placebo.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f25f96bc]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Cough physiology and pathophysiology — conclusions emphasize that chronic cough is more often encountered as a clinical problem in older women and that physicians should recognize comorbidities when managing troublesome cough. Conditions associated with impairment in the nervous or muscular systems may contribute to deficits in cough mechanics, the consequences of which in some cases can be predicted by assessing cough peak flow (CPF) and other measures, and airway secretion properties may impact cough efficiency. Respiratory maneuvers and devices can augment CPF, whereas medications can modify the physical properties of secretions, and these approaches may be of particular help with cough efficiency in some patients, especially with neuromuscular weakness or with difficulty in sputum expectoration. Cough testing approaches vary greatly in the type of cough measured and reported measures, with most studies reporting CPF only, and in populations with ineffective cough there is reduced cough output as opposed to the hypersensitive, increased output seen with chronic cough. The focus with these populations is evaluating the ability to effectively clear the airways, there is critical need to develop therapeutic techniques with this goal, yet despite many airway clearance devices and medications there are few well-controlled randomized controlled trials evaluating their safety and effectiveness, and the design and delivery of such trials remain a priority. A heightened cough reflex sensitivity in women is widely reported but poorly understood, and creating normative values and a standardized methodology for CPF and other clinically meaningful cough metrics represent important knowledge gaps.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection causes intestinal cell damage: role of interferon's imbalance [^1e93f8da]. Cytokine (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the newly emerging lung disease pandemic COVID-19. This viral infection causes a series of respiratory disorders, and although this virus mainly infects respiratory cells, the small intestine can also be an important site of entry or interaction, as enterocytes highly express in angiotensin-2 converting enzyme (ACE) receptors. There are countless reports pointing to the importance of interferons (IFNs) with regard to the mediation of the immune system in viral infection by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this review will focus on the main cells that make up the large intestine, their specific immunology, as well as the function of IFNs in the intestinal mucosa after the invasion of coronavirus-2.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^81b35bea]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend to start prone position in patients with ARDS receiving invasive mechanical ventilation early after intubation, after a period of stabilization during which low tidal volume is applied and PEEP adjusted and at the end of which the PaO₂/FiO₂ remains < 150 mmHg. Maintain prone positioning for prolonged sessions (≥ 16 consecutive hours) to reduce mortality.

### SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths: evidence base for 2016 updated recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [^c7eec2fd]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Serotonergic brainstem abnormalities in unexplained sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are described, with a recent large systematic review concluding that "the most consistent findings, and most likely to be pathophysiologically significant, are abnormalities of serotonergic neurotransmission in the caudal brain stem", and that brainstem abnormalities that involve the 5-HT system in up to 70% of infants who die of SIDS have now been confirmed in several independent data sets and laboratories. Reported abnormalities include decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5‑HT₁A) receptor binding, a relative decreased binding to the 5-HT transporter, increased numbers of immature 5-HT neurons, and decreased tissue levels of 5-HT and the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase, with "no evidence of excessive serotonin degradation as assessed by levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the main metabolite of serotonin) or ratios of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to serotonin"; this area of the brainstem "plays a key role in coordinating many respiratory, arousal, and autonomic functions", and "when dysfunctional, might prevent normal protective responses to stressors that commonly occur during sleep", and findings "are not confined to nuclei containing 5-HT neurons but also include relevant projection sites".

### Variable tidal volumes improve lung protective ventilation strategies in experimental lung injury [^b6377462]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

Noisy ventilation with variable Vt may improve respiratory function in acute lung injury.

Objectives

To determine the impact of noisy ventilation on respiratory function and its biological effects on lung parenchyma compared with conventional protective mechanical ventilation strategies.

Methods

In a porcine surfactant depletion model of lung injury, we randomly combined noisy ventilation with the ARDS Network protocol or the open lung approach (n = 9 per group).

Measurements and Main Results

Respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and distribution of pulmonary blood flow were measured at intervals over a 6-hour period. Postmortem, lung tissue was analyzed to determine histological damage, mechanical stress, and inflammation. We found that, at comparable minute ventilation, noisy ventilation (1) improved arterial oxygenation and reduced mean inspiratory peak airway pressure and elastance of the respiratory system compared with the ARDS Network protocol and the open lung approach, (2) redistributed pulmonary blood flow to caudal zones compared with the ARDS Network protocol and to peripheral ones compared with the open lung approach, (3) reduced histological damage in comparison to both protective ventilation strategies, and (4) did not increase lung inflammation or mechanical stress.

Conclusions

Noisy ventilation with variable Vt and fixed respiratory frequency improves respiratory function and reduces histological damage compared with standard protective ventilation strategies.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^4f4d3339]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Peripheral mechanisms of cough — dual-sensory neuron model indicates that extensive studies in animals and humans support the concept that at least two subtypes of primary sensory neurons can induce coughing when stimulated; C-fiber nociceptors have terminals in and around the mucosal surface of the airways and are sensitive to a wide variety of inhaled or locally produced chemical mediators, whereas mechanically sensitive cough receptors are positioned beneath the epithelium in the large airways, appear insensitive to most chemical mediators (with the exception of low pH), and are exquisitely sensitive to punctate stimuli delivered to the mucosal surface.

### Vasculopathy in COVID-19 [^49b2bf76]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is a primary respiratory illness that is frequently complicated by systemic involvement of the vasculature. Vascular involvement leads to an array of complications ranging from thrombosis to pulmonary edema secondary to loss of barrier function. This review will address the vasculopathy of COVID-19 with a focus on the role of the endothelium in orchestrating the systemic response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The endothelial receptor systems and molecular pathways activated in the setting of COVID-19 and the consequences of these inflammatory and prothrombotic changes on endothelial cell function will be discussed. The sequelae of COVID-19 vascular involvement at the level of organ systems will also be addressed, with an emphasis on the pulmonary vasculature but with consideration of effects on other vascular beds. The dramatic changes in endothelial phenotypes associated with COVID-19 has enabled the identification of biomarkers that could help guide therapy and predict outcomes. Knowledge of vascular pathogenesis in COVID-19 has also informed therapeutic approaches that may control its systemic sequelae. Because our understanding of vascular response in COVID-19 continues to evolve, we will consider areas of controversy, such as the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 directly infects endothelium and the degree to which vascular responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unique or common to those of other viruses capable of causing severe respiratory disease. This conceptual framework describing how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects endothelial inflammation, prothrombotic transformation, and barrier dysfunction will provide a context for interpreting new information as it arises addressing the vascular complications of COVID-19.
