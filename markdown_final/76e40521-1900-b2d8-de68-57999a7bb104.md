## Question

Pulmicort flex healer dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Pulmicort Flexhaler dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct product name and indication. Then, I should verify the available strengths and device characteristics. Next, I will extract age-specific starting doses and maximums from the FDA label. After that, I should review titration principles and onset of effect. I will then examine special populations and safety monitoring. Finally, I will reconcile any discrepancies and synthesize a concise, practical dosing summary with caveats about technique and interactions.

> Let me first confirm the product and indication. The query says "Pulmicort flex healer", but I should correct that to Pulmicort Flexhaler, which is a dry-powder inhaler containing budesonide indicated for maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 6 years and older; it is not for acute bronchospasm relief, so I need to ensure we do not imply it replaces a rescue inhaler [^1eb73985] [^76472dc4].

> I need to check the available strengths and device features. Pulmicort Flexhaler comes in 90 mcg and 180 mcg strengths, with 60 or 120 actuations per inhaler; importantly, dose delivery is flow-dependent, so inadequate inspiratory effort can reduce lung deposition, and patients should be taught to inhale deeply and forcefully and to rinse the mouth after use to reduce oral candidiasis risk [^e6d88f99] [^9fd54014] [^f8ee684e].

> Next, I should review adult dosing. For patients 18 years and older, the recommended starting dose is 360 mcg twice daily, with some patients adequately controlled at 180 mcg twice daily; the maximum recommended dose is 720 mcg twice daily, which equals 1,440 mcg/day, and I should double-check that ceiling to avoid exceeding labeled limits [^f8ee684e] [^e609d9de].

> Now, pediatric dosing. For children and adolescents 6 to 17 years, the recommended starting dose is 180 mcg twice daily, with some requiring 360 mcg twice daily; the maximum is 360 mcg twice daily, which is 720 mcg/day, and I should confirm that this pediatric ceiling is lower than in adults to reflect greater systemic sensitivity in children [^f8ee684e].

> Hold on, I should verify titration and onset. After 1 to 2 weeks, if control is inadequate, the dose may be increased; once control is achieved, titrate to the lowest effective dose. Improvement can begin within 24 hours, but maximum benefit may take 1 to 2 weeks or longer, so I need to counsel on expectations and adherence during this period [^f8ee684e].

> I will now examine special populations and safety. In hepatic impairment, budesonide exposure may increase due to hepatic metabolism, so monitor closely and consider dose reduction if signs of systemic corticosteroid effects emerge; in older adults, start at the low end and titrate cautiously given comorbidities; in pregnancy and lactation, available data suggest low infant exposure and support continued use when clinically indicated, though shared decision-making is prudent [^49b43ea7] [^97645465].

> But wait, what about device technique and critical errors. I should confirm that patients prime the device before first use, inhale forcefully, and rinse afterward; suboptimal inspiratory flow can markedly reduce delivered dose, so technique training and reassessment are essential to avoid underdosing and poor control [^f8ee684e] [^9fd54014].

> Next, I should review safety monitoring. Long-term inhaled corticosteroid use can be associated with oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia, adrenal suppression at high doses, effects on growth in pediatrics, and ocular effects such as cataracts or glaucoma; therefore, monitor growth in children, watch for signs of adrenal insufficiency, and consider periodic eye exams in high-risk patients or those on higher cumulative doses [^d8ba0cf9] [^d643408d].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the adult maximum was 720 mcg/day, but that would be incorrect; I should correct myself and emphasize that the labeled adult maximum is 720 mcg twice daily, which equals 1,440 mcg/day, whereas the pediatric maximum is 360 mcg twice daily, or 720 mcg/day, and I need to ensure I state these as separate ceilings to avoid confusion [^f8ee684e] [^e609d9de].

> I should also confirm drug interactions. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and itraconazole can increase budesonide exposure and risk of systemic effects; if combination therapy is necessary, monitor closely and consider dose adjustment or alternative agents when feasible [^d643408d].

> Let me synthesize a practical dosing summary. Adults 18 years and older: start 360 mcg twice daily, consider 180 mcg twice daily if milder disease or steroid-naive, titrate after 1 to 2 weeks if needed, and do not exceed 720 mcg twice daily; children and adolescents 6 to 17 years: start 180 mcg twice daily, consider 360 mcg twice daily if more severe, and do not exceed 360 mcg twice daily; for all, rinse mouth after use, reassess technique regularly, and titrate to the lowest effective dose once control is achieved [^f8ee684e] [^e609d9de].

Pulmicort Flexhaler (budesonide DPI) is dosed **twice daily** for asthma maintenance in patients aged ≥ 6 years [^1eb73985]. Adults typically start at **360 mcg twice daily** (max 720 mcg twice daily) [^f8ee684e], while children 6–17 years start at **180 mcg twice daily** (max 360 mcg twice daily) [^f8ee684e]. Titrate to the lowest effective dose after control is achieved [^f8ee684e]; if control is inadequate after 1–2 weeks, increase the dose or add a LABA [^f8ee684e]. Rinse mouth after each dose to reduce oral candidiasis risk [^f8ee684e]. Not for acute bronchospasm [^1eb73985]; use a SABA for rapid relief [^f8ee684e].

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be administered twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

Patients should be instructed to prime PULMICORT FLEXHALER prior to its initial use, and instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully each time the device is used.

The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established.

After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1–2 weeks of therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control.

2.1 Asthma

If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.

Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily.

Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily.

For all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose after adequate asthma stability is achieved.

Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of budesonide can occur within 24 hours of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. Individual patients will experience a variable onset and degree of symptom relief.

If a previously effective dosage regimen of PULMICORT FLEXHALER fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the lower strength of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the higher strength or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6–13%. In contrast, most of budesonide delivered to the lungs is systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lungs (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a different budesonide containing dry-powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered from PULMICORT FLEXHALER in adults with asthma (n = 39) occurred at approximately 10 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively.

In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and Cmaxwith increasing dose after both a single dose and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide.

Distribution

The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85–90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1–100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood/plasma ratio of about 0.8.

5.6 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression

PULMICORT FLEXHALER will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER.

Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.

It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms.

5.7 Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.8 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density

Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, post menopausal status, tobacco use, advance age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.

14.1 Asthma

The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER were evaluated in two 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical studies conducted at sites in the United States and Asia involving 1137 patients aged 6 to 80 years with mild to moderate asthma. Study 1 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, and placebo, each administered as 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily in patients 18 years of age and older with mild to moderate asthma previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids. The delivered dose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg and PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg are the same; each delivers 160 mcg from the mouthpiece. Study 2 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg, 2 inhalations once daily or 4 inhalations twice daily, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily, and placebo in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with mild to moderate asthma. Both of the studies had a 2-week placebo treatment run-in period followed by a 12-week randomized treatment period. The primary endpoint was the difference between baseline and the mean of the treatment-period FEV1(adults) or FEV1% predicted (children).

### Budesonide (Pulmicort) [^9fd54014]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In vitro testing has shown that the dose delivery for PULMICORT FLEXHALER is dependent on airflow through the device, as evidenced by a decrease in the fine particle dose at a flow rate of 30 L/min to a value that is approximately 40–50% of that produced at 60 L/min. At a flow rate of 40 L/min, the fine particle dose is approximately 70% of that produced at 60 L/min. Patient factors such as inspiratory flow rates will also affect the dose delivered to the lungs of patients in actual use [see Patient Information and Instructions for Use]. In asthmatic children age 6 to 17 (N = 516, FEV12.29 [0.97–4.28]) peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through PULMICORT FLEXHALER was 72.5 [19.1–103.6] L/min). Inspiratory flows were not measured in the adult pivotal study. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery.

### Budesonide (Pulmicort) [^49b43ea7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The administration of inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry-powder inhaler in doses up to 800 mcg/day (mean daily dose 445 mcg/day) or via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in doses up to 1200 mcg/day (mean daily dose 620 mcg/day) to 216 pediatric patients (age 3 to 11 years) for 2 to 6 years had no significant effect on statural growth compared with non-corticosteroid therapy in 62 matched control patients. However, the long-term effect of inhaled budesonide on growth is not fully known.

The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, should be monitored (e.g., via stadiometry). If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her asthma [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies receiving inhaled budesonide, 153 (n = 11 treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER) were 65 years of age or older and one was age 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine differences in efficacy between elderly and younger patients. Other reported clinical or medical surveillance experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Formal pharmacokinetic studies using PULMICORT FLEXHALER have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. However, since budesonide is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of budesonide in the plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored.

### Budesonide (Pulmicort flexhaler) [^0a4134a7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric

Following intravenous dosing in pediatric patients age 10–14 years, plasma half-life was shorter than in adults (1.5 hours vs. 2.0 hours in adults). In the same population following inhalation of budesonide via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, absolute systemic availability was similar to that in adults.

Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered via PULMICORT FLEXHALER in children and adolescents with asthma (n = 14) occurred at approximately 15 to 30 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.4 and 1.5 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively.

Nursing Mothers

The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (< 0.02 nmol/L in four infants and < 0.04 nmol/L in one infant) [see Use In Specific Populations (8.2)].

10 OVERDOSAGE

The potential for acute toxic effects following overdose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is low. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Another budesonide-containing dry powder inhaler at 3200 mcg daily administered for 6 weeks caused a significant reduction (27%) in the plasma cortisol response to a 6-hour infusion of ACTH compared with placebo (+1%). The corresponding effect of 10 mg prednisone daily was a 35% reduction in the plasma cortisol response to ACTH.

Postmarketing experience showed that acute overdose of inhaled budesonide commonly remained asymptomatic. The use of excessive doses (up to 6400 mcg daily) for prolonged periods showed systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting dose and highest recommended dose of PULMICORT RESPULES, based on prior asthma therapy, are listed in the following table.

2.1 Dosing Recommendations

Dosing recommendations based on previous therapy are as follows:

Bronchodilators alone: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily
Inhaled corticosteroids: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily
Oral corticosteroids: 0.5 mg twice daily or 1 mg once daily

In symptomatic children not responding to non-steroidal therapy, a starting dose of 0.25 mg once daily may be considered. If once-daily treatment does not provide adequate control, the total daily dose should be increased and/or administered as a divided dose. In all patients, it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.

2.2 Directions for Use

PULMICORT RESPULES should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask. Ultrasonic nebulizers are not suitable for the adequate administration of PULMICORT RESPULES and, therefore, are NOT recommended.

The effects of mixing PULMICORT RESPULES with other nebulizable medications have not been adequately assessed. PULMICORT RESPULES should be administered separately in the nebulizer [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

A Pari-LC-Jet Plus Nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a Pari Master compressor was used to deliver PULMICORT RESPULES to each patient in 3 U.S. controlled clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT RESPULES delivered by other nebulizers and compressors have not been established.

5.9 Effects on Growth

Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving PULMICORT FLEXHALER routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, titrate each patient's dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.10 Glaucoma and Cataracts

Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.

5.11 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms

As with other inhaled asthma medications, PULMICORT FLEXHALER can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-bronchodilator. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted.

5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome

In rare cases, patients on inhaled corticosteroids may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between budesonide and these underlying conditions has not been established.

The effects of PULMICORT RESPULES at doses of 0.5 mg twice daily, and 1 mg and 2 mg twice daily (2 times and 4 times the highest recommended total daily dose, respectively) on 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion were studied in 18 patients between 6 to 15 years of age with persistent asthma in a cross-over study design (4 weeks of treatment per dose level). There was a dose-related decrease in urinary cortisol excretion at 2 and 4 times the recommended daily dose. The two higher doses of PULMICORT RESPULES (1 and 2 mg twice daily) showed statistically significantly reduced (43–52%) urinary cortisol excretion compared to the run-in period. The highest recommended dose of PULMICORT RESPULES, 1 mg total daily dose, did not show statistically significantly reduced urinary cortisol excretion compared to the run-in period.

PULMICORT RESPULES, like other inhaled corticosteroid products, may impact the HPA axis, especially in susceptible individuals, in younger children, and in patients given high doses for prolonged periods [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Once-daily inhaled budesonide for the treatment of asthma: clinical evidence and pharmacokinetic explanation [^1e439f80]. The Journal of Asthma (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Budesonide, a widely used inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a favorable therapeutic ratio, is available via a dry powder inhaler (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) and as a suspension for nebulization (Pulmicort Respules).

Methods

MEDLINE and an AstraZeneca database were searched to identify relevant controlled clinical trials published between 1986 and 2002 using the key words budesonide OR inhaled corticosteroid, AND once daily.

Results

Thirty-four controlled clinical studies involving once-daily administration of budesonide to asthmatic patients were identified. Excluding long-term studies, this review presents data from 23 controlled studies for 4466 adults or adolescents and 1532 children with asthma and demonstrates efficacy of budesonide in both corticosteroid-naïve patients and patients previously treated with ICS. Once-daily administration of budesonide achieves clinical efficacy comparable with that of twice-daily regimens in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma and is equally effective when given in the morning or evening. Once-daily administration simplifies treatment regimens and may improve patient compliance. The tolerability profiles of budesonide once-daily via Turbuhaler or as budesonide inhalation suspension are good and comparable with those for twice-daily dosing.

Conclusions

Once-daily budesonide is effective and well tolerated as initial treatment for adults and children with mild asthma and as maintenance therapy in patients with more severe asthma once asthma control has been achieved.

### The role of budesonide in adults and children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma [^d325e84c]. The Journal of Asthma (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma, a chronic and potentially life-threatening disease of the airways, affects patients of all ages. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended first-line therapy for patients with persistent asthma. To review the clinical efficacy and tolerability data available on budesonide in the treatment of mild-to-moderate persistent asthma, a MEDLINE database search was performed for 1996–2003 using the following key words: budesonide, inhaled corticosteroid, efficacy, safety, systemic. When administered once or twice daily, budesonide effectively controls asthma in children, adolescents, and adults with mild-to-moderate asthma. Budesonide can be delivered effectively via a dry powder inhaler (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) in patients aged ≥ 6 years or as an inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules) in children as young as 12 months. With over 20 years' clinical exposure, budesonide has been demonstrated to be well tolerated in the treatment of chronic asthma in patients as young as 12 months. Specifically, at doses required to treat mild or moderate persistent asthma, budesonide does not affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, bone mineral density, cataract formation, or final adult height. As Pulmicort Turbuhaler, budesonide is the only ICS to achieve a Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category B rating. Early intervention with budesonide is recommended in asthma management: maximum benefit from therapy is reported in patients treated within 2 years of disease recognition. Budesonide is effective and well tolerated in the control of mild-to-moderate persistent asthma in patients aged 12 months and older. There is no evidence for variation in efficacy in population subgroups.

### Potency ratio fluticasone propionate (flixotide diskus) / budesonide (pulmicort turbuhaler) [^616fe245]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

In the choice of, or switch between, various inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) it is important to know equipotent doses for clinical treatment effects of the alternatives. Various ICS do have different inherent potency. Further, the ICS are delivered from inhalers that may differ markedly in output characteristics and drug delivery to intrapulmonary airways. Therefore, clinical efficacy comparisons must include drug-inhaler comparisons. We estimated the therapeutic potency ratio of the Flixotide Diskus (fluticasone propionate, FP) and the Pulmicort Turbuhaler (budesonide, BUD) in steroid-naive asthma patients, using a dose-reduction technique (FP 500–0 mcg/day, BUD 800–0 mcg/day). The dose defining end point was loss of asthma control in this paper denoted as exacerbation. In total, 282 patients with proven asthma were enrolled in the study, and 103 in the FP group and 98 in the BUD group completed the study per protocol. In total, 80 patients in the FP-group and 79 in the BUD-group experienced a dose defining exacerbation. The exacerbation frequency increased in a dose-dependent way as the dose was titrated down. From these data the potency difference between the present drug inhaler combinations, Flixotide Diskus and Pulmicort Turbuhaler, was calculated to be between 1.50:1 (95% CI 1.10:1–2.05:1) and 1.75:1 (CI 1.26:1–2.43:1) depending on if patients with insufficient steroid-response were excluded from the calculations or not. In these steroid-naïve patients, the potency difference was evident only at low daily doses, below 200 mcg.

Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines, if you are not sure.

Know the medicines your child takes. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when your child gets a new medicine.

How should I use PULMICORT RESPULES?

Use PULMICORT RESPULES exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Your child must use PULMICORT RESPULES regularly for it to work.
PULMICORT RESPULES comes in three strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for your child.
Do not stop using PULMICORT RESPULES, and do not change your child's dose of PULMICORT RESPULES without talking to your healthcare provider.
PULMICORT RESPULES is for inhaled use only. Use PULMICORT RESPULES with a jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor set up with a mouthpiece or face mask. Do not use an ultrasonic nebulizer to give PULMICORT RESPULES.
Do not mix PULMICORT RESPULES with other nebulizer medicines. If your child uses another medicine by inhalation to treat asthma, talk with your healthcare provider for instructions on when to use the other medicine.
If your child misses a dose, just give the next regularly scheduled dose when it is due. Do not use PULMICORT RESPULES more often than has been prescribed.
Improvement in the control of asthma symptoms with PULMICORT RESPULES can occur within 2–8 days. It may take up to 4–6 weeks before maximum improvement is seen.
Make sure your child always has a short-acting beta2-agonist medicine with him or her. Your child should use the short-acting beta2-agonist medicine for breathing problems between doses of PULMICORT RESPULES or if a sudden asthma attack happens. Call your healthcare provider right away if:
the short-acting rescue medicine does not work as well for relieving asthma symptoms.
your child needs to use the short-acting rescue medicines more often than usual.
your child's breathing problems worsen with PULMICORT RESPULES
Rinse your child's mouth with water and have him or her spit the water out after each PULMICORT RESPULES treatment. Do not swallow the water. This will lessen the chance of getting a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth.
If your child has used long-term corticosteroids and the dose is now being lowered or stopped, a warning card should be carried stating that your child may need corticosteroids during times of stress or during an asthma attack that does not get better with bronchodilator medicines.
Your healthcare provider may check your child's blood, breathing and do eye exams while using PULMICORT RESPULES.
Read the Patient Information and Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet for detailed instructions about how to use PULMICORT RESPULES.

### Budesonide inhalation suspension: a nebulized corticosteroid for persistent asthma [^3785827b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines for managing asthma in pediatric patients published by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the management of persistent asthma in infants and young children. When these guidelines were published, pressurized metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers were the only delivery devices available for inhaled corticosteroids in the United States. These devices can be difficult for young children to use correctly. Furthermore, no inhaled corticosteroid was approved in the United States for the treatment of children younger than 4 years. Budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules; AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, Del) was developed to meet the medication delivery needs of infants and young children with persistent asthma. Pulmicort Respules is the first inhaled corticosteroid approved for administration by means of a nebulizer and the only inhaled corticosteroid approved in the United States for infants as young as 12 months. Budesonide has been studied extensively worldwide. In the United States the tolerability and efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension were confirmed in 3 placebo-controlled multicenter trials. These studies demonstrated that both once- and twice-daily dosing of budesonide inhalation suspension (0.25–1 mg) improved pulmonary function and ameliorated asthma symptoms in infants and young children with persistent asthma. Budesonide inhalation suspension was well tolerated, and the incidences of reported adverse events were similar among patients in the budesonide, placebo, and conventional asthma therapy groups. This article reviews the results of these studies, as well as the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical use of budesonide inhalation suspension.

### Efficacy and safety of budesonide inhalation powder (pulmicort turbuhaler) during 52 weeks of treatment in adults and children with persistent asthma [^29e46e0c]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids are the agents of choice for treating persistent asthma.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of budesonide inhalation powder (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) in patients with mild to severe persistent asthma.

Methods

Patients (n = 1133) received open-label budesonide (dose range, 100–800 microg b.i.d.) for 52 weeks following 2 weeks to 5 months of treatment in one of four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients, identified before the double-blind studies, included adults (n = 249) not receiving corticosteroids, adults (n = 384) and children (n = 356) previously maintained on inhaled corticosteroids, and adults (n = 144) previously maintained on oral corticosteroids.

Results

Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 sec was 68.2% of predicted normal (n = 1133) at baseline (mean from two visits before randomization), 74.4% (n = 1132) at the end of double-blind treatment, 81.3% (n = 971) at week 52, and 80.1% (n = 1125) at last observation (including patients who discontinued early). Sixty-four patients maintained on oral corticosteroids before double-blind treatment entered the open-label study off oral corticosteroids, 58 of whom (91%) remained oral corticosteroid-free throughout the study. There was no evidence of basal or cosyntropin-stimulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function suppression, and the most commonly occurring adverse events were respiratory infection, sinusitis, and pharyngitis.

Conclusions

During this 52-week, open-label study, budesonide maintained the improved pulmonary function and decreased oral corticosteroid use observed during previous double-blind treatment and was well tolerated, supporting its long-term use in adults and children with mild to severe persistent asthma.

### Efficacy of budesonide in moderate to severe asthma [^1895714f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The worldwide prevalence of asthma is increasing by approximately 50% per decade. Budesonide is one of several inhaled corticosteroids available for the treatment of asthma and has been extensively evaluated in clinical trials.

Objective

This article reviews the published literature on the efficacy of budesonide in the management of adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe asthma and compares budesonide with other inhaled corticosteroids and nonsteroidal treatment options.

Methods

All controlled, randomized studies in patients with moderate or severe asthma were considered for inclusion. Relevant studies were identified through a MEDLINE search of the period from 1980 to 2000 using the terms budesonide plus efficacy, with or without the termsfluticasone, mometasone, and beclomethasone. The manufacturer's reference database was used to identify additional publications.

Results

Budesonide is associated with a dose-response effect in adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. The data on budesonide are in line with the current recommendation for a high starting dose of inhaled corticosteroid (800 microg/d), followed by downward titration to the minimal effective dose. Budesonide administered by Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, Del) dry-powder inhaler (DPI) was effective at a significantly lower dose than beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) administered by pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) (P = 0.009), whereas its efficacy was similar to that of BDP delivered by hydrofluoroalkane pMDI and that of fluticasone propionate administered by DPI. Inhaled budesonide therapy was shown to be oral corticosteroid sparing in patients with severe asthma, thus reducing the total corticosteroid dose and the risk of systemic side effects. Pulmicort Respules (AstraZeneca), a nebulized formulation, was effective in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in patients aged ≥ 12 months.

Conclusions

Once- or twice-daily administration of budesonide delivered via the Turbuhaler and Pulmicort Respules systems has been shown to be well tolerated and efficacious in populations with moderate to severe asthma.

For 12–17 years: "Budesonide-formoterol 200/6 [160/4.5] mcg DPI or pMDI (maximum total 12 inhalations in any day)" with "Step 1–2 (AIR-only): 1 inhalation as needed," "Step 3 MART: 1 inhalation twice (or once) daily plus 1 as needed," and "Step 4 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed" and "Step 5 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed." For adults ≥ 18 years: "Budesonide-formoterol 200/6 [160/4.5] or BDP-formoterol 100/6 mcg, pMDI or DPI (maximum total 12 inhalations in any day†)" with "Step 1–2 (AIR-only): 1 inhalation as needed," "Step 3 MART: 1 inhalation twice (or once) daily plus 1 as needed," "Step 4 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed," and "Step 5 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed." Administration guidance states "patients should take either 1 or 2 inhalations… whenever needed for symptom relief," they "do not need to wait a certain number of hours before taking more reliever doses… but in a single day, they should not take more than the maximum total number of inhalations shown below," and evidence of inhaler options notes "Most evidence for MART, and all evidence for AIR-only, is with budesonide-formoterol DPI, usually 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose)… and 100/6 mcg (80/4.5 mcg) delivered dose for MART in children 6–11 years. Beclometasone dipropionate (BDP)-formoterol 100/6 mcg (84.6/5.0) is also effective for MART in adults." The footnote adds, "GINA suggests that the maximum total dose in any day should be 12 inhalations" for BDP-formoterol and gives delivered doses "84.6/5 mcg for pMDI and 81.9/5 mcg for DPI."

### Pharmacologic interventions to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations [^940a00cc]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are known to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations and asthma fatalities. In addition, an increased dose of ICS at the onset of exacerbation can reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids, although this may require a fourfold increase in dose. The overuse of short-acting beta(2)-agonists or long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists, used as monotherapy, increases these risks. By contrast, the use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists together with ICS has been demonstrated to reduce the doses of ICS needed for ideal asthma control, as well as to reduce asthma exacerbations. This has been best demonstrated in the Formoterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy and Oxis and Pulmicort Turbuhaler in the Management of Asthma studies, which demonstrated that the combination of inhaled budesonide and formoterol reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations over that achieved by budesonide alone. Even the "as needed" use of inhaled formoterol added to ICS reduces asthma exacerbations. The combination inhaler, Symbicort, containing both budesonide and formoterol, reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations to a similar extent as the monocomponents, given separately. Treatment with either leukotriene receptor antagonists or anti-IgE also reduces the risks of asthma exacerbations, but the magnitude of the benefit compared with the combination of ICS and long-acting beta(2)-agonists is not yet known.

### Assessment of the systemic effects of budesonide inhaled from easyhaler and from turbuhaler in healthy male volunteers [^5e1ac9ba]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The main objective of this study was to show dose-dependent equivalence in the systemic activity of budesonide 800 microg day(-1) and 1600 microg day(-1) delivered from either Easyhaler or Turbuhaler in healthy male subjects. This single-centre study was carried out according to a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, five-way crossover design over a 9-week period. All subjects received 1 week of treatment with the following, in randomized order, with a washout week between each treatment: budesonide Easyhaler 800 microg day(-1) plus placebo Turbuhaler; budesonide Easyhaler 1600 microg day(-1) plus placebo Turbuhaler; placebo Easyhaler plus Pulmicort Turbuhaler 800 microg day(-1); placebo Easyhaler plus Pulmicort Turbuhaler 1600 microg day(-1); placebo Easyhaler plus placebo Turbuhaler. The final inhalation of study drug was performed at the study centre, where blood and urine samples were collected. Fifteen subjects were recruited and all completed the study. Mean serum cortisol AUC0-20 values (the primary outcome variable) were comparable for each device at the two dose levels, and met the defined criteria for equivalence (90% CI 0.8–1.25 for between-treatment difference). Budesonide 800 microg day(-1) caused minimal suppression of serum cortisol AUC0-20 values, Budesonide 1600 microg day(-1) statistically significantly suppressed serum cortisol AUC0-20 values compared with placebo. Mean morning serum cortisol values were within the reference range in al treatment groups. At a budesonide dose of 800 microg day(-1) mean urine cortisol/creatinine ratio was statistically significantly higher with Easyhaler than with Turbuhaler, but there was no significant difference between the devices at the 1600 microg day(-1) dose. Serum budesonide concentrations were equivalent for each device at both dose levels. Adverse drug reactions were infrequent and mild in nature and there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory safety variables. In conclusion, in healthy male volunteers, budesonide 800 microg day(-1) and 1600 microg day inhaled from Easyhaler had comparable systemic effects to the same doses inhaled via Turbuhaler.

### Comparison of two budesonide powder inhalers, easyhaler and turbuhaler, in steroid-naïve asthmatic patients [^b82bbecb]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this multicenter study was to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and acceptability of Easyhaler and Turbuhaler for the delivery of budesonide 200 micrograms/dose twice daily in steroid-naïve asthmatic patients. Three hundred and twenty-six newly diagnosed, steroid-naïve adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma were recruited into this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study, comprising a 2-week run-in period and 8 weeks of treatment. Patients received budesonide inhalation powder 400 micrograms/day either via Easyhaler (n = 159) or via Turbuhaler (n = 167), plus salbutamol inhalation powder (100 micrograms/dose) via Easyhaler as rescue therapy. The study was completed by 292 patients: 143 in the Easyhaler group and 149 in the Turbuhaler group. The primary outcome variable, mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), improved significantly and almost similarly by 36.3 and 30.6 l/min, respectively, from run-in to weeks 7–8. At weeks 7–8, the mean (SE) difference in morning PEF between the two treatments was 7.1 (9.4) l/min (90% CI from -8.4 to 22.6) on per protocol analysis, which was within the defined limits for therapeutic equivalence. There were no significant differences between treatments in terms of secondary efficacy variables or adverse events. However, patients found Easyhaler more acceptable than Turbuhaler. The results show that budesonide via Easyhaler is clinically as effective as Pulmicort Turbuhaler when equal daily doses of budesonide are delivered to steroid-naïve asthmatic patients. Moreover, patients found Easyhaler more acceptable than Turbuhaler, and a majority would prefer Easyhaler if given a choice.

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^6370b641]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study the intervention implemented by the second author. Due to the conditions of the infants, the person who involved in treatment was not blind instead of the outcome assessor was blind.

In the control group, neonates received intratracheal CUROSURF surfactant alone at a dose of 2.5 cc/kg. In the intervention group, neonates received the same dose of CUROSURF surfactant combined with intratracheal administration of budesonide at a dose of 0.25 mg or 1 cc/kg. Decisions to continue managing RDS treatment in all patients were made based on the standard protocol and guidelines of the NICU. Curosurf is a natural surfactant. each vial of Curosurf (Poractant alfa) used in this trial 3 cc instillation suspension contains 240 mg phospholipid fraction from Porcine lung. (Made by Chiesie Pharma company of Italy). The recommended starting dose is 100–200 mg/kg (1.25–2.5 ml/kg), additional doses of 100 mg/kg (1.25 ml/kg), each at about 6-12hourly intervals may also be administered if needed. Pulmicort inhaler solution used in this trial is a 2 cc suspension with 0.25 mg/ml concentration containing Budesonide. (Made by Swedish manufacture ASTRAZENECA which is imported by Cobel Daru company). The vials should be warmed to room temperature by holding it in the hand for a few minutes, before use, and gently turned upside down a few times, without shaking, in order to obtain a uniform suspension. The suspensions should be withdrawn from the vials using a sterile needle and syringe and mixed gently. A suitable tube should then be used to instill Curosurf with Budesonide into the lung directly into the lower trachea by passing a catheter through the tube after intubation of the patient. In this the outcome assessment researchers were blinded to the treatment groups.

### One-year safety and efficacy of budesonide / formoterol in a single inhaler (symbicort turbuhaler) for the treatment of asthma [^0fbb99fa]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A budesonide/formoterol single inhaler has been developed for convenient treatment of patients whose asthma is inadequately controlled by inhaled glucocorticosteroids alone.

Objectives

To compare long-term safety and efficacy of budesonide/formoterol single inhaler with budesonide plus formoterol via separate inhalers in adults with asthma.

Methods

In this open, randomized, parallel-group 6-month extension conducted in a subset of centres from a previous 6-month study, patients (n = 321) received two inhalations bid of budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort Turbuhaler) 160/4.5 microg delivered dose or corresponding doses of budesonide (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) plus formoterol (Oxis Turbuhaler) via separate inhalers.

Results

Significantly fewer patients receiving budesonide/formoterol single inhaler withdrew compared with budesonide plus formoterol (9 vs. 19%, P = 0.008). Incidence and severity of AEs were low and similar in both groups. No clinically important differences between groups, or changes, were identified in laboratory measurements, vital signs or ECG. Treatments produced similar improvements in lung function, ACQ scores and Mini AQLQ domains that were maintained throughout 12 months.

Conclusions

Budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler is as safe and effective in the long-term treatment of asthma as budesonide plus formoterol via separate inhalers. The lower number of withdrawals with budesonide/formoterol may reflect better adherence to treatment compared with budesonide plus formoterol.

### Daily versus as-needed inhaled corticosteroid for mild persistent asthma (the helsinki early intervention childhood asthma study) [^5265de8c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

The 18-month study was of a controlled, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, single-centre design including a 2-week run-in period. Two blinded treatment regimens were initiated with inhaled budesonide via a dry-powder inhaler (Pulmicort Turbuhaler, AstraZeneca, Lund, Sweden), and one open-label treatment regimen was initiated with DSCG via a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI; Lomudal with Fisonair spacer, Aventis Pharma, Holmes Chapel, UK). Patients were randomised as to treatment in balanced blocks as generated by a computer program. During the 2-week run-in period, all enrolled patients received a short-acting β 2 -agonist, terbutaline (Bricanyl Turbuhaler, 0.25 mg/dose, AstraZeneca, Lund, Sweden) as needed. After the run-in period, children were assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) continuous budesonide group, receiving budesonide (400 μg twice daily for the first month, then 200 μg twice daily for 5 months) followed by low-dose budesonide (100 μg twice daily for 12 months); (2) budesonide/placebo group, where patients received identical budesonide treatment as Group 1 for the first 6 months followed by placebo for 12 months; and (3) DSCG control group, where patients received DSCG 10 mg three-times daily for 18 months (fig 1).

### Safety, tolerability and acceptability of two dry powder inhalers in the administration of budesonide in steroid-treated asthmatic patients [^54eb3053]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this randomized, double-blind parallel group study was to compare the safety, tolerability and acceptability of Easyhaler and Turbuhaler dry powder inhalers for the delivery of budesonide 800 microg day(-1) in adult asthmatic patients who had already been treated with inhaled corticosteroids for at least 6 months prior to the study Additionally the efficacy of the products was evaluated. The main objective was to evaluate the systemic safety of budesonide inhaled from Easyhaler (Giona Easyhaler, Orion Pharma, Finland) as determined by serum and urine cortisol measurements. The secondary objective was to compare the tolerability acceptability and efficacy of the two devices in the administration of budesonide. After a 2-week run-in period (baseline), patients were randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive budesonide from Easyhaler (n = 103) or from Turbuhaler (Pulmicort Turbuhaler, AstraZeneca, Sweden) (n = 58) 200 g dose(-1), two inhalations twice daily for 12 weeks. There was no statistically significant change in morning serum cortisol values from baseline to the end of treatment in either group. Urine free cortisol and urine cortisol/ creatinine ratio increased from baseline in both groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of morning serum cortisol, urine cortisol, adverse events or efficacy variables, but Easyhaler was generally considered more acceptable to the patients. In conclusion, at 800 microg day(-1), Giona Easyhaler is as safe and efficacious as Pulmicort Turbuhaler in adult asthmatic patients previously treated with corticosteroids, but more acceptable to patients.

### A randomized phase IIb trial of pulmicort turbuhaler (budesonide) in people with dysplasia of the bronchial epithelium [^ad5f817c]. Clinical Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Preclinical studies suggest that inhaled budesonide may be an effective chemopreventive agent for lung cancer. We conducted a phase IIb study to determine the effects of inhaled budesonide in smokers with bronchial dysplasia.

Experimental Design

A total of 112 smokers with more than or equal to one site of bronchial dysplasia > 1.2 mm in size identified by autofluorescence bronchoscopy-directed biopsy was randomly assigned to receive placebo or budesonide (Pulmicort Turbuhaler) 800 microg twice daily inhalation for 6 months. The primary end point was change in the histopathologic grade on repeat biopsy of the same sites at the end of 6 months.

Results

There were no significant differences in the regression or progression rates of bronchial dysplasia between the two groups. There was a statistically significant but modest decrease in p53 and BclII expression in the bronchial biopsies after 6 months of Pulmicort Turbuhaler versus placebo (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001, respectively). There was a small but statistically significant decrease in the proportion of computed tomography-detected lung nodules after Pulmicort Turbuhaler compared with placebo (P = 0.024).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that in smokers, inhaled budesonide in the dose of 1600 microg daily for 6 months had no effect in regression of bronchial dysplastic lesions or prevention of new lesions. Budesonide treatment resulted in a modest decrease in p53 and BclII protein expression in bronchial biopsies and a slightly higher rate of resolution of computed tomography-detected lung nodules. Whether budesonide truly has an effect in preneoplastic lesions in the peripheral airways and alveoli requires additional investigation.

Asthma Step 4 MART dosing — In Step 4, the MART regimen can be prescribed with medium-dose maintenance budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol by increasing low-dose ICS-formoterol to 2 inhalations twice-daily; the reliever remains 1 inhalation of low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed. The usual dose for MART with budesonide-formoterol is 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) and for beclometasone-formoterol is 100/6 mcg metered dose (delivered dose 84.6/5 mcg for pMDI and 81.9/5 mcg for DPI), and for Step 4 each is prescribed as two inhalations twice-daily plus one inhalation whenever needed for symptom relief. As in Step 3, the maximum recommended total dose of budesonide-formoterol in a single day (total of maintenance-and-reliever doses) gives 72 mcg metered dose (54 mcg delivered dose) of formoterol; based on this evidence, GINA suggests the same maximum total dose should also apply for MART with beclometasone-formoterol (maximum total 12 inhalations, total metered dose 72 mcg), and most patients need far fewer doses than this.

### Once-daily budesonide inhalation suspension in infants and children or = 4 years of age with persistent asthma [^8c8861f5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules; AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE), a nebulized corticosteroid, was developed for use in infants and young children with persistent asthma.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily budesonide inhalation suspension in children < 4 years of age and in those ≥ 4 years of age with persistent asthma.

Methods

A retrospective analysis stratified by age group was performed on data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, or 1.0 mg once daily for 12 weeks in children 6 months to 8 years of age with persistent asthma. Clinical assessments included nighttime and daytime asthma symptoms, breakthrough medication use, adverse events, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis function.

Results

In both randomized studies, budesonide inhalation suspension demonstrated statistically significant improvement in nighttime and daytime asthma symptom scores compared with placebo. In the retrospective analysis of pooled data from these studies, the efficacy of budesonide was maintained when children were stratified by age group. Clinical improvements from baseline in nighttime and daytime asthma symptom scores were observed in both age groups at all budesonide inhalation suspension dose levels. No significant differences were observed between age groups in breakthrough medication use in any of the treatment groups. No differences were observed in the incidence of adverse events between the two age groups, and significant (P < 0.01) effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis function was apparent only in children < 4 years of age at the 0.25-mg dose level.

Conclusions

Once-daily budesonide inhalation suspension is effective in the treatment of persistent asthma in children aged < 4 and ≥ 4 years of age.

### The formulation and evaluation of a CFC-free budesonide pressurised metered dose inhaler [^ca3a4bc2]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Although dry powder inhalers are well established for the delivery of corticosteroids, the pressurised metered dose inhaler remains the preferred and most cost effective presentation. To design an HFA solution formulation which matched marketed CFC products (Pulmicort and Desonac DA) two elements of the Chiesi Modulite system, the addition of a non-volatile component and the actuator orifice diameter, were varied. These variables, which were shown by in vitro tests to influence the fine particle dose and its mean particle size in different ways, could be permuted to give an aerosol cloud with size characteristics very close to the comparator products. The likelihood that this would confer clinical equivalence is reinforced by a pharmacokinetic analysis which showed that the chosen HFA solution formula gave similar systemic absorption from the lung as Pulmicort. The equivalence in aerosol characteristics was sustained when the pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) were used with spacers. The Chiesi Jet and the AstraZeneca Nebuhaler, when used with their respective pMDIs, reduced likely oropharyngeal deposition to the same extent and gave a similar increase in the fine particle dose.

### Combination of budesonide / formoterol on demand improves asthma control by reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^57632297]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Material and methods

Study design

In a randomised, double-blind, double dummy, parallel-group, 6-week trial the protective effect of three treatment regimens on EIB was investigated in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. The treatment alternatives were as follows:
regular placebo once daily and a fixed combination of 200 μg budesonide and 6.0 μg formoterol metered dose (Symbicort, AstraZeneca AB, Sweden) on demand;
regular placebo once daily and 500 μg terbutaline metered dose (Bricanyl, AstraZeneca AB) on demand;
regular inhalation of 400 μg budesonide metered dose (Pulmicort, AstraZeneca AB) once daily and 500 μg terbutaline metered dose (Bricanyl, AstraZeneca AB) on demand.

On demand means inhalation of study drugs before exercise and for symptom relief at any time. The participating subjects were instructed to perform physical exercise three to four times a week during the 6-week treatment period.

The trial was conducted at 10 study sites in Sweden and Norway. All study subjects attended two screening visits prior to randomisation.

At the first visit a standard skin prick test, spirometry, physical examination, vital signs control, demography, control of medical history and concomitant medication were conducted and the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5 (ACQ5) was completed. Eligible subjects underwent a maximal exercise test on a treadmill.

At the second visit a 6 min standardised exercise test was performed on a treadmill at 90% of maximal aerobic capacity, while breathing dry air. If post-exercise forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) was reduced by ≥ 10% compared with the pre-exercise value, the patient was included.

At the third visit the patients were randomised to one of the three treatment regimens. Three weeks and 6 weeks after randomisation an exercise test, identical to visit 2, was performed (figure 1).

In both studies, improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s in patients who were randomly assigned to use the Novolizer was comparable with that in patients who used the established devices. Furthermore, no differences in tolerability or safety between the Novolizer and the control devices were observed. Finally, patient acceptance of the Novolizer was high, with the majority of patients who used it stating that they would use the device again.

### Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) of asthma: a critical appraisal [^445808b3]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Scicchitano and colleagues undertook a study of similar design to the study by Rabe et al but the study was of 12 months duration and time to first severe exacerbation (using the expanded definition) was the primary outcome variable. One arm was treated with budesonide/formoterol 200/6 (Symbicort 200/6) once daily with additional doses as needed, the other received budesonide 200 μg (Pulmicort 200) two puffs twice daily with terbutaline 500 μg/puff reliever as needed. The results were similar to those reported by Rabe and colleagues. Time to first severe exacerbation was longer in the ICS/LABA combination therapy group while other symptom outcomes were also better. Most adverse events and safety events were similar between treatment groups, although one patient in the SMART group developed atrial fibrillation attributed to study medication by the investigator.

The results of these two early SMART trials do not elucidate a unique value of a SMART approach; they confirm only that the addition of a long-acting β 2 agonist to inhaled steroids is an effective option.

The largest of the early trials was reported by O'Byrne and colleagues. This 1-year trial assigned patients to (1) budesonide/formoterol 100/6 one puff twice daily with terbutaline reliever; (2) budesonide 400 μg twice daily with terbutaline reliever; or (3) budesonide/formoterol 100/6 one puff twice daily with additional doses as reliever. Time to first severe exacerbation was delayed in the SMART group compared with the other regimens. Secondary outcome variables were also better. The investigators suggested the timing of additional ICS therapy in the SMART group as a possible mechanism to explain the better outcomes with SMART versus budesonide monotherapy at mean daily doses of 300 μg versus 400 μg respectively. They did not discuss the improved outcome of SMART versus conventional combination therapy with SABA reliever, but their data showed that patients on SMART averaged 50% higher daily ICS doses than patients using conventional combination therapy. Thus, this trial reconfirms that increasing the dose of ICS may be helpful in improving asthma outcomes.

Adjustable maintenance and reliever therapy (AMD) with ICS–LABA — Dynamic-dosing step-up strategies using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) have been studied, and multiple recent studies have consistently demonstrated efficacy of AMD in the yellow zone; this AMD strategy has become standard of care in many countries in Europe and Canada, but studies used doses that exceeded FDA approval (up to 3 times the recommended dose) and the Turbuhaler device, whereas in the United States these medications are available as metered dose inhalers and there is an FDA boxed warning regarding the LABA component. One controlled trial compared fixed fluticasone/salmeterol dosing (250 and 50 μg twice daily) versus AMD with budesonide/formoterol (400 and 12 μg twice daily); after a run‑in, patients in the budesonide–formoterol arm halved their dose and then adjusted puffs per day based on nocturnal awakenings, rescue medication use, and changes in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF).

Asthma Prevalence, Morbidity, and Control

One in four caregivers (24.9%) reported having a child with physician-diagnosed asthma (Table 2). Probable asthma, defined as at least one affirmative response to the Brief Pediatric Screen Plus, was identified in 16.2% of children without a formal asthma diagnosis. Among children diagnosed with asthma, 48.0% reported using long-term asthma control medication and 68.3% quick-relief medication during the month prior to the survey (Table 3); 81.5% of caregiver's believed their child's medication helped his or her asthma. Asthma was moderately or poorly controlled among 60.0% of children based on an affirmative response to one or more questions on items 1a-e of the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire. Roughly 1 in 3 asthmatic children had missed school in the past month and had visited a doctor or the emergency department in the past year due to their illness; 5.4% of children were admitted to the hospital for an asthma exacerbation in the year prior to the survey.

GINA Treatment Steps for Adults and Adolescents

Steps 1 and 2, Preferred Treatment (Track 1)

The preferred treatment for adults and adolescents with mild asthma is low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief, without maintenance treatment (Figure 3). As-needed-only ICS–formoterol is usually prescribed with a budesonide–formoterol inhaler providing a metered dose of 200/6 μg per inhalation (equivalent to a delivered dose of 160/4.5 μg), with one inhalation taken as needed for symptom relief (Table 1; for dosage details, see Table E2 and thein the online supplement). Other combination ICS–formoterol products may be suitable but have not yet been studied.

Rationale

Considerations for the recommendations at Steps 1 and 2 are interrelated. In patients eligible for Step 2 treatment, two large studies found that as-needed ICS–formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations by almost two-thirds compared with SABA-only treatment. Four studies (∼10,000 patients) showed a similar or greater reduction in severe exacerbations compared with daily low-dose ICS, without clinically important differences in symptom control, lung function, or airway inflammation measured by F NO over 12 months. The primary outcome variable of one study was "well-controlled asthma weeks," but this outcome was not considered reliable because it was based on a past definition of asthma control and was systematically biased against the as-needed ICS–formoterol treatment group, in which patients were permitted much less ICS than those on maintenance ICS before a week was classified as not well controlled. In two studies that showed a greater overall reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations with as-needed ICS–formoterol compared with maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA, no predictors of differential response were identified among many baseline characteristics, including inflammatory phenotype, except for a clinically unimportant difference in the five-item Asthma Control Questionnaire in one study.

### Comparison of symbicort® versus pulmicort® on steroid pharmacodynamic markers in asthma patients [^553349f5]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β(2)-adrenergic agonists (LABA) is reported to have superior effects on controlling asthma symptoms to ICS alone; however, there is no molecular-based evidence to explain the clinical effects. Here, the effect of the ICS/LABA combination was compared with ICS on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation in sputum macrophages.

Methods

In a randomised, double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled 6-visit study, 10 patients with mild asthma were given placebo, formoterol (Oxis(®) 12 μg), budesonide (Pulmicort(®) 200 μg :BUD200, or 800 μg :BUD800), or budesonide/formoterol combination (Symbicort(®)) as a single 100/6 μg (SYM100) or double 200/12 μg (SYM200) dose. Sputum macrophages were separated by plate adhesion from induced sputum. GR binding to the glucocorticoid-response elements on oligonucleotides (GR-GRE binding) was evaluated by ELISA. mRNA expression of MAP-kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1 and IL-8 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR.

Results

GR-GRE binding was significantly increased after treatment with SYM100 (3.5 OD/10 μg protein, median, p < 0.05) versus placebo (1.3) and BUD200 (1.6), and the induction was higher than that of BUD800 (2.4). MKP-1 mRNA was increased and IL-8 mRNA was significantly inhibited by BUD800, SYM100 and SYM200 versus placebo.

Conclusions

The effects of SYM100 and SYM200 on GR activation were not different from that of BUD800 and superior to BUD200. Thus, it has been confirmed at a molecular level that inhaled combination therapy with a lower dose of budesonide has an equivalent effect to a high dose of budesonide alone. In addition, GR-GRE binding is found to be a valuable pharmacodynamic marker for steroid efficacy in clinical studies.

### Efficacy and safety of insulin degludec in a flexible dosing regimen vs insulin glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes (BEGIN: flex T1): a 26-week randomized, Treat-to-target trial with a 26-week extension [^6f8a034f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Procedures

Eligible participants were switched to OD IDeg or IGlar with mealtime IAsp at randomization (week 0). If previous basal insulin was dosed OD, initial doses were transferred 1:1 for IDeg and IGlar. If previous basal insulin was dosed more than OD, total daily basal dose was calculated and transferred 1:1 for IDeg, with dose reduction considered by the investigator's judgment. For transfer to IGlar, a 20%–30% dose reduction was recommended, based on current prescribing information. Participants switched pretrial bolus insulin to IAsp 1:1 at the pretrial dose (Supplemental Data). At the end of the main and extension periods, basal insulin was switched to NPH insulin for 7 days to minimize interference with antibody detection at a follow-up visit performed 1 week later.

The trial was approximately 56 weeks including one screening week, two 26-week treatment periods, and two 7- to 12-day follow-up wash-out periods (Supplemental Figure 1). The main period compared IDeg Forced-Flex [IDeg administered on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings and on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings; ie, at fixed intervals with a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 40 hours between injections (Supplemental Data)] with IDeg (given OD with the evening meal) and with IGlar (given OD at the same time daily). All participants randomized to IDeg in the main study were offered participation in the extension with instructions to take IDeg OD at any time of day (IDeg Free-Flex), provided they maintained a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 40 hours between doses. Patients randomized to IGlar in the main period who entered the extension continued the same-time-daily IGlar.

### Impact of multiple-dose versus single-dose inhaler devices on COPD patients' persistence with long-acting β ₂-agonists: a dispensing database analysis [^9212b0df]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Switching

Part of the nonpersistent patients were those who did discontinue their initial inhaler or medication but did not completely discontinue the use of any long-acting medication at all (that is, they switched therapy). Therefore, follow-up of non-persistent (to initial therapy) patients was monitored by assessing patients' medication profiles after the date of discontinuation of their initial therapy. For all patients, follow-up was at least 1 year from the date of treatment initiation; however, to be able to assess switching patterns in the year after the date of treatment discontinuation, follow-up needed to be longer. Therefore, we defined a subcohort where patients needed to have a follow-up of at least 2 years. After discontinuation of initial treatment, we assessed the following possibilities: a switch to a different inhaler within the DPI class (that is, from single- to multiple-dose inhaler or vice versa), a switch to a LABA-pressurised metered dose inhaler, a switch to a different bronchodilator class (LABA/ICS or long-acting muscarinic antagonist), a restart with initial type of medication/inhaler or permanent discontinuation of any long-acting bronchodilator.

Defining the single-dose and multiple-dose cohorts

Two cohorts were defined based on the type of LABA-DPI initiated by the patients. We made a distinction between single-dose and multiple-dose DPI inhalers. Single-dose inhalers require loading of separate capsules before using the device. Examples include the Handihaler, the Cyclohaler, the Rotahaler and the Breezhaler. Multiple-dose inhalers contain a fixed amount of doses (usually between 60 and 120) that can be taken successively until the device runs out of doses. Examples include the Diskus, the Turbuhaler and the Novolizer. We hypothesised that the use of single-dose inhalers required more complex and time-consuming handlings in order to perform proper inhalation and would therefore decrease treatment persistence.

### Exposure of infants to budesonide through breast milk of asthmatic mothers [^97645465]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is often required for asthmatic nursing women. Data on the transfer of inhaled corticosteroids from plasma to breast milk and the subsequent exposure of the breast-feeding infant has been unavailable.

Objective

We sought to assess budesonide concentrations in milk and plasma of asthmatic nursing women receiving maintenance treatment with the Pulmicort Turbuhaler and estimate the exposure of their breast-fed infants.

Methods

Milk and plasma samples were collected up to 8 hours after dosing from 8 mothers receiving budesonide maintenance treatment (200 or 400 microg twice daily). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from budesonide milk and plasma concentrations. Infant exposure was estimated based on average milk budesonide concentrations. A single blood sample was obtained from 5 infants close to expected infant maximum concentration.

Results

Budesonide concentrations in milk reflected those in maternal plasma, supporting passive diffusion of budesonide between plasma and milk, and was always lower than that in plasma. The mean milk/plasma ratio was 0.46. The estimated daily infant dose was 0.3% of the daily maternal dose for both dose levels, and the average plasma concentration in infants was estimated to be 1/600th of the concentrations observed in maternal plasma, assuming complete infant oral bioavailability. Budesonide concentrations in infant plasma samples were all less than the limit of quantification.

Conclusion

Maintenance treatment with inhaled budesonide (200 or 400 microg twice daily) in asthmatic nursing women results in negligible systemic exposure to budesonide in breast-fed infants.

Clinical Implications

These data support continued use of inhaled budesonide during breast-feeding.

### Evaluation of inhaler handling-errors, inhaler perception and preference with spiromax, easyhaler and turbuhaler devices among healthy Finnish volunteers: a single site, single visit crossover study (finhaler) [^b3729212]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

The combination therapy involving an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting β 2 agonist (LABA) is recommended for patients with inadequately controlled asthma. The fixed dose combination of the ICS/LABA budesonide/formoterol (BF) has shown greater improvement in pulmonary function and overall asthma control compared with either individual compound alone. Currently in Europe, BF is available via three different DPIs: Bufomix (BF) Easyhaler (Orion Pharma Oy), Symbicort (BF) Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca AB) and DuoResp (BF) Spiromax (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd).

Easyhaler is a multidose DPI that shares similarities in its handling steps and shape with a pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI). It consists of seven plastic components, a metering cylinder spring and plastic components. The drug dose is delivered by pressing/pushing down once on the overcap of the inhaler. Easyhaler dose preparation requires vigorous shaking with the inhaler kept in the upright position. Turbuhaler is a multidose DPI designed to deliver predetermined doses of the drug (located within the inhaler in the form of a soft aggregate pellet). It consists of a mouthpiece with spiral-shaped channels, rotating disk, drug reservoir, turning grip and a protective cover. Dose preparation requires holding the device in the upright position and a full twist/rotation (forward and back) of the grip at the base of the device. Spiromax is a multidose DPI designed to provide high-dose consistency with maximal ease-of-use for the patients. Similar to Easyhaler, Spiromax has a design/look similar to a pMDI; however, the internal configurations of the inhaler are different (the devices use a novel X-ACT technology). Dose preparation consists of fully opening the cap until a click is heard while holding the device in the upright position.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^90940596]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Formoterol – where does it fit in the current guidelines? [^5f169e88]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Drugs available to treat asthma have improved considerably over the past three decades and understanding of the disease process is continually improving. However, the incidence of asthma is increasing and the cause(s) of this increase are not yet identified. Asthma is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Poor compliance with medication is also an important consideration in how effective management strategies can be. The aim of current asthma treatment, according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), is to control the disease. However, two surveys, one in Europe and the other in the U.S. A. indicate that the objectives of treatment guidelines are not being met. Patients were shown to experience high rates of exacerbations and require many doses of reliever medication. There was also a large difference between patient and physician perceptions of treatment — this needs to be countered by improved education for both the general public and healthcare professionals. Formoterol, which is the only beta2-agonist to possess both fast- and long-acting properties, may help to improve patient compliance by allowing a single inhaler to be used for both maintenance and as-needed therapy. However, although formoterol is already widely used as maintenance therapy current treatment guidelines do not include the use of formoterol as first-line reliever medication. Evidence is increasing to support as-needed use and a large, randomized effect veness study in 18,000 patients across the world is ongoing to assess the safety and efficacy of formoterol as needed in a real-life setting. The results from the Real-Life Effectiveness of Oxis Turbuhaler (RELIEF) study should help to establish the position of formoterol as an effective first line reliever medication and ultimately lead to the inclusion of formoterol as needed in treatment guidelines.

### Can medicines development improve outcomes in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management by driving effectiveness? [^07fe510a]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Device features and design

Effective drug delivery systems enable the controlled introduction of a medicine into the body, while also improving drug efficacy and safety. The dosage form and device can directly impact on treatment success and patient adherence. Critical errors — those that can be defined as errors resulting in limited or no medication being delivered to the lung — have been associated with major impacts on respiratory symptoms and healthcare consumption. The ELLIPTA inhaler has been shown to be superior to other commonly used inhalers for the administration of ICS/LABA medicines, in terms of patient preference for its design features of dose counter, ease of use, and dosing regimen. Furthermore, it has been shown that fewer patients make critical errors with the ELLIPTA inhaler compared with a range of other ICS/LABA inhalers, and that the ELLIPTA inhaler requires less teaching time than other inhalers. In studies evaluating the dose delivery achieved through ELLIPTA, patients received a dose close to the label claim with inspiratory flow rates of 30 L/min and above 30 L/min peak inspiratory flow rate. Furthermore, studies have shown that asthma and COPD patients across a range of disease severities achieved a flow of 43 L/min or above. In everyday practice, a simple inhaler that requires less time to teach the correct technique, is easy to use, has a low potential for patients to make critical errors, delivers adequate dose across a broad range of inspiratory flow rates, and is preferred by patients, will be a positive driver of effectiveness since there will be greater confidence that the medication has been optimally delivered.

Tolerability

A theoretical consequence of some drivers of effectiveness is that, while the likelihood of correct and adequate dosing increases, the benefits in terms of positive outcomes might be outweighed by an increased risk of side effects. Tolerability and adverse events reported in phase lll clinical studies of FF/VI in patients with asthma and COPD were similar to those seen with the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination. In the SLS, serious adverse event rates were very similar for FF/VI and UC. Modeling studies have suggested that FF may have a better therapeutic index than other inhaled steroids.

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^8bf61488]. FDA (DailyMed) (2012). Low credibility.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2. 5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Lung function, beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. PULMICORT FLEXHALER will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose.

Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving PULMICORT FLEXHALER routinely. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, titrate each patient's dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms. Prescribers should weigh the known benefits of breastfeeding for the mother and the infant against the potential risks of minimal budesonide exposure in the infant.

Dosing considerations include prescription or titration to the lowest clinically effective dose and use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER immediately after breastfeeding to maximize the time interval between dosing and breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure. However, in general, PULMICORT FLEXHALER use should not delay or interfere with infant feeding. In a 12-week pivotal study, 204 patients 6 to 17 years of age were treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER twice daily. Efficacy results in this age group were similar to those observed in patients 18 years and older. There were no obvious differences in the type or frequency of adverse events reported in this age group compared with patients 18 years of age and.
