## Question

Evaluation of protein in the urine of an athlete

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate proteinuria in athletes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and prevalence of exercise-induced proteinuria. Then, I should verify the optimal timing and type of urine collection. Next, I will review which quantitative tests to order and how to interpret results, including thresholds and variability. After that, I need to consider confounders like dehydration, supplements, and posture. Then, I will outline a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm for evaluation and follow-up. Finally, I should address special populations and summarize key principles with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanisms. Exercise-induced proteinuria is common in athletes, with prevalence ranging from roughly 18% up to 100% depending on intensity, and it is primarily intensity-driven rather than duration-driven, reflecting transient increases in glomerular permeability and partial tubular reabsorption inhibition. The protein pattern after heavy exercise is mixed glomerular-tubular, whereas lighter exercise tends to show predominantly glomerular-type proteinuria, and the effect typically resolves within about 1–2 hours post-exercise, which is important for timing of sampling and interpretation [^115Dx4Dc] [^113dvmns].

> Wait, let me verify the best sampling strategy to minimize variability. I initially thought a random spot urine might suffice, but hold on, I should confirm that first-morning voids are preferred to reduce confounding from activity, posture, and hydration; if first-morning is not feasible, an early-morning sample is acceptable, and I should avoid sampling within 24 hours of strenuous exercise because transient elevations can mislead diagnosis, so I need to ensure a 48-hour washout from intense activity before confirmatory testing [^1175ZuJn] [^115ue12H] [^113rzxmp].

> Next, I should review which tests to order and why. Dipstick urinalysis is a convenient screen but has poor sensitivity for low-level albuminuria and is vulnerable to false positives and negatives; therefore, I need to confirm any positive dipstick with a quantitative laboratory method and express results as a ratio to creatinine, preferably using albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) for most kidney diseases, reserving protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) when non-albumin proteins are suspected or in specific contexts like pregnancy or transplant care [^1175ZuJn] [^116ecPJu] [^113bgsG9].

> I will now examine how to interpret results and account for variability. I should confirm that albuminuria categories are defined by ACR: < 30 mg/g normal, 30–300 mg/g moderately increased, and ≥ 300 mg/g severely increased; however, because within-person biological variability exceeds 20%, I need at least two abnormal results over 3–6 months to establish chronicity, and I should repeat testing if transient contributors were present, including recent exercise, infection, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, or uncontrolled hypertension [^1175ZuJn] [^113rzxmp] [^111c4Bwr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single abnormal value. I should double-check for confounders that can artifactually elevate protein or albumin excretion in athletes: dehydration concentrates urine and can falsely elevate dipstick protein, high protein intake can modestly increase urinary protein, and creatine supplementation can raise serum creatinine without reducing true GFR, complicating eGFR-based interpretations. Posture-related orthostatic proteinuria remains a consideration in adolescents and young adults, so I need to ensure appropriate sample timing and, if needed, split urine collections to distinguish orthostatic from persistent proteinuria [^117D9Xtv] [^115LG7L7] [^1147GaKG].

> Let me think about a pragmatic clinical algorithm. First, I should screen with a dipstick during a routine visit. If negative and the athlete is low risk, no further testing is needed. If positive or if the athlete is high risk (hypertension, diabetes, family history of CKD, or performance decline), I should arrange a first-morning ACR within 1–2 weeks, ensuring at least 48 hours without strenuous exercise. If ACR is normal, I can reassure and continue routine care, but if ACR is ≥ 30 mg/g, I should repeat ACR two more times over 3–6 months to confirm persistence before labeling as CKD, while concurrently checking eGFR, blood pressure, and glucose as indicated [^1175ZuJn] [^113rzxmp] [^113tDexu].

> But wait, what if albuminuria is confirmed and significant. I should confirm that persistent albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/g warrants evaluation for etiology, including assessment for diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune disease, and medication review; in athletes with confirmed albuminuria, I should also consider whether high-intensity training contributed and adjust training load while monitoring, and if proteinuria is in the nephrotic range or accompanied by hematuria, edema, or systemic symptoms, I should refer to nephrology for further workup and possible biopsy [^1175ZuJn] [^113zZbyz].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In adolescents and young adults, orthostatic proteinuria is common and benign. A split urine collection can help distinguish it from persistent disease. In patients with established CKD, exercise training generally does not worsen proteinuria and may modestly reduce it in some studies, but I should individualize intensity and monitor closely. In pregnancy, proteinuria thresholds and preferred tests differ, with protein-to-creatinine ratio favored over dipstick for quantification, and I should follow obstetric guidelines for confirmation and management rather than CKD pathways [^1147GaKG] [^117LyCH6] [^117D9Xtv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said that exercise-induced proteinuria is "harmless". I should correct that. While transient post-exercise proteinuria is common and typically resolves within hours, repeated or very high-level proteinuria, especially in the setting of endurance events, may reflect renal stress and, in susceptible individuals, could signal risk for acute kidney injury. Thus, I should counsel on hydration, avoidance of nephrotoxins like NSAIDs around competitions, and prompt evaluation if red flags such as oliguria, gross hematuria, or systemic symptoms occur [^113yNYwC] [^113iKac9].

> Let me reconsider the key principles to close the loop. Timing matters: avoid sampling within 24 hours of strenuous exercise and prefer first-morning specimens; confirm any positive screen with quantitative ACR and repeat to establish chronicity; interpret results within clinical context and after addressing confounders; and escalate evaluation for persistent albuminuria or concerning features. By following this structured approach, I can minimize false positives, avoid overdiagnosis, and ensure that true kidney disease is not missed in athletic populations [^1175ZuJn] [^113rzxmp] [^111c4Bwr].

Proteinuria in athletes is most often **transient and benign**, typically resolving within 24–48 hours after exercise [^115Dx4Dc]. Persistent proteinuria (> 3 months) or levels > 1 g/day warrant evaluation for **underlying renal pathology** [^111c4Bwr]. Use **first-morning urine ACR** for screening and confirmation, and avoid testing within 24 hours of intense exercise [^113rzxmp] [^1175ZuJn]. If ACR is ≥ 30 mg/g, repeat to confirm persistence, assess eGFR, and evaluate for glomerular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or other systemic causes [^1175ZuJn] [^113tDexu]. Management is cause-specific; transient cases require no treatment, whereas persistent proteinuria may need RAAS blockade, blood pressure control, or further nephrology workup [^1125fo7H] [^113U7LTM].

---

## Physiological mechanisms of proteinuria in athletes

Proteinuria in athletes arises from **multiple physiological mechanisms**:

- **Increased glomerular permeability**: Intense exercise increases sympathetic activity and catecholamines, raising glomerular capillary permeability and causing protein leakage [^113dvmns] [^115ThC66].

- **Reduced tubular reabsorption**: Exercise may transiently inhibit tubular reabsorption, increasing urinary protein excretion [^113dvmns].

- **Hemodynamic changes**: Exercise-induced renal blood flow shifts and increased filtration fraction contribute to transient proteinuria [^notfound].

---

## Types of proteinuria observed in athletes

Athletes may exhibit **different types of proteinuria**:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Transient proteinuria | Temporary proteinuria occurring after intense exercise, resolving within 24–48 hours [^notfound] | Benign, no intervention required |
| Orthostatic proteinuria | Proteinuria occurring in the upright position, resolving in supine position [^1147GaKG] | Benign, common in adolescents |
| Persistent proteinuria | Proteinuria persisting beyond 3 months or > 1 g/day [^111c4Bwr] [^116qeBca] | Indicates underlying renal pathology, requires evaluation |

---

## Clinical significance and potential risks

Transient proteinuria is **benign and self-limiting**, whereas persistent proteinuria may signal glomerular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or other systemic conditions [^114Jxx65]. Persistent proteinuria increases the risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular disease [^1125fo7H] [^113U7LTM].

---

## Recommended evaluation protocol

A **structured approach** is essential for evaluating proteinuria in athletes:

---

### Initial screening

Use **urine dipstick testing** as a rapid screen, but confirm positives with quantitative methods due to false positives/negatives [^116ecPJu] [^1175ZuJn]. Prefer **first-morning urine samples** to minimize exercise and hydration effects [^1175ZuJn] [^111NosL1].

---

### Quantitative assessment

Use **albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)** from a first-morning sample to quantify proteinuria and confirm persistence [^1175ZuJn] [^113rzxmp]. If ACR is ≥ 30 mg/g, repeat to confirm persistence and assess for chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^1175ZuJn] [^113tDexu].

---

### Further evaluation

Persistent proteinuria warrants assessment of **renal function (eGFR)** and evaluation for hypertension, diabetes, and other systemic causes [^113ZdbBS] [^113tDexu]. Consider **24-hour urine collection** to quantify total protein excretion if ACR is significantly elevated or if glomerular disease is suspected [^117ErQGq].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **proteinuria type and underlying cause**:

- **Transient proteinuria**: Requires no specific treatment; educate on hydration and gradual training progression [^115Dx4Dc].

- **Persistent proteinuria**: Address underlying causes (e.g. hypertension, diabetes); consider ACE inhibitors or ARBs to reduce proteinuria and protect renal function [^1125fo7H] [^1156CbiU].

- **Orthostatic proteinuria**: Reassure and monitor; no intervention typically required [^1117Ns7Y].

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Athletes can reduce proteinuria risk with **adequate hydration**, a balanced diet, and avoidance of overtraining. Regular monitoring of urinary protein — especially in high-risk athletes — supports early detection and management [^1143hH3P].

---

Proteinuria in athletes is **usually transient and benign**, but persistent proteinuria requires structured evaluation and management. A **first-morning ACR-based approach**, with repeat testing and targeted workup, ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate care [^1175ZuJn].

### Exercise-induced albuminuria increases over time in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism [^114nd67t]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism lead to endothelial dysfunction and kidney injury. Excessive urinary albumin excretion reflects damage to the kidney's vasculature bed and precedes kidney failure. Moreover, even moderately increased levels of urinary albumin excretion (measured by a spot urinary albumin to creatine ratio test (UACR)) correlate with elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Exercise induced albuminuria (EiA) appears earlier and may be a more sensitive biomarker for kidney endothelial damage. We and others have shown that elevated EiA levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes. However, the change in an individual's EiA levels over time and its interaction with metabolic dysfunction has never been studied.

A recent report showed that changes in rest UACR over time modifies the risk of major clinical outcomes and mortality in diabetic patients. Accordingly, we hypothesize that measuring changes in EiA over time should enable earlier risk stratification.

Here, we sought to determine the change in EiA levels over time in a cohort of diabetic and apparently healthy individuals, and to reveal the factors responsible for "abnormal" changes.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^117D9Xtv]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1.3

We recommend quantification of proteinuria is undertaken by protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) or albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR). Twenty-four hour urine collection for quantification of protein is not required (1B).

Rationale

Dipstick testing of urine with reagent strips to detect proteinuria preferentially detects albumin. False positives occur with dehydration, exercise, infection and alkaline urine. False negatives occur with dilute urine, and non-albumin proteinuria. A systematic review of seven prospective studies showed that the sensitivity and specificity of a dipstick result of ≥ 1+ protein for predicting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy (> 300 mg/24 h) ranges from 47 to 86% and 39–95% respectively, leading to the conclusion that the accuracy of dipstick urinalysis with a 1+ threshold in the prediction of significant proteinuria is poor. However, automated dipstick urinalysis provides a more accurate screening test for the detection of proteinuria than visual testing in hypertensive pregnancies.

The urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics, and whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Managing the combined consequences of COVID-19 infection and lock-down policies on athletes: narrative review and guidelines proposal for a safe return to sport [^112YiTHj]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

MULTIORGAN THREAT AND GLOBAL ASSESSMENT FOR INFECTED ATHLETES

In about 5% of the cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection does not only affect lungs and heart. As commonly observed in sepsis, liver and kidney alterations might occur. Hepatocytes degenerate, liver sinusoids are hyperaemic with micro-thrombi and can lead to a metabolic disorder. So far, these complications are reported only in severe forms, but less is known about athletes infected with milder symptoms and the potential detrimental effect on liver and kidney of an early return to sport, which would result in misadapted physiological responses to exercise. We then suggest adding specific blood and urine biomarkers to the PPE to help understand the severity of the infection in athletes before a return to sport. Recent work reported that C reactive protein (CRP) levels are increased in patients with COVID-19, and it has been shown that median CRP values are strongly correlated with disease severity and prognosis. Based on a global review of laboratory markers, complete blood count, interleukin 6, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, ferrintin, troponin I, CK-MB and NT-pro BNP can be relevant to explore the level of severity of COVID-19 in patients. – To prevent asymptomatic acute kidney injury that may result from COVID-19 infection, we recommend assessment of traditional urine biomarkers such as the glomerular filtration rate of the kidney, creatinine, albumin urea, cystatin C, beta-trace protein, beta-2 microglobulin and fatty acid-binding proteins. For a better understanding, biomarkers are presented in table 1. During the first month of practice, tracking the evolution of kidney and liver biomarkers could be of great help to understand the consequences of the viral infection and prevent a putative worsening due to a too rapid and/or too high energy expenditure. In that perspective, oxygen consumption (VO₂) evaluation could be an additional valuable approach.

### Effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Qi93i]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Expectations for the future

Our findings highlight several essential considerations for future studies. First, six studies monitored proteinuria only at baseline and at the end of the follow-up; however, because proteinuria is unstable, it is necessary to continuously monitor proteinuria to ensure the authenticity of the data. Second, few studies reported compliance. It is common that the compliance of objects in exercise training to decline over time; therefore, participants may need to exercise under supervision rather than on their own. Future studies should specifically report exercise compliance along with the intensity and duration of exercise, completion of the treatment process, and changes in the health status of participants, including those who have not been followed up. A comprehensive report of this information will allow this essential variable to be included in future meta-analyses to confirm the effectiveness of exercise training interventions. Of note, the calculation of UACR is based on urine creatinine levels, which are influenced by increased muscle strength, protein intake, or decreased renal function. We found that only a few studies have measured and analysed the change in muscle strength, volume, and creatinine levels whilst measuring UACR. To accurately evaluate whether exercise has a substantial effect on UACR, future studies should fully assess the impact of these potential factors.

### Orthostatic proteinuria due to inferior vena cava interruption without nutcracker phenomenon in an old obese female: a case report and literature review [^117TpwD2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case discussion

To the best of our knowledge, it is the one of the first cases reported of orthostatic proteinuria attributed to subsequent hemodynamic abnormality of IVC interruption in the absence of LRV entrapment and IVC thrombosis. The patient's LRV received most of infrarenal IVC blood, directly resulting in elevated pressure of LRV and then increasing the pressure of renal venules and efferent arteriole, which caused elevated glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and more protein filtering from glomeruli into the primary urine. The pressure of LRV would be more exaggerated due to the calf muscle pump, explaining its postural dependence. Although fixed and reproducible orthostatic proteinuria, this patient had normal serum creatinine and benign renal outcome.

Without longitudinal observation, orthostatic proteinuria is hard to be distinguished from that caused by measuring bias, transient proteinuria after vigorous exercise, and primary or secondary chronic kidney disease (CKD) in this case. After verifying that all quality control (QC) records of urinary microalbumin and total protein were under control, we considered the patient's highly variant urinary protein was a reflection of her original disease rather than the detection error. With the value of ACR elevated over 400 times after mild to moderate exercise intensity, the degree of fluctuation is much greater than that of postexercise transient proteinuria in healthy subjects and could hardly be explained by chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the patient had several risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, and multiple cystic in bilateral kidney that could cause secondary kidney diseases, the patterns of normal serum creatinine and 24h UTP, plus clear renal structure are not consistent with the characteristics of CKD. Besides, the tests for secondary kidney diseases, comprising of autoimmune antibodies and monoclonal protein were all negative. Therefore, we excluded the possibility of secondary kidney diseases.

### Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115LG7L7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To improve physical performance and overall health, both competitive and recreational athletes are increasingly turning to methods that provide a performance advantage. Among these methods, nutritional and exercise approaches are commonly employed to enhance training results. Creatine monohydrate, often simply called creatine (α-methyl-guanidine-acetic acid: C₄H₉N₃O₂), has become one of the most thoroughly studied and commonly used dietary supplements for enhancing physical performance. Through a process involving amino acids glycine and arginine, the liver, kidneys, and pancreas create naturally occurring creatine. It plays a crucial role in supporting cellular energy metabolism. Its ability to raise intramuscular phosphocreatine concentrations helps to rapidly resynthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during prolonged exercise. Beyond its ergogenic advantages, increasing data indicate that creatine may have therapeutic effects in several clinical settings, including rheumatic illnesses, and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its broader applicability beyond the athletic population.

A fundamental assessment of kidney performance, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is usually deduced from solute removal. Exogenous markers such as inulin are used in the most accurate approach, mGFR, but this method is usually limited to specific settings. eGFR is often calculated using serum biomarkers such as creatinine (Crn), a byproduct of creatinine metabolism. Blood Crn levels may rise as a result of chronic creatine supplementation, which raises total body creatine. This increase, meanwhile, does not always indicate compromised renal function. Because of this, estimating GFR in creatine supplementation trials using only creatinine-based metrics can be deceptive and is mainly insufficient for precisely evaluating renal health in this situation.

There are still concerns about the safety of creatine supplementation, particularly in relation to kidney function, although many studies have not observed any significant changes in important renal markers, including mGFR, cystatin C, proteinuria, or albuminuria. Early reports are the main source of these concerns, animal studies, and the clinical reliance on serum creatinine. However, many studies have shown that oral creatine use did not lead to kidney damages. The goal of the current study is to conduct a thorough and updated systematic review because of the contradictory findings surrounding this topic, the critical importance of comprehending its implications.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113K2zxJ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Multivariate meta-analysis for protein to creatinine ratio to detect significant proteinuria compared with 24 hour urine collection

For many of the studies, we could extract test accuracy results for protein to creatinine ratio at multiple thresholds; for example, for Al Ragip et al, a two by two table expressing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives was available for each of five protein to creatinine ratio thresholds (0.13, 0.18, 0.19, 0.2, and 0.49). Multiple test accuracy results within the same study are correlated, as the same patients are contributing their data to each of the thresholds. For example, one would expect a strong positive correlation between test accuracy results at neighbouring thresholds. This within study correlation between thresholds should be accounted for in the meta-analysis by synthesising all thresholds simultaneously, as it contains important information that is otherwise lost. In particular, by using the within study correlations one can "borrow strength" across thresholds; this means that, for example, if a study presents results for a threshold of 0.2 but not for threshold 0.3 then, with any knowledge of the within study correlation between estimates at 0.2 and 0.3 in other studies, this study can still provide some indirect information about test accuracy at threshold 0.3.

### Clinical practice guideline exercise and lifestyle in chronic kidney disease [^114xATqi]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

When discussing the relationship between physical activity and exercise with disease progression, it is important to separate findings relating to different outcome measures. A recent meta-analysis including 31 trials which undertook aerobic exercise programmes (totalling n = 1305) concluded there was no difference in serum creatinine between control and training groups post intervention period. However, a recent report did conclude that a self-management intervention (which included an exercise component) was able to show improvements in serum creatinine after a 3-month period. As the exercise here was part of a wider intervention it is hard to infer cause and effect; however further studies are warranted to follow up on such findings. As the most common indicator used for disease progression in CKD populations, the effect of exercise and physical activity on eGFR has rightly been investigated. The current research available has been summarised in 3 meta-analyses which concluded conflicted findings. Two of these analyses reported that aerobic exercise programmes show no discernible effects upon eGFR, with most of the included studies focussed around self-management interventions which contained an exercise element. The other meta-analysis reported that, with the inclusion of 11 RCTs (totalling n = 362 patients) with an average of 35-weeks of aerobic exercise, eGFR was increased (2.16 ml/min [0.18;4.13]. However, the authors did concede that the effects were small, and the data was limited due to many of the included studies being low to moderate quality. As such we believe that though positive effects have been reported in regard to exercise and eGFR, current evidence does not warrant recommendations in the non-dialysis CKD population. A final measure of disease progression which has been studied is the role of exercise and physical activity in moderating albuminuria/proteinuria. Recent research in this area has been summarised, which included those who studied the effect of self-management interventions (which included exercise) on albuminuria. Conclusions suggested that self-management interventions were associated with lower 24 h protein excretion. Two studies, which were not included in this analysis, both looked at an exercise-only intervention and reported no significant changes in either a non-dialysis CKD-obese population or after a 24-week exercise intervention in non-dialysis CKD patients only. Overall conclusions from the research base investigating exercise and physical activity on disease progression markers is that currently, the work presented shows no basis for specific recommendations.

### Interpreting abnormal proteinuria in pregnancy: the need for a more pathophysiological approach [^1151fJ6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

This review and opinion article focuses on the definitions and meanings of abnormal protein excretion in pregnancy, asking the following questions: Are our tests to determine abnormal proteinuria adequately performed? Are current guidelines for diagnosis of excessive proteinuria, especially when used to identify preeclampsia, supported by adequate data? Can the magnitude of proteinuria be used as a reliable clinical biomarker of the gravity of preeclampsia? Should timed urine collections, primarily 24-hour excretions, be supplanted by the urine protein/creatinine ratio in clinical practice? The answers to most of these questions are: We are not sure, or some guidelines are poorly supported by data and may prove erroneous. We suggest a more physiologic approach to assessment of proteinuria and believe that if clinicians and investigators looked at proteinuria in terms of how the kidney handles protein in health and disease it would lead to a more rational and evidence-based approach to proteinuria in pregnancy. Finally, we recommend that current cutoff for abnormal proteinuria be used to diagnose preeclampsia, but the level of proteinuria should not guide management. Other variables, such as status of blood pressure control, evidence of increasing organ damage in the liver and hematological systems, evidence of falling glomerular filtration rate, and signs of neurological involvement, are more reliable indicators of severity of preeclampsia.

### Evaluation of proteinuria redux [^115c2VDE]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

All of the methods for quantitative evaluation of proteinuria (or albuminuria) suffer from some methodological flaw. A new modification that improves the accuracy of the urine protein-to-creatinine ratios for predicting 24-hour urinary protein excretion has been examined in a well-characterized cohort of patients with glomerular disease. This approach needs to be systematically compared with other techniques before it can be universally recommended to replace the time-honored 24-hour urine collection.

### Detection and measurement of urinary protein [^116qeBca]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The measurement of urine total protein and albumin is central to the diagnosis and management of subjects with kidney disease and in assessing cardiovascular risk. Accurate assessment is vital to enable detection and management of the patient with proteinuria.

Recent Findings

The spot urine protein has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to 24-h urine collections. Recent studies suggest that this holds true for screening to exclude significant proteinuria (> 1 g/day) but data are lacking for the quantification of proteinuria and in assessing response to therapy. For albuminuria, while 24-h urinary albumin excretion remains the gold standard, spot urine samples are appropriate for screening. The optimal technique for the laboratory determination of urinary albumin has been questioned with the high-performance liquid chromatography-based method demonstrating significantly more albumin in the urine. Population-based studies have found dramatic increases in the prevalence of microalbuminuria with the new high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Whether this extra immunounreactive albumin detected by high-performance liquid chromatography is clinically important remains to be established.

Summary

Twenty-four-hour urine collection remains the gold standard for the accurate determination of both total urinary protein and albumin. Spot urine samples can be used for screening patients for albuminuria and proteinuria. The optimal method for measuring urinary albumin concentration remains to be established.

### Hypoxia is not the primary mechanism contributing to exercise-induced proteinuria [^115f7zew]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

We calculated ORs for urinary α1-AGP excretion in placebo and losartan groups at rest (pre-exercise and post-exercise at 120 and 180 min) and with exercise (at post-60 min) based on the relative changes (relative increase (+) or decrease (−)) from baseline sea-level measures within each individual.

Patient and public involvement

This study was supported by the Birmingham Medical Research Expeditionary Society which provided input for the conduct of the research. Patients were not included. Public involvement was limited to recruitment. Notification was given to participants at the time of consent that acquisition of personal data was permitted on request. Permission was also obtained at this time for the dissemination of de-identified data within the research team and only externally when a reasonable request was submitted directly to the corresponding author(s) of the present study within 6 months of its publication. A portion of the cohort was invited to review the research methods for accuracy and readability.

Ethics approval

This study did not aim to investigate any safeties or efficacies of the already Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs included, thus no clinical trial approval was obtained. There were no active FDA recalls for either drug for the duration of the study.

### Population-based screening for CKD [^113ZdbBS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Organizations both in the United States and globally have advocated for screening for chronic kidney disease with a urine test for proteinuria followed by subsequent testing with creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate determinations. Screening for a disease, such as chronic kidney disease, can have value, but a decision to screen is not a trivial decision. Criteria must be met to balance the aggregate benefits with the risks and costs of a screening test. We discuss how screening for chronic kidney disease meets many of these criteria, but also how the populations to which it is applied must be targeted and the strategies for testing must be clearly defined.

Evaluation of CKD — detection of CKD: Practice points state to "Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)", and, after incidental abnormalities, to "repeat tests to confirm presence of CKD" when "elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR)" are detected.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^115ue12H]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

A random spot urine sample, collected at any time of the day, is a convenient and minimally burdensome option for clinical practice. However, its results are subject to variability due to factors such as posture, physical activity and dietary protein intake. A first‐morning void, collected immediately upon waking, minimises variability from these factors, making it the preferred method for diagnosing and monitoring albuminuria. This method has a strong correlation with 24‐h albumin excretion and exhibits low intraindividual variability. However, implementation may be challenging, as nephrology offices must provide containers and instructions for home collection. As a practical alternative, early‐morning voids, collected shortly after waking, are acceptable, though they exhibit slightly greater variability.

Urinary albumin concentration can be measured from these samples; however, it varies within individuals due to fluctuations in urine concentration and dilution over time. Since creatinine is excreted at a relatively constant rate per unit of time, it serves as a normalising factor, allowing adjustments for urine tonicity and reducing intraindividual variability. Albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement eliminates the need for timed collections, including 24‐h samples, making ACR a practical alternative for assessing urinary albumin excretion.

### Acute kidney injury associated with endurance events-is it a cause for concern? A systematic review [^113iKac9]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A growing body of evidence suggests even small rises in serum creatinine (SCr) are of considerable clinical relevance. Given that participants in endurance events are exposed to potential (repeated) renal insults, a systematic review was undertaken to collate current evidence for acute kidney injury (AKI), complicating such events.

Methods

A systematic review of studies and case reports meeting inclusion criteria on Medline and EMBASE (inception to October 2015). Included: studies with markers of renal function before and after endurance or ultraendurance events; case reports of severe AKI. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results

Eleven case report publications (n = 27 individuals) of severe AKI, were retrieved, with risk factors including systemic illness or nephrotoxic medications usually identified. From 30 studies of endurance and ultraendurance events, mean rise in SCr was 29 (± 12.3) µmol/L after marathon or ultramarathon (17 studies, n = 568 participants) events. Where follow-up tests were conducted, SCr returned to baseline within 48hours. Rises in biomarkers suggest potential parenchymal insult, rather than simply muscle breakdown. However, evidence of long-term deleterious effects is lacking.

Conclusions

Raised levels of SCr are reported immediately after endurance events. It is not clear whether this is either clinically significant, or if repeated participation predisposes to long-term sequelae. The aetiology of severe exercise-associated AKI is usually multifactorial, with risk factors generally identified in the rare cases reported. On-site biochemistry, urine analysis and biomarkers of AKI may help identify collapsed runners who are at significant short-term risk and allow suitable follow-up.

### Hypoxia is not the primary mechanism contributing to exercise-induced proteinuria [^114dHi9e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Limitations and future directions

The inability to control for extraneous variables (eg, activity, sleep, environmental conditions) as well as low subject numbers were weaknesses of the present study but they are common limitations for such field-based research. Not controlled for were the inter-individual variabilityand between-day variations in α1-AGP excretion which could have impacted results. Future research could be strengthened by incorporating a sea-level control arm that compared post-exercise proteinuria between exercise tests executed 48 hours apart. Benefit could also be gained by using a less complex design and avoiding overlapping factors (eg, acclimatisation status and time course of exercise tests in this case). Lastly, further research is needed in order to confirm the relationship between DBP and 24 hours α1-AGP excretion.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

3 MEASUREMENT

3.1 Measurement technique and urine sample type

Historically, urinary protein assessment relied on measuring 24‐h total protein excretion. Advances in the understanding of kidney disease, as reflected in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guideline, shifted the focus to albuminuria, recognising it as the predominant urinary protein in most kidney diseases. These recommendations have been retained in the updated KDIGO 2024 guidelines, further reinforcing the clinical importance of albuminuria assessment. Measuring urinary albumin, now widely recommended, is a relatively standardised and sensitive procedure that improves the sensitivity, quality and consistency of kidney disease detection and management. Although total protein measurements are less expensive, they lack the sensitivity to detect low but clinically significant levels of albuminuria, leading to their replacement by albumin‐specific assays (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Comparison of albuminuria measurement methods.

Albuminuria can be assessed using semi‐quantitative dipstick tests, particularly in resource‐limited settings. These reagent strips provide a quick, inexpensive and convenient screening method but have limited sensitivity and specificity, partly due to their inability to account for urine concentration or dilution. While these tests may eventually facilitate at‐home monitoring for CKD patients, they should currently be regarded as preliminary tools requiring confirmation through laboratory‐based methods to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective clinical decision‐making.

While 24‐h urine collection is the gold standard for assessing albuminuria due to its ability to account for variations in urine tonicity and the circadian rhythm of urinary albumin excretion, practical limitations often necessitate alternative methods. Although 24‐h urine collections provide comprehensive data, including assessments of muscle mass (via 24‐h creatinine excretion) and dietary intake (sodium and protein intake measured through sodium and urea excretion, respectively), they are labour‐intensive and prone to errors such as incomplete collection. Timed overnight collections are less cumbersome while still covering a reasonable collection interval; however, compliance remains poor compared to spot urine sampling. These challenges have led to the widespread adoption of more practical methods, including random urine samples, first‐morning voids and early‐morning voids.

TABLE 2
KDIGO albuminuria categories in CKD.

The continuous relationship between albuminuria and risk underscores that reference thresholds for ACR are not absolute disease indicators but rather markers within a spectrum of risk. Current albuminuria cut‐offs serve as practical benchmarks but lack the precision derived from prospective intervention studies needed to define optimal values, as has been done for blood pressure. Consequently, albuminuria thresholds should be regarded as global tools for guiding clinical decision‐making rather than definitive disease markers.

3.3 Variability

Albuminuria exhibits significant day‐to‐day variability within individuals due to fluctuations in blood pressure, exercise, diet and posture. Although these factors contribute to variability, they account for only a small fraction of its overall magnitude. This variability affects diagnostic consistency, as an individual's albuminuria status may fluctuate across days, potentially crossing diagnostic thresholds. Abnormal values should therefore be confirmed on at least one separate occasion to definitively establish increased albuminuria. Furthermore, according to KDIGO guidelines, chronicity must be demonstrated to diagnose CKD. This requires evidence of persistent abnormalities over at least 3 months, necessitating repeat ACR measurements beyond this period. Abnormal results at a single time point should not be assumed to reflect CKD, as they may indicate transient conditions such as acute kidney injury or acute kidney disease.

Within‐individual variability in albuminuria also complicates the assessment of therapeutic efficacy. Short‐term changes in ACR following the initiation of albuminuria‐lowering drugs may partly reflect random fluctuations rather than true treatment effects. This variability poses challenges in interpreting drug responses. Therefore, repeated measurements during the early phase of treatment are essential to distinguish genuine drug effects from background variability. Individualised monitoring is crucial for optimising therapeutic regimens, including dose adjustments and the addition of adjunctive therapies, to achieve target reductions in albuminuria. Long‐term disease monitoring must also account for ACR variability. Changes in ACR should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of disease progression or remission without confirmatory testing and consideration of the clinical context. Misinterpreting single measurements may lead to premature treatment adjustments or misclassification of prognosis, which should be avoided.

In clinical trials, it is also crucial to account for this day‐to‐day variability of albuminuria when evaluating treatment effects. Previous studies have demonstrated that collecting multiple urine samples per individual across several study visits significantly improves the statistical power to detect an intervention's effect size on albuminuria. This approach reduces the required sample size for intervention trials and decreases screen failure rates caused by variability‐driven misclassification.

### Effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111M69m6]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Underlying mechanisms of exercise training and proteinuria

Although the mechanisms of exercise training and their effects on proteinuria are inconsistent, some hypotheses may explain the positive association. The production of proteinuria is associated with low inflammation and impaired endothelial function. A potential mechanism is that the decrease in proteinuria level is potentially related to the reduction of hypersensitivity in C-reactive protein and IL-6 and the decrease of oxidative stress. An experimental study based on CKD that used combined spontaneous hypertension rates confirmed this view. Moreover, exercise training has been shown to protect the vascular endothelial cells in cardiovascular patients, which is a crucial mechanism for low levels of proteinuria and a low incidence of cardiovascular disease in CKD patients. Furthermore, one author reported that aerobic exercise could significantly improve the levels of transforming growth factor beta and BB (platelet-derived growth factor BB) in CKD patients, thus contributing to the survival of CKD residual renal cells and fundamentally improving the kidney function of CKD patients, thereby reducing proteinuria.

Indeed, a decrease in blood pressure contributes to the reduction of proteinuria, potentially due to the decrease of renal hyperperfusion, high filtration rate, and selective permeability of the glomerular filtration membrane. It is well known that RAAS drugs can effectively reduce the level of proteinuria whilst lowering the blood pressure. In the included studies, more than 52% of the CKD patients were complicated by hypertension, but the exact number of patients taking RAAS drugs were not given clearly. It is worth noting that several studies reported a decrease in blood pressure, but most studies did not analyze the effects of RAAS drugs and changes in blood pressure on proteinuria in detail, which might have caused confusion on whether there is a real exercise effect on proteinuria. Therefore, to confirm whether exercise has an effect on proteinuria, the factors involved in changes in proteinuria levels should be clarified.

These mechanisms seem to support that exercise training can reduce proteinuria, but the effect sizes reviewed in this study may not be clinically significant because the positive results are limited to their before exercise and after exercise comparison or are derived from the total effect of high heterogeneity. This may be because the sample size included in this study was too small, and the intervention time was not long enough to observe changes in proteinuria-related indicators.

### Hypoxia is not the primary mechanism contributing to exercise-induced proteinuria [^1149bfNL]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that post-exercise α1-AGP is (1) more related to exercise intensity than degree of hypoxia or BP and (2) possibly influenced by activation or inhibition of AT1 receptors. Losartan may limit post-exercise proteinuria by helping to maintain the charge-selectivity function in the glomerular filter, although further investigations are required for evaluation.

### Do the high-protein recommendations for athletes set some on a path to kidney injury and dialysis? [^114vzsBb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Athletes and fitness enthusiasts are often encouraged to follow high-protein diets to optimize muscle protein synthesis, modify body composition, and enhance performance, yet the safety of these higher protein intakes has been debated. Many people with kidney dysfunction are unaware of their condition, and the potential harm of excess protein intake on the kidneys may not be adequately reported in the sports nutrition literature. Studies suggesting that high-protein intake may be associated with incident kidney disease have led the nephrology community to make conservative recommendations. In contrast, the fitness community suggests that high dietary protein intake is safe and poses no risk of kidney injury. These claims often fail to acknowledge limitations in the internal validity and generalizability of the study results, despite many studies not being adequately powered to support such claims. It is essential to make dietary recommendations that consider the totality of the data and follow the ethical norm of "do no harm". Studies that evaluate the use of high-protein diets among athletes must consider the balance of efficacy with safety. While an intervention may be safe in one population, it does not mean that safety can be assumed for all groups.

### Screening, identifying, and treating chronic kidney disease: why, who, when, how, and what? [^1148AzFB]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The former gold-standard for detection and quantification of albuminuria is a 24-hour urine collection, which is cumbersome and subject to over and under collection. Instead, measuring a spot uACR correlates well with the 24-hour excretion and is currently recommended for routine practice. Urinary albumin concentration can be increased by physical activity, fever, stress, metabolic perturbations, and other conditions, making first-morning samples optimal. Given the variability in albumin excretion, confirming elevated uACR with repeat testing should be emphasized. The uACR is in the process of being standardized.

While quantitative tests for albuminuria are standard, semi-quantitative approaches have been studied because they may reduce costs, expand access to clinics without laboratory services, and are point-of-care which may allow for immediate identification for clinical counseling and treatment decisions. When studied, semi-quantitative tests have shown reasonable sensitivity, but do not match the quantitative uACR. Given their potential benefits for expansion of access, semi-quantitative is a reasonable screening test in the absence of quantitative uACR availability. Semiquantitative or qualitative screening tests should be positive in > 85% of individuals with A2 or moderately increased albuminuria to be useful for patient screening. A recent international CKD screening review addressed differing approaches to screening versus case finding in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries with considerations including less expensive urine protein dipstick testing in low-income countries versus a broader population screened with eGFR and uACR and increased interval of screening in high-income countries. Highly motivated and high socioeconomic status individuals will likely prefer additional screening tests with increased frequency, but the benefits of this approach have not been clearly demonstrated. The focus of this review is the impact of the minimum standard screening to overcome potential inequities in CKD care that may be driven by lower uACR testing among individuals with risk conditions and low neighborhood income and low education level that were shown in a recent U.S. study of over 7 million adults with diabetes. See Table 3 for a comparison of the various tests for urinary proteins.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

### Effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LyCH6]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rehabilitation effects of exercise training on adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been generally recognised; however, the effects of exercise training on proteinuria have been underexplored. Our aim was to explore the effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult CKD patients without renal replacement therapy.

Methods

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies examining the effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adults CKD patients without renal replacement therapy were searched in 10 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, SPORTDiscus with full text, Web of Science, China Wan Fang Database, China National Knowledge Internet, China Science and Technology Journal Database) until June 2019. The quality of quasi-experimental studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for non-randomised experimental studies. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the RCT quality.

Results

We analysed 11 studies (623 participants). The 24-h urinary protein (24h UP) level significantly decreased after exercise training in the within-group analysis (standard mean difference [SMD], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08 to 0.88). There was a slight decrease in 24h UP levels in the between-group analysis (SMD, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.00 to 1.82); however, the subgroup analysis showed that the change was insignificant (RCT: SMD, 0.24; 95% CI, -0.44 to 0.92; quasi-experimental studies: SMD, 2.50; 95% CI, -1.22 to 6.23). Exercise resulted in no significant differences in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the between-group analysis (SMD, 0.06; 95% CI, -0.54 to 0.67), but a significant decrease was found in the within-group analysis (SMD, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.38). No evidence of a decreased urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio was found after exercise (between-group analysis: SMD, 0.08 and 95% CI, -0.33 to 0.48; within-group analysis: SMD, 0.04; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.32).

Conclusion

Exercise training does not aggravate proteinuria in adult CKD patients without renal replacement therapy. Further research is warranted in the future to determine the effectiveness of exercise training on proteinuria and to explore the mechanisms by which exercise training influences proteinuria.

### New insights into the significance of microalbuminuria [^1156CbiU]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent work that has explored the association between microalbuminuria and adverse clinical outcomes in the presence and absence of diabetes.

Recent Findings

Recent investigations have documented the prevalence of microalbuminuria in the general community and have also highlighted the continuous relationship between the level of urinary albumin excretion and clinical endpoints. Even below traditional microalbuminuria thresholds, urinary albumin levels appear to correlate with clinical outcomes. Microalbuminuria is becoming increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. At least for subjects with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, intensive, multifactorial interventions can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by about 50%. Although several studies have found an association between microalbuminuria and surrogate measurements of vascular disease, the exact molecular mechanisms linking an increase in urinary albumin excretion and vascular disease are still unknown. Microalbuminuria also has a well-documented association with progressive diabetic renal disease but recent studies have suggested that the prognostic significance of microalbuminuria in this regard may not be as powerful as originally reported.

Summary

Aggressive, multifactorial interventions, including the use of drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system are strongly recommended for patients with diabetes and micro-albuminuria to ameliorate the progression of renal and vascular complications. This approach should also possibly apply to microalbuminuric subjects without diabetes. The relationship between microalbuminuria and progressive diabetic renal disease requires re-evaluation given temporal trends in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.

### Association of single measurement of dipstick proteinuria with physical performance of military males: the CHIEF study [^111NdHmf]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Proteinuria, a marker of kidney injury, may be related to skeletal muscle loss. Whether the severity of proteinuria is associated with physical performance is unclear.

Methods

We examined the association of proteinuria severity with physical performance cross-sectionally in 3357 military young males, free of chronic kidney disease, from the cardiorespiratory fitness and hospitalization events in armed Forces (CHIEF) study in Taiwan. The grades of proteinuria were classified according to one dipstick urinalysis which were collected at morning after an 8-h fast as unremarkable (0, +/−, and 1+), moderate (2+) and severe (3+ and 4+). Aerobic physical performance was evaluated by time for a 3000-m run and anaerobic physical performance was evaluated by numbers of 2-min sit-ups and 2-min push-ups, separately. Multiple linear regressions were used to determine the relationship.

Results

As compared with unremarkable proteinuria, moderate and severe proteinuria were dose-dependently correlated with 3000-m running time (β: 4.74 (95% confidence intervals (CI): − 0.55, 10.02) and 7.63 (95% CI: 3.21, 12.05), respectively), and inversely with numbers of 2-min push-ups (β = − 1.13 (− 1.97, − 0.29), and − 1.00 (− 1.71, − 0.28), respectively) with adjustments for age, service specialty, body mass index, blood pressure, alcohol intake, smoking, fasting plasma glucose, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and physical activity. However, there was no association between proteinuria severity and 2-min sit-ups.

Conclusions

Our findings show a relationship of dipstick proteinuria with aerobic physical performance and parts of anaerobic physical performance in military healthy males. This mechanism is not fully understood and requires further investigations.

### Primary care approach to proteinuria [^114Jxx65]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common finding in primary care practice. Most adolescents who are diagnosed with proteinuria through screening urinalysis do not have renal disease, and the proteinuria will usually resolve on repeat testing. In contrast, proteinuria is suggestive of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, primary renal disease, or other systemic illnesses. Quantification of proteinuria can be used longitudinally to monitor therapeutic effects of treatment of the underlying disease. Given the multitude of clinical settings in which proteinuria can occur, we suggest an algorithm that may help clinicians differentiate between benign and serious etiologies of proteinuria.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^112mxsCD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The term microalbuminuria was introduced in 1981 by Viberti, Parving and Svendsen and colleaguesto describe urinary albumin excretion levels below the detection threshold of standard dipstick tests but predictive of progression to overt proteinuria, particularly in patients with diabetes. Initially defined as a urinary albumin excretion of 20–200 μg/min or 30–300 mg/24 h, it quickly gained recognition as a critical prognostic marker. Although microalbuminuria was widely accepted as a risk marker for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or without diabetes, the term has since been abandoned due to its misleading implication that small or abnormal albumin molecules were being excreted in urine, as well as the potential for misinterpreting microalbuminuria as clinically insignificant. Furthermore, emerging evidence demonstrated that any detectable albuminuria, even within 'normal' ranges, is associated with an increased risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting a continuous relationship between albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes. This pattern parallels findings in blood pressure, where even high‐normal levels (a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 130 mHg) are associated with elevated risk. Advances in the understanding of albumin heterogeneity, including the presence of albumin fragments and modified forms in urine, further challenged the validity of the term. Consequently, microalbuminuria has been removed from clinical and laboratory nomenclature and replaced by standardised, more quantitative terms, such as moderately and severely increased albuminuria.

### Hypoxia is not the primary mechanism contributing to exercise-induced proteinuria [^112qFv9P]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Proteinuria increases at altitude and with exercise, potentially as a result of hypoxia. Using urinary alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) levels as a sensitive marker of proteinuria, we examined the impact of relative hypoxia due to high altitude and blood pressure-lowering medication on post-exercise proteinuria.

Methods

Twenty individuals were pair-matched for sex, age and ACE genotype. They completed maximal exercise tests once at sea level and twice at altitude (5035 m). Losartan (100 mg/day; angiotensin-receptor blocker) and placebo were randomly assigned within each pair 21 days before ascent. The first altitude exercise test was completed within 24–48 hours of arrival (each pair within ~1hour). Acetazolamide (125mg two times per day) was administrated immediately after this test for 48hours until the second altitude exercise test.

Results

With placebo, post-exercise α1-AGP levels were similar at sea level and altitude. Odds ratio (OR) for increased resting α1-AGP at altitude versus sea level was greater without losartan (2.16 times greater). At altitude, OR for reduced post-exercise α1-AGP (58% lower) was higher with losartan than placebo (2.25 times greater, p = 0.059) despite similar pulse oximetry (SpO₂) (p = 0.95) between groups. Acetazolamide reduced post-exercise proteinuria by approximately threefold (9.3 ± 9.7 vs 3.6 ± 6.0 μg/min; p = 0.025) although changes were not correlated (r = -0.10) with significant improvements in SpO₂ (69.1% ± 4.5% vs 75.8% ± 3.8%; p = 0.001).

Discussion

Profound systemic hypoxia imposed by altitude does not result in greater post-exercise proteinuria than sea level. Losartan and acetazolamide may attenuate post-exercise proteinuria, however further research is warranted.

### Exercise-induced albuminuria increases over time in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism [^115B9Ayj]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study is that patients with diabetes and/or elevated fasting blood glucose increase their exercise-induced urinary albumin excretion over time. Metabolic dysfunction was associated with consistent elevated levels of exercise induced albuminuria in a cohort of young and apparently healthy individuals without overt kidney disease.

Excessive urinary albumin excretion following exercise has been reported in patients with metabolic syndrome, including patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. We present here, for the first time, a prospective study that characterizes EiA variation over time in patients with and without metabolic dysfunction. Our findings show that EiA levels are relatively stable among healthy individuals and do not change significantly over a mean follow-up period of 3 years. However, metabolic dysfunction, and more specifically impaired glucose metabolism seems to drive an increase in urinary albumin excretion following exercise which continues to elevate over time. These differences between patients with and without altered glucose metabolism were not seen using standard rest albuminuria measurements which stayed relatively stable during follow up.

The current study is in line with our past reports on urinary albumin excretion following exercise and its association with multiple risk factors for CVD. Measuring EiA is a potential new sensitive and early biomarker for the kidney's "reservoir capacities", endothelial dysfunction and other metabolic related end organ damage. Results of future reports from this study cohort and others on the ability of EiA to predict major renal and cardiovascular events are highly anticipated. Whether EiA measurements provide additional clinical utility in stratifying risk as opposed to standard rest UACR calculations is still unknown.

A reduction in albuminuria is related to favorable cardiovascular and renal outcomes, especially in patients with diabetes. While novel treatment strategies for cardio-renal outcomes such as SGLT-2 inhibitors are effective in lowering rest albuminuria, their effect on exercise induced excretion of albumin is not entirely clear. We suggest that monitoring exercise induced levels of albuminuria may serve as a screening tool for pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals who require early initiation of such renal protective therapies.

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and checklist (see Additional file 1).

Search strategy

The Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using Ovid SP. SPORTDiscus with full text and CINAHL were searched using the EBSCO host. A search of the Web of Science electronic databases (Science and Social Science Citation Index) was also conducted. Moreover, three Chinese databases, including the China Wan Fang Database, China National Knowledge Internet, and China Science and Technology Journal Database, were searched. The retrieval time was from the establishment of the database to June 2019.

By considering a broad range of phrases and terms used in the definitions related to CKD, exercise training, and proteinuria, we combined text words and Medical Subject Headings terms to search related terms, synonyms, and abbreviations. These include CKD, kidney insufficiency, chronic renal failure, exercise, physical activity, swimming, proteinuria, albuminuria, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and others. Furthermore, all references of the included studies were scanned manually to identify additional articles not found by our search. Only studies written in English or Chinese were included. The search strategy is outlined in Additional file (see Additional file 2).

### Prevention of cardiorenal damage: importance of albuminuria [^115ucSwj]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is projected to become a leading global cause of death by 2040, and its early detection is critical for effective and timely management. The current definition of CKD identifies only advanced stages, when kidney injury has already destroyed > 50% of functioning kidney mass as reflected by an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio > six-fold higher than physiological levels (i.e. > 30 mg/g). An elevated urinary albumin-excretion rate is a known early predictor of future cardiovascular events. There is thus a 'blind spot' in the detection of CKD, when kidney injury is present but is undetectable by current diagnostic criteria, and no intervention is made before renal and cardiovascular damage occurs. The present review discusses the CKD 'blind spot' concept and how it may facilitate a holistic approach to CKD and cardiovascular disease prevention and implement the call for albuminuria screening implicit in current guidelines. Cardiorenal risk associated with albuminuria in the high-normal range, novel genetic and biochemical markers of elevated cardiorenal risk, and the role of heart and kidney protective drugs evaluated in recent clinical trials are also discussed. As albuminuria is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, starting from levels not yet considered in the definition of CKD, the implementation of opportunistic or systematic albuminuria screening and therapy, possibly complemented with novel early biomarkers, has the potential to improve cardiorenal outcomes and mitigate the dismal 2040 projections for CKD and related cardiovascular burden.

### Methods for diagnosing proteinuria-when to use which test and why: a review [^116ecPJu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria plays a central role in the diagnosis of kidney disease and has a high prognostic value. The test methods used differ considerably regarding their impact on test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Therefore, knowledge of the methodology is crucial for the interpretation of the results. In addition to the distinction between semiquantitative and quantitative tests, there are also relevant differences within the 2 methods. In general, semiquantitative tests are easy to handle but have limitations such as incomplete quantification, a lack of specificity regarding the type of proteinuria, and a high rate of false-positive results that require retesting with a quantitative method for verification. In contrast, quantitative methods, especially immunoassays, have the advantages of high test accuracy and the possibility of targeted detection of specific protein molecules in addition to albumin. However, these methods are more expensive and require access to a laboratory or an electronic point-of-care device. In this Review, the different types of tests for proteinuria and their underlying methodologies and strengths and weaknesses are discussed in detail to allow a rational decision of use and the correct interpretation of the results depending on the clinical context.

Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement — factors affecting urinary ACR span preanalytical, biological, storage, non-renal creatinine variation, and analytical domains, including transient elevation in albuminuria from menstrual blood contamination, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), exercise, upright posture (orthostatic proteinuria), or other conditions increasing vascular permeability; intraindividual variability such as intrinsic biological and genetic variability; degradation of albumin before analysis; non-renal causes of variability in creatinine excretion such as age, race, muscle mass, and gender; non-steady state for creatinine in acute kidney injury (AKI); and analytical issues such as creatinine excess ("prozone") effect where samples with very high concentrations of albumin may be reported as low or normal using some assays.

### Cardiovascular implications of proteinuria: an indicator of chronic kidney disease [^1125fo7H]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria, defined as urine protein excretion greater than 300 mg over 24 h, is a strong and independent predictor of increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with and without diabetes. Proteinuria is a sign of persistent dysfunction of the glomerular barrier and often precedes any detectable decline in renal filtration function. Measurement of proteinuria is important in stratifying the risk for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease progression. A variety of basic pathophysiologic mechanisms that can partially explain simultaneous renal and cardiac disease will be discussed in this Review. In addition to being a prognostic marker, proteinuria is being considered as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular medicine. Therapeutic strategies for amelioration of proteinuria by achieving blood pressure targets, glycemic control in diabetes, treatment of hyperlipidemia, and reducing dietary salt and protein intake are also reviewed in this paper. Future clinical studies are needed to assess if proteinuria reduction should be a target of treatment to reduce the burden of end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and improve survival in this high-risk population.

### Renal alterations during exercise [^115Dx4Dc]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria and hematuria are common during exercise. Proteinuria is usually due to glomerular or tubular changes or to an excessive production of protein as in myeloma. Certain clinical conditions can, however, result in a functional or temporary proteinuria, especially during pregnancy, fever, orthostasis, or following physical activity. Sport-related proteinuria following marching, exercise, and stress, was first observed in soldiers after long marching. Prevalence of proteinuria during exercise ranges from 18% up to 100% depending on type of exercise and its intensity. A higher incidence of proteinuria has been observed in some sports requiring great exercise intensity and it is certainly related to muscular work intensity and would decrease after prolonged training. Indeed, exercise-induced proteinuria is strictly related to exercise intensity rather than to exercise duration. Exercise aggravates the proteinuria of various nephropathies and that of renal transplant recipients. The prevalence of hematuria is higher in the athletic than the general population and the main difference is that sport-related hematuria resolves spontaneously after physical exercise while hematuria found in nonathletic population can be chronic. Sport-induced hematuria is influenced by exercise duration and intensity. Among the mechanisms underlying the exercise induced hematuria are increased body temperature, hemolysis, increased production of free radicals, and excessive release of catecholamines. Lactic acidosis, generated during anaerobic conditions, causes the passage of erythrocytes into the urine, through increased glomerular permeability.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113rzxmp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — assessment with urine albumin and estimated GFR: Screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot urine collection, with albuminuria categories defined as " < 30 mg/g creatinine", " ≥ 30–300 mg/g creatinine", and " ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine". Because of high biological variability of " > 20%", two of three UACR specimens collected within a "3-to 6-month" period should be abnormal before considering moderately or severely elevated albuminuria, and transient factors such as "Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, and marked hypertension may elevate UACR independently of kidney damage". For kidney function, "eGFR persistence < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or an urinary albumin value of > 30 mg/g of creatinine is considered abnormal", the CKD-EPI creatinine equation "was refit without the race variable and should be used for everyone", and "increased use of cystatin C… is suggested in combination with serum creatinine" because combining markers "is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone".

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^111ZAZ8y]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### Testing for chronic kidney disease: a position statement from the National Kidney Foundation [^1143hH3P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in the United States. The estimated prevalence of CKD in US adults was 11.7% ± 0.8% in 2000, based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Global estimates for CKD prevalence are less certain, but recent studies in Europe, Australia, and China suggest a high prevalence. The most common risk factors for CKD include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, a family history of CKD, and age greater than 60 years. Major outcomes of CKD include progression to kidney failure, development of complications of impaired kidney function, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. CKD is usually silent until its late stages, thus many patients with CKD are detected only shortly before the onset of symptomatic kidney failure, when there are few opportunities to prevent adverse outcomes. Earlier detection allows for more time for evaluation and treatment but requires explicit testing strategies for asymptomatic individuals at increased risk. In the majority of patients, CKD can be detected with 2 simple tests: a urine test for the detection of proteinuria and a blood test to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These 2 tests facilitate detection of CKD by all physicians by allowing for identification of CKD without first requiring determination of its cause. Understanding the strengths and limitations of CKD testing is critical for appropriate implementation of these recommendations. Application of CKD testing in national and international screening and surveillance programs could improve public health related to CKD.

### Early change in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for kidney disease progression: an individual patient meta-analysis [^111DTC1u]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is controversial whether proteinuria is a valid surrogate end point for randomized trials in chronic kidney disease.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of individual patient-level data.

Setting & Population

Individual patient data for 9,008 patients from 32 randomized trials evaluating 5 intervention types.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials of kidney disease progression until 2007 with measurements of proteinuria both at baseline and during the first year of follow-up, with at least 1 further year of follow-up for the clinical outcome.

Predictor

Early change in proteinuria.

Outcomes

Doubling of serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.

Results

Early decline in proteinuria was associated with lower risk of the clinical outcome (pooled HR, 0.74 per 50% reduction in proteinuria); this association was stronger at higher levels of baseline proteinuria. Pooled estimates for the proportion of treatment effect on the clinical outcome explained by early decline in proteinuria ranged from -7.0% (95%CI, -40.6% to 26.7%) to 43.9% (95%CI, 25.3% to 62.6%) across 5 intervention types. The direction of the pooled treatment effects on early change in proteinuria agreed with the direction of the treatment effect on the clinical outcome for all 5 intervention types, with the magnitudes of the pooled treatment effects on the 2 end points agreeing for 4 of the 5 intervention types. The pooled treatment effects on both end points were simultaneously stronger at higher levels of proteinuria. However, statistical power was insufficient to determine whether differences in treatment effects on the clinical outcome corresponded to differences in treatment effects on proteinuria between individual studies.

Limitations

Limited variety of interventions tested and low statistical power for many chronic kidney disease clinical trials.

Conclusions

These results provide new evidence supporting the use of an early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate end point, but do not provide sufficient evidence to establish its validity in all settings.

### The significance of trace proteinuria [^112EcnHv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of a trace protein reading on urinalysis is unclear, and such a result is often ignored by the clinician.

Methods

We examined 185 samples of urine with trace proteinuria by both Chemstrips and sulfosalicylic acid testing, and compared the results with those of urinary albumin and total protein concentrations.

Results

Taking for the purposes of this study an arbitrary upper limit of normal of 20 mg/l for albumin and 100 mg/l for total protein concentration, we found abnormal albumin excretion in 87% and abnormal total protein excretion in 88% of trace samples. In this study, a negative urinalysis for protein excluded microalbuminuria in 87% and proteinuria in 78% of cases.

Conclusion

Qualitative testing for protein by urinalysis has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing or ruling out microalbuminuria. Trace proteinuria usually means microalbuminuria; negative proteinuria tends to rule it out.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^115uJsQ9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

### Effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FZNKz]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Proteinuria is a marker of renal damage and a predictor of the progress of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 2012 guidelines for CKD explicitly mentioned the reduction of proteinuria as one of the markers of CKD staging. The proteinuria level is an important predictor of disease progression, which is closely related to the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, some studies found that proteinuria can be used as a therapeutic target or endpoint for the clinical treatment and prevention of cardiovascular complications, especially for patients with high proteinuria levels.

Exercise training has been recommended for patients with CKD by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes. A substantial number of meta-analyses summarised the positive impacts of regular exercise programs for adults with CKD on physical performance, cardiopulmonary function, blood lipids, and quality of life. A review suggested that high levels of physical activity appeared to be closely related to low proteinuria, and a cross-sectional study of non-diabetic women had similar results. Afshinnia et al. confirmed that exercise training can reduce proteinuria in obese people, although its long-term effect has not been confirmed by high-quality experimental studies. However, the sedentary time of patients with CKD, especially those with severe renal function impairment, is still significantly higher than that of individuals without CKD. Glavinovic et al. reported that sedentary time of CKD was 10-times higher than that of individuals without CKD. Indeed, exercise is not a routine clinical treatment, and most CKD patients are worried about the safety of exercise, because sometimes high-intensity exercise can induce proteinuria. A study has shown that strenuous exercise can increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the blood concentration of catecholamine, thus increasing the permeability of glomerular capillary membrane, which leads to proteinuria. Nevertheless, it seems that proteinuria returns to normal levels after 2 h of exercise.

No consensus has been achieved regarding the effect of exercise training on proteinuria in adult CKD patients without renal replacement therapy. Specific exercise programs for CKD are still being explored. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies to determine the effects of exercise training on proteinuria and to explore the effects of different exercise intensities on proteinuria in adult CKD patients without renal replacement therapy.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114UVqwL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria as a surrogate marker — KDOQI notes that relationships between glomerular structural lesions and the presence or absence of microalbuminuria in diabetes are not straightforward, intrapatient variability in albuminuria measurements is large with controversy about standardization, and therefore the evidence for using albuminuria as a surrogate marker for clinical outcomes was not sufficiently strong to merit a guideline statement.

### Proteinuria in children: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1117Ns7Y]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Although proteinuria is usually benign in the form of transient or orthostatic proteinuria, persistent proteinuria may be associated with more serious renal diseases. Proteinuria may be an independent risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease in children. Mechanisms of proteinuria can be categorized as glomerular, tubular, secretory, or overflow. A history, a physical examination, and laboratory tests help determine the cause. Transient (functional) proteinuria is temporary. It can occur with fever, exercise, stress, or cold exposure, and it resolves when the inciting factor is removed. Orthostatic proteinuria is the most common type in children, especially in adolescent males. It is a benign condition without clinical significance. Persistent proteinuria can be glomerular or tubulointerstitial in origin. The urine dipstick test is the most widely used screening method. Although a 24-hour urine protein excretion test is usually recommended for quantitation of the amount of protein excreted in the urine, it may be impractical in children. A spot, first-morning urine test for a protein-to-creatinine or protein-to-osmolality ratio is a reliable substitute. Treatment of proteinuria should be directed at the underlying cause. Patients with active urinary sediments, hematuria, hypertension, hypocomplementemia, renal insufficiency with depressed glomerular filtration rate, or signs and symptoms suggestive of vasculitic disease may require referral to a pediatric nephrologist and a renal biopsy.

### Time to abandon microalbuminuria? [^115HyvzB]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The term microalbuminuria — a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) between 20 and 200 microg/min — has been introduced to identify subjects at increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between albuminuria and risk is not restricted to the microalbuminuric range and extends to as low as 2–5 microg/min. On the contrary, the increase of UAE above 200 microg/min (macroalbuminuria) heralds the onset of proteinuria (urinary protein excretion above 0.5 g/24 h) and progressive renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria is a component of the metabolic syndrome and may represent a marker of the increased risk of renal and cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Proteinuria is a sign of established kidney damage and plays a direct pathogenic role in the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria reflects functional and potentially reversible abnormalities initiated by glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, a size-selective dysfunction of the glomerular barrier normally associated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline that may result in end-stage renal disease. Thus, the limit of 200 microg/min segregates patients with albuminuria or proteinuria who are at quite different risk. Among subjects with albuminuria, however, there is a continuous relationship between albumin excretion and risk and no lower bound between normal albuminuria and microalbuminuria can be identified that segregates subjects at different risk. Thus, the terms microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria could be replaced by the concepts of albuminuria- and proteinuria-associated diseases. Future studies are needed to identify levels of albuminuria below which therapy is no longer beneficial.

### Screening, monitoring, and treatment of albuminuria: public health perspectives [^1131uyvj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria is an early sign of progressive cardiovascular and renal disease in individuals with and without diabetes. Despite compelling data, at present only a minority of patients with diabetes and rarely individuals without diabetes are screened for albuminuria in a systematic way. All of the criteria to implement systematic albuminuria screening are fulfilled in diabetes, and most are nearly fulfilled for microalbuminuria screening in individuals without diabetes. Because of the growing evidence that treatment of microalbuminuria in individuals without diabetes may offer a cost-effective benefit to prevent cardiovascular disease, nephrologists and other health care providers should pay more attention to the early detection and subsequent treatment of individuals with microalbuminuria.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^116Y8ZW1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Since its discovery, albuminuria measurement has undergone remarkable advancements, evolving from a rudimentary diagnostic tool to a pivotal biomarker in nephrology and cardiovascular medicine. Today, albuminuria can be measured with reasonable accuracy, and upcoming standardisation in measurement techniques and pre‐analytical protocols will further improve its reliability and clinical applicability. Despite these advancements, albuminuria screening remains under‐utilised in clinical practice. While population‐based screening may not yet be justified, routine albuminuria assessment should at least be incorporated into laboratory panels to provide a comprehensive cardiovascular risk profile — a practice that is rarely implemented today. Even among high‐risk individuals, such as those with diabetes or hypertension, albuminuria is insufficiently measured, limiting its potential to guide treatment and improve patient outcomes. Greater integration of albuminuria testing into routine clinical practice is therefore pivotal. Beyond its established role in CKD management, albuminuria has also become a key parameter for risk stratification and therapy selection. Recommendations for use in clinical practice are summarised in Table 4. The data presented in this review clearly demonstrate that albuminuria has emerged as a key biomarker for the detection, prognostication, surveillance and treatment optimisation of both kidney and cardiovascular disease.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^117ErQGq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing and confirmation states, "We suggest using the following measurements for initial testing of proteinuria (in descending order of preference, in all cases an early morning urine sample is preferred) (2B); 1) urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR); 2) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR); 3) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading; 4) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading". It further specifies, "We recommend that clinical laboratories report ACR and PCR in untimed urine samples in addition to albumin concentration or protein concentrations rather than concentrations alone. (1B)" and "The term microalbumin should no longer be used by laboratories. (Not Graded)". For confirmation, it directs, "Confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to creatinine whenever possible", "Confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent early morning urine sample", and "If a more accurate estimate of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure albumin excretion rate or total protein excretion rate in a timed urine sample". When non-albumin proteins are suspected, it adds, "If significant non-albumin proteinuria is suspected, use assays for specific urine proteins (e.g., α1-microglobulin, monoclonal heavy or light chains, [known in some countries as "Bence Jones" proteins]). (Not Graded)".

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1126ZMbV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical application

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. When considering pre-eclampsia, one would wish a replacement test (stand alone) to limit the number of false negative results, as these women run the risk of developing undetected pre-eclampsia with a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity. If protein to creatinine ratio were to be used as a triage test, with patients who test positive going on to have a 24 hour urine collection to verify the significant proteinuria, then false negatives need to be minimised but false positives will be identified by the second test, so sensitivity can be maximised at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis relate to the accuracy of protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level (that is, averaged across all studies). Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, so the performance of protein to creatinine ratio in an individual study setting may be somewhat different from the summary results presented here. Further research needs to identify the causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy across studies (for example, method of measurement, inaccurate reference standards) and identify those circumstances in which protein to creatinine ratio performs consistently well.

Prevalence of proteinuria also varied considerably across studies and has a big effect on how a protein to creatinine ratio test could be used. Following the protein to creatinine test, high positive and negative predictive values above 0.85 are achieved when the prevalence is high (for example, 0.8; see appendix E). However, when the prevalence is low (for example, 0.2; see appendix C), the negative predictive value remains above 0.85 but positive predictive value is then around 0.4. Thus a negative protein to creatinine ratio remains a good test for ruling out significant proteinuria, but positive tests results may have a high rate of false positives in this low prevalence population. Clinicians thus need to know the prevalence of significant proteinuria in the population and setting under investigation to allow accurate interpretation of the test results

### Can young adult patients with proteinuric IgA nephropathy perform physical exercise? [^116AMSEa]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

It is not known whether physical exercise increases daily proteinuria in patients with proteinuric nephropathies, thus accelerating progression of the renal lesion. This study evaluates the acute effects of physical exercise on proteinuria in young adults with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy.

Methods

Changes induced by intense physical exercise on quantitative and qualitative proteinuria were evaluated in basal conditions and after 10 days of ramipril therapy in 10 patients with IgA nephropathy, normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria between 0.8 and 1.49 g/24 h, and "glomerular" microhematuria before and after the end of a maximal treadmill Bruce test (B-test). The basal study also was performed in 10 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers.

Results

At rest, GFR averaged 141 ± 23 mL/min; it increased by 16.3% ± 3.3% (P < 0.005) and 7.1% ± 1.6% at 60 and 120 minutes after the B-test, respectively. At rest, GFR-corrected proteinuria averaged protein of 0.76 ± 0.21 mg/min/100 mL GFR; it increased to 1.55 ± 0.28 mg/min/100 mL GFR after 60 minutes (P < 0.001) and declined to 0.60 ± 0.11 mg/min/100 mL GFR at 120 minutes after the end of the B-test. The pattern of urinary proteins remained unchanged, as did microhematuria. Daily proteinuria was not different from the basal value on the day of the B-test. After ramipril therapy, patients showed a reduction in GFR, but no change in daily GFR-corrected proteinuria, pattern of urinary proteins, or hematuria.

Conclusion

The increase in proteinuria after exercise in our patients is significant and is not prevented by ramipril therapy, but lasts less than 120 minutes. Therefore, it cannot modify daily proteinuria. Thus, these data do not support the need to reduce acute physical activity in patients with nonnephrotic renal diseases.

### Proteinuria during pregnancy: definition, pathophysiology, methodology, and clinical significance [^116a6eU2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative measurement of urine protein excretion is one of the most common tests performed during pregnancy. For more than 100 years, proteinuria was necessary for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, but recent guidelines recommend that proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary for the diagnosis. Still, in clinical practice, most patients with gestational hypertension will be diagnosed as having preeclampsia based on the presence of proteinuria. Although the reference standard for measuring urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for proteinuria. Urine dipstick screening for proteinuria does not provide any clinical benefit and should not be used to diagnose proteinuria. The classic cutoff cited to define proteinuria during pregnancy is a value of > 300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of at least 0.3. Using this cutoff, the rate of isolated proteinuria in pregnancy may reach 8%, whereas preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 8% of pregnancies. Although this threshold is widely accepted, its origin is not based on evidence on adverse pregnancy outcomes but rather on expert opinion and results of small studies. After reviewing the available data, the most important factor that influences maternal and neonatal outcome is the severity of blood pressures and presence of end organ damage, rather than the excess protein excretion. Because the management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is almost identical in frequency of surveillance and timing of delivery, the separation into 2 disorders is unnecessary. If the management of women with gestational hypertension with a positive assessment of proteinuria will not change, we believe that urine assessment for proteinuria is unnecessary in women who develop new-onset blood pressure at or after 20 weeks' gestation. Furthermore, we do not recommend repeated measurement of proteinuria for women with preeclampsia, the amount of proteinuria does not seem to be related to poor maternal and neonatal outcomes, and monitoring proteinuria may lead to unindicated preterm deliveries and related neonatal complications. Our current diagnosis of preeclampsia in women with chronic kidney disease may be based on a change in protein excretion, a baseline protein excretion evaluation is critical in certain conditions such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and autoimmune or other renal disorders. The current definition of superimposed preeclampsia possesses a diagnostic dilemma, and it is unclear whether a change in the baseline proteinuria reflects another systemic disease such as preeclampsia or whether women with chronic disease such as chronic hypertension or diabetes will experience a different "normal" pattern of protein excretion during pregnancy. Finally, limited data are available regarding angiogenic and other biomarkers in women with chronic kidney disease as a potential aid in distinguishing the worsening of baseline chronic kidney disease and chronic hypertension from superimposed preeclampsia.

### Association of single measurement of dipstick proteinuria with physical performance of military males: the CHIEF study [^113JT6pX]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our principal findings were that more severe proteinuria in one urine dipstick test was associated with lower cardiorespiratory (aerobic) and part of anaerobic physical performance, particularly for muscular endurance of the chest wall and upper extremities in physically fit male adults with euvolemia and without chronic kidney disease, independent of age, body mass index, kidney function, fasting plasma glucose, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity. While the effect sizes may be small, the results are still concerning given the young age and general good health of the study population, especially because proteinuria is suspected to worsen over time.

Previous studies have revealed that there was an association between muscle wasting and a decrease of renal function. People with chronic kidney disease are predisposed to muscle wasting and vice versa, those with sarcopenia have a decrease of glomerular filtration rate, which may progress to chronic kidney disease status and result in presence of persistent proteinuria. Our findings were in line with this concept by the characteristics of lower body weight and greater BUN and serum creatinine levels which were mainly found in the males with moderate or severe proteinuria. In addition, it is reasonable that decreased muscle mass in the study subjects could lead to lower aerobic physical performance and impair part of anaerobic physical performance.

Multiple logistic regressions

The results of multiple logistic regressions of the best 10% and the worst 10% performances in each exercise, with moderate and severe proteinuria relative to unremarkable proteinuria, are shown in Table 4. As compared to those with unremarkable proteinuria, the males with moderate proteinuria and the males with severe proteinuria were more likely to be the worst 10% performers in the 3000-m run test in models 3 (OR = 1.30 and 1.93, respectively). In addition, the males with severe proteinuria but not the males with moderate proteinuria were more likely to be the worst 10% performers in the 2-min push-ups test (OR: 1.77). On the contrary, the males with moderate proteinuria and the males with severe proteinuria were not associated with the performances in 2-min sit-ups in models 1–3. The results of multiple logistic regressions of the best and the worst performances in each exercise at the level of 5 and 16%, respectively with moderate and severe proteinuria relative to unremarkable proteinuria, are in line with that at the level of 10%, which are shown in supplemental Table 3.

### Effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Qu67Q]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assessed the relationship between exercise training and proteinuria. We found that exercise training did not aggravate proteinuria in adult CKD patients without renal replacement therapy, but the positive effects that could decrease proteinuria were uncertain. Exercises with intensity higher than moderate seemed to have the potential to reduce proteinuria, and low-intensity swimming training had a similar effect.

Different exercise intensities and proteinuria

Evidence of the effects of low-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity exercises was still inadequate during our assessment. Proteinuria levels decreased in CKD patients after 3 months of low-intensity swimming training. However, we should note that the mechanism of swimming training is very different from that of other land exercises.

In all studies that implemented moderate and vigorous exercise programs, more than half of them (6/10) reported that proteinuria tended to decline. A previous review reported that exercise could induce kidney damage, especially high-intensity exercise. Recently, some studies suggested that the risk of kidney damage increases only when the exercise intensity exceeded the lactic acid threshold. However, no adverse events related to exercise were reported in any of the included trials. Relative to studies are needed to resolve the discrepancies and further explore the effects of diverse exercise intensities on adult CKD patients without renal replacement therapy. Moreover, we found that the participants in six of the included studies well represented the CKD patients, whilst the participants in the remaining five studies were strictly selected, such as including only male patients or those who had completed the stress, nutrition, and laboratory tests at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion may not be appropriate to the general CKD patients, the personal exercise programs with different intensities should be designed according to the physical function and disease status of the participants with CKD.

### Association of single measurement of dipstick proteinuria with physical performance of military males: the CHIEF study [^115ThC66]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Protein is one of the major materials such as the actin and myosin components of sarcomere constituting skeletal muscle fibers in the body. Under normal conditions, protein loss is less than 150 mg per day and excreted by the kidney in healthy adults. Proteinuria is defined as excess proteins excreted in the urine and commonly observed in several clinical situations. Pathological proteinuria is related to urinary tract abnormalities (e.g. hematuria), systemic inflammation, diabetes, hypertension, malignancies, dehydration, drugs and chronic kidney disease. By contrast, physiological proteinuria is usually asymptomatic and associated with intense physical activity, also referred as exercise-induced proteinuria.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of proteinuria can be reasoned by an increase of glomerular capillary permeability to proteins, reduced protein reabsorption in the renal tubules, and overflow of low-molecular-weight proteins. With regard to exercise-induced proteinuria, the main cause is not clarified, but the renin-angiotensin system and prostaglandins are considered to play a major role. The plasma angiotensin II concentration increases at exercise, possibly resulting in filtration of proteins through the glomerular membrane. Strenuous exercises which activate the sympathetic nervous system, secrete catecholamine and produce lactate, would increase the permeability of glomerular capillary membrane and related excessive protein excretions as well. In addition, intense physical activity is at higher risk of rhabdomyolysis and dehydration, and leads to presence of proteinuria. Previous studies have shown that exercise-induced proteinuria is associated with the amount and the length of exercise performed. In an elderly cohort higher albuminuria is a predictor of a decline of physical performance > 2 years. It is important to monitor proteinuria in the general population; however in young adults, the relationship with exercise capacity has not been explored.

Military personnel are a special group of young individuals, required to receive intensive training regularly. We hypothesized that presence of proteinuria in military personnel may be related to skeletal muscle injury caused by rigorous training and thus they have poor exercise performance. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of proteinuria severity with physical performance in a military population in Taiwan.

### Proteinuria should be used as a surrogate in CKD [^115pf36e]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Surrogate end points of renal failure are instrumental to the testing of new treatments in patients with chronic kidney disease, the natural history of which is characterized by a slow, asymptomatic decline in renal function. The magnitude of proteinuria is widely recognized as a marker of the severity of glomerulopathy. Population-based studies have identified proteinuria as a predictor of future decline in glomerular filtration rate and of the development of end-stage renal disease. More importantly, a reduction in proteinuria invariably translates into a protection from renal function decline in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease with overt proteinuria. Thus, proteinuria should be considered a valuable surrogate end point for clinical trials in patients with proteinuric renal diseases.

Results

Subject characteristics

The subject characteristics of each group are revealed in Table 1. The males with unremarkable proteinuria had relatively older ages, greater body mass index and waist circumference, a lower prevalence of current cigarette smokers, and lower concentrations of BUN, serum creatinine and fasting plasma glucose than those with moderate and severe proteinuria. On the contrary, the males with severe proteinuria had a higher level of systolic blood pressure and higher concentrations of BUN, serum creatinine and fasting plasma glucose than those with unremarkable or moderate proteinuria.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of the Study Cohort (n = 3357)

Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and categorical variables as n. Unremarkable proteinuria was defined as dipstick proteinuria grades: 0, +/−, or 1+; moderate proteinuria as grades: 2+; and severe proteinuria as grades: 3+ or 4+

Group means comparisons

Table 2 shows the number of military males specifically for an exercise test and the mean of physical performance in the three proteinuria groups. There were significant differences in 3000-m running time (857.2 s vs. 861.5 s vs. 873.0 s, p < 0.01) and 2-min push-ups numbers (49.6 vs. 48.5 vs. 47.5, p < 0.01) among the unremarkable proteinuria, moderate proteinuria, and severe proteinuria groups after adjusting for all covariates in model 3. However, there were similar 2-min sit-ups numbers among the three proteinuria groups in models 1–3. In addition, since there was only one young female categorized in the moderate proteinuria group, the moderate and severe proteinuria groups were combined to the remarkable proteinuria group in the sensitivity analysis which demonstrated similar tendencies for each physical performance, despite statistically insignificance (supplemental Table 1).

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^112bawdu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In the late 19th century, Hermann Senator (1834–1911), working at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, revolutionised the understanding of albuminuria by demonstrating its presence in seemingly healthy individuals. Using meticulous, albeit rudimentary, methods, he identified the physiological occurrence of trace albuminuria and proposed mechanisms for albumin handling in the kidney, concepts that align with modern understandings of glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Senator also suggested that urinary proteins predict a higher mortality risk. His work emphasised the variability of urinary albumin excretion and its modulation by factors like physical exertion and dietary protein intake, offering the first potential therapeutic insights for CKD management. Despite the significance of his findings, they were largely overlooked for decades.

Advancements in sensitive detection methods in the mid‐20th century renewed interest in albuminuria, particularly as a prognostic marker for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This resurgence was catalysed in 1963 by Harry Keen (1925–2013), who, using newly developed radioimmunoassay techniques, identified previously undetectable urinary albumin levels in early diabetes. Independently, Carl Erik Mogensen made similar observations. Their pioneering work highlighted the significance of albuminuria as an early indicator of kidney disease and its prognostic value for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Initially focused on patients with diabetes, where its clinical relevance was most evident, this research spurred widespread interest in albuminuria, eventually extending to individuals without diabetes as its broader implications became apparent.

### Proteinuria in adults: a diagnostic approach… [^1147GaKG]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The results are graded as negative, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ or 4+. This method preferentially detects albumin and is less sensitive to globulins or parts of globulins. 6 Most patients with persistent proteinuria should undergo a quantitative measurement of protein excretion, which can be done with a 24-hour urine specimen. The patient should be instructed to discard the first morning void; a specimen of all subsequent voidings should be collected, including the first morning void on the second day. The urinary creatinine concentration should be included in the 24-hour measurement to determine the adequacy of the specimen. An alternative to the 24-hour urine specimen is the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, determined in a random urine specimen while the person carries on normal activity.

18 Fortunately, the ratio is about the same numerically as the number of grams of protein excreted in urine per day. Thus, a ratio of less than 0. 2 is equivalent to
0. 2 g of protein per day and is considered normal, a ratio of 3. 5 is equivalent to
3. 5 g of protein per day and is considered nephrotic-range proteinuria. A medication history is particularly important. A 24-hour urine protein measurement or a UPr/Cr ratio on a random urine specimen should be obtained. An adult with proteinuria of more than 2 g per 24 hours requires aggressive work-up. To diagnose orthostatic proteinuria, split urine specimens are obtained for comparison. The first morning void is discarded. A 16-hour daytime specimen is obtained with the patient performing normal activities and finishing the collection by voiding just before bedtime. An eight-hour overnight specimen is then collected.

The daytime specimen typically has an increased concentration of protein, with the nighttime specimen having a normal concentration. Patients with true glomerular disease have reduced protein excretion in the supine position, but it will not return to normal, as it will with orthostatic proteinuria.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected on less accurate methods:

- confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive)

- confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the urine sample.

### Effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UAaj4]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

Each quasi-experimental study was evaluated for quality and risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for quasi-experimental studies, which includes nine items. The quality of RCTs was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias checklist. Any discrepancy concerning quality assessment was settled through a discussion.

Data treatment and analysis

According to the American College of Sports Medicine, we classified exercise intensity as light, moderate, vigorous, and near maximal to maximal based on the physiological and perceived exertion responses.

Review Manager version 5.2 software (RevMan; the Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England;) was used to analyse the data. The 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and standard mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data with inconsistent units, such as UACR (mg/mmol) and UACR (mg/g), were used. The data were pooled for meta-analysis when two or more trials measured the same outcome. For the trials reporting data as the median, interquartile range, or median and range, we translated these to the median and standard deviation for the meta-analysis. We only extracted the baseline data and data of the final follow-up period, although some trials reported data at more than one time. If a trial included a multiple intervention group without a shared control, then its data were entered separately. If there was a shared control, then we pooled the intervention groups using the proper formula from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Heterogeneity was quantified using the I² test, with I² values of 25, 50, and 75% corresponding to low, moderate, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively. A subgroup analysis was used to determine whether the type of study leads to a potential heterogeneity (RCT, quasi-experimental study). A fixed effect model was used when heterogeneity was < 50%; otherwise, the random effect model was used. We tested if these studies would have changed the results through a sensitivity analysis. We did not test the publication bias of the included studies because the number for each outcome was too limited to perform funnel plots.

Proteinuria — spot urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) guidance and correction: The guideline discourages random (spot) UPCR assessments in patients with glomerular disease, yet in clinical practice a trend in spot UPCR in an individual patient over time provides meaningful input; if using the spot UPCR, efforts should be made to collect samples at the same time of day with similar activity, often with the first morning sample providing the most consistency. A correction is noted for Figure 4 on page 91: instead of " < 300 mg/g (< 30 mg/mmol)" for UPCR, the values should be " < 3,000 mg/g (< 300 mg/mmol) or < 3,500 mg/g" in order to correspond to the traditional thresholds for nephrotic-range proteinuria.

### Microalbuminuria: do we need a new threshold? [^115xrZhi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (30–300 mg of albumin/24 h) is a well-known independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease and of mortality in diabetic, hypertensive and in the general population. However, recent studies indicate that increased risk is observed at levels of albuminuria much lower than those currently employed to define microalbuminuria. Such low levels were shown to predict heart disease and death, independent of age, sex, renal function, diabetes, hypertension and lipids, in subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and in the general population; as well as to predict progression to hypertension. Correction of obesity and metabolic derangements lowered levels of albuminuria below 30 mg/24 h to levels not associated with increased risk (5–7 mg/24 h). Despite the lack of outcome studies, there is substantial evidence to indicate that the threshold for defining microalbuminuria (that is, albuminuria associated with increased risk) should be lowered by nearly three to four-fold from the currently defined threshold. It would be advisable that clinical scores and future guidelines would consider including microalbuminuria at the lower rates as an independent risk factor, and as an indication for implementing early intervention. Unfortunately, and despite the abundance of evidence, albuminuria measurements are still underutilized in clinical practice.

### Postexercise proteinuria in humans: facts and mechanisms… [^113dvmns]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Strenuous exercise induces profound changes in renal hemodynamics and the protein content of urine. Postexercise proteinuria seems to be directly related to the intensity of exercise, rather than to its duration. The pattern of proteins identified in urine collected after exercise is different from normal physiological proteinuria. Immunochemical techniques demonstrate that postexercise proteinuria is of mixed glomerular-tubular type when heavy exercise is involved. The origin of proteinuria after light exercise seems to be preponderantly of glomerular type. Clearance of individual plasma proteins suggests an increased glomerular permeability and a partial tubular-reabsorption inhibition of macromolecules. Poortmans JR.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on the care of the athlete and athletic person with diabetes [^1157YDUD]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pre-exercise screening in diabetes — recent literature has shown that the risk of cardiac events, hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia is low and that the benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for most individuals with diabetes, and screening of individuals without symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) undergoing low-to moderate-intensity exercise has not been shown to reduce the risk of cardiac events. The American Diabetic Association guidelines state that pre-exercise medical clearance is not necessary for asymptomatic individuals who are receiving diabetes care consistent with the current guidelines who wish to begin a low or moderate-intensity physical activity that does not exceed the demands of brisk walking or everyday living. The American College of Sports Medicine guidelines state that physically inactive individuals with known metabolic disorders or those with signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic diseases should seek medical clearance before starting any exercise program, regardless of the intensity. When screening is performed, evaluation often includes electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing at the discretion of the clinician, and although the risk stratification in this group is more complex, the workup should be the same as in any individual with symptoms of CVD. Indications for pre-exercise screening include patients with symptoms of CVD, regardless of exercise-intensity level.

### Acute kidney injury associated with endurance events-is it a cause for concern? A systematic review [^117VcqGH]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

NGAL is a 25 kDa acute phase protein largely produced by the kidney tubule, though it is also upregulated in other pathological conditions. In a study of 16 ultramarathon runnersmean increase in SCr was 38%, with a significant increase in serum NGAL, urinary NGAL, as well as the urinary NGAL/creatinine ratio. Other studies have demonstrated increases in the urine protein:creatinine ratio 6–18 hours postrace. In a study on 152 runners in a 161 km ultramarathon, 34% met AKI criteria, with those demonstrating more significant degrees of injury having a significantly higher CK concentration. In addition, urinalysis tests that were positive for at least 1+ protein, 3+ blood and specific gravity ≥ 1.025 predicted those meeting the injury criteria with high sensitivity. The authors commented that using this simple test could be a useful screening test to identify those at highest rise.

The diagnostic utility of most of the biomarkers described to date to diagnose AKI prior to elevations in SCr is variable. This is due, in part, to clinical studies being hampered by diverse patient populations with differing comorbidities, the timing of the measurements and chosen cut-off values. More recently, studies have emerged using two biomarkers associated with cell cycle arrest, namely insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2. The concentrations of these two proteins was found to be in the urine of patients at high risk of AKI from a variety of aetiologies. Initial studies seem to suggest that these perform better than other known markers within this patient cohort; the mechanism of which may be an 'alarm signal' raised by the renal tubules, in response to stress. Furthermore, recent data imply that the presence of these biomarkers in the context of AKI may predict a worse prognosis in the critically ill, so perhaps they may be able to identify a group of athletes who may require closer follow-up (see figure 1 for a pathway outlining the aetiology of endurance exercise related renal dysfunction and potential utility of a biomarker to risk stratify participants).

Recommendations

Below are our pragmatic recommendations:
All marathon runners (or other endurance runners) should be given advice regarding the avoidance of NSAIDs, monitoring of urine volume and colour and the importance of adequate hydration.
Participants with pre-existing risk factors (for example, pre-existing renal dysfunction, hypertension and diabetes) should be made aware of the potential dangers of NSAIDs and systemic upset (such as vomiting) around the time of the event.
Runners who have collapsed during or at the end of a marathon, should have their observations recorded and basic investigations performed (including a urine dip and basic biochemistry); abnormal results should be followed up within a suitable time frame, according to local resources.
Future research could focus on biomarkers that more specifically reflect renal dysfunction, to help identify those at most risk and allow follow-up, where dysfunction has been found.

### Dehydration is how you define it: comparison of 318 blood and urine athlete spot checks [^1135Cw91]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

What are the new findings?

A urine osmolality above 700 mOsmol/kgH 2 O would classify > 50% of athletes as dehydrated, in a spot sample hydration check, despite normal blood sodium concentration, potassium concentration and osmolality values that would confirm the athletes were euhydrated (normonatremic) at rest.
Urine concentration, either as urine osmolality or specific gravity, should not be used as a surrogate measure for blood hydration markers in a spot sample hydration check conducted at rest.
A urine osmolality value above 700 mOsmol/kgH 2 O, and/or urine specific gravity above 1.020, reflects urinary free water conservation and not clinically significant (intracellular) dehydration in a large cohort of collegiate athletes.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^111NosL1]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Many factors can cause transient increases in albuminuria (including urinary tract infection, exercise, and menstruation) and as such, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and other international guideline groups recommend that repeat testing should take place within 3 months if a single uACR result is between 3–69 mg/mmol. An early morning sample offers some advantages due to reduced impact of hydration status and exercise, but if unavailable, random sampling may still offer a reliable indication of total daily albuminuria. A uACR value ≥ 70 mg/mmol generally does not require further confirmation, as this is consistent with clinically significant proteinuria.

We agree with the statement within the NICE CKD guidelines that reagent strips and protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements should not be used to quantify albuminuria. Large-scale meta-analysis and other observational data have shown that dipstick values using reagent strips are neither sensitive, nor specific enough to predict uACR accurately. However, we recognise that uACR testing may not be regularly undertaken in some areas of the UK, and local methods of assessing risk may need to be used to ensure those at risk are offered SGLT-2 inhibition.
4 We recommend that SGLT-2 inhibition can be continued until the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation arises (Grade 1A).

Rationale

Data from CKD trials include many hundreds of participants with an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73 m². Continued use of SGLT-2 inhibitors until the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation was the practice in these trials, which have confirmed benefits exceed any harms. In subgroup analyses, kidney benefits are unmodified by baseline eGFR. At a population level, people with a low eGFR are at highest absolute risk of kidney failure, and are therefore most likely to benefit (in absolute terms).
5 We suggest that co-prescription of SGLT-2 inhibition with MRA can be considered, where each are individually indicated (Grade 2B).

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^113U7LTM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria, the abnormal presence of albumin in urine, is a key marker of kidney damage and a strong predictor of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Its clinical significance has evolved from early historical observations to its current role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) detection, risk stratification and treatment monitoring. Advances in measurement techniques and evidence from large-scale studies have reinforced its prognostic value, particularly in guiding interventions such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Albuminuria assessment is now integrated into CKD staging, cardiovascular risk prediction models and therapy selection. Despite its established utility, challenges remain, including measurement variability, assay standardisation and under-utilisation in clinical practice. This review provides a practical update on albuminuria testing, summarising its historical development, technical aspects and clinical implications, and emphasising its role in CKD management and cardiovascular risk assessment.
