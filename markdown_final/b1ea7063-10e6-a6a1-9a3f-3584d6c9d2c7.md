## Question

What's the benefit of as stress test

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits of a stress test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "stress test" means clinically and the main modalities. Then, I should verify the core benefits across diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic domains. Next, I will examine outcome data in key scenarios: preoperative risk stratification, stable chest pain evaluation, and emergency department chest pain. After that, I need to check guideline positions and where stress testing is not beneficial or may cause harm. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced, patient-centered conclusion and highlight special populations and test selection nuances.

> Let me first confirm the construct. A cardiac stress test evaluates myocardial ischemia by increasing myocardial oxygen demand via exercise or pharmacologic vasodilation, with or without imaging, to detect flow-limiting coronary disease and to inform prognosis and management decisions; modalities include exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, nuclear SPECT/PET perfusion imaging, and CMR perfusion, each with strengths and limitations depending on patient factors and pretest probability [^ecf3aed7] [^78b954ce] [^c7817357].

> I will now examine the diagnostic benefit. Stress testing detects obstructive coronary artery disease with accuracy that varies by modality and patient factors; exercise ECG has moderate sensitivity/specificity, whereas stress imaging improves diagnostic yield, and in patients with intermediate pretest probability of CAD, guidelines endorse stress imaging or exercise ECG to establish the diagnosis and guide therapy, with test selection tailored to ECG interpretability, exercise capacity, and local expertise [^c2323719] [^68c64b6b] [^1ad61122].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis. I should confirm that stress testing provides prognostic stratification beyond diagnosis. Normal stress test results, particularly with good exercise capacity, are associated with very low annual event rates, whereas inducible ischemia, especially in multiple territories or at low workloads, identifies patients at higher risk who may benefit from intensified medical therapy or revascularization; this prognostic value is well established for stress echocardiography and nuclear MPI, and is reflected in contemporary guidelines [^8a8fabf6] [^f2af1e5b] [^68c64b6b].

> Next, I should review therapeutic decision-making. Stress testing can reveal ischemia that prompts guideline-directed medical therapy intensification, informs the need for coronary angiography, and, when ischemia is extensive, supports revascularization; importantly, modern trials emphasize that revascularization decisions should be guided by functional significance rather than anatomy alone, aligning with an ischemia-guided strategy in appropriate patients [^6610bad9] [^68c64b6b] [^8ec02921].

> Let me consider preoperative risk stratification, where I recall conflicting data. Large population-based cohorts suggest that preoperative stress testing is associated with improved one-year survival and shorter hospital stay in intermediate-to-high risk patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery, likely via optimized perioperative management and selective revascularization; however, randomized data like DECREASE II did not show a clear outcome benefit, and contemporary guidelines restrict testing to patients with poor or unknown functional capacity facing elevated-risk surgery, cautioning against routine testing in low-risk patients or those with good functional capacity [^dbc3227c] [^553c9442] [^60c7876f] [^91462715].

> Wait, let me verify the harm signal in low-risk patients. Observational analyses show that preoperative stress testing in low-risk patients is associated with worse outcomes, plausibly due to unnecessary beta-blockade and downstream procedures; this reinforces guideline recommendations to avoid routine preoperative stress testing in low-risk patients or those with adequate functional capacity, and to individualize decisions using validated risk tools and shared decision-making [^56b0e8f5] [^60c7876f] [^91462715].

> I should double-check the emergency department context. Routine stress testing in low-risk ED chest pain patients with normal ECG and biomarkers does not reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events and increases length of stay, radiation exposure, and costs; GRACE-1 concludes there is no benefit to repeat stress testing within 12 months after a prior normal or non-diagnostic test, and observational ED cohorts show low event rates irrespective of timely stress testing, supporting selective, symptom-guided follow-up rather than routine stress testing in this population [^596955d1] [^459f2b92] [^0045135b].

> Let me reconsider stable chest pain outside the ED. In patients with intermediate-to-high pretest probability of obstructive CAD, stress testing remains appropriate to diagnose ischemia and risk-stratify; comparative effectiveness data show similar near-term outcomes between stress testing and CCTA in PROMISE, while CCTA may have higher diagnostic sensitivity and can reduce unnecessary invasive angiography in some pathways, so test choice should be individualized by age, ECG interpretability, exercise capacity, and local expertise, with shared decision-making emphasized [^ae95f384] [^43ef0a82] [^479e5302].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In women, stress echocardiography is often preferred due to higher specificity and absence of radiation; in patients unable to exercise, pharmacologic stress with echocardiography or nuclear imaging is appropriate; in syncope, exercise testing is indicated when syncope occurs during or immediately after exertion; in chronic coronary disease with changing symptoms or functional capacity, stress testing can reassess ischemia and guide therapy adjustments [^5679d7b6] [^78b954ce] [^04ae2dc5] [^1008114b].

> But wait, what about screening asymptomatic individuals. I should confirm that routine stress testing for screening is not recommended, as false positives can lead to unnecessary invasive procedures without proven outcome benefit; the USPSTF found no evidence that screening exercise testing improves outcomes, and guidelines restrict testing to patients with symptoms or specific high-risk scenarios where results would change management [^b2088c66] [^4eb0d7af].

> Let me synthesize the benefits succinctly. The principal benefits of stress testing are threefold: diagnostic confirmation of obstructive CAD in appropriate patients, prognostic risk stratification that informs intensity of medical therapy and need for invasive evaluation, and therapeutic guidance toward guideline-directed medical therapy and, when ischemia is extensive, revascularization; these benefits are most compelling in intermediate-to-high risk patients with symptoms or in selected preoperative contexts with poor functional capacity, while routine use in low-risk or asymptomatic patients is discouraged due to limited yield and potential harm [^68c64b6b] [^60c7876f] [^f2af1e5b].

> Finally, I should confirm practical takeaways. Use stress testing when results will change management, align the modality with patient factors and pretest probability, avoid routine testing in low-risk or asymptomatic patients, and engage in shared decision-making to weigh benefits, risks, and costs; this approach maximizes value while minimizing overuse and downstream harms [^479e5302] [^60c7876f] [^0adce7e1].

Stress testing helps **detect coronary artery disease** by revealing ischemia that may not be apparent at rest [^ecf3aed7], and it **guides treatment decisions** by identifying patients who benefit from medical therapy, revascularization, or closer follow-up [^0abdf42a]. It also **assesses functional capacity**, informing prognosis and exercise prescriptions [^c2323719]. In preoperative settings, stress testing can reduce perioperative risk in high-risk patients [^dbc3227c] [^553c9442], but it is not routinely indicated for low-risk patients or those with good functional capacity [^a5a9578d] [^91462715]. Overall, stress testing improves diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and management of cardiovascular disease [^68c64b6b].

---

## Diagnostic benefits

- **Detection of coronary artery disease (CAD)**: Stress testing identifies inducible ischemia in patients with suspected CAD, especially when symptoms are atypical or resting ECG is normal [^c2323719].

- **Differentiation of cardiac from non-cardiac chest pain**: Helps distinguish ischemic pain from non-ischemic causes, guiding appropriate management [^c2323719].

- **Identification of high-risk lesions**: Detects significant stenoses that may warrant invasive evaluation and revascularization [^8a8fabf6].

---

## Prognostic benefits

- **Risk stratification**: Normal stress test results indicate low short-term cardiovascular risk, while abnormal results identify patients at higher risk of adverse events [^8a8fabf6].

- **Guiding therapy intensity**: Results inform the aggressiveness of medical therapy, need for revascularization, and follow-up frequency [^0abdf42a].

- **Assessment of functional capacity**: Exercise testing quantifies functional capacity, which correlates with prognosis and guides rehabilitation planning [^c2323719].

---

## Therapeutic and management benefits

Stress testing **guides medical therapy** by identifying ischemia that warrants intensified anti-anginal and risk-factor management, and it informs revascularization decisions by identifying patients with extensive ischemia who may benefit from coronary angiography and intervention [^0abdf42a] [^8a8fabf6]. In surgical planning, preoperative stress testing can reduce perioperative risk in high-risk patients [^dbc3227c] [^553c9442], though it is not routinely indicated for low-risk patients or those with good functional capacity [^a5a9578d] [^91462715].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False positives and false negatives**: Exercise ECG has moderate sensitivity and specificity; imaging improves accuracy but increases cost and radiation exposure [^c2323719] [^15c42c6f].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Resting ECG abnormalities, inability to exercise, and comorbidities may limit test utility or necessitate pharmacologic stress [^78b954ce].

- **Overuse and low-value testing**: Routine stress testing in low-risk or asymptomatic patients can lead to unnecessary procedures and costs without outcome benefit [^b2088c66] [^0adce7e1].

---

Stress testing provides **significant diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic benefits**, particularly in patients with intermediate to high risk of CAD or those undergoing high-risk surgery. It is most useful when results will change management, and should be individualized to patient risk, symptoms, and functional capacity [^60c7876f].

### Preoperative stress testing: new guidelines [^a9a0b345]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

To date, there are no well controlled trials in the literature that demonstrate an outcome benefit using stress testing as a screening procedure before noncardiac surgery. Perioperative beta-blockade significantly decreases morbidity and mortality, and thus reduces any potential benefit stress testing may have in identifying patients who may advance to more invasive treatment. Preoperative percutaneous coronary intervention has unproven perioperative benefit, and coronary artery bypass graft carries risks that often offset the risk of noncardiac surgery. Unless an outcome benefit from cardiac testing and procedures can be demonstrated in a properly designed trial, their use should generally be restricted to situations in which symptoms or other cardiac findings warrant cardiac evaluation and treatment, regardless of upcoming surgery.

### Optimizing the assessment of patient clinical risk at the time of cardiac stress Testing [^0abdf42a]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to a marked temporal decline in inducible myocardial ischemia over recent decades, most diagnostic patients now referred for cardiac stress testing have nonischemic studies. Among nonischemic patients, however, long-term risk is heterogeneous and highly influenced by a variety of clinical parameters. Herein, we review 8 factors that can govern long-term clinical risk: coronary risk factor burden; patient symptoms; exercise capacity and exercise test responses; the need for pharmacologic stress testing; autonomic function; musculoskeletal status; subclinical atherosclerosis; and psychosocial risk. To capture the clinical benefit provided by both assessing myocardial ischemia and these additional parameters, the authors propose that a cardiac stress tests report have an additional component beyond statements as to the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease and/or magnitude of ischemia. This added component could be a comment section designed to make referring physicians aware of aspects of long-term risk that may influence clinical management and potentially lead to changes in the intensity of risk factor management, frequency of follow-up, need for further testing, or other management decisions. In this manner, the increasingly frequent normal stress test result might more commonly influence treatment recommendations and even patient behavior, thus leading to improvement in patient outcomes even in the setting of normal stress test results.

### Update on pharmacological cardiac stress testing: efficacy, risk stratification and patient selection [^ddf630dd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite greater control of risk factors and improved treatments, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a significant cause of mortality with 1 in every 4 deaths in the United States due to this disorder.(1) Cardiac stress tests have long been one of the most often utilized testing modalities used to identify patients suspected of having CHD, specifically coronary artery disease (CAD). These tests allow for noninvasive assessment of the coronary circulation and its ability to augment flow in response to physiologic demand. As with any diagnostic testing however, potential health risks as well as the financial burden of cardiovascular stress testing, must be weighed against the benefits and utility of the data procured. Given the rapidly evolving field of cardiac stress testing with respect to new risk stratification guidelines, new agents, and new assessment methods, it is difficult for physicians to remain up to date on the latest research and the benefits and risks of different testing modalities. A recent survey of primary care physicians and cardiologists conducted by the Elsevier Office of Continuing Medical Education found that approximately one-quarter of the cardiologists and primary care physicians surveyed do not feel confident identifying the factors which should be considered before ordering a cardiac stress test as part of pre-operative screening for a patient. Additionally, this survey also reported that primary care physicians reported a high degree of confidence in ordering the appropriate cardiac screening tests for patients yet, cardiologists reported that they frequently/somewhat frequently felt the need to change the test ordered by the internist. This educational intervention focuses on patient selection, exercise vs. pharmacologic stress testing, pharmacologic agents, and the importance of patient and doctor communication in ensuring the right test is recommended for the right patient.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department (GRACE): recurrent, low-risk chest pain in the emergency department [^596955d1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

GRACE-1 question 2 — repeat stress testing after prior normal or non-diagnostic testing within 12 months: There were no studies with direct evidence to answer whether repeat stress testing versus no stress test affects MACE within 30 days in adult patients with recurrent, low-risk chest pain and normal or non-diagnostic stress testing within the last 12 months. Indirect evidence included two randomized studies and one multicenter, retrospective study; among the three studies, zero out of 4906 ED patients (0%) died at 30 days, while 91 out of 4906 patients (1.9%) experienced a non-fatal, significant cardiac event. The two randomized studies did not demonstrate a reduction in significant cardiac events, including MACE, at 30 days, and the multicenter, retrospective cohort did not demonstrate any associated benefit of stress testing within 3 days, nor within 30 days, compared with not undergoing a stress test at all. Harms and burdens included potential for an allergic reaction, radiation exposure, procedural risks, indirect harm from downstream testing and procedures, avoidable out-of-pocket expenses, time spent in the ED/observation unit or hospital, psychological stress with false-positive results, downstream testing such as coronary angiography, and greater total charges at 30 days compared with direct discharge. Shared decision-making may be reasonable in this clinical scenario, and a majority (~85%) of men and women with potential ACS would accept a stress test if recommended by their physician.

### Clinical outcomes after cardiac stress testing among US patients younger than 65 years [^452d03c3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac stress tests play an important role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. However, wide variation in testing rates between regions and healthcare systems raises questions about the effectiveness of testing as used in practice. 1, 2, 3, 4 Noninvasive cardiac tests are also a significant contributor to healthcare costs, accounting for > 40% of Medicare Part B spending on medical imaging, or over $17 billion annually. 5 Professional societies and policymakers have made several efforts to improve stress test utilization, including the development of appropriate use criteria and campaigns to reduce the use of "low‐value" tests. 6, 7 Despite these efforts, between 32% and 48% of stress tests performed in the United States are rated as "rarely appropriate" according to a recent meta‐analysis. 8

Recent scientific statements have championed the measurement of clinical outcomes after stress testing to better define their value. 9 Since healthcare value is generally defined as the outcome of a test or treatment divided by its cost, measuring relevant clinical outcomes after stress testing may provide new insights on the current value of stress testing. However, little is known about the incidence or predictors of clinical outcomes after stress testing in contemporary, nationally representative cohorts.

Accordingly, our objectives were to (1) determine the incidence of relevant clinical outcomes within 1 year after stress testing in a large cohort of commercially insured US individuals, and (2) identify and describe the characteristics of patients most and least likely to experience these outcomes. Relevant clinical outcomes were chosen consistent with recent scientific statements and clinical trials, 9, 10 and included (1) hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with or without coronary revascularization, (2) elective coronary revascularization, and (3) coronary angiography without revascularization.

### Exercise stress testing: indications and common questions [^4eb0d7af]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Exercise stress testing is a validated diagnostic test for coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, and is used in the evaluation of patients with known cardiac disease. Testing of asymptomatic patients is generally not indicated. It may be performed in select deconditioned adults before starting a vigorous exercise program, but no studies have compared outcomes from preexercise testing vs. encouraging light exercise with gradual increases in exertion. Preoperative exercise stress testing is helpful for risk stratification in patients undergoing vascular surgery or who have active cardiac symptoms before undergoing nonemergent noncardiac surgery. Exercise stress testing without imaging is the preferred initial choice for risk stratification in most women. Sensitivity and specificity increase with the use of adjunctive imaging such as echocardiography or myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography. Exercise stress testing is rarely an appropriate option to evaluate persons with known coronary artery disease who have no new symptoms less than two years after percutaneous intervention or less than five years after coronary artery bypass grafting. The Duke treadmill score has excellent prognostic value for exercise stress testing. Imaging is not necessary if patients are able to achieve more than 10 metabolic equivalents on exercise stress testing. Exercise stress testing is not indicated before noncardiac surgeries in patients who can achieve 4 metabolic equivalents without symptoms.

### A test in context: fractional flow reserve: accuracy, prognostic implications, and Limitations [^6610bad9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an invasive procedure used during coronary angiography to determine the functional significance of coronary stenoses. Its use is particularly helpful in intermediate or angiographically ambiguous lesions in the absence of noninvasive functional studies. Randomized clinical trials have reported improved clinical outcomes with the use of FFR to guide coronary revascularization, including a reduction in cardiac death or myocardial infarction, as well as costs, with an FFR-based strategy compared with a conventional angiography-based approach. Current societal guidelines provide a Class II, Level of Evidence: A recommendation to perform FFR in angiographically intermediate stenoses in the absence of stress testing or in the presence of discordant stress test results and angiographic findings. However, despite the relative ease of use of FFR, multiple technical factors can impair its accuracy, and attention to detail is critical when performing the test. This review focuses on the fundamental basics of FFR testing, clinical evidence, and limitations.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^daf06b0f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Stress echocardiography — indications for viability testing across left ventricular (LV) dysfunction severity are described as follows: Testing for viability is not needed in patients with mild LV systolic dysfunction, significant angina, limited comorbidities, and good anatomy for revascularization, whereas testing for both ischemia and viability may provide useful information to guide management in patients with moderate LV dysfunction, dyspnea and/or angina, and a variable extent of coronary artery disease (CAD); revascularization would be indicated with the finding of extensive ischemia, and among those with severe global dysfunction, advanced symptoms of heart failure, and severe multivessel disease, the extent of viable myocardium may play a larger role in predicting outcome and the benefit of revascularization in these patients.

### Anticipated rates and costs of guideline-concordant preoperative stress testing [^f9c99a50]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients have preoperative assessment of cardiac risk and functional status, and that patients at "elevated" cardiac risk with poor or unknown functional status be referred for preoperative stress testing. Little is known about current rates of testing or resultant medical costs. We set out to estimate the expected rates of preoperative stress testing and resultant costs if physicians in the United States were to follow current guidelines and to investigate differences that would arise from 2 risk prediction methods included in current guidelines.

Methods

We applied 2 risk prediction tools (Revised Cardiac Risk Index and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest) included in current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines to a multicenter prospective registry of patients undergoing surgery in the United States in 2009. We then calculated expected rates of preoperative cardiac stress testing if physicians were to follow American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, expected nationwide direct medical expenditures that would result (in 2017 US dollars), and agreement beyond chance between the 2 risk prediction tools.

Results

Current guidelines recommend considerable spending on preoperative stress testing. Guideline-recommended spending would differ substantially depending on the risk prediction tool used and the reliability of the functional status assessment. Rates of testing and resultant spending are likely much greater among patients at "elevated" risk, compared with patients at "low" risk. Two guideline-recommended risk assessment tools, Revised Cardiac Risk Index and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest, have poor agreement beyond chance across the currently recommended risk threshold.

Conclusions

Preoperative stress testing is likely a considerable source of medical spending, despite unproven benefit. Which perioperative risk assessment tool clinicians should use, what risk thresholds are appropriate for patient selection, and the reliability of the functional status assessment all warrant further attention.

### Functional capacity and cardiovascular assessment: submaximal exercise testing and hidden candidates for pharmacologic stress [^a731904f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Submaximal exercise testing is often used to estimate functional capacity in non-athletes, to assess cardiovascular disease in elderly or frail patients, to demonstrate exercise equipment, or to risk-stratify patients after myocardial infarction. However, submaximal exercise testing is not sufficiently sensitive, specific, or predictive to have widespread clinical utility, except in post-myocardial infarction protocols. Many patients for whom submaximal exercise testing is not useful are unable to exercise sufficiently for maximal testing and are referred for imaging with pharmacologic stress. Although some patients who are unable to exercise adequately are easily recognized, many are not. The identification of such patients before they fail a maximal exercise test attempt is beneficial to both the patient and the imaging laboratory.

### Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective major non-cardiac surgery: population based cohort study [^56b0e8f5]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

In contrast to these benefits for intermediate to high risk patients, we found that stress testing was associated with harm in low risk patients. The increased mortality observed might be explained by the use of unnecessary, and potentially deleterious, interventions such as β blockade. It is noteworthy that the frequency of new β blocker use in low risk patients was 2.8 times higher in those who were tested than in those who were not (web table A).

Comparison with other studies

Our study warrants comparison with the DECREASE II trial, in which 770 patients with one or two clinical risk factors were randomly allocated to either stress testing or no testing before major vascular surgery. Although the rates of cardiac death or myocardial infarction at 30 days after surgery did not significantly differ between the two strategies, the few outcome events (n = 16) and wide 95% confidence interval (odds ratio 0.28 to 2.91) suggest that the trial was underpowered to detect a plausible treatment effect. Indeed, this confidence interval is still consistent with our finding of a small benefit for intermediate risk patients.

Additionally, the design of the DECREASE II trial might have minimised its ability to detect differences between the study arms. All participants received perioperative β blockade and similar postoperative surveillance, thereby diminishing the influence of testing on clinical care. Stress testing altered subsequent management only in that patients with extensive ischaemia were considered for preoperative revascularisation, which has not been shown to improve outcomes.

Strengths and limitations of study

Our study has several strengths. Previous studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative stress testing, whereas our study focused on the clinically relevant question of whether it influences outcomes. Additionally, the large sample size enabled us to detect small treatment effects that would have been deemed non-significant in smaller studies. The population based sample we used describes the effects of preoperative stress testing in "real world" clinical care, as opposed to in a protocol driven randomised trial. Thus, our findings can be generalised to other healthcare systems reasonably similar to that in Ontario, Canada. Finally, our study included only patients scheduled for elective intermediate to high risk surgery. Urgent or emergency procedures are unlikely to be delayed to facilitate preoperative stress testing, whereas patients undergoing low risk ambulatory surgery have a very low risk of major complicationsand are unlikely to benefit from preoperative stress testing. Our study, therefore, focused on individuals who had reasonable opportunities to undergo, and potentially benefit from, preoperative stress testing.

### Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective major non-cardiac surgery: population based cohort study [^357331a5]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this population based retrospective cohort study, non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgery was associated with improved one year survival and reduced hospital stay. These benefits largely applied to patients who were at high risk for cardiac complications on the basis of three or more clinical risk factors. In contrast, stress testing was associated with only minor benefits for intermediate risk patients (1–2 risk factors) and with harm in low risk individuals.

Our results suggest that preoperative stress testing should be reserved for patients with clinical risk factors for cardiac complications. In high risk patients with three or more clinical risk factors, the use of preoperative stress testing was supported by an associated moderate improvement in one year survival and favourable number needed to treat. Conversely, in intermediate risk patients with one or two clinical risk factors, testing was associated with a small, albeit statistically significant, benefit. Given the small magnitude of this effect and the associated relatively large number needed to treat, routine preoperative stress testing is not justified in intermediate risk patients. Our results do, however, support the safety and potential benefits of selective testing in intermediate risk patients. Future research should therefore determine whether stress testing provides additional prognostic information in specific subgroups of intermediate risk patients; for example, in subgroups defined by risk factors that were not captured by administrative data (such as poor functional status) or were suggested by our subgroup analyses (such as previous history of ischaemic heart disease). Our study does not support the use of preoperative stress testing in low risk patients; furthermore, the results suggest that such testing is associated with harm.

### Current methods of pharmacologic stress testing and the potential advantages of new agents [^ef7287c7]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents the exciting advances made and ongoing in the area of pharmacologic cardiac stress testing. In particular, new A(2A)-specific receptor agonists work like adenosine but promise the delivery of uncomplicated vasodilator stress testing or the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary disease. These agents, although not perfect, do likely present a level of protection against the complications of bronchospasm and heart block. Phase III studies have shown that these agents promise a reduced symptom intensity and greater patient tolerance. One of these agents, regadenoson, is now Food and Drug Administration approved and will be delivered as the same single-dose bolus in all patients, regardless of weight, greatly simplifying the method and increasing its acceptability. Most widely applied with myocardial perfusion SPECT, these agents will find application with PET myocardial perfusion studies and likely MRI studies. Because of their effect on coronary supply rather than demand, they will not be applied with stress echocardiography. Before considering these agents, we will consider the principles and methods of stress testing, and particularly pharmacologic stress testing. The learning objectives of this article are to familiarize the reader with the methods and choices in stress testing for coronary disease diagnosis and prognosis, to present the advantages and disadvantages of pharmacologic stress testing, to review current pharmacologic stress-testing methods and their specific combination with imaging methods, to present the chemistry and effects of the new A(2a)-specific receptor agonists and their advantages compared with existing nonspecific agents, and to help the reader better understand the clinical role of the A(2a)-specific receptor agonists and their application.

### Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective major non-cardiac surgery: population based cohort study [^98d0de67]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgery is associated with improved one year survival and reduced hospital stay. These benefits principally apply to patients at high risk for cardiac complications on the basis of clinical risk factors. Our results are generally supportive of the current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for preoperative cardiac evaluation.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^d9b7743f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — overall utility and comparative performance: Stress echocardiography is a well-validated tool for detection and assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Its prognostic value has been well documented in multiple large studies, demonstrating roles in preoperative risk stratification before noncardiac surgery, recovery of function of viable myocardium, and identification of patients at increased risk of cardiac events and death. The test is less expensive than other stress imaging modalities, providing accuracy for detection of CAD and prognostic information equivalent to SPECT perfusion imaging, and it has great versatility, permitting assessment of valvular and pericardial abnormalities, chamber sizes, and wall thicknesses.

### Stress radionuclide imaging versus stress echocardiography: a framework for comparisons [^00cfefd0]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Comparisons of stress-imaging procedures require analyses based on their 2 principal applications: diagnostic and prognostic assessments. Besides comparing results reported in the literature — in which differences have been reported in the ability of stress nuclear versus stress echocardiographic imaging to predict a low risk of cardiac events-other factors often not reported may be important in discerning the relative efficacy of these tests. These include consideration of how these tests perform in specific, individualized patient scenarios; the effect of on-going technical advances on test usefulness; and evaluation of test worthiness according to such factors as cost-effectiveness and the magnitude of incremental test information that is provided. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between a test's efficacy (ie, its intrinsic accuracy) and its effectiveness (ie, how it performs in the real world of clinical practice).

### Provocative biomarker stress test: stress-delta N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide [^460b19a4]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Background

Accurate diagnosis and management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has been a vexing problem for decades. Patients can be rapidly assessed for myocardial infarction (MI) by cardiac troponin assays. However, even in the era of high-sensitivity troponin assays, patients frequently require inpatient admission or observation for further risk stratification, including stress testing. However, stress tests require specialty expertise and equipmentthat are not routinely available in the emergency department (ED). Multiple factors, including medicolegal risk aversionand supply-induced demand, have led to widespread, low-yield use of stress testing. A new paradigm is needed for risk stratification of patients with suspected ACS in whom MI has been excluded.

Importance

Prior research suggests that myocardial ischaemia induced by stress testing is associated with dynamic increases (stress-deltas) in N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations. These studies only included outpatients with symptoms of stable angina. In this investigation, we test a novel means for assessing ED patients with potential ACS: a biomarker-based stress test. A stress test that uses biomarkers (as opposed to imaging) to assess ischaemia could have several possible benefits for ED patients with ACS symptoms and could improve the current paradigm.

Goals of this investigation

We hypothesised that ED patients undergoing stress testing with myocardial ischaemia would demonstrate higher increases in NT-proBNP (stress-delta NT-proBNP) than patients without myocardial ischaemia. We calculated the diagnostic test characteristics for the index test of stress-delta NT-proBNP compared with a reference standard of standard stress test imaging. For exploratory analyses, we evaluated whether patients who subsequently suffered adverse cardiac events, such as MI, urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting, would similarly demonstrate significantly higher stress-delta NT-proBNP.

### Myocardial ischemia in the management of chronic coronary artery disease: past and present [^8ec02921]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

For many years, stress-induced myocardial ischemia has been considered important in the management of chronic coronary artery disease. Early evidence focused on the exercise ECG and the Duke treadmill score. In the 1970s, randomized clinical trials, which compared coronary artery bypass surgery to medical therapy, enrolled patients who were very different from contemporary practice and had inconsistent results. Surgery appeared to be of greatest benefit in high-risk patients defined by anatomy (such as left main disease) or stress-induced ischemia. However, randomized clinical trials of revascularization versus contemporary medical therapy over the past 20 years have been surprisingly negative. Nuclear cardiology substudies from these trials reported inconsistent results. Two observational studies from a single-center provided the best evidence for the use of stress-induced ischemia to identify patients who were most likely to benefit from revascularization. The recently completed ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) was designed to test the hypothesis that revascularization would improve outcomes in patients with moderate-severe ischemia on stress testing. Unfortunately, 14.2% of the randomized patients had either mild or no ischemia on core lab review. Nearly one-quarter of the patients were randomized on the basis of an exercise ECG without imaging. The negative results of the trial reflect the long-term population decline in coronary artery disease and abnormal stress tests, as well as improvements in patient outcome due to optimal medical therapy. Topics requiring further research are presented. The implications of the trial for the use of both stress imaging and coronary computed tomography angiography in clinical practice are examined.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^e4de86e9]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

KDIGO kidney transplant candidate — non-invasive stress testing evidence indicates that although testing shows reasonable diagnostic performance, "there are no studies demonstrating a survival benefit in patients assessed for kidney transplantation undergoing stress testing for asymptomatic CAD", and in the DIAD randomized trial among people with diabetes, screening yielded 7 nonfatal MIs and 8 cardiac deaths (2.7%) versus 10 nonfatal MIs and 7 cardiac deaths (3.0%) without screening, with HR 0.88 (95% CI: 0.44–1.88; P = 0.73).

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^15c42c6f]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic procedures for IHD that expose women to ionizing radiation include stress MPI, CCTA, and invasive coronary angiography, and any referring physician or imager should have adequate knowledge of a test's effective radiation dose; when the benefit-risk ratio favors a high benefit of IHD risk detection, radiation exposure is not a major consideration, but in every case the lowest dose should be used for all patients with an appropriate indication for testing, and for low-risk premenopausal women alternative tests without radiation exposure (eg, ECG) or a no-testing strategy should be strongly considered. Average exposures cited are Average background radiation exposure per year for a member of the US population is ≈3.1 mSv and CAD imaging modalities are associated with average exposures of ≈11 mSv for rest-stress myocardial perfusion.

### Evaluation of outpatient cardiac stress testing after emergency department encounters for suspected acute coronary syndrome [^459f2b92]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Professional guidelines recommend 72-hour cardiac stress testing after an emergency department (ED) evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome. There are limited data on actual compliance rates and effect on patient outcomes. Our aim is to describe rates of completion of noninvasive cardiac stress testing and associated 30-day major adverse cardiac events.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of ED encounters from June 2015 to June 2017 across 13 community EDs within an integrated health system in Southern California. The study population included all adults with a chest pain diagnosis, troponin value, and discharge with an order for an outpatient cardiac stress test. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who completed an outpatient stress test within the recommended 3 days, 4 to 30 days, or not at all. Secondary analysis described the 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiac events.

Results

During the study period, 24,459 patients presented with a chest pain evaluation requiring troponin analysis and stress test ordering from the ED. Of these, we studied the 7,988 patients who were discharged home to complete diagnostic testing, having been deemed appropriate by the treating clinicians for an outpatient stress test. The stress test completion rate was 31.3% within 3 days and 58.7% between 4 and 30 days, and 10.0% of patients did not complete the ordered test. The 30-day rates of major adverse cardiac events were low (death 0.0%, acute myocardial infarction 0.7%, and revascularization 0.3%). Rapid receipt of stress testing was not associated with improved 30-day major adverse cardiac events (odds ratio 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.54).

Conclusion

Less than one third of patients completed outpatient stress testing within the guideline-recommended 3 days after initial evaluation. More important, the low adverse event rates suggest that selective outpatient stress testing is safe. In this cohort of patients selected for outpatient cardiac stress testing in a well-integrated health system, there does not appear to be any associated benefit of stress testing within 3 days, nor within 30 days, compared with those who never received testing at all. The lack of benefit of obtaining timely testing, in combination with low rates of objective adverse events, may warrant reassessment of the current guidelines.

### Overview of stress echocardiography: uses, advantages, and limitations [^8692bcaf]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Responses of the heart to changes in our environment are probably even more important than how the heart functions at rest. Accordingly, stress testing with noninvasive imaging has become important for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring the effects of therapy. Echocardiography at rest and with stress permits characterization of global and segmental left ventricular function as well as valvular structure and function. Moreover, echocardiography can be performed during or after a number of different physical or even mental stressors. Advantages of stress echocardiography include its ready availability, relatively low capital cost, and incremental value in that it allows characterization of cardiac anatomy as well as the myocardial response to a potentially ischemic stimulus. Moreover, echocardiography has the potential to image myocardial perfusion along with wall motion and wall thickening. Substantial literature has now been accumulated on the value of stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of ischemic disease, preoperative risk assessment, and assessment of myocardial viability. Echocardiography has compared generally well with nuclear imaging techniques for the detection of angiographic coronary artery disease. Overall sensitivity, however, has been slightly less, particularly for the detection of single-vessel coronary disease, although specificity has been on average somewhat higher than nuclear cardiology techniques. Because of the potential for variability in study acquisition as well as interpretation, careful safeguards need to be employed. Specifically, meticulous technique needs to be applied to obtain high-quality images and to assure that those images are obtained promptly after treadmill exercise stress. Only readers with specific interest and expertise should interpret stress echocardiography studies. Continuing efforts need to be made to assess and minimize variability and to assure continuing quality improvement. Advances in instrumentation, including evolving technology for real-time 3-dimensional imaging, and echocardiography contrast assessment of myocardial perfusion will likely improve the sensitivity of echocardiography and further extend its usefulness.

### Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective major non-cardiac surgery: population based cohort study [^66ea4684]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Every year, approximately 900 000 adults worldwide experience major cardiac complications after surgery, which are associated with increased mortalityand hospital stay. Preoperative non-invasive cardiac stress testing may help prevent these complications. This strategy detects underlying ischaemic heart disease and identifies individuals who might benefit from preoperative interventions, aggressive intraoperative haemodynamic management, closer postoperative surveillance, or avoiding surgery. Additionally, the results of stress testing can guide the use of perioperative β blockade, which has greatest benefit in patients with inducible ischaemia. Given these benefits, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines recommend preoperative non-invasive stress testing, but only in individuals with clinical risk factors for cardiac complications.

Conversely, some authors have discouraged the use of preoperative stress testingbecause it may delay surgery and has not been shown to improve postoperative outcomes. Instead, they advocate routine perioperative β blockade. This recommendation was supported by the Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echo II (DECREASE II) randomised trial, which evaluated routine stress testing in intermediate risk patients receiving perioperative β blockade. The study found no significant effect of preoperative stress testing on cardiac complications. None the less, the estimated effect had a wide 95% confidence interval (odds ratio 0.28 to 2.91) that did not exclude either substantial benefit or harm. Additionally, the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation (POISE) trial has raised concerns about the safety of perioperative β blockade.

Given the potential benefits of preoperative stress testing but the lack of proved impact on outcomes, we undertook a population based cohort study of non-invasive cardiac stress testing in Ontario, Canada. Our objective was to determine whether stress testing before major elective non-cardiac surgery was associated with improved one year survival and reduced hospital stay.

### The emerging role of exercise testing and stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease [^8d05e612]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Exercise testing has an established role in the evaluation of patients with valvular heart disease and can aid clinical decision making. Because symptoms may develop slowly and indolently in chronic valve diseases and are often not recognized by patients and their physicians, the symptomatic, blood pressure, and electrocardiographic responses to exercise can help identify patients who would benefit from early valve repair or replacement. In addition, stress echocardiography has emerged as an important component of stress testing in patients with valvular heart disease, with relevant established and potential applications. Stress echocardiography has the advantages of its wide availability, low cost, and versatility for the assessment of disease severity. The versatile applications of stress echocardiography can be tailored to the individual patient with aortic or mitral valve disease, both before and after valve replacement or repair. Hence, exercise-induced changes in valve hemodynamics, ventricular function, and pulmonary artery pressure, together with exercise capacity and symptomatic responses to exercise, provide the clinician with diagnostic and prognostic information that can contribute to subsequent clinical decisions. Nevertheless, there is a lack of convincing evidence that the results of stress echocardiography lead to clinical decisions that result in better outcomes, and therefore large-scale prospective randomized studies focusing on patient outcomes are needed in the future.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to stress testing, ACC/ACS/AHA/ASNC/HRS/SCA/SCCT/SCMR/SVM 2024 guidelines recommend to do not obtain routine stress testing before NCS in patients at low risk for perioperative cardiovascular events, with adequate functional capacity and stable symptoms, or undergoing low-risk procedures due to lack of benefit.

### Clinical outcomes after cardiac stress testing among US patients younger than 65 years [^0ac0dd03]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patient‐Centered Stress Testing

Although clinical outcomes represent an important component of value, few studies have explored the use of patient‐centered outcomes after stress testing. There is some evidence that patients may still choose to undergo testing despite counseling that (1) they have a low pretest probability of disease and (2) testing in low‐risk individuals increases the likelihood of false‐positive tests that may prompt an invasive procedure with concurrent risks. 24, 25 As the healthcare system shifts away from a fee‐for‐service model to one that emphasizes patient satisfaction and achievement of good clinical outcomes at lower cost, 26, 27 novel means of measuring and improving stress test value from patient‐centered perspectives could be considered.

Limitations

An important limitation is the lack of indication for stress testing in our data, and therefore the proportion of stress tests performed for indications other than evaluation for obstructive coronary artery disease was unknown. However, we excluded patients with a prior diagnosis of arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy to minimize this effect. Symptoms prompting performance of stress testing were not available to us, and therefore the pretest probability of obstructive coronary artery disease or the appropriateness of referrals for testing was not known. Certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as family history of early coronary artery disease or tobacco use, as well as medication use before testing, were not available in our data. Death was not used as an outcome because it was not available in our data set. Stress test results, parameters, and patient preferences for treatment were not available in our data, and therefore patients who may have been medically treated for coronary artery disease after stress testing were not captured in our cohort. Only patients who had at least 1 year of membership in the managed care company after stress testing were included in the study. Thus, disenrollment of sicker patients over time could have had the effect of underestimating true event rates after stress testing. Finally, given that our population only included commercially insured patients from a single managed care company, our results may not be fully generalizable to other health systems or insurance providers.

American Society of Anesthesiologists practice advisory — preanesthesia cardiac evaluation other than ECG: Preanesthesia cardiac evaluation may include consultation with specialists and ordering, requiring, or performing tests that range from noninvasive passive or provocative screening tests (e.g., stress testing) to noninvasive and invasive assessment of cardiac structure, function, and vascularity (e.g., echocardiogram, radionucleotide imaging, cardiac catheterization). Anesthesiologists should balance the risks and costs of these evaluations against their benefits, and clinical characteristics to consider include cardiovascular risk factors and type of surgery.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 155: urinary incontinence in women [^c2d0e7b4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Multichannel urodynamic testing — use in evaluation and preoperative planning for stress urinary incontinence — is outlined as follows: Most experts do not recommend urodynamic testing in the initial evaluation of uncomplicated urinary incontinence, and diagnosis by urodynamic testing does not better predict which patients would benefit from nonsurgical treatments versus diagnosis by patients' symptom reports. Randomized controlled trial data indicate that a basic office evaluation (normal postvoid residual urine volume, negative urinalysis, and positive cough stress test) is not inferior to urodynamic testing for women with stress-predominant urinary incontinence undergoing anti-incontinence surgery, and in women with uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence, outcomes 1 year after midurethral sling surgery were the same with or without preoperative urodynamic testing. Thus, preoperative multichannel urodynamic testing is not necessary before planning primary anti-incontinence surgery in women with uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence (defined as postvoid residual urine volume less than 150 mL, negative urinalysis result, a positive cough stress test result, and no pelvic organ prolapse beyond the hymen); however, women with complicated stress urinary incontinence may benefit from multichannel urodynamic testing before treatment, and clinical judgment should guide whether to test or refer to a specialist.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^eea3604e]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Key points — stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: Stress echocardiography accuracy is similar to other stress imaging techniques for detecting angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD) and provides similar prognostic information compared with other stress imaging modalities and computed tomography angiography. Comparative studies have not considered the incremental value of stress echocardiography's additional information at the time of testing (e.g., wall thicknesses, chamber sizes, valvular abnormalities, diastolic function). Contractile reserve by dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) compares favorably for predicting recovery of systolic function of viable segments; compared to perfusion imaging techniques, DSE has mildly lower sensitivity but better specificity. The absence of radiation or need for gadolinium and cost benefit make stress echocardiography attractive for many patients.

### Exercise and type 2 diabetes: the American College of Sports Medicine and the American diabetes association: joint position statement [^037f8e73]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

PREEXERCISE EVALUATION

Safe exercise participation can be complicated by the presence of diabetes-related health complications such as CVD, hypertension, neuropathy, or microvascular changes. For individuals desiring to participate in low-intensity PA such as walking, health care providers should use clinical judgment in deciding whether to recommend preexercise testing. Conducting exercise stress testing before walking is unnecessary. No evidence suggests that it is routinely necessary as a CVD diagnostic tool, and requiring it may create barriers to participation.

For exercise more vigorous than brisk walking or exceeding the demands of everyday living, sedentary and older diabetic individuals will likely benefit from being assessed for conditions that might be associated with risk of CVD, contraindicate certain activities, or predispose to injuries, including severe peripheral neuropathy, severe autonomic neuropathy, and preproliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Before undertaking new higher-intensity PA, they are advised to undergo a detailed medical evaluation and screening for BG control, physical limitations, medications, and macrovascular and microvascular complications.

This assessment may include a graded exercise test depending on the age of the person, diabetes duration, and the presence of additional CVD risk factors. The prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) is greater in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and maximal graded exercise testing can identify a small proportion of asymptomatic persons with severe coronary artery obstruction.

Most young individuals with a low CAD risk may not benefit from preexercise stress testing. In the Look AHEAD trial, although exercise-induced abnormalities were present in 1,303 (22.5%) participants, only older age was associated with increased prevalence of all abnormalities during maximal testing. A systematic review of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that stress testing should not be routinely recommended to detect ischemia in asymptomatic individuals with a low CAD risk (< 10% risk of a cardiac event more than 10 years) because the risks from invasive testing done after a false-positive test outweigh the benefits of its detection. The lower the CAD risk, the higher the chance of a false positive.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^0ed9449f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Key points for stress echocardiography emphasize that exercise stress tests are more physiologic than pharmacologic stress tests and include the prognostically important finding of the patient's exercise capacity, and thus if a patient can exercise this is the preferred stress modality (Class of recommendation I, level of evidence A); bicycle stress echocardiography (upright or supine) is technically more feasible for assessment of both coronary flow reserve and diastology; DSE is a preferred alternative test for evaluation of myocardial ischemia when a patient cannot exercise; and diagnostic endpoints include achievement of at least 80% of the age- and sex-predicted workload for exercise testing and target HR for DSE.

### Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective major non-cardiac surgery: population based cohort study [^a54ac9da]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Our results are largely consistent with the position of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines, which emphasise stress testing specifically in individuals who are undergoing intermediate to high risk surgery and have one or more clinical risk factors (for example, ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or renal insufficiency). These guidelines also suggest, however, that testing be restricted to individuals who concurrently have poor or unknown functional capacity. As described above, our data sources did not capture information on exercise tolerance; consequently, further research is needed to determine whether the prognostic significance of preoperative stress testing in intermediate to high risk surgical patients varies with their functional capacity.

The beneficial effects of stress testing on mortality risk in intermediate to high risk patients are likely to be the result of a reduction in perioperative cardiac complications. Prevention of such complications would be expected to improve both length of hospital stayand one year survival. By comparison, testing was not associated with any difference in the risk of surgical site infections.

Several plausible mechanisms might, in combination, explain a reduction in cardiac complications among individuals who underwent stress testing. Firstly, the results of preoperative stress testing can help guide perioperative drug therapy with β blockers or statins. β blockade across a broad spectrum of surgical patients may cause harm, but it has been associated with strong benefits in patients with multiple clinical risk factors, especially in those with inducible ischaemia. Thus, preoperative stress testing may help identify subgroups of patients that would benefit from β blocker therapy. Similarly, evidence of ischaemic heart disease on preoperative testing may indicate that a patient requires statin therapy, which is also associated with improved postoperative outcomes.

Secondly, clinicians could use preoperative testing to determine which patients warrant closer postoperative surveillance. This hypothesis is supported by the higher rate of postoperative admission to monitored beds among patients who had undergone stress testing before surgery. Thirdly, stress testing can identify patients with high risk ischaemic heart disease who meet usual indications for revascularisationor who would benefit from avoiding surgery. Finally, clinicians might use the results of preoperative testing to determine which patients require more aggressive clinical care, such as stringent haemodynamic management.

### Stress nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging versus stress echocardiography: prognostic comparisons [^241d6926]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The use of noninvasive stress cardiac imaging for stratifying risk in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease is growing as a tool for identification of the subgroup most likely to benefit from the expense and risk of more invasive procedures, including cardiac catheterization and coronary revascularization. In this setting, it is especially important that a test be able to identify patients with sufficiently low risk that clinicians are comfortable in deferring such interventions, especially in those with other markers of increased risk. Previous data have shown that cardiac risk is most closely related to the presence and extent of jeopardized viable myocardium on noninvasive stress cardiac imaging. Although stress echocardiography may have comparable ability to detect coronary artery disease, current data suggest that stress echocardiography detects significantly less jeopardized viable myocardium than stress nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging and consequently fewer patients at risk for cardiac events. Stress nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging may therefore have important advantages for risk stratification and the direction of future care of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.

### Clinical outcomes after cardiac stress testing among US patients younger than 65 years [^386a0778]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Optimizing the utilization of noninvasive cardiac tests has proved challenging. Stress tests may be particularly prone to overuse because they are readily available as a result of technology proliferation, potentially lucrative to providers and health systems, and can be used in a number of clinical situations to provide reassurance to both patients and providers. 14, 15 Growing concerns about high healthcare costs, radiation exposure from medical imaging, and unnecessary invasive testing have spurred efforts to use stress tests more effectively. 16, 17, 18, 19 However, the success of efforts such as dissemination of appropriate use criteria and "low‐value" lists has been mixed. 8, 20 Furthermore, even though most patients who receive elective coronary angiography undergo prior stress testing, only 38% of patients are found to have obstructive coronary artery disease according to a prior study. 21 Routine measurement of clinical outcomes after stress testing, rather than stress test appropriateness or stress test performance, could potentially serve as a novel measure to improve use of stress testing.

Risk of Subsequent Clinical Outcomes

In the lowest likelihood quintile for AMI and/or coronary revascularization after stress testing, the rate of subsequent clinical events was low (0.5%, or a number needed to test of 200 patients). This group was largely comprised women under the age of 45 with a low prevalence of identifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors. While it is well established that young age and female sex are associated with lower risk for coronary artery disease, 22, 23 symptoms of concern for obstructive coronary artery disease or other risk factors such as family history of early cardiovascular disease may still have prompted testing among these patients. Similarly, some patients were more likely to undergo angiography without revascularization after stress testing, including patients aged 55 to 64, of black race, and located in the Southern United States. The clinical reasons for referral to coronary angiography are not known, but may include changes in symptoms after stress testing, a "true positive" stress test prompting angiography and subsequent medical treatment for obstructive coronary artery disease, or a "false positive" stress test result prompting angiography but not revascularization. Our results underscore the need for accurate assessment of pretest probability of disease and the likelihood of future clinical events to guide referrals for stress testing.

### Risk assessment and predictive value of coronary artery disease testing [^7a861f6e]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This review highlights and compares risk assessment, predictive accuracy, and economic outcomes for 3 commonly applied cardiac imaging procedures: stress myocardial perfusion SPECT or PET and coronary CT angiography (CCTA). This review highlights an expansive evidence base for stress myocardial perfusion imaging and reveals a decided advantage for higher-risk patients, notably those who have established coronary artery disease (CAD). It is likely that the use of CCTA will continue to expand, particularly for patients with more atypical symptoms and patients with a lower likelihood of CAD. Despite a high level of evidence, comparative research is not available across modalities that could definitively drive utilization of cardiac imaging modalities.

### Cost-effectiveness of stress echocardiography and nuclear perfusion imaging [^d316e81a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a method of comparing societal economic value of 2 different strategies. Ideally, it defines accurate test-related (direct and downstream) costs and appropriately converts differential patient outcomes into a dollar value. The likelihood that cost-effectiveness analysis translated into a policy-making tool will enhance health care and/or control costs is dependent on the validity of numerous assumptions about relative costs, patient outcomes, and generalizability of the literature to regional capabilities. The purpose of this report is to review the concept of cost-effectiveness analysis as it applies to stress echocardiography and stress myocardial perfusion imaging for selected patient subsets.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain diagnostic modality selection — age, obesity, and exercise capacity guide test choice: Patients ≥ 65 years of age have a higher likelihood of ischemia and obstructive coronary artery disease, and contemporary randomized trials support that candidates for elective coronary angiography may be safely triaged using coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) or noninvasive testing. Imaging of obese patients, especially those with morbid obesity (body mass index > 40), can be challenging and requires careful consideration of available equipment. In patients selected for stress imaging who are able to exercise, exercise testing is preferred over pharmacologic stress to improve diagnostic and prognostic information. Although positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are grouped together, PET has improved diagnostic and prognostic performance, especially when quantitative assessment of myocardial blood flow (MBF) can be performed. Irrespective of the test performed, an overarching goal is to identify those who would benefit from guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and the patient should be engaged in a process of shared decision-making before determining the final choice of the cardiac test modality and in guiding the pathway for treatment decisions.

### Arm exercise stress testing: diagnostic options in stable coronary artery disease [^a514e3b7]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Xie et al recognised that a large proportion of patients referred for stress testing were unable to perform the required exercise for the test due to common comorbidities such as peripheral vascular disease and arthritis. In a previous paperthey demonstrated that, in this population, measures derived from arm exercise ECG stress testing (figure 1) were a feasible alternative to physiological and pharmacological stress imaging with SPECT. In the current paper, published in Open Heart, they used the same retrospective cohort to produce a risk stratification score analogous to that commonly used for treadmill stress testing. The equations produced, incorporating arm exercise capacity, 1 min heart rate recovery and ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm, perform well in predicting future cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality and total mortality, especially once adjusted to account for common adverse clinical characteristics.

Figure 1
A patient performing arm exercise stress testing.

Some limitations of the study should be acknowledged. The cohort examined had a markedly high mortality rate (27.1% at 5 years and 57.8% at 12 years) reflecting a very high-risk for adverse events. Current approaches tend to use stress ECG tests in patients with lower pretest probability of occlusive CAD, meaning that the performance of the test may not be as good in the population it is to be applied in. Against this, the higher mortality likely reflects the additional burden of comorbidity in this patient group and this would still be the case in clinical practice.

Another consideration is where to place arm exercise stress testing among the plethora of diagnostic options available, especially as existing guidance favours a stress-imaging approach even in low-intermediate probability patients. Despite this, there are some situations where the stress ECG option proves useful. Cardiologists are considering treatment options for an increasing number of patients with multiple comorbidities, including those that limit mobility. Stress ECG testing is a viable option to confirm diagnosis in such patients who would not be suitable for or would not want invasive management of CAD, so reducing the need for functional imaging. Those who have diagnosis confirmed derive substantial symptomatic and prognostic benefit from medical therapy while those who have occlusive CAD excluded are spared the side effects and risks of polypharmacy. It is also important to remember that, even if management stays the same, diagnostic and prognostic information can still be useful for patients and their relatives.

Finally, the current study is retrospective and the scores created need refinement and validation using randomised, prospective data. Ideally, this work should also incorporate measures to consider patient acceptability of the test and health economic evaluation.

### Stress test in the emergency department… [^0045135b]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Chest pain is one of the most challenging symptoms for emergency medicine physicians to evaluate. They must identify patients with cardiac ischemia without subjecting all patients, the overwhelming majority of whom do not have ischemia, to unnecessary testing. Most patients evaluated in the emergency department for chest pain who have normal electrocardiogram findings and negative results of cardiac biomarker tests do not have cardiac ischemia. Thus, the question should not be what further testing to perform, but should any further testing be done in the ED. The study by Foy et al1 in this issue of JAMAInternal Medicine sheds much light on this question. They found that, after more than 6 months of follow-up, only 0. 33% of all patients who received treatment for chest pain in the ED were hospitalized with a myocardial infarction.

Even more important, this very low risk was the same in patients who underwent cardiac testing compared with those who did not undergo testing. These findings suggest that the current practice of performing a stress test on low-risk patients in the ED is unnecessary and prolongs the length of stay in EDs as well as increases unnecessary medical imaging, with a significant associated radiation risk for tests that include nuclear imaging. It is time to change our guidelines and practice for treatment of chest pain in low-risk patients. Such patients should be given a close follow-up appointment with a primary care physician who can determine, based on the patient's condition, whether further evaluation is necessary.

### Clinical practice guideline: age-related hearing loss [^5e54c6a0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Age-related hearing loss — Statement 4: Hearing test — If screening suggests hearing loss, clinicians should obtain or refer to a clinician who can obtain an audiogram. Evidence strength is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled studies and SRs with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action Statement Profile 4 highlights a quality improvement opportunity in which identification of degree and type of hearing loss allows for appropriate intervention for the management of hearing loss. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for the accuracy of audiograms with diagnosing hearing loss based on multiple RCTs and SRs, and Grade B for use of app-based testing, online testing, tablet-based testing, and other objective modalities based on large variations in cross-sectional studies and limited RCTs. The level of confidence in the evidence is high for audiograms and moderate for other modalities. Listed benefits include earlier identification of severity of hearing loss, support for early and time-appropriate intervention, enrollment into appropriate pathway to care, and provision of opportunity for patient education and counseling. Risks, harms, and costs noted include time, financial impact on clinicians and patients, cost of equipment, additional training and possible additional staff for screening, stigma, false positives causing stress and distress, false negatives missing hearing loss, increased demand of resources such as audiology services, anxiety, and downstream services that may be needed.

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^5ed3643b]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Comparative effectiveness research in women with ischemic symptoms — priorities and ongoing trials are highlighted, noting that comparative effectiveness registries and trials to optimally guide the diagnostic evaluation and improved treatment evidence for symptomatic women should be a high priority. The goal of this requisite evidence would be to ascertain long-term effectiveness data comparing stress testing or anatomic testing with no testing or alternative approaches for the diagnostic evaluation of women with ischemic symptoms. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain is an ongoing comparative effectiveness trial of functional stress testing (with exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, or stress myocardial perfusion imaging [MPI]) compared with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for the evaluation of > 8000 patients presenting for a diagnostic evaluation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive stress imaging, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining exercise treadmill testing to determine whether the symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, assess the severity of symptoms, evaluate functional capacity, and guide management in patients with chronic coronary disease and a change in symptoms or functional capacity persisting despite guideline-directed medical therapy.

Intermediate-high risk stable chest pain without known CAD — test selection and expected yields: Test choice should be guided by local availability and expertise, and The approach to the diagnostic evaluation of patients with no known CAD who are at intermediate to high risk (Figure 12) should be guided by the ability to achieve high-quality imaging as well as local availability and expertise. Selection between modalities is framed as *Test choice guided by patient's exercise capacity, resting electrocardiographic abnormalities; CCTA preferable in those < 65 years of age and not on optimal preventive therapies; stress testing favored in those ≥ 65 years of age (with a higher likelihood of ischemia). Expected prevalence is stated as Intermediate-high risk patients have modest rates of obstructive CAD (~10%–20%) and risk of clinical events (~1%–2% per year).

Stress testing — prognostic value and comparative effectiveness: The prognostic value of stress echocardiography has been demonstrated in large observational series with low rates of CAD events for patients with normal test results, particularly those with good exercise tolerance, and in the PROMISE trial patients randomized to stress testing had no difference in the primary outcome compared to CCTA. For stress nuclear imaging, multicenter registries support effective risk stratification based on rest/stress measures of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and left ventricular function, randomized comparisons reveal similar 1- to 3-year outcomes versus other noninvasive tests, and two multicenter trials evaluated cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)–guided strategies. In CE-MARC 2 (n = 1202), both CMR and SPECT MPI had similar rates of unnecessary invasive angiography (7.1%–7.5%), compared with standard testing for chest pain (28.8%; P < 0.001), and MR-INFORM randomized 918 patients, where CMR was associated with less coronary revascularization (P = 0.005) and a similar event rate (death, AMI, or target vessel revascularization; P = 0.91). Although PET and SPECT are grouped together, PET has improved diagnostic and prognostic performance, and a recent clinical trial (n = 475) reported a higher diagnostic accuracy with stress PET MPI compared with other stress test modalities.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Anatomic testing with CCTA — diagnostic accuracy and outcomes versus stress testing: Clinical trials report a higher diagnostic sensitivity for CCTA compared with stress testing for detecting obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on invasive coronary angiography (ICA). From the PROMISE trial, the 3-year CAD event rate for negative test findings was 0.9% for CCTA versus 2.1% for stress testing, and trials comparing CCTA versus stress testing report similar near-term effectiveness (at ~2–3 years of follow-up). In the SCOT-HEART trial, adding CCTA to standard care reduced 5-year CAD death or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) versus standard care alone (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41–0.84; P = 0.004). In a prespecified PROMISE analysis of patients with diabetes, CCTA was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (MI) than stress testing (adjusted HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18–0.79; P = 0.01). From the CONSERVE trial, an initial CCTA strategy was associated with lower cost and similar 1-year major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rates as direct ICA (4.6% versus 4.6%), and CCTA more often prompts initiation and intensification of preventive and anti-ischemic therapies than other diagnostic strategies.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^91462715]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Preoperative cardiac evaluation — functional capacity and stress testing recommendations indicate that stable patients with exercise capacity ≥ 4 METs are at relatively low risk for perioperative cardiac events. In the CARP trial of 510 patients with documented CAD (at least 1 lesion with ≥ 70% stenosis), those assigned to revascularization experienced a 36-day delay to surgery, and there was no difference in perioperative MI at 30 days or in all-cause mortality at a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Because the benefits of preoperative revascularization appear to be limited, routine preoperative stress testing should not be performed in patients with adequate functional capacity, and preoperative stress testing is not recommended in low-risk patients (eg, RCRI = 0) or in stable patients undergoing low-risk NCS. This applies to patients with or without known or suspected CAD or cardiovascular risk factors.

### Can chatGPT answer patients' questions about nuclear stress tests andF-flurodeoxyglucose PET for myocardial inflammation? [^8993ebad]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Several modalities are used for stress testing and require specific patient preparation. 18 F-Flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) is an important tool in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients suspected of cardiac sarcoidosis and endocarditis [1–3]. There is a need for improved patient access to questions regarding cardiac testing to ensure proper adherence to instructions. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT in answering questions about stress testing and cardiac FDG PET inflammation scans.

Methods and Results

We generated fifty-eight questions about stress testing and cardiac FDG PET inflammation scans. OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5 and -4o were used to answer the questions. The answers were graded by three nuclear cardiologists as the following categories: 1 = correct and complete, 2 = somewhat correct/somewhat complete, 3 = incorrect: no benefit, or 4 = incorrect: harmful/misleading information (Table I). Of the 174 grades assigned to responses to the questions from ChatGPT-3.5, 62/174 (36%) were correct and complete, 93/174 (53%) were somewhat correct/somewhat complete, 12/174 (7%) were incorrect: no benefit, 7/174 (4%) were incorrect: harmful/misleading information. Of the grades assigned to responses to questions from ChatGPT-4o, 107/174 (61%) were correct and complete, 62/174 (36%) were somewhat correct/somewhat complete, 3/174 (2%) were incorrect: no benefit, and 2/174 (1%) were incorrect: harmful/misleading information.

Conclusions

ChatGPT can provide some accurate responses to patient questions regarding stress tests and cardiac FDG PET inflammation studies, and its accuracy has improved over time; however, it is not suitable as a primary resource for clinical care at this stage of development.

### Update on exercise stress testing [^ac214118]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Exercise stress testing is an important diagnostic tool for the evaluation of suspected or known cardiac disease. In 2002, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) revised their guidelines for exercise testing. Ten categories from the ACC/ AHA 1997 guidelines were modified: ST heart rate adjustment, unstable angina, older patients, acute coronary syndromes, chest pain centers, acute myocardial infarction, asymptomatic patients, valvular heart disease, rhythm disturbances, and hypertension. Adjustment of the ST heart rate can identify myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic patients with elevated cardiac risk. Intermediate- and low-risk patients with unstable angina, acute coronary syndromes, or chest pain should undergo exercise stress testing when clinically stable. Provided they are stable, patients who have had acute myocardial infarction can undergo a submaximal exercise test before discharge or a symptom-limited exercise stress test any time after two to three weeks have elapsed. In asymptomatic patients with cardiac risk factors, the exercise stress test may provide valuable prognostic information. Aortic regurgitation is the only valvular heart disorder in which there is significant evidence that exercise stress testing is useful in management decisions. The stress test also can be used in older patients to identify the presence of coronary artery disease. However, because of other comorbidities, a pharmacologic stress test may be necessary. Exercise stress testing can help physicians successfully evaluate arrhythmia in patients with syncope. The exercise stress test also can help identify patients at risk of developing hypertension if they show an abnormal hypertensive response to exercise.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the evidence-based use of integrative therapies during and after breast cancer treatment [^e00c811f]. CA (2017). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer stress management — risk/benefit and implementation — Stress-management therapy is noninvasive, nontoxic, and has no appreciable risk to patients, and it does not require specialized equipment and can be implemented in a variety of locations. Because the majority of trials discussed above tested long-term interventions, the guideline recommendation is specific to long-term stress-management programs. However, this may be complicated by factors such as potential increased cost of delivery and barriers related to access-to-care and health care disparities. Overall, it is recommended that stress-management therapy can be safely and effectively implemented in clinical settings for patients with breast cancer.

### Which test should I order for an inpatient evaluation of cardiac ischemia? [^0970ae75]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractTesting for cardiac ischemia, or for the obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) that causes cardiac ischemia, is common among hospitalized patients. Many testing options exist. Choosing an appropriate test can be challenging and requires accurate risk stratification. Two major categories of testing are available: stress testing (also known as functional testing) and anatomical testing. Stress testing evaluates specifically for ischemia and can be conducted with or without imaging. Anatomical testing visualizes the obstructive CAD that causes ischemia. This article reviews how to choose an appropriate test for the evaluation of cardiac ischemia in the inpatient setting, using case examples to illustrate the considerations involved.

### Stress testing for risk stratification of patients with low to moderate probability of acute cardiac ischemia [^8a12d072]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In summary, this article focused on the use of stress testing to risk-stratify patients at the conclusion of their emergency evaluation for ACI. As discussed, those patients in the probably not ACI category require additional risk stratification prior to discharge. It should be kept in mind that patients in this category are heterogeneous, containing subgroups at both higher and lower risk of ACI and cardiac events. The patients with lower pretest probability for ACI may only need exercise testing in the ED. Patients with higher pretest probability should undergo myocardial perfusion or echocardiographic stress testing to maximize diagnostic and prognostic information. Prognostic information is the key to provocative testing in the ED. Prognostic information is the component that will help emergency physicians identify the patients who may be discharged home safely without having to worry about a 6% annual cardiac death rate and a 10% overall death rate over the next 30 months. Stress testing provides this key prognostic data, and it can be obtained in short-stay chest pain observation units in a safe, timely, and cost-effective fashion.

Stress testing — prognostic value and comparative trials: the prognostic value of stress echocardiography has been demonstrated in large observational series with low rates of CAD events for patients with normal test results, and in the PROMISE trial patients randomized to stress testing had no difference in the primary outcomes of death, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or major procedural complications as compared to CCTA. Randomized trials comparing rest/stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with other noninvasive tests revealed similar 1- to 3-year outcomes, and in CE-MARC 2 (n = 1202) both cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and SPECT MPI had similar rates (ie, 7.1%–7.5%) of unnecessary invasive angiography, compared with standard testing for chest pain (28.8%; P < 0.0001).

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^78b954ce]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Stress testing modalities (Table 2) — exercise (bicycle/treadmill), dobutamine, and dipyridamole/adenosine — are contrasted by physiology, test selection, hemodynamics, and contraindications. Exercise preserves integrity of the electro-mechanical response and is the preferred stress for patients who can attain an adequate level of exercise for known or suspected CAD, with systolic blood pressure ↑↑ by 50%. Dobutamine stimulates beta-1 adrenoceptors with the effect of increased heart rate and/or contractility; contraindications include hemodynamically significant LV outflow tract obstruction and severe systemic hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg). Vasodilators increase coronary blood flow through effects on adenosine A2A receptors, and myocardial blood flow may be ↑ 3 to 5 times that of resting blood flow; they are the preferred test for myocardial perfusion, with contraindications including pronounced active bronchospastic airway disease.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^8a8fabf6]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography for risk stratification — Stress echocardiography is a useful technique for the risk stratification of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), with studies documenting prognostic use across symptoms, known CAD, prior coronary artery revascularization, prior myocardial infarction, and asymptomatic patients with risk factors for CAD. A normal exercise echocardiogram result is associated with an annual event rate of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction of less than 1%, equivalent to that of an age- and sex-matched population, and these patients do not require further diagnostic evaluation unless there is a change in clinical status. Patients with a normal pharmacologic stress echocardiogram result have a slightly higher event rate. Patients with extensive stress-induced abnormalities in a multivessel distribution are at a high risk of mortality and cardiac events, and in these patients, coronary angiography and subsequent myocardial revascularization may be justified. An exercise wall-motion score index greater than 1.4 or exercise ejection fraction (EF) less than 50% portends a significantly worse prognosis. Baseline left ventricular (LV) function expressed as wall-motion score index or EF remains a powerful predictor, and patients with resting LV dysfunction but no inducible myocardial ischemia have an intermediate risk, whereas patients with resting LV dysfunction and new wall-motion abnormalities have the greatest risk for death and cardiac events.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Add-on anatomic and adjunctive testing after stress testing — Use of CCTA after stress testing can diagnose or exclude obstructive CAD and identify patients who may benefit from referral to ICA. The ISCHEMIA trial used CCTA after site-determined moderate-to-severe ischemia to exclude patients with nonobstructive CAD and identify those with significant left main stenosis for prompt referral to ICA, and half of the screen failures were identified by CCTA including those with nonobstructive CAD or unprotected left main CAD. Observational registry data suggest that adding CAC can improve risk assessment, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, help detect atherosclerotic plaque, and guide preventive management. After an initial exercise ECG, further stress imaging is supported to improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification, and for symptomatic patients with negative stress test findings, selective use of CCTA or invasive coronary angiography can help detect obstructive CAD and atherosclerotic plaque.

### Ischemia and No obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA): what is the risk? [^4db0cfbf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, treadmill ECG stress testing, stress echocardiography, and single photon emission computed tomography stress all have a limited sensitivity and specificity for detection of ischemia in INOCA patients. 57 This is not surprising given the lack of a large regional territory of ischemia, as in the obstructive CAD populations used to validate these techniques. Among subjects from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's Cath Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (CathPCI) undergoing invasive coronary angiography for stable chest pain, while low‐ or intermediate‐risk findings on noninvasive testing were associated with no obstructive CAD, the ability to predict MACE was not tested. 58 Notably, > 50% of MACE occurred in subjects with normal stress testing in the PROMISE, 59 emphasizing the lower sensitivity and specificity to detect ischemia in less than obstructive CAD. An anatomical computed coronary tomography angiography approach offered better prognostic information once NOCAD was visualized. 59 Furthermore, mechanisms leading to acute coronary syndromes are not solely depending on degree of luminal stenosis. An ischemic event is the consequence of a complex interaction among plaque characteristics, endothelial dysfunction, coronary blood flow hemodynamics, hemostasis factors, and metabolic, inflammatory, neurohormonal, and environmental factors 60 that are not addressed by commonly used tests.

### Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective major non-cardiac surgery: population based cohort study [^dbc3227c]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the association of non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgery with survival and hospital stay.

Design Population based retrospective cohort study.

Setting Acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between 1 April 1994 and 31 March 2004.

Participants Patients aged 40 years or older who underwent specific elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgical procedures.

Interventions Non-invasive cardiac stress testing performed within six months before surgery.

Main outcome measures Postoperative one year survival and length of stay in hospital.

Results Of the 271 082 patients in the entire cohort, 23 991 (8.9%) underwent stress testing. After propensity score methods were used to reduce important differences between patients who did or did not undergo preoperative stress testing and assemble a matched cohort (n = 46 120), testing was associated with improved one year survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; P = 0.03) and reduced mean hospital stay (difference −0.24 days, 95% CI −0.07 to −0.43; P < 0.001). In an analysis of subgroups defined by Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) class, testing was associated with harm in low risk patients (RCRI 0 points: HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.74), but with benefit in patients who were at intermediate risk (RCRI 1–2 points: 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99) or high risk (RCRI 3–6 points: 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97).

Conclusions Preoperative non-invasive cardiac stress testing is associated with improved one year survival and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgery. These benefits principally apply to patients with risk factors for perioperative cardiac complications.

Use of Clinical Data in Adjudicating Stress Testing Value

Previous studies used administrative claims data to estimate the proportion of stress testing that is considered to be low value (ie, provides no net benefit) among patients with stable ischemic heart disease. One study suggested that the rate of low-value stress testing may range between 1 and 8 per 1000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries annually and cost between $212 million and $2.8 billion. Other studies similarly used administrative claims data to examine whether there are differences in use of low-value stress testing between health care systems, health care payers, and payment models (fee-for-service vs value-based). In contrast, the present study supplemented administrative claims data with detailed medical record review to understand whether stress testing may have been performed in accordance with the clinical guideline. In this context, the results suggest that without clinical data to ascertain patient symptoms, it is likely that a large proportion of stress tests that were considered to be low value in previous studies may have been clinically indicated; therefore, the true prevalence of low-value stress testing may be lower than previously reported. Future studies are needed that use clinical data to adjudicate the value of stress tests and procedures that may be indicated because of symptoms or other data, which are not generally available in administrative claims data.

Table 12 — Recommendations for stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms or suspected stable coronary artery disease — non-invasive testing for ischemic heart disease (IHD) states that in suspected stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with intermediate pretest probability and preserved ejection fraction, stress imaging, such as stress echocardiography, is preferred as the initial test option; in patients without typical angina, an imaging stress test is recommended as the initial test for diagnosing stable CAD if the pretest probability is high or if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced; with resting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities that prevent accurate interpretation of ECG changes during stress, an imaging stress test is recommended; with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and symptoms consistent with IHD, stress echocardiography (either exercise stress echocardiography [ESE] or dobutamine stress echocardiography [DSE]) is preferred over SPECT imaging because of greater specificity and versatility for detecting other cardiac conditions associated with LBBB; for women with an indication for a noninvasive imaging test for known or suspected CAD, stress echocardiography is the preferred test because of safety and greater specificity; for children with suspected IHD, ESE is the preferred imaging stress test because of the absence of radiation, the absence of need for an intravenous line, and the assessment of exercise capacity; a pharmacologic stress test such as DSE is recommended when patients who meet these indications are unable to exercise; in exertional dyspnea of uncertain etiology, stress echocardiography is the preferred test and tricuspid regurgitation velocity and diastolic function should be assessed at rest and with stress; an imaging stress test should be considered in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and new cardiac symptoms; and an imaging stress test should be considered to assess the functional severity of intermediate lesions on coronary arteriography.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^1d92f3a1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — adequate stress thresholds and strategies to address false-negative studies: Suboptimal stress is a primary cause of false-negative studies, and an adequate level of stress is frequently defined as achievement of 85% or more of the patient's age-predicted maximal heart rate for exercise or dobutamine stress and/or a rate-pressure product of 20,000 or more for exercise testing. For those who cannot exercise, pharmacologic stress and atrial pacing are suggested alternatives, and among nonexercise methods the highest heart rates and sensitivity may be achieved with atrial pacing. The use of atropine substantially enhances the sensitivity of dobutamine stress in the setting of beta-blockade and may be required to overcome Wenckebach heart block during atrial pacing, and small comparative studies suggest that imaging during peak exercise may detect abnormalities when posttreadmill images are negative.

### Exercise tolerance testing to screen for coronary heart disease: a systematic review for the technical support for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^b2088c66]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Exercise tolerance testing has been proposed as a means of better identifying asymptomatic patients at high risk for coronary heart disease events.

Purpose

To review the evidence on the use of exercise tolerance testing to screen adults with no history of cardiovascular disease for coronary heart disease.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database from 1966 through February 2003, hand-searching of bibliographies, and expert input.

Study Selection

Eligible studies evaluated the benefits or harms of exercise tolerance testing when added to traditional risk assessment for adults with no known history of cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted information from eligible articles into evidence tables, and another reviewer checked the tables. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

No study has directly examined the effect of screening asymptomatic patients with exercise tolerance testing on coronary heart disease outcomes or risk-reducing behaviors or therapies. Multiple cohort studies demonstrate that screening exercise tolerance testing identifies a small proportion of asymptomatic persons (up to 2.7% of those screened) with severe coronary artery obstruction who may benefit from revascularization. Several large prospective cohort studies, conducted principally in middle-aged men, suggest that exercise tolerance testing can provide independent prognostic information about the risk for future coronary heart disease events (relative risk with abnormal exercise tolerance testing, 2.0 to 5.0). However, when the risk for coronary heart disease events is low, most positive findings will be false and may result in unnecessary further testing or worry. The risk level at which the benefits of additional prognostic information outweigh the harms of false-positive results is unclear and requires further study.

Conclusions

Although screening exercise tolerance testing detects severe coronary artery obstruction in a small proportion of persons screened and can provide independent prognostic information about the risk for coronary heart disease events, the effect of this information on clinical management and disease outcomes in asymptomatic patients is unclear.

In the PROMISE trial, the 3-year CAD event rate for negative test findings was 0.9% for CCTA versus 2.1% for stress testing, and in SCOT-HEART the addition of CCTA to standard care reduced 5-year CAD death or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared with standard care alone (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41–0.84; P = 0.004). In a prespecified PROMISE analysis of patients with diabetes, CCTA was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (MI) than stress testing (adjusted HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18–0.79; P = 0.01). Several randomized trials compared CCTA versus direct referral to invasive coronary angiography (ICA), and from CONSERVE an initial CCTA strategy had lower cost and similar 1-year major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rates as direct ICA (4.6% versus 4.6%).

### Non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective major non-cardiac surgery: population based cohort study [^553c9442]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the association of non-invasive cardiac stress testing before elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgery with survival and hospital stay.

Design

Population based retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between 1 April 1994 and 31 March 2004.

Participants

Patients aged 40 years or older who underwent specific elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgical procedures.

Interventions

Non-invasive cardiac stress testing performed within six months before surgery.

Main Outcome Measures

Postoperative one year survival and length of stay in hospital.

Results

Of the 271 082 patients in the entire cohort, 23 991 (8.9%) underwent stress testing. After propensity score methods were used to reduce important differences between patients who did or did not undergo preoperative stress testing and assemble a matched cohort (n = 46 120), testing was associated with improved one year survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; P = 0.03) and reduced mean hospital stay (difference -0.24 days, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.43; P < 0.001). In an analysis of subgroups defined by Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) class, testing was associated with harm in low risk patients (RCRI 0 points: HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.74), but with benefit in patients who were at intermediate risk (RCRI 1–2 points: 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99) or high risk (RCRI 3–6 points: 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97).

Conclusions

Preoperative non-invasive cardiac stress testing is associated with improved one year survival and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective intermediate to high risk non-cardiac surgery. These benefits principally apply to patients with risk factors for perioperative cardiac complications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Stress testing for noncardiac surgery — when to test and when not to test: In patients undergoing elevated-risk noncardiac surgery (NCS) with poor or unknown functional capacity and elevated risk for perioperative cardiovascular events based on a validated risk tool, stress testing may be considered to evaluate for inducible myocardial ischemia; poor functional capacity is considered < 4 METs or a DASI score of ≤ 34. In contrast, in patients who are at low risk for perioperative cardiovascular events, have adequate functional capacity with stable symptoms, or who are undergoing low-risk procedures, routine stress testing before NCS is not recommended due to lack of benefit.

Conclusions

Coronary CTA improves the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected obstructive CAD based on stable chest pain when compared with functional stress testing. Diagnostic benefits of CTA over cardiac stress testing are seen across a wide range of clinical pretest probabilities and CTA should become widely adopted in patients with intermediate pretest probability.

Stress testing — cost–value considerations show differing test yields and downstream utilization. Exercise electrocardiographic results were 55.7% negative, 7.2% positive, and 37.1% inconclusive, whereas stress echocardiography results were 94.8% negative, 4.7% positive, and 0.5% inconclusive. Stress echocardiography was associated with fewer clinic and emergency visits, less coronary angiography (6.3% versus 13.4%; P = 0.02), lower mean costs (P = 0.04), and no difference in the composite of death, MI, unplanned revascularization, and hospitalization for chest pain (3.7% versus 3.2%; P = 0.38) at 3 years. Patients with good functional capacity and stable symptoms as well as low-risk patients undergoing low-risk NCS do not benefit from preoperative stress testing. Simulated results demonstrate that deferral of diagnostic testing in low-risk patients may be associated with greater patient health benefits and lower costs, with estimated cost reductions of −$749 (95% CI, −$1647 to −$158) in the PROMISE patients with 10% lowest risk and −$677 (95% CI, −$1383 to −$71) in the patients with 20% lowest risk.

### Population-based study on patterns of cardiac stress testing after percutaneous coronary intervention [^a9f4412f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The appropriate use criteria considers cardiac stress testing within 2 years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to be rarely appropriate, unless prompted by symptoms or change in clinical status. Little is known about the patterns of cardiac stress testing after PCI in the single-payer Canadian healthcare system, where mechanisms for reimbursement are different from the United States.

Methods and Results

Frequency and timing of cardiac stress testing within 2 years of PCI performed between April 2004 and March 2013 in Ontario, Canada, was determined from linked provincial databases. Subsequent rates of coronary angiography and revascularization after stress testing were ascertained. Of the 112 691 patients with PCI, 67 442 (59.8%) underwent at least 1 stress test, with 38 267 (34.0%) undergoing repeat stress testing (ie, > 1 stress test) within 2 years. Patients who underwent stress testing were younger, had less medical comorbidities, were more likely to reside in urban areas, and had higher incomes. Spikes in incidence of repeat stress testing were observed at 3 to 4 months, 6 to 7 months, and 12 to 13 months after the prior stress test. Of those tested, only 5.9% underwent subsequent coronary angiography, and only 3.1% underwent repeat revascularization within 60 days of stress testing.

Conclusions

More than half of all patients undergo cardiac stress testing within 2 years of PCI, with one third undergoing repeat stress tests. Only 1 of 30 tested patients underwent repeat revascularization. These findings reinforce the appropriate use criteria recommendations against routine stress testing after PCI. Further work is needed to aid with the selection of patients most likely to benefit from stress testing after PCI.

Exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) — diagnostic accuracy and prognostic thresholds are outlined, with lower diagnostic accuracy than stress imaging noted as "sensitivity and specificity range, 60%–77%", and in the WOMEN trial of "824 symptomatic women" exercise ECG was "equally effective" versus exercise SPECT MPI with "similar 2-year CAD event rates (2.0% versus 2.3%; P = 0.59)". Failure to complete Bruce stage 1 "or < 5 METs" or not achieving "85% of age predicted fitness level" increases CAD event risk, whereas "Bruce stage III or > 10 METs with a negative ECG" indicates low risk. After submaximal exercise or with "ischemic ECG ≥ 1.0 mm ST depression", additional stress imaging "may improve its detection and guide clinical management", and "Marked ischemia (eg, ≥ 2.0 mm at reduced workloads) or high Duke or Lauer scores" signifies increased risk and "such patients may benefit from additional testing (anatomic or stress testing)".

### Moving toward the optimal test for the assessment of myocardial ischemia [^9f1ffdea]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The past 2 decades have produced an unprecedented amount of research toward defining the optimal approach to patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). This has led to an enormous increase of knowledge, and the improved outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases have contributed significantly to longevity.

There is increasing agreement on various aspects of how to assess patients with suspected CAD and how to guide them toward revascularization, for example:
The diagnosis of CAD can be based on anatomy or function. Both have strong prognostic value, which may be additive rather than competitive. Medical therapy is guided toward reducing and stabilizing plaque as well as reducing myocardial ischemia.
Revascularization should be guided by functional assessment. It is well understood and generally agreed that patients without hemodynamically relevant coronary artery stenosis should not be revascularized. There are data but no consensus on which method should be used to prove hemodynamic significance.
Pretest likelihoods are frequently overestimated. This can be seen by the high number of negative tests in imaging and in the catheterization laboratory as well as the high number of healthy patients in many studies designed to assess pathways for assessing patients with suspected CAD, such as the recent PROMISE trial. 1 The most recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines 2 adapted the pretest likelihoods to accommodate for this observation. Although stress testing should precede invasive angiography in most cases, the high number of negative stress tests (and computed tomography angiographies) remains worrying.

### Initial diagnostic evaluation of stable coronary artery disease: the Need for a patient-centered strategy [^5ea3dafd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The authors do quote existing guidelines but do not stress that these guidelines offer specific scenarios for some of the recommendations; they also seem to overstate the impact of their findings. It is clear that not all patients with suspected CAD are the same and risk factors, pre‐existing diagnoses, ability to exercise, the interpretability of an ECG, and the purpose of the evaluation should be considered in the selection of noninvasive testing. The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines clearly base noninvasive test selection for the initial diagnosis of CAD on the pretest likelihood of CAD and actually make a Class I recommendation for GXT in patients with an intermediate likelihood of CAD who have an interpretable ECG and can exercise. 3 A virtually identical recommendation is made by the 2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, as supported by the appropriate use criteria. 4, 5 Thus, it appears that no guidelines recommend cardiac imaging procedures as the initial test in this population, although the European Society of Cardiology document does indicate that stress imaging is an initial testing option depending on local expertise. Both guidelines suggest stress imaging when the pretest likelihood is higher than intermediate or when the resting ECG is uninterpretable. It also is obvious that GXT cannot be considered the initial testing option when patients are unable to exercise and pharmacologic stress imaging or CCTA would clearly be rational and appropriate. 3, 4 Thus, while GXT may well serve as the first‐line test in some patients, all guidelines indicate that cardiac imaging (stress echocardiography, stress cardiac magnetic resonance, stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, and CCTA) may be selected and in fact preferable in many patients.

Noninvasive imaging specificity and verification bias — implications for stress echocardiography: In the current era, the specificity of all noninvasive imaging tests will be reduced by test verification bias, because a diminishing number of patients with normal or negative noninvasive examinations are subjected to angiography, reducing the apparent specificity when angiography is used as the reference standard. The comparatively high specificity of stress echocardiography contributes to its use as a cost-effective diagnostic method, particularly where alternative stress testing methods have higher false-positive rates.

### Cardiac stress testing… [^ecf3aed7]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed nations. Assessing the heart's function and examining the seriousness of coronary artery disease are the goals of cardiac stress testing. Putting stress on the heart, such as with exercise or certain medications, makes the heart work harder. Under these conditions, myocardial ischemia may occur. As part of an evaluation for cardiovascular disease in someone with chest pain, cardiac stress testing may be helpful in determining the need for invasive tests such as coronary angiography — visualizing coronary arteries after injecting dye through a cardiac catheter. The October 15, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about cardiac stress testing.

Pharmacologic stress tests, often used for persons who cannot walk for more than a short distance, use drugs that put stress on the heart muscle. ECG and other cardiac monitors record data, including heart rate and rhythm. Changes in the ECG and/or cardiac imaging may indicate ischemia. Echocardiography can be combined with stress testing to examine the function of the heart at rest and under stress conditions. Persons who have symptoms of heart disease should be evaluated by their doctor and may need to have a stress test. Symptoms of cardiac disorders include chest, arm, or jaw pain; shortness of breath; swelling of the lower legs and feet; palpitations; and unexplained fatigue or nausea. Unfortunately, sudden cardiac death is often the first sign that a person has heart disease.

Women with cardiac disease may not always display the classic signs of chest or left arm pain. Sometimes, upper abdominal pain, especially in an older person with risk factors for heart disease, may be a symptom of heart disease. Sedentary persons who are planning to start a vigorous exercise program sometimes are advised to undergo a stress test prior to initiation of the new regimen.

### Arm exercise stress testing: diagnostic options in stable coronary artery disease [^93627ab3]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and prognostic testing in coronary artery disease (CAD) is a rapidly expanding field and now includes a range of functional tests, imaging modalities and combinations of the two (stress imaging). For patients suspected of having occlusive CAD, current European Society of Cardiology and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidancerecommends an approach where the probability of obstructive disease and the risk of future events are estimated to determine the next steps. Those at low-risk on the basis of history, examination and basic investigations do not need further assessment, while those at high-risk can proceed directly to treatment, including invasive angiography, if needed. However, for intermediate risk patients, there are a number of options.

Ideally, investigations for this population should be non-invasive, acceptable and applicable to a wide patient population and affordable for the health service. It should perform well enough to exclude the diagnosis while stratifying the risk of future events in those with occlusive CAD, so providing a guide to future medical or interventional management. None of the currently available options tick every box and a tailored approach is needed for each patient. CT coronary angiography performs well but exposes the patient to ionising radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agents. Stress imaging can be carried out using echocardiography, MRI, positron emission topography or single photon emission CT (SPECT), and can utilise either physiological exercise or pharmacological agents as the stressor. However, often, these tests are expensive, time-consuming, and require highly qualified staff to perform and interpret. Exercise ECG testing is widely available, non-invasive and relatively simple to perform, but can be difficult or impossible to read in those with resting ECG abnormalities. In addition, those who are unable to perform exercise on a bike or treadmill are currently excluded from this test.

### Considerations for stress testing performed in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging [^1d4cfea6]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

For myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), the best test to evaluate hemodynamic changes during stress is an exercise treadmill test. It provides independent prognostic value, including evaluation of total exercise time, performance, and capacity; heart rate response during exercise, with ischemia, and in recovery; blood pressure response; myocardial oxygen demand; and assessment of symptoms. Combining these exercise data with perfusion imaging provides the best prognostic value and risk stratification for patients. Although exercise stress testing accompanied by MPI is preferential, it is not always possible since an increasing number of patients cannot exercise to a maximal (symptom-limited) level. Further, there is much evidence in the literature demonstrating a suboptimal, non-symptom-limited (not achieving at least 4–6 min or < 85% of maximum predicted heart rate) exercise test performed as part of an MPI study may result in a false-negative outcome. Therefore, pharmacologic stress agents provide an excellent alternative for those patients who cannot achieve an adequate heart rate response or adequately perform physical exercise. This article focuses on considerations for performing stress (exercise and pharmacologic) testing in conjunction with MPI. It is meant to provide a basic overview of the principles of exercise stress testing; discuss the indications, contraindications, patient preparation, and protocols for exercise stress testing; discuss the contraindications, administration protocols, and side effects for vasodilator (adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson) stress testing; and discuss the contraindications, administration protocols, and side effects for dobutamine stress testing.

### Should stress test Be routine in patients with chest pain? [^8781bb62]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Of the more than 5 million persons who present to emergency departments each year with chest discomfort suggesting myocardial ischemia, 75 percent or more have no objective evidence of an unstable coronary syndrome. Evaluation of these "low-risk" patients with hospitalization is very expensive, necessitating the development of rapid "rule-out" protocols in short-stay observation areas to reduce costs. Lindsay and associates point to the need for an effective and accurate protocol in these short-stay situations and examine some of the data that support a protocol calling for routine stress testing. Virtually all triage protocols include a period of observation for recurrent ischemic pain and electrocardiographic changes, as well as testing for serum markers of myocardial necrosis. Some protocols include routine stress testing if there is no evidence confirming active ischemia during the observation period.

The stress test most often used, exercise ECG, has important disadvantages as a screening test in acute ischemia triage situations. First, many patients cannot exercise adequately for reasons other than heart disease. Second, exercise ECG results can be misleading when the resting ECG is abnormal. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block or resting ST-T wave segment abnormalities cannot be accurately evaluated. The false-positive rate in a low-risk population such as those with negative findings after initial screening for unstable coronary disease is unacceptably high. Echocardiography, stress echocardiography and myocardial scintigraphy have all been advocated as ways to recognize patients with unstable coronary artery disease. These studies provide higher sensitivity and specificity than exercise ECG and can be used in more diverse patients.

Although these procedures are more accurate and improve the triage procedure, they increase the cost of chest screening tremendously. The authors concur with the view of the National Heart Attack Alert Coordinating Committee's Working Group on Evaluation of Technologies for Identifying Acute Cardiac Ischemia in the Emergency Department, which found that data supporting the routine use of stress testing to be limited and inconclusive. Newer biochemical assays including troponin levels combined with clinical markers such as age, history of prior coronary artery disease and the presence of cardiac risk factors such as diabetes may be the most effective way to triage patients with chest pain.
