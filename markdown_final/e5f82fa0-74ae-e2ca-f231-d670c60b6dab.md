## Question

If a patient is taking levothyroxine 75mcg and TSH is low with t3 and t4 normal, do adjust medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to adjust levothyroxine 75 mcg when TSH is low but free T4 and T3 are normal, and if so, how to adjust it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "low TSH with normal free T4/T3" means biochemically and clinically. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies, including over-replacement, assay or timing issues, and central causes. Next, I will review guideline-based targets and thresholds that trigger dose reduction. After that, I need to check for confounders like adherence, drug interactions, and formulation changes. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise plan for dose adjustment, monitoring, and special populations, and I will confirm whether any exceptions apply before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical pattern and its implications. A suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3 in a patient on levothyroxine typically reflects subclinical hyperthyroidism from mild over-replacement, where the pituitary senses sufficient thyroid hormone and suppresses TSH even though circulating free hormones are not frankly elevated, and this pattern is commonly seen with levothyroxine monotherapy when the dose is slightly excessive for the individual's needs [^07a7b05d] [^1829ce08].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance before jumping to action. Persistent subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fracture, particularly in older adults, so even without overt thyrotoxic symptoms, dose reduction is generally indicated unless there is a compelling reason to maintain suppression, such as thyroid cancer risk stratification or a planned pregnancy strategy, which are different scenarios with different targets [^4b5003c6] [^1be19404].

> I need to check guideline thresholds that trigger dose reduction. The ATA recommends titrating levothyroxone to a TSH target of about 0.5–3.5 or 4 mIU/L in primary hypothyroidism, and to avoid overtreatment; thus, a suppressed TSH below the reference range warrants dose reduction unless a suppressive strategy is intended for oncology or other indications, and the ETA similarly advises adjusting to keep TSH within the population reference interval in primary hypothyroidism [^07a7b05d] [^1829ce08].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm confounders that can artifactually suppress TSH or mimic over-replacement. I need to ensure proper timing of labs (ideally before the morning dose, fasting, and separated from calcium, iron, bile acid sequestrants, sucralfate, and some antacids), verify adherence and whether the patient is actually taking extra pills, review new medications that increase levothyroxine absorption or decrease clearance, and consider whether the formulation was switched, because any of these can shift TSH without a true need to change dose [^d4d51eca] [^ed1b4d82] [^639f6a74].

> Let me think about the magnitude of adjustment. Standard practice is to change the dose in 12.5–25 mcg increments and reassess in 4–6 weeks; for a 75 mcg daily dose, a reasonable first reduction is 12.5–25 mcg, bringing the dose to 62.5 or 50 mcg, with closer monitoring if the patient is elderly or has cardiovascular disease to avoid rebound hypothyroidism or ischemia during correction [^07a7b05d] [^7cd5a384].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence. After any dose change, TSH should be rechecked in 4–6 weeks, and once stable, periodic monitoring every 6–12 months is reasonable; importantly, small dose changes of about 20% generally do not produce measurable changes in symptoms or quality of life, so I should avoid chasing subjective complaints with repeated micro-adjustments once TSH is in range [^07a7b05d] [^b2cb9a43].

> But wait, what if this is central hypothyroidism rather than primary disease. In central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable for dosing, and the target is to keep free T4 in the mid-to-upper reference range; a low TSH with normal free T4/T3 could reflect adequate replacement in that context, so I should not reduce the dose based on TSH alone if the etiology is pituitary or hypothalamic disease [^318324c9] [^916982eb].

> I will now examine special scenarios. In older adults, I should be more conservative with dose reductions and consider higher TSH targets, given increased risks of overtreatment; in patients with coronary artery disease, I should reduce the dose gradually and monitor for angina; in pregnancy planning or during pregnancy, TSH targets are stricter and dose adjustments are guided by trimester-specific ranges, so a suppressed TSH would generally prompt reduction unless a suppressive oncology strategy is intended [^95d0aac6] [^07a7b05d] [^1be19404].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. Yes, in primary hypothyroidism, a suppressed TSH with normal free T4/T3 on 75 mcg levothyroxine indicates over-replacement and warrants a dose reduction of about 12.5–25 mcg, with reassessment of TSH in 4–6 weeks, unless there is a valid indication for maintaining TSH suppression such as thyroid cancer risk management, in which case the plan should be individualized and coordinated with oncology guidance [^07a7b05d] [^1829ce08] [^4b5003c6].

In a patient on levothyroxine 75 mcg/day with **low TSH and normal free T4/T3**, this pattern most often reflects **over-replacement** [^07a7b05d] or **assay interference** [^notfound]. Confirm adherence, timing, and drug interactions, then **reduce the dose by 12.5–25 mcg** [^07a7b05d] and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^2200a7ba]. Persistent low TSH with normal free T4/T3 warrants dose reduction to avoid long-term risks (atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis) [^4b5003c6]. Do not add T3; combination therapy is not indicated here [^c5dd836d] [^9f82f68e].

## Clinical significance of low TSH with normal free T4 and T3

Low TSH with normal free T4 and T3 is **subclinical hyperthyroidism** [^notfound] — often from over-replacement or assay interference. It carries increased risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fractures, especially in older adults [^4b5003c6].

---

## Factors influencing TSH levels in patients on levothyroxine

Several factors can cause **low TSH with normal free T4/T3** in patients on levothyroxine:

- **Over-replacement**: Excess levothyroxine suppresses TSH while free T4/T3 remain normal [^99f896d2].
- **Assay interference**: Heterophile antibodies or biotin can falsely lower TSH [^notfound].
- **Adherence issues**: Inconsistent dosing or timing can cause fluctuating TSH.
- **Drug interactions**: Calcium, iron, PPIs, and some foods impair absorption, leading to variable TSH [^d4d51eca].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **dose adjustment** when TSH is low with normal free T4/T3:

- **Confirm adherence and timing**: Ensure consistent dosing, fasting administration, and separation from interfering agents [^d4d51eca].
- **Reduce dose**: Decrease levothyroxine by 12.5–25 mcg and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^07a7b05d].
- **Monitor closely**: Repeat TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually [^2200a7ba].
- **Avoid overtreatment**: Chronic low TSH increases risks of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis [^4b5003c6].

---

## Risks associated with not adjusting levothyroxine dose

Failure to adjust the dose in this setting can cause **chronic subclinical hyperthyroidism**, with increased risks of:

- **Cardiovascular**: Atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias [^4b5003c6].
- **Bone health**: Osteoporosis and fractures, especially in postmenopausal women [^4b5003c6].
- **Mortality**: Higher all-cause mortality in older adults [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring dose adjustment

Dose adjustment is indicated in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Low TSH with normal free T4 and T3 | Over-replacement or assay interference [^99f896d2] |
| Elderly patients with low TSH | Increased risk of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis [^4b5003c6] |
| Patients with cardiovascular disease | Increased risk of arrhythmias [^4b5003c6] |
| Postmenopausal women | Increased risk of osteoporosis [^4b5003c6] |

---

## Alternative explanations and diagnostic considerations

Before adjusting the dose, consider:

- **Assay interference**: Rule out heterophile antibodies or biotin interference [^notfound].
- **Central hypothyroidism**: Low TSH with low free T4/T3 suggests pituitary disease [^318324c9].
- **Non-thyroidal illness**: Acute illness can transiently suppress TSH [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After dose reduction, **monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks** until stable, then annually. Assess for symptoms of hyperthyroidism (palpitations, anxiety, insomnia) and adverse effects (arrhythmias, bone loss) [^2200a7ba].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In a patient on levothyroxine 75 mcg/day with low TSH and normal free T4/T3, **reduce the dose by 12.5–25 mcg** and recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks. This approach minimizes risks of subclinical hyperthyroidism and aligns with current guidelines [^07a7b05d] [^1829ce08].

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^cdf53b2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^4bde2cf9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

If the FT 4 level is normal, further thyroid or pituitary evaluation is unnecessary. If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome. Some patients with a normal TSH level and symptom resolution may become symptomatic again with or without a change in TSH. When symptoms reappear without a change in TSH level, the physician should consider nonthyroid etiologies. When there is an accompanying change in the TSH level, especially in a patient who has stayed on a stable dosage for some time, other reasons should be explored before adjusting the levothyroxine dosage. Adding T 3 to levothyroxine does not additionally alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism.

A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials found no difference in symptoms or quality of life in patients treated with levothyroxine monotherapy vs. levothyroxine plus combination therapy. 32 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists does not recommend desiccated thyroid hormone and finds insufficient evidence to recommend combination levothyroxine/T 3 therapy over levothyroxine monotherapy. For combination treatment, T 3 is given at the same time as levothyroxine and dosed at 5 to 20 mcg, then 2. 5 to 10 mcg every eight hours until clinical improvement. Lower dosages are appropriate in older adults and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Serum FT 4 and T 3 should be monitored every one to two days, with samples drawn at least one hour after dosing T 3.

The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. 31, 40 A systematic review and meta-analysis found an excess risk of depression in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism but no improvement with the use of levothyroxine. 41 Thyroid hormone therapy may benefit patients with treatment-resistant depression and TSH levels greater than 2. 5 mIU per L. 15.

Different levothyroxine products and serum TSH — Because use of different levothyroxine products may sometimes be associated with altered serum TSH values, a change in an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine (brand name or generic) should be followed by re-evaluation of serum TSH at steady state. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^b2bf2570]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

This study was undertaken to systematically review the literature for achieving more robust evidence on the optimal LT4 dose to be prescribed to athyreotic patients just after total thyroidectomy. The primary outcome was to assess the proportion of patients who achieve euthyroidism under the initial LT4 dose. Secondary outcomes include comparing different dose-choosing methods and stratifying results by patient setting, which may require specific TSH targets.

Hospitalized but not critically ill patients starting or increasing levothyroxine — therapeutic goal: The therapeutic goal of levothyroxine replacement in non-critically ill patients is long-term normalization of serum thyrotropin when steady-state thyroid hormone levels are achieved, and levothyroxine should not be titrated to serum free thyroxine levels unless serum thyrotropin cannot be relied upon. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^847bc656]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Although combined treatment sounds promising, the results from clinical trials comparing monotherapy and combined therapy are conflicting. In a previous study involving 19 patients, the TSH levels were normalized only when patients' T3 levels were not significantly different from those of controls. The results are inconsistent with those of more recent double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on RCTs failed to show any advantages in quality of life, mood states, or psychometric performance for patients receiving combination therapy. Although previous meta-analyses reported a preference for combined therapy by patients, a more recent meta-analysis based on 7 blinded RCTs did not support this conclusion, suggesting that T3 may serve as a "placebo" and raise patients' expectations in some nonblinded studies. Taken together, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association, "the use of combined replacement therapy, with the administration of both LT4 and liothyronine (LT3), is generally not recommended due to the low quality of the available evidence. A trial may be considered in those patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism. Also, in these cases, the presence of coexistent nonthyroid problems should be first ruled out". We further recommend discussing the financial burdens with these patients while addressing concomitant diseases and mitigating their unrealistic expectations.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling: a novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^5cbdeaa9]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to suggest LT4 dosage adjustment based on repeated fT4 and TSH measurements during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy. Application of the DAT enabled the clinician to make appropriate dosage adjustments after only two weeks. It is hard to compare the performance of our model directly against other published dosage schemes, because they all use the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, while we used a narrower TSH target also for replacement therapy. The reason we did not include TSH range > 2.0 mIU/L in our targets was that high normal TSH values are associated with comorbidity, and to make our TSH targets more applicable to all diagnoses in the study, including cancer. The study was thus not designed to evaluate our model against other published dosage schemes, but to evaluate whether computerized modeling would allow meaningful early LT4 dose adjustments, before a steady state is reached. When recalculating our eight-week data for patients with goiter using the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, we found, however, that our model outperforms other published dosage schemes. Care must be taken when interpreting these data, as the number of patients is low both in our study groups and in comparable studies.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^bac3eadf]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General

The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 3). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T4and TSH testing.

The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see PRECAUTIONS).

Regarding medical management for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy (choice of agent and dosing), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider starting levothyroxine in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism at generally lower doses (25–75 mcg/day depending on the degree of TSH elevation) than required in the treatment of overt hypothyroidism. Guide further adjustments by clinical response and follow-up laboratory determinations including TSH values.

Clinical assessment of levothyroxine adequacy — symptoms alone "lack sensitivity and specificity and therefore are not recommended for judging adequacy of replacement in the absence of biochemical assessment", and "symptoms by themselves should not be used to guide therapy; they should be considered in the context of serum thyrotropin values, relevant comorbidities, and other potential causes". Strength of guidance is stated as "Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence".

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring — recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

### Levothyroxine monotherapy: what works better for the individual with hypothyroidism? [^8ff88d78]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

I explore objective data not supporting the addition of liothyronine (medication) (LT3) to levothyroxine (medication) (LT4) in patients with hypothyroidism. Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.

Methods

In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.

Conclusion

Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of "symptomatic" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms.

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

Pregnancy — levothyroxine therapy for overt hypothyroidism should be titrated to trimester-specific thyrotropin targets, with serial serum thyrotropin assessed every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and reassessed during the second half; for women already taking levothyroxine, two additional doses per week (one extra dose twice weekly with several days separation) may be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Trimester thyrotropin reference ranges are provided as 0.1–2.5 mIU/L (first), 0.2–3.0 mIU/L (second), and 0.3–3.0 mIU/L (third). Thyroid function should be monitored every 4–6 weeks at least for the first and second trimesters and also reassessed during the third trimester, and up to 70% of women will require adjustments of 30% or more from the preconception dose.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVO-T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVO-T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO-T dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVO-T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Levothyroxine (LT4) bioequivalence — FDA criteria and clinical assessment: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an LT4 formulation as equivalent if the 90% confidence interval of the difference of the pharmacokinetically derived areas under the curve (AUC) and difference of maximal concentrations (Cmax) of serum T4 fall within 80%–125% of a reference product when a comparable dose is administered to healthy volunteers, and in this analysis the LT4 dose is only tested at a single oral dose of 600 μg. The guideline states this definition is problematic because it does not require assessment of serum TSH and because 600 μg is pharmacologic, and proposes assessing comparable serum T4, T3, and TSH after daily dosing for at least 4–6 weeks in athyroid individuals; simulation studies also support TSH-based protocols for judging bioequivalence rather than pharmacokinetic indices.

Impaired Bioavailability and Malabsorption of Oral LT4 Tablets

The tablet form is the predominant preparation of LT4, accounting for more than 95% of LT4 prescriptions. Generally, a dose of LT4 of 1.6 to 1.8 µg/kg body weight is sufficient for the normalization of thyroid function. Unfortunately, more than 30% to 50% of LT4-treated patients are estimated to be either undertreated or overtreated. Impaired bioavailability of LT4 is a common cause of off-target serum TH levels and has been reported in patients with many medical conditions, including concurrent diseases, coingestion with drugs or food, a switch in the LT4 preparation, improper storage, or poor compliance. Patients will present with elevated TSH levels, and reduced T3 and T4 levels and thus require a dose adjustment (> 1.9 µg/kg). Identification of the underlying cause is required to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms (Fig. 2).

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Intervention

The investigational medicinal products are levothyroxine sodium (T4) as 25 or 50 microgram tablets for oral administration and a matching placebo. All tablets are white and round in shape with the strength imprinted, identically packaged in blisters and packed in plain cardboard cartons to maintain study blinding. Participants are advised to take the suggested dose of study medication once daily half an hour before breakfast.

The intervention group will start with levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (25 micrograms in participants with < 50 kg body weight or with a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with matching placebo for six to 8 weeks.

After 6–8 weeks a venous blood sample is taken for TSH assessment. Based on the TSH results, the data centre advises the new dose of study medication or placebo to the clinical investigators.
If TSH < 0.4 mU/L: the treatment dose is reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – effected by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose. These participants will have a further TSH check after 6–8 weeks. If TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L participant will be withdrawn from randomised treatment and referred to usual care.
If TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose.
If TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): 25 micrograms of levothyroxine will be added. Giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5–25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2–4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Symptoms and TSH in levothyroxine-treated patients — In levothyroxine (LT4) users, a cross-sectional analysis of 697 patients taking LT4 showed a correlation between higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and more hypothyroid symptoms, even within the subset of 43 patients who were overtly euthyroid; however, another cross-sectional study did not find a relationship between well-being and TSH categories of less than and greater than 2 mIU/L, and a randomized, controlled cross-over trial of three LT4 dose targets reported no differences in the major outcomes of patient preference. A nonrandomized open-label study noted symptomatic improvement on an LT4 dose 50 μg higher than the optimal dose with low TSH, yet the summary states that patients treated with LT4 to euthyroid TSH goals may experience more symptoms than people without treated hypothyroidism, and increasing LT4 dose does not affect these symptoms. Psychological distress among those referred for thyroid testing was approximately twice as high as in the general population under physician care, with 54% versus 19% having GHQ scores > 3.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling: a novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^f8dd9a8e]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

The consequences of efficient dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy in terms of work capacity, sick leave, quality of life, or other patient-reported outcomes have to be determined before we know whether a minimum of five postoperative blood draws is acceptable. The number is comparable with routine follow-up in the first author's clinic before development of the DAT (Supplemental Data). There is, however large variation in the reported number of necessary dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy, probably reflecting that optimal care is yet to be established. We believe that the advantages of the DAT outweigh the extra cost of early blood samples, for example by reducing the number of follow-up visits and shortening the dosage adjustment period. In addition, further refinement of our model could lower the number of needed samples.

The failure of the simplified DAT to improve dosage for thyrotoxic patients suggests that individual fT4-TSH estimations are necessary to achieve successful dosage with our model. The majority of the patients in the thyrotoxicosis group had a totally suppressed TSH before surgery and were still on anti-thyroid hormone drugs. Slow recovery of normal TSH dynamics after prolonged suppression made our model vulnerable to mistakes, as it relied heavily on initial blood samples. In addition, our assumption that a log-linear relationship exists between TSH and fT4 may not be valid for this group. The overall altered metabolism in patients with Graves' disease could also be changing during the course of follow-up, making initial estimations invalid later on.

In conclusion, application of the DAT for LT4 dosage was superior to clinician dosage adjustment in patients who were euthyroid before total thyroidectomy. Further studies should include patient-reported outcome measures and investigate whether faster dosage adjustment has direct implications for health or quality of life.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^318324c9]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

Thyroid function should be assessed at least monthly with ATD dose adjustment; the dose of ATD should be kept as low as possible; block-replacement therapy consisting of ATD plus levothyroxine should not be used in pregnancy and, if still needed, therapy should be changed to an ATD alone; free T4 is most closely correlated with good fetal outcome and serum TSH should not be used as sole guide; maternal thyroid function should be monitored frequently with noninvasive fetal assessment to balance therapy for acceptable thyroid function in mother and fetus.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^a03cf760]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient's standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of EUTHYROX is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of EUTHYROX dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 (L-thyroxine) level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate EUTHYROX dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Hyper parameters of the Bayesian regression lines estimated from the pilot population used to develop our model. For estimation of individual TSH/fT4 relationships a Bayesian regression model was used instead of OLS to compensate for the low number of samples and for censoring. Center: A patient without detectable TSH, naive OLS would give flat/no response. The Bayesian model gives more plausible estimate with response extending below censoring limit, slope is informed by population data. Right: Bayesian slope is less steep than naive patient specific OLS as informed by population data. fT4, free thyroxine; OLS, ordinary least squares; RCT, randomized controlled trial; TSH, thyrotropin.

FIG. 2.
Study design for randomized controlled validation trial. After total thyroidectomy, the surgeon chose an LT4 starting dosage based on diagnose and clinical routine. TSH and fT4 was measured four times the next two weeks to allow early dosage adjustment. The patients were randomized to the application of a DAT or not (control) for dosage adjustments that were supervised by an experienced endocrine surgeon in either case. Eight weeks after surgery, successful dosage adjustment was evaluated based on TSH measurements. If the TSH target was not achieved, the patient continued six-week dosage adjustment cycles. DAT, decision aid tool.

FIG. 3.
Output from the DAT guided the clinician to increase LT4 dosage 20 days after thyroidectomy, when the DAT was applied in this example patient (same as in Fig. 1, right). A near twofold increase in dosage is suggested to reach the target of TSH < 0.10 mIU/L. The plots show the actual measurements of fT4 (A) and TSH (B) alongside the model estimates. The suggested dosages and the projected responses are also shown to facilitate evaluation from the clinician before deciding on the final dosage.

Eight weeks after surgery (i.e. 5–6 weeks after the first follow-up), blood tests were again evaluated. If the TSH target was reached, they left the study and continued follow-ups by surgeons, endocrinologists, or general practitioners, according to local routines. If the TSH target was not reached, the participants entered loops of follow-up every six weeks until the TSH target was reached (Fig. 2). On each follow-up, the DAT was applied only to the DAT group.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that an altered thyroid function test in previously well-controlled hypothyroid patients treated with levothyroxine may result from transient interference by specific foods or a change in dietary habits. Obtain a retest of thyroid function in non-pregnant patients before increasing the dose of levothyroxine.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of different levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of human thyroid disease [^8d967d82]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

At the present time, optimal therapy for hypothyroidism requires replacement of the deficiency in thyroid hormone with synthetic levothyroxine. Precise titration of this narrow therapeutic index drug is necessary to return the patient to a chemically and clinically euthyroid state. Seven levothyroxine formulations are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and four are available to the physician. Proper dosage is established based on thyrotropin (TSH) testing and clinical evaluation. Each levothyroxine preparation must comply with FDA standards for bioavailability but may vary with respect to its dissolution and absorption properties and are not interchangeable. This equivalence testing is done on normal volunteers and requires a suprapharmacologic dose of levothyroxine in order to make the determination of bioavailability. In this review we discuss the various methods to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of thyroid disease. These are relevant to the physician and patient because small differences in the efficacy can produce unwanted effects of either underreplacement or overreplacement.

American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists — gestational Graves' disease dosing and monitoring (Recommendation 72) specifies that GD during pregnancy should be treated with the lowest possible dose of antithyroid drugs needed to keep the mother's thyroid hormone levels slightly above the normal range for total T4 and T3 values in pregnancy and the TSH suppressed, with Free T4 estimates kept at or slightly above the upper limit of the nonpregnant reference range and thyroid function assessed monthly with dose adjustment as required. 1/+00. Technical remarks note that Free T4 is the parameter that has been most closely correlated with good fetal outcome and that serum TSH may still be suppressed and should not be used as the guide in treatment, although normalization of maternal TSH during ATD therapy may indicate a need to reduce the dose of ATD. ATD plus levothyroxine should not be used in pregnancy; if a woman receiving such therapy becomes pregnant, therapy should be changed to an ATD alone.

Levothyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations — clinical significance of within‑reference‑range T3 changes: The significance of perturbations in serum triiodothyronine concentrations within the reference range or of mildly low serum triiodothyronine concentrations is unknown. According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^99f896d2]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^2200a7ba]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO-T may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO-T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO-T [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^45d6e99e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conduct of Review

The present systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID 1061048). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in reporting this study (Supplemental Material 1).

Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. The search aimed to identify studies reporting the proportion of "euthyroid" patients at their first follow-up after thyroidectomy and the strategy employed to estimate the LT4 starting dose. Euthyroid patients were defined as those with TSH levels within the target range specified in each article. For benign diseases, a higher TSH range was used, whereas for malignant conditions, risk-stratified TSH targets were applied. The search was restricted to articles published in English from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2024. The online search was conducted by the following algorithm: [(levothyroxine) or (L-thyroxine) or (LT4)] and [(thyroidectomy) or (athyreotic)] and (dose). In the attempt to expand the search, references in the retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional studies.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were original studies reporting the number of patients achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy evaluation and the criteria used to prescribe the initial LT4 dose. Exclusion criteria were studies lacking data on postthyroidectomy follow-up or underlying thyroid pathology, review articles, and outdated publications. Two independent researchers (I.C. P.C.) screened titles and abstracts based on these criteria. Subsequently, all authors independently reviewed the full text of eligible articles to confirm their inclusion in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

For each included study, the following information was extracted independently by 2 investigators (I.C. P.C.) in a piloted form: (1) study details (authors, publication year, and country of origin); (2) patient demographics [median age, body mass index (BMI), and sex]; (3) underlying thyroid pathology (benign or malignant); (4) LT4 dosing method; (5) follow-up data for the first and second postthyroidectomy controls. Extracted data were cross-checked for accuracy, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When studies included 2 (or more) different populations according to the LT4 dosing strategy employed, they were reported as separate series.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^f99d7a3d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

All studies were conducted in referral hospital centers. The normal TSH range was reported by all studies, with most using 0.4 to 4.5, while only 1 study applied a 0.4 to 2.5 range. For tumors, different risk categories were considered: low risk (0.5–2), intermediate risk (0.1–0.5), and high risk (< 0.1). Of the 11 studies included, 7 analyzed patients using a single LT4 dosing method: 2 studies used a dose/kg approach, 3 applied a fixed-dose regimen, and 2 employed an algorithm-based method. In the remaining 4 studies, multiple groups of patients received different dosing strategies: 3 compared 2 groups (1 using a dose/kg method and the other an algorithm-based approach) and 1 examined 4 groups using a dose/kg method but with a different TSH target according to their disease.

As a result, the 11 studies yielded 17 patient groups. Among them, 3 groups followed a fixed-dose regimen [2 receiving 100 mcg, 1 receiving 150 mcg], 9 groups used a dose/kg approach, and 5 groups applied an algorithm-based calculation.

A detailed description of the algorithm-based approaches is reported in Supplemental Material 3.

All studies reported the number of euthyroid patients at the first control, which was typically conducted at 6 to 8 weeks, with the widest timeframe being 4 to 15 weeks.

Quantitative Analysis (Meta-analysis)

The pooled proportion of patients achieving target thyroid hormone levels at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up was 33.9% (803/2577 patients), with a confidence interval from 29.3% to 38.5% (Fig. 2). The analysis included 17 different study populations, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity (I² = 82.68%). A comparative analysis based on key study characteristics was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity (Table 2).

Central hypothyroidism in pregnancy — monitoring and levothyroxine dosing: We recommend that clinicians monitor fT4 or total T4 levels every 4–6 weeks for women with CH who become pregnant and that these women may require increased L-T4 doses to maintain pregnancy targets. Many women with primary hypothyroidism require significant (20–50%) increases in L-T4 doses early in pregnancy, with current recommendations to increase L-T4 by two extra pills per week upon confirming pregnancy; however, women with CH may not require the same degree of dose escalation. If pregnancy-specific fT4 reference ranges are not available, clinicians can use total T4 reference ranges adjusted upward by 50%; in CH, serum TSH is not useful for monitoring, so clinicians should use either fT4 or total T4, and an alternative approach is to monitor total T4 adjusting the nonpregnant reference range upward by 50%.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^d4d51eca]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General Principles

The goal of replacement therapy is to achieve and maintain a clinical and biochemical euthyroid state. The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue. The dose of LEVOTHROID®that is adequate to achieve these goals depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, concomitant medications, and the specific nature of the condition being treated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

LEVOTHROID®is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one-half to one hour before breakfast. LEVOTHROID®should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4–6 weeks.

Caution should be exercised when administering LEVOTHROID®to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Levothyroxine [^0d2e1231]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Warnings

WARNING: Thyroid hormones, including Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.

Levothyroxine sodium should not be used in the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is associated with hypothyroidism.

In patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease, particularly the elderly or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, levothyroxine sodium therapy is contraindicated if the serum TSH level is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). If the serum TSH level is not suppressed, Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be used with caution in conjunction with careful monitoring of thyroid function for evidence of hyperthyroidism and clinical monitoring for potential associated adverse cardiovascular signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^aa9f8dd5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

Thyroid hormone replacement in central hypothyroidism (CH): We recommend L-T4 in doses sufficient to achieve serum fT4 levels in the mid to upper half of the reference range, and appropriate L-T4 doses in CH average 1.6 μg/kg/d, with dose adjustments based on clinical context, age, and fT4 levels. We suggest against treating CH with levotriiodothyronine (L-T3), thyroid extracts, or other formulations of thyroid hormones. We recommend against using serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with CH.

Although serum TSH values are comparable and within normal ranges in LT4-treated patients, LT4 as an exogenous pro-drug cannot simulate serum thyroid hormone profile and circadian rhythm in the native euthyroid state. Serum TSH values in the previous clinical trials varied in patients under LT4 + LT3 combination therapy. In this study, serum TSH levels in the intervention group increased to abnormal levels and after adjusting the dosage restored to normal values, which showed insufficient potency in the combined tablets. As was expected and shown in the literature, we found a decline in serum T4/FT4 values in LT4 + SR-T3 treated patients because of lowering LT4 dosages administered to these patients. We found an increase in serum T3 in those who received CBT with 1:5 ratio (group B) in line with the results of about half of the previous clinical trials involving LT4 + LT3 combination therapy indicating an increase in serum T3 compared to LT4-treated patients; however, most of these studies used a plain form of LT3. T3 to T4 ratio increased in the intervention group, however, the ratio was similar to the control group and lower than those with the native euthyroid states in line with a few previous reports.

Introduction

Levothyroxine monotherapy is considered the standard of care for hypothyroidism by professional organizations, whereby the patients achieve the state of euthyroidism through the normalization of TSH, a reliable proxy of euthyroidism. In euthyroid individuals, 80% of T3 (25 µg) is generated from T4 to T3 conversion in kidney and liver cells and 20% (5 µg) is secreted from the thyroid gland. Using levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is expected to be a suitable strategy owing to the peripheral conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the hormonally active T3 by the deiodinase. Of interest, while this treatment modality is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely effective in normalizing TSH, it may not be sufficient to account for the normal thyroidal secretion of T3 and T4. Approximately 10% lower serum T3 levels in LT4-treated patients compared to euthyroid individuals with similar serum TSH values have been reported previously, leading to the skewed T3:T4 ratio toward an increase of T4, while serum T3 levels are normal to low. The clinical significance of these deviations in thyroid hormones in LT4-treated patients is not clear.

Clinically, a sizable minority of patients adequately treated with LT4 complain of residual symptoms. Higher T4 and lower T3 serum levels reflect a relative imbalance in the thyroid hormone axis homeostasis may be responsible for the persistence of hypothyroid symptoms in some patients. It is unclear to what extent lower serum T3 levels may contribute to the persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients; however, in an experimental study on thyroidectomized rats with evident tissue hypothyroidism in peripheral cells, tissue euthyroidism occurred only following normalization of serum T3.

The above-mentioned evidence led to the growing interest in combination therapy with LT4 plus liothyronine(LT3); however, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials addressing objective and subjective clinical outcomes did not provide conclusive results. The non-conclusive results, besides heterogeneity in the study population, design, and dosage, may be attributed to the concerns and challenges regarding available oral T3 preparations stemming from the short half-life of T3 with rapid T3 absorption followed by fast metabolization. Despite the lack of definite evidence for the superiority of combination therapy, this strategy remains a common practice in hypothyroid patients who remained dissatisfied with LT4 monotherapy, while the use of LT4 + SR-T3 was suggested.

Children at risk for hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in children, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: THYQUIDITY dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester- specific range, increase the dose of THYQUIDITY by 12.5 to 25 mcg/day and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable THYQUIDITY dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce THYQUIDITY dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure THYQUIDITY dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust THYQUIDITY dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 mIU per liter, and this usually requires a THYQUIDITY dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

American Thyroid Association guideline — starting dose strategies indicate that several approaches to initiating LT4 therapy are acceptable, including basing the starting dose on the serum thyrotropin (TSH) level, with full replacement doses roughly 0.73 µg/lb or 1.6 µg/kg body weight when the serum TSH is markedly elevated, and lower doses such as 25–50 µg for milder degrees of hypothyroidism.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine targeting of triiodothyronine or thyrotropin levels: There is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that treatment with levothyroxine be targeted to achieve low-normal thyrotropin values or high-normal triiodothyronine values in patients with hypothyroidism who are overweight, those who have depression or dyslipidemia, or those who are athyreotic. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Supporting data include a 1-year study in which hypothyroid patients maintained low-normal or high-normal triiodothyronine (T3) had resultant T3 levels of 123 and 113 ng/dL with no decrement in cholesterol, BMI, or percentage body fat associated with the higher LT4, and a cross-over trial of 56 patients with primary hypothyroidism treated for 8-week periods with three doses of LT4 that achieved TSH values of 2.8, 1, and 0.3 mIU/L and free T3 values of 2.5, 2.7, and 3.1 pg/mL, in which psychologic well-being, treatment satisfaction, and body weight did not change across the three different groups; although there was progressive lowering of total cholesterol with higher free T3 values, the significance of this reduction seemed to be due to lowering of cholesterol in the group that included many long-term patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and retrospective data found no significant weight changes after LT4 replacement or suppressive doses in postsurgical hypothyroidism.

### Levothyroxine dosage is associated with stability of thyroid-stimulating hormone values [^88e2377e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

In patients treated for hypothyroidism, the usual practice is to monitor thyroid-stimulating hormone values yearly once a therapeutic dosage of levothyroxine is determined. This study investigates whether there are any clinical predictors that could identify a subset of patients who might be monitored safely on a less frequent basis.

Methods

With the use of a retrospective study design, 715 patients treated for hypothyroidism who had a normal (ie, therapeutic) thyroid-stimulating hormone value in 2006 while taking levothyroxine were identified. All thyroid-stimulating hormone values were then obtained through December 31, 2012. By using a Cox proportional hazard model, gender, age, body mass index, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, initial thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and levothyroxine dose were analyzed for time to first abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value.

Results

Age, gender, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and body mass index at the time of initial normal thyroid-stimulating hormone were not associated significantly with time to abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value. Levothyroxine dose > 125 μg/day had an increased hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.4; P < .0001) for time to first follow-up abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value, but dosages less than that did not increase the hazard ratio. One year after the initial normal thyroid-stimulating hormone value, 91.1% of patients taking ≤ 125 μg/day had a continued normal thyroid-stimulating hormone, whereas only 73.3% of patients taking > 125 μg/day did. Transformed thyroid-stimulating hormone value (which represents a measure of how far the initial thyroid-stimulating hormone was from the midpoint of the normal range) also had an increased hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–1.2; P < .0001) for time to first abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value.

Conclusions

For patients receiving ≤ 125 μg/day of levothyroxine, we propose that a testing interval up to 2 years may be acceptable if their thyroid-stimulating hormone is well within the normal range.

### Small changes in thyroxine dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life: results of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^b2cb9a43]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

In patients with primary hypothyroidism, anecdotal evidence suggests that well-being is optimized by fine adjustment of T(4) dosage, aiming for a serum TSH concentration in the lower reference range. This has not been tested in a clinical trial.

Objective

Our objective was to test whether adjustment of T(4) dosage aiming for a serum TSH concentration less than 2 mU/liter improves well-being compared with a serum TSH concentration in the upper reference range.

Design

We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a crossover design.

Participants

Fifty-six subjects (52 females) with primary hypothyroidism taking T(4) (≥ 100 microg/d) with baseline serum TSH 0.1–4.8 mU/liter participated.

Interventions

Each subject received three T(4) doses (low, middle, and high in 25-microg increments) in random order.

Outcome Measures

Outcome measures included visual analog scales assessing well-being (the primary endpoint) and hypothyroid symptoms, quality of life instruments (General Health Questionnaire 28, Short Form 36, and Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire), cognitive function tests, and treatment preference.

Results

Mean (± sem) serum TSH concentrations were 2.8 ± 0.4, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 0.3 ± 0.1 mU/liter for the three treatments. There were no significant treatment effects on any of the instruments assessing well-being, symptoms, quality of life, or cognitive function and no significant treatment preference.

Conclusions

Small changes in T(4) dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life, despite the expected changes in serum TSH and markers of thyroid hormone action. These data do not support the suggestion that the target TSH range for the treatment of primary hypothyroidism should differ from the general laboratory range.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect levothyroxine overtreatment in patients with CeH when serum fT4 concentrations are above or close to the ULN (provided that levothyroxine is taken after blood withdrawal), particularly when associated with clinical thyrotoxic manifestations or high T3 concentrations.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: joint British thyroid association / society for endocrinology consensus statement [^9f82f68e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest.

Pregnancy- Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine requirements (see PREGNANCY).

Subclinical Hypothyroidism- If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg/kg/day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level. Patients who are not treated should be monitored yearly for changes in clinical status and thyroid laboratory parameters.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules- The target level for TSH suppression in these conditions has not been established with controlled studies. In addition, the efficacy of TSH suppression for benign nodular disease is controversial. Therefore, the dose of Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP used for TSH suppression should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated.

In the treatment of well differentiated (papillary and follicular) thyroid cancer, levothyroxine is used as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to < 0.1 mU/L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg/kg/day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be < 0.01 mU/L.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^4b5003c6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — Principles of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression state that the use of levothyroxine to maintain low TSH levels is considered optimal for papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, although data are lacking to permit precise specification of serum TSH levels. In general, patients with known structural residual carcinoma or at high risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained below 0.1 mU/L. Patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained at the normal range, and for patients at low risk for recurrence with biochemical evidence but no structural evidence of disease (eg, Tg positive, but imaging negative), maintain TSH levels at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Patients who remain disease free for several years should have their TSH levels maintained within the reference range. Given the potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine — including cardiac tachyarrhythmias (especially in the elderly) and bone demineralization (particularly in post-menopausal women) as well as frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis — the risks and benefits of TSH-suppressive therapy must be balanced for each individual patient. Patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed should be counseled to ensure adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^32fb980c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As millions of people around the world take LT4 daily and a huge number of patients with goiter or cancer undergo thyroidectomy, achieving robust data about the optimal starting LT4 dose should be important for helping the clinical practice of thyroidologists. The main goal of the present meta-analysis was to assess whether different approaches for a LT4 dose-choosing strategy would translate into a higher number of euthyroid patients at the first follow-up visit after total thyroidectomy.

The results of the present analysis show a mean percentage of euthyroid patients receiving LT4 at the first follow-up after thyroidectomy of ∼34%. This indicates that, in most patients, independently from the LT4 dose-choosing method used, TSH level was either below or above the normal range. The high heterogeneity in terms of euthyroidism rates observed across studies (ranging from 19% to 68%) using different dose-choosing strategies highlights the complexity of choosing an adequate starting LT4 replacement dose in thyroidectomized patients. We aimed to identify the primary contributors to this variability, considering methodological differences in LT4 dosing and patient characteristics by assessing whether different methods for estimating LT4 dose would lead to different results in terms of rates of euthyroidism achieved.

The studies included in our analysis employed different dosing approaches, including fixed-dose regimens, weight-based dosing (dose/kg), and individualized algorithms incorporating factors such as BMI, lean body mass (LBM), or age. We conducted mainly 2 comparative analyses: (1) dose/kg studies vs all other approaches and (2) weight-based, BMI-based, LBM-based dosing vs fixed-dose and other particular algorithm-based methods. In both analyses, the second group exhibited higher rates of euthyroidism; however, this was accompanied by greater heterogeneity and wider confidence intervals, primarily due to 1 study belonging to the second group reporting a 68% achievement rate among 31 patients. When considering how these factors were incorporated into dose-choosing algorithms, we found that only 1 study included LBM in its algorithm, yet it achieved a euthyroidism rate of just 26%, indicating no clear advantage over other methods. No study accounted for sex in the dose-choosing algorithm. Two studies included age as a variable, reporting euthyroidism rates of 67% and 58%. Three studies incorporated BMI into their algorithms. Two studies considered age and BMI, while 1 used a BMI-based approach, achieving a euthyroidism rate of 38%.

AACE/ATA hypothyroidism — TSH monitoring with interacting drugs: In patients receiving L-thyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be remeasured within 4–8 weeks of initiation of treatment with drugs that decrease the bioavailability or alter the metabolic disposition of the L-thyroxine dose (Grade A, BEL 1).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^e4b106db]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — postoperative levothyroxine is considered optimal to decrease TSH in patients with higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, but the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring the degree of TSH suppression to individual risk because optimal serum levels have not been defined. For patients with known residual carcinoma or those at high risk for recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mU/L; for patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence, TSH levels should be maintained at the normal range; and for patients at low risk with imaging negative but Tg levels concerning for disease, TSH levels should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, so an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended for patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed; reports do not suggest that bone mineral density is altered in patients receiving levothyroxine.

2.4	Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of EUTHYROX therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of EUTHYROX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)])].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^a76d28c8]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid extracts versus levothyroxine in adults with primary hypothyroidism — recommendation: We recommend that levothyroxine be considered as routine care for patients with primary hypothyroidism, in preference to use of thyroid extracts. Although there is preliminary evidence from a short-duration study that some patients may prefer treatment using thyroid extracts, high-quality controlled long-term outcome data are lacking to document superiority of this treatment compared to levothyroxine therapy. Furthermore, there are safety concerns related to the use of thyroid extracts, such as the presence of supraphysiologic serum triiodothyronine levels and a paucity of long-term safety outcome data. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.
