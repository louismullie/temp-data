## Question

What indicates uremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what indicates uremia and how to identify it clinically and biochemically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative clinical definition and which symptoms truly reflect uremic toxicity. Then, I should verify how to distinguish uremic manifestations from other kidney failure features like volume overload or hypertension. Next, I will review laboratory indicators that quantify uremic burden and consider the underlying pathophysiology of retained solutes. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of eGFR as an indicator and the evidence on timing of dialysis. I should also examine special populations, such as pregnancy, where thresholds may differ. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of indicators that clinicians can use to recognize uremia and guide decisions, anchored in guidelines and outcome data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition so I don't jump to conclusions. Uremia is best understood as a clinical syndrome caused by kidney failure, characterized by symptoms and signs attributable to retained toxins and organ dysfunction, including neurological impairment (encephalopathy, neuropathy), pericarditis, anorexia, intractable pruritus, serositis, and medically resistant acid–base or electrolyte abnormalities; KDIGO 2024 emphasizes initiating dialysis when these manifestations appear, often but not invariably in the eGFR 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m² range, and within a composite assessment of symptoms, signs, QoL, preferences, GFR, and labs [^114STYkA] [^114STYkA].

> Hold on, I should verify how uremic symptoms differ from general consequences of kidney failure. Inability to control volume status or blood pressure is a dialysis indication but is not, strictly speaking, a uremic toxin-mediated syndrome; studies categorizing initiation reasons separate "uremic symptoms" from "volume overload/hypertension", and this distinction carries prognostic implications, with volume-driven starts often faring worse than purely laboratory-decline starts, underscoring the need to document uremic features explicitly rather than infer them from fluid status alone [^1169bfPA] [^1151kkHL] [^115brG9V].

> Next, I will now examine laboratory "uremic indicators", but I need to ensure I don't treat them as standalone diagnostic criteria. Several investigations have operationalized a seven-item panel — hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate — to quantify uremic burden; while these capture nitrogenous waste accumulation, electrolyte/acid–base derangements, and secondary complications like anemia and malnutrition, they complement rather than replace clinical symptom assessment in defining uremia [^1151kkHL] [^115brG9V].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to anchor the clinical picture. Uremia arises from retained waste solutes ("uremic toxins") that native kidneys clear more effectively than dialysis; the illness burden reflects both small solutes and larger protein-bound molecules, and our current urea-based dosing metrics are imperfect proxies, which is why symptom-guided assessment remains critical and dialysis prescriptions cannot be optimized solely around urea kinetics [^111vUG4T] [^116WSvcM] [^117KWaP8].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought a GFR threshold like < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² might define uremia, but that would conflate kidney failure with symptomatic uremic toxicity; I should double-check the evidence showing eGFR is an unreliable standalone indicator. The IDEAL trial and subsequent population analyses confirm no survival advantage to starting dialysis at higher eGFR, and contemporary guidance supports an intent-to-defer approach focusing on symptom onset rather than numeric eGFR alone, cautioning against early initiation trends driven by automated eGFR reporting rather than clinical need [^111snNxz] [^115wt9bj] [^112WLQsp] [^1163RDqo] [^114STYkA].

> Let me verify typical ranges without overgeneralizing. While uremic symptoms often emerge when eGFR is approximately 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m², symptom development can occur at higher or lower function depending on comorbidity and solute burden; importantly, a substantial proportion of patients have been starting dialysis above 10 mL/min/1.73 m² without clear symptomatic justification, a practice criticized for lacking outcome benefits and potentially exposing patients to early dialysis harms [^114STYkA] [^1163RDqo].

> I should also review special contexts where thresholds differ, and pregnancy is a prime example. During pregnancy, maternal and fetal considerations shift the balance: initiation of hemodialysis is suggested when maternal urea reaches roughly 17–20 mmol/L because of fetotoxicity concerns, even if classic maternal uremic symptoms are not yet prominent, although this remains based on limited historical data and requires individualized assessment of maternal–fetal status [^114GVBJd].

> But wait, what about urgency signals that complicate recognition and timing. Stroke, cardiac failure, and lack of prepared dialysis access increase the likelihood of urgent or unplanned starts, which can obscure careful recognition of uremia and worsen early outcomes; ensuring adequate predialysis follow-up and access planning reduces urgent starts and allows more deliberate, symptom-guided decisions [^112SzRFw] [^112n66Ca].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchical framework so it's clinically usable. Primary indicators of uremia are organ dysfunctions directly attributable to retained toxins — neurologic changes, pericarditis, intractable pruritus, serositis, severe anorexia, and refractory acid–base or electrolyte disturbances — which should generally trigger initiation of dialysis regardless of eGFR; secondary indicators are the composite lab abnormalities reflecting solute accumulation and sequelae (elevated BUN/creatinine, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, low bicarbonate, anemia, hypoalbuminemia), which strengthen the case but are insufficient without clinical correlation; contextual indicators include the recognition that eGFR alone is not reliable for uremia, that symptoms commonly cluster at eGFR 5–10, and that presenting indication categories (e.g., uremic symptoms vs volume overload) carry different prognoses and should be documented explicitly [^114STYkA] [^115brG9V] [^111snNxz] [^1169bfPA].

> In summary, I need to ensure that I identify uremia as a constellation of toxin-mediated clinical manifestations corroborated by a pattern of biochemical derangements, not by any single laboratory value or eGFR threshold; decisions to initiate dialysis should be anchored in the presence of uremic symptoms and refractory metabolic disturbances within a shared decision-making framework, while recognizing special scenarios like pregnancy where earlier action based on maternal urea is reasonable [^114STYkA] [^1154YSUL] [^114GVBJd] [^111snNxz].

---

Uremia is indicated by **clinical symptoms** [^114STYkA] (encephalopathy, pericarditis, intractable pruritus, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, cognitive impairment, serositis) and **refractory metabolic derangements** [^1154YSUL] (hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, volume overload) that persist despite medical therapy. Dialysis should be initiated when these symptoms or complications occur, typically at eGFR 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m², but **not based on eGFR alone** [^114STYkA] [^111snNxz]. Early initiation at higher eGFR does not improve survival [^111snNxz] and may increase risks; decisions should be individualized and guided by patient preferences and clinical context [^114duaf9].

## Clinical indications for dialysis initiation in uremia

According to KDIGO 2024, dialysis initiation should be based on a **composite assessment** [^1154YSUL] of symptoms and signs, quality of life, patient preferences, GFR level, and laboratory abnormalities [^114STYkA]. Key clinical indications include:

- **Neurological symptoms**: Encephalopathy, cognitive impairment, or other neurological signs attributable to uremia [^114STYkA].

- **Pericarditis**: Inflammation of the pericardium attributable to uremia [^114STYkA].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or progressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention [^114STYkA].

- **Intractable pruritus**: Severe itching resistant to medical management [^114STYkA].

- **Serositis**: Inflammation of serous membranes attributable to uremia [^114STYkA].

- **Medically resistant acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities**: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, or other electrolyte disturbances unresponsive to medical therapy [^114STYkA].

- **Inability to control volume status or blood pressure**: Refractory fluid overload or hypertension despite optimal medical management [^114STYkA].

---

## Laboratory thresholds and clinical parameters

While **clinical symptoms are paramount** [^114STYkA], specific laboratory and clinical parameters can also guide the decision to initiate dialysis:

| **Parameter** | **Threshold/condition** |
|-|-|
| Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) | - Typically 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m² <br/> - But not solely determinative [^114STYkA] |
| Serum potassium | Hyperkalemia refractory to medical management [^114STYkA] |
| Metabolic acidosis | Persistent acidosis unresponsive to medical therapy [^114STYkA] |
| Volume status | Inability to control fluid overload despite diuretics [^114STYkA] |
| Nutritional status | Progressive deterioration refractory to dietary intervention [^114STYkA] |

## Risks and benefits of early versus delayed dialysis initiation

Early initiation at higher eGFR confers **no significant survival benefit** [^111snNxz] and is linked to increased risks — including loss of residual renal function, higher initial mortality [^111eSU2U], and greater healthcare costs [^112hrgHs]. Conversely, delayed initiation at lower eGFR does not increase mortality or cardiovascular events [^1125Gsji] and permits longer dialysis-free survival while preserving residual renal function. The IDEAL randomized controlled trial found no survival difference [^111snNxz] between early and late strategies, supporting a symptom-based approach over reliance on eGFR alone.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dialysis initiation

Several **patient-specific factors** influence the timing and appropriateness of dialysis initiation:

- **Age**: Older patients may have slower progression of renal function decline and higher competing risks of death from comorbidities, necessitating individualized decision-making [^114W85y1].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions significantly impact prognosis and dialysis initiation timing [^114W85y1].

- **Patient preferences and quality of life** [^114duaf9] [^114W85y1]: Shared decision-making, considering patient values and goals, is essential in determining the appropriate timing and modality of dialysis.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize a **patient-centered, symptom-based approach** to dialysis initiation [^1154YSUL] [^111snNxz]. KDIGO 2024 recommends initiating dialysis based on clinical symptoms and signs, quality of life, patient preferences, and laboratory abnormalities — typically when GFR is 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114STYkA]. The Canadian Society of Nephrology 2014 guideline advocates an intent-to-defer strategy, initiating when symptoms or signs attributable to uremia develop rather than at a specific eGFR threshold [^115PkCBP] [^115wt9bj].

---

Dialysis initiation in uremia should be guided by clinical symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, and patient-specific factors, **rather than solely by eGFR** [^111snNxz] [^1154YSUL]. Early initiation at higher eGFR levels does not confer significant survival benefits [^111snNxz] and may increase risks, while delayed initiation allows longer dialysis-free survival without increasing mortality [^1125Gsji]. Current guidelines emphasize a patient-centered, symptom-based approach, incorporating shared decision-making and individualized care plans [^114duaf9].

### Timing of initiation of dialysis: Time for a new direction [^1163RDqo]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The past 15 years have seen tremendous growth in the initiation of dialysis at higher levels of kidney function in the setting of mixed evidence and at great societal economic cost. We review recent data on the early dialysis initiation trend, the clinical and economic impact of early dialysis initiation, and the future implications for the management of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Recent findings**: The percentage of patients who initiate dialysis with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 10 ml/min/1.73 m² is now greater than 50%, including 20% who initiate with an eGFR above 15 ml/min/1.73 m². The drivers behind these findings are probably diverse, but recent literature does not seem to support a higher symptom burden among the aging CKD population as the major cause. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial provides guidance on the safety of waiting for symptoms or lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate prior to beginning dialysis. In addition, economic analyses based on the IDEAL and US Renal Data System findings suggest that significant cost savings could be achieved by reversing the early initiation trend.

These findings should help clinicians and policymakers looking to rein in costs while maintaining the quality of CKD care.

### Choice of dialysis modality [^117Nbh8u]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Few medical decisions have as profound an impact on every aspect of a patient's life as the selection of dialysis modality by a patient with end-stage renal disease. The outcome differences observed between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients in observational studies remain uncertain as to whether they are attributable to the dialysis modality. Therefore, such studies are insufficient to deny patients a choice in selecting their dialysis modality.

### Determinants of urgent start dialysis in a chronic kidney disease cohort followed by nephrologists [^112SzRFw]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) registry collects the dialysis initiation context for each patient starting dialysis with a flawed definition of urgent start dialysis (USD). The main objective of this study was to identify factors associated with USD in patients regularly followed up by a nephrologist using a classification of USD considering the preparation for renal replacement therapy.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients who started dialysis between 2012 and 2018 in the Franche-Comté region of France following a minimum of two nephrology consultations. We classified dialysis initiation context as follows: USD for patients with no dialysis access (DA) created or planned; unplanned non-urgent start dialysis (UNUSD) for patients starting with a recent or non-functional DA; and planned start dialysis (PSD) for those starting with a functional and mature DA.

- **Results**: Four hundred and sixty-five patients met inclusion criteria. According to the REIN registry, 94 (20.3%) patients were urgent starters (US), whereas, with our classification, 80 (17.2%) and 73 (15.7%) were respectively US and unplanned non-urgent starters (UNUS). The factors independently associated with USD in our classification were: stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 2.76, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [1.41–5.43]), cardiac failure (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = [1.07–2.96]), and the number of nephrology consultations prior to dialysis onset (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = [0.64–0.83]). Thirty-one patients died during the first year after dialysis start. According to our classification, we observed…

### A randomized, controlled trial of early versus late initiation of dialysis [^111snNxz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

The IDEAL study, published by Cooper BA and colleagues in 2010 in the New England Journal of Medicine, investigates the effects of early versus late initiation of dialysis in patients with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Study design**: The study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 828 patients (286 female, 542 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients aged 18 years or older with progressive CKD and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 10.0 and 15.0 mL/min/1.73 m² of body-surface area.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Included being younger than 18 years, an eGFR of less than 10.0 mL/min, plans to receive a kidney transplant from a live donor within 12 months, recently diagnosed cancer likely affecting survival, or an inability to provide written informed consent.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Early dialysis initiation**: Dialysis started when eGFR was between 10.0–14.0 mL/min (n = 404).
	- **Late dialysis initiation**: Dialysis started when eGFR was between 5.0–7.0 mL/min (n = 424).

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in all-cause mortality was observed between the early and late initiation groups (37.6% vs. 36.6%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.3).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in cardiovascular event incidence (10.9/100 patient-years vs. 8.8/100 patient-years; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.56).
	- Borderline significant increase in infectious event incidence was noted (12.4/100 patient-years vs. 14.3/100 patient-years).

The study underscores the importance of determining the optimal timing for dialysis initiation in CKD patients, as no substantial differences in primary or secondary outcomes were evident between early and late initiation groups.

### Late initiation of dialysis among women and ethnic minorities in the United States [^1152jFmW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2000). Low credibility.

The ideal timing for the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been debated. It is currently recommended that RRT be instituted once the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 10.5 ml/min per 1.73 m², unless there are stable or increased edema-free body weight, a normalized protein nitrogen appearance rate of 0.8 g/kg per day or greater, and no clinical signs or symptoms of uremia. However, the mean estimated GFR at initiation of dialysis in the United States is 7.1 ml/min per 1.73 m².

Factors associated with the timing of dialysis initiation in the United States are not clear. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the factors associated with late initiation of dialysis, defined by GFR at initiation of less than 5 ml/min per 1.73 m², among patients who began dialysis in the United States between 1995 and 1997. Data were obtained from the U.S. Renal Data System, and GFR was estimated using the formula derived from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study.

Twenty-three percent of patients started dialysis late. In the multivariate analysis, women (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70), Hispanics and Asians (OR = 1.47 and 1.66, respectively, compared with Caucasians), uninsured patients (OR = 1.55 compared with private insurance), and employed patients (OR = 1.20) were more likely to start dialysis late. Patients with diabetes, cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, and poor functional status were less likely to start dialysis late compared with patients without these comorbid conditions. Certain nonclinical patient characteristics, notably female gender and minority status, appear to influence the timing of dialysis initiation.

### Optimal dialysate sodium-what is the evidence [^114meeRg]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Oligo-anuric patients with end-stage kidney disease are dependent on hemodialysis to achieve and maintain the desired goal of euvolemia. The dialysis prescription, in addition to sodium and fluid restriction, is therefore a critically important factor in the care of hemodialysis patients. Various dialysate sodium concentrations have been favored throughout the history of dialysis, but the "optimal" concentration remains unclear.

In this manuscript, we examine the historical context of changes to the dialysate sodium prescription, review the evidence of its associated effects, discuss 'individualization' of dialysate sodium, and highlight the need for definitive trials that are powered for important clinical outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^114GVBJd]. BMC Nephrology (2019).

- **Initiating dialysis during pregnancy**: We suggest that haemodialysis should be initiated in pregnancy when the maternal urea concentration is 17–20 mmol/L, and the risks of preterm delivery outweigh those of dialysis initiation. Consideration should be given to gestation, renal function trajectory, fluid balance, biochemical parameters, blood pressure, and uraemic symptoms in addition to maternal urea concentration.

- **Rationale**: The guideline committee acknowledges the inadequacy of data to produce evidence-based recommendations for the initiation of dialysis during pregnancy. However, a specific request from the UK renal community was received for expert, opinion-based practice. In pregnancy, concern regarding the fetotoxicity of urea is likely to precede maternal indications for dialysis. These indications are the same as those outside of pregnancy: refractory hyperkalaemia, acidosis and/or fluid overload, and uraemic symptoms that impact daily living. The recommendation to initiate dialysis when maternal urea concentration is greater than 17 mmol/L is extrapolated from historical observational data reporting high rates of fetal death in women with this level of renal dysfunction. However, these data also reflect obstetric and renal practice from over 50 years ago. Contemporary practice varies: from routine commencement of dialysis at a maternal urea level above 17 mmol/L to considering dialysis only when the urea is consistently above 20 mmol/L. In addition to maternal serum biochemistry, fetal health, including growth profile and polyhydramnios, and maternal wellbeing should be taken into account.

### Starting dialysis is dangerous: How do we balance the risk [^116VgPHY]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies on the timing of dialysis initiation challenge the trend towards earlier therapy initiation. The observed outcomes result from balancing the risks of advanced uremia against the inherent dangers associated with dialysis therapy itself. Many risks are inherent in current dialysis treatment methods and may be mitigated through refining clinical practices and potentially by choosing different modalities. This article discusses how patient outcomes are the result of balancing these factors, focusing on a particular patient's vulnerability to these associated risks.

### A randomized, controlled trial of early versus late initiation of dialysis [^11661q3F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, there is considerable variation in the timing of the initiation of maintenance dialysis for patients with stage V chronic kidney disease, with a worldwide trend toward early initiation. In this study, conducted at 32 centers in Australia and New Zealand, we examined whether the timing of the initiation of maintenance dialysis influenced survival among patients with chronic kidney disease.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients 18 years of age or older with progressive chronic kidney disease and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 10.0 and 15.0 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area (calculated with the use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation) to planned initiation of dialysis when the estimated GFR was 10.0 to 14.0 mL per minute (early start) or when the estimated GFR was 5.0 to 7.0 mL per minute (late start). The primary outcome was death from any cause.

- **Results**: Between July 2000 and November 2008, a total of 828 adults (mean age, 60.4 years; 542 men and 286 women; 355 with diabetes) underwent randomization, with a median time to the initiation of dialysis of 1.80 months (95% confidence interval, 1.60 to 2.23) in the early-start group and 7.40 months (95% CI, 6.23 to 8.27) in the late-start group. A total of 75.9% of the patients in the late-start group initiated dialysis when the estimated GFR was above the target of 7.0 mL per minute, owing to the development of symptoms. During a median follow-up period of 3.59 years, 152 of 404 patients in the early-start group (37.6%) and 155 of 424 in the late-start group.

### Canadian society of nephrology 2014 clinical practice guideline for timing the initiation of chronic dialysis [^115PkCBP]. CMAJ (2014). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic kidney disease, particularly relating to renal replacement therapy (RRT), the Canadian Society of Nephrology's 2014 guidelines recommend adopting an intent-to-defer rather than an intent-to-start-early approach for initiating chronic dialysis in adult patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Adherence to ketoacids/essential amino acids-supplemented low protein diets and new indications for patients with chronic kidney disease [^117CN3FG]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Maintenance dialysis poses a significant burden on global health systems and is escalating at an unprecedented rate. A recent analysis of the prevalence of end-stage renal disease concluded that the prevalence of maintenance dialysis has increased more rapidly over the last two decades than previously predicted. Efforts to delay the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) primarily focus on controlling blood pressure and diabetes. However, in many countries, nephrologists typically do not examine CKD patients until dialysis becomes imminent, leaving few options to delay the onset of dialysis.

Increasing the time until transition to dialysis therapy may enhance the patient's quality of life and reduce the financial strain on the healthcare system. Therefore, postponing dialysis initiation should be a high priority for most patients with advanced CKD. Evidence indicates that many patients can delay the transition to dialysis; reportedly, more than 60% of CKD patients can maintain a persistently low GFR (i.e. below 25 ml/min/1.73 m²) during the two years prior to initiating dialysis. There is an opportunity to reduce the drivers of chronic kidney disease, including poorly controlled hypertension and symptoms of uremia, through a low-protein diet supplemented with ketoanalogues where available, alongside dietary salt restriction. In jurisdictions without approved ketoacids, such as the United States or Canada, essential amino acids can be used instead.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: Nationwide cohort study [^112KoDdN]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

To identify the optimal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at which to initiate dialysis in people with advanced chronic kidney disease, a nationwide observational cohort study was conducted. This study utilized the National Swedish Renal Registry of patients referred to nephrologists. Participants had a baseline eGFR between 10 and 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and were included between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016, with follow-up until June 1, 2017.

- **Main outcome measures**: The strict design criteria of a clinical trial were mimicked by using the cloning, censoring, and weighting method to eliminate immortal time bias, lead time bias, and survivor bias. A dynamic marginal structural model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and absolute risks for five-year all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) for 15 dialysis initiation strategies with eGFR values between 4 and 19 mL/min/1.73 m² in increments of 1 mL/min/1.73 m². An eGFR between 6 and 7 mL/min/1.73 m² was taken as the reference.

- **Results**: Among 10,290 incident patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (median age 73 years; 3,739 (36%) women; median eGFR 16.8 mL/min/1.73 m²), 3,822 started dialysis, 4,160 died, and 2,446 had a major adverse cardiovascular event. A parabolic relation was observed for mortality, with the lowest risk for eGFR 15–16. Compared with dialysis initiation at eGFR 6–7, initiation at eGFR 15–16 was associated with a 5.1% (95% confidence interval 2.5% to 6.9%) reduction in the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis for people with chronic kidney disease [^112Da4eH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require urgent initiation of dialysis but do not have a permanent dialysis access have traditionally commenced haemodialysis (HD) using a central venous catheter (CVC). However, several studies have reported that urgent initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a viable alternative option for such patients.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to examine the benefits and harms of urgent-start PD compared to HD initiated using a CVC in adults and children with CKD requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 May 2020 for randomised controlled trials through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. For non-randomised controlled trials, MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 11 February 2020) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 11 February 2020) were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and non-RCTs comparing urgent-start PD to HD initiated using a CVC were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of studies. Additional information was obtained from the primary investigators. The estimates of effect were analysed using a random-effects model, and results were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals.

### An integrated review of "unplanned" dialysis initiation: Reframing the terminology to "suboptimal" initiation [^11758c2u]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Whether to advise a patient to undergo an attempt to place an AVF is a complex decision that requires a nephrologist's anxious consideration. On the one hand, it is documented in the literature that there is a subset of patients who die with a functional AVF or PD catheter who never started dialysis. On the other hand, there is a compelling moral and ethical obligation to avoid long-term catheter-based vascular access. Selecting only patients with progressive nephropathy who will need to initiate HD is an imprecise science at present and requires considerable clinical judgment.

One challenge with comparing outcomes across the studies reviewed in this article is the variability in the definition of unplanned dialysis. Unplanned dialysis occurs in patients both known and unknown to nephrology services and in both late and early referrals. Some researchers defined unplanned dialysis only if it was started in a life-threatening situation. Other researchers also included an element of timing of nephrology referral (e.g. 1 to 4 months) or the lack of ready-to-use vascular or peritoneal access in the definition of unplanned dialysis. We suspect that our search has missed articles because the terms "planned" and "unplanned" dialysis starts are difficult to define and inconsistently used in the literature.

To improve evaluation of the effectiveness of strategies for reducing the incidence of unplanned dialysis, a more consistent definition is required. We propose the term "suboptimal initiation" to include all patients starting in hospital and/or with a central venous catheter.

### Time trends in initiation and dose of dialysis in end-stage renal disease patients in The Netherlands [^116hQbUD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

The guidelines published by the NKF-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) in 1997 advocate an earlier start of dialysis in ESRD patients and a higher dialysis dose than usual. We studied the possible influence of the increasing emphasis on adequate dialysis on the management of ESRD patients in The Netherlands during 1993–2000.

- **Methods**: The NECOSAD study on the adequacy of dialysis began in 1993. This prospective multi-centre study included ESRD patients older than 18 years who started HD or PD as the first RRT. We analyzed the distribution of age, gender, primary renal disease, and co-morbidity, as well as the mean residual renal function and the mean dialysis-Kt/V(urea) at 3 months in 1569 consecutive patients, by calendar year of dialysis initiation.

- **Results**: Age, gender, primary renal disease, and number of co-morbid conditions at the start of dialysis remained stable over time between 1993 and 2000. The mean renal Kt/V(urea) at 3 months increased from 0.5 in 1993 to 0.8 per week in 2000 (P < 0.01). An upward trend remained after adjustment for patient characteristics and dialysis center. The total Kt/V(urea) at 3 months increased from 3.3 in 1993 to 3.7 per week in 2000 in HD (P < 0.01) and from 2.0 in 1993 to 2.3 per week in 1999 in PD patients (P < 0.01). An upward trend in the dialysis-Kt/V(urea) was found after adjustment for renal Kt/V(urea) (HD: +0.3 per week, P = 0.06; PD: +0.2 per week, P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: These results indicate a tendency towards earlier introduction of RRT and higher doses of dialysis in The Netherlands. Potential implications of these developments on patient outcomes require further investigation.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^114W85y1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrology guidelines recommend an age-neutral approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) management based on the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. Nephrology referrals are advised for patients with an eGFR of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m² or proteinuria greater than 300 mg/g, or for those experiencing rapid progression of renal failure, defined by a sustained decline in renal function of more than 5 ml/min/1.73 m² per year.

This approach may need to be modified, as there are significant differences in prognosis and the trajectory of illness for older and younger adults with similar levels of eGFR. Compared to younger adults, older adults with advanced kidney disease lose their renal function more slowly, have multiple other comorbidities, and face a substantially higher competing risk of death from these comorbidities before needing to make a decision regarding the initiation of dialysis.

Dialysis initiation trends have led to earlier initiation, starting dialysis at higher levels of eGFR. Because of this trend, many older adults who might have otherwise died from non-renal issues are faced with a decision regarding dialysis. Between 1996 and 2009, the percentage of early US dialysis starts, at eGFR greater than 10 ml/min/1.73 m², in older adults increased from 25% to 62%. Recent observational studies using US and international dialysis registry data, along with one randomized controlled trial, failed to demonstrate a survival benefit for early initiation of dialysis.

### Should dialysis modalities be designed to remove specific uremic toxins [^116WSvcM]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

The definition of optimal dialysis therapy remains elusive. Randomized clinical trials have neither supported using urea as a surrogate marker for uremic toxicity nor provided clear-cut evidence in favor of larger solutes. Thus, where to focus resources in the development of new membranes and therapies remains unclear.

Three basic questions remain unanswered: (i) what solute(s) should be used as a marker for optimal dialysis; (ii) should dialytic therapies be designed to remove a specific solute; and (iii) how can therapies be modified to provide better control of uremic toxicity? Identification of a single, well-defined uremic toxin appears to be unlikely as new analytical tools reveal an increasingly complex uremic milieu. As a result, it is probable that membranes and therapies should be designed for the nonspecific removal of a wide variety of solutes retained in uremia.

Removal of the widest range of solutes can best be achieved using existing therapies that incorporate convection in conjunction with longer treatment times and more frequent treatments. Membranes capable of removing solutes over an expanded effective molecular size range can already be fabricated; however, their use will require novel approaches to conserve proteins, such as albumin.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1152yYgd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In an acute care setting, delaying dialysis may not be an option for patients with a rapid decline in renal function and associated oliguria. The use of serum creatinine-based measures of renal function in these situations may be confounded by the decline in somatic protein stores in acutely ill patients. On the other hand, "early" dialysis initiation in the acute setting, absent a conventional or life-threatening indication, is not supported by available studies. As these acute episodes are common but not predictable, repeated joint decision discussions are necessary to understand a patient's preferences before these stressful, often intensive care unit-related decisions are required.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: Nationwide cohort study [^112hrgHs]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

Worldwide, more than 3 million people with kidney failure need maintenance dialysis treatment for survival. These numbers are expected to double by 2030. The societal and individual burden of kidney failure treated by dialysis is high. For instance, the US Medicare fee-for-service spending for beneficiaries with kidney failure was $36.6 billion in 2018. The mean annual healthcare costs per hemodialysis patient are $93,191 in the US, and similar numbers are reported for European countries. Dialysis treatment also places a large burden on patients' daily lives. Determining the optimal timing of dialysis is therefore of substantial importance.

Despite extensive previous literature, evidence on whether an optimal glomerular filtration rate to start dialysis exists, and if so where it lies, is lacking. Previous observational studies that attempted to investigate multiple estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) strategies have been limited by insufficient power, immortal time bias, or lead time and selection biases. In 2010, the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial showed that a strategy to start dialysis at an eGFR of 10–14 mL/min/1.73 m² was not superior to one of waiting until symptoms develop or eGFR is 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m². This is reflected in subsequent guidelines, which recommend starting dialysis when symptoms and signs attributable to kidney failure arise rather than at a specific kidney function. However, IDEAL compared only two strategies, from which an optimal eGFR cannot be derived. In addition, the achieved eGFR separation in IDEAL was 1.8 (9.0 vs. 7.2).

### Meeting the challenges of the new K/DOQI guidelines [^114Y6ggm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Substantial gains in the dialytic treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease have been made during the past several decades. However, inadequate attention has been given to the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a whole. CKD and its associated complications emerge years before patients develop kidney failure and become dialysis dependent. It now is evident that to improve dialysis outcomes, it is essential for practitioners to recognize the earlier stages of CKD, not only to retard disease progression but also to prevent and treat its complications and comorbidities long before the need for dialysis arises.

The recently published National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines identify the broad-based problem of CKD in the general population and introduce action plans that can be used at the different stages of CKD. This article discusses the process behind the development of the CKD guidelines and highlights the disease evaluation, classification, and stratification system provided by the guidelines. It is hoped that widespread implementation of these recommendations will increase the understanding of CKD among both providers and patients and eliminate many of the obstacles that nephrologists have faced in providing optimal care to dialysis patients in particular and to patients with CKD in general.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^1151kkHL]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Mortality: Four studies showed that patients with an optimal start of renal replacement therapy or those who started dialysis at higher eGFR levels have better survival rates. Martínez et al. observed that patients with an optimal start of dialysis (hemofiltration or peritoneal dialysis) had greater survival than those who experienced a non-optimal start. The optimal start was defined by meeting all the following criteria: a planned dialysis start, a minimum of 6-month follow-up by a nephrologist, and a first dialysis method coinciding with the one registered at 90 days. This result remained statistically significant, with no material change after adjustment for sex, age, primary renal disease, and dialysis modality [HRCrude = 0.635 (95% CI 0.598–0.674), P < 0.001 versus HRAdj = 0.669 (95% CI 0.628–0.712), P < 0.001].

Matthew et al. also found that patients initiating dialysis therapy due to volume overload may have an increased risk for mortality compared to those initiating routine dialysis due to laboratory evidence of kidney function decline. After adjusting for demographic variables, coexisting illnesses, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, initiation of dialysis therapy for volume overload or hypertension was associated with a 1.69 (95% CI, 1.02–2.80) times higher risk for subsequent mortality compared to initiation for laboratory evidence of kidney function decline.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^114duaf9]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

While both eGFR and kidney failure-related symptoms figure prominently in recent dialysis initiation guidelines, much less attention has been given to a patient's goals and priorities. There is growing recognition that clinicians need to ensure maximal involvement of patients and their families in treatment decisions. This shared decision-making process allows patients and providers to discuss the benefits and burdens of potential treatment strategies in the context of each patient's priorities and needs. A major challenge to this shared decision approach is the fact that many older adults initiate dialysis during acute illness, without the time to understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of starting dialysis versus a non-dialytic conservative management approach. Early and repeated discussions are necessary to address this challenge.

The review provides a pragmatic framework for the shared decision-making process for older adults with advanced CKD. The questions addressed include:

- **How does a patient's rate of loss of renal function, comorbidities, and episodes of AKI impact the likelihood that a dialysis decision will become necessary?**

- **In what clinical situations should a non-dialysis approach be considered?**

- **How does AKI, as a precursor to chronic dialysis, relate to dialysis decisions?**

- **What symptoms justify dialysis initiation in older adults?**

- **How can clinicians help patients understand the potential benefits and harms of dialysis versus conservative management in the context of a patient's symptoms, goals, and priorities?**

This structured approach aims to support informed decision-making that aligns with the patient's values and preferences.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115brG9V]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Hence, a number of other studies paid attention to the comprehensive assessment of uremic signs and/or symptoms for optimal dialysis initiation. Chang et al. quantified uremic burden based on seven uremic indicators that reached the predefined threshold (hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate). Dialysis timing was classified as standard (met 0–2 uremic indicators), late (3–5 indicators), and very late (6–7 indicators), and no correlation was found between the late or very late group and mortality.

Ying et al. developed an equation based on fuzzy mathematics to assess the timing of hemodialysis initiation. The results showed that the combination of sex, age, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, hemoglobin, serum phosphorus, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure as equation variables resulted in the best accuracy to prognose three-year survival.

Matthew et al. categorized clinically documented primary indications for dialysis initiation into four groups: laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference category), uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown. They found that volume overload or hypertension was associated with the highest risk for subsequent mortality.

These studies highlight future directions for comprehensive evaluation of dialysis timing, especially in patients with volume overload and complications sensitive to volume changes during dialysis, mainly varied causes of cardiovascular instabilities. It is well known that the main functions of peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) are to remove excess solutes and fluid.

### Association between the publication of the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late trial and the timing of dialysis initiation in Canada [^115wt9bj]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Published in 2010, the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) randomized clinical trial, which randomized patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 10 and 15 mL/min/1.73 m² to planned initiation of dialysis with an estimated GFR between 10 and 14 mL/min/1.73 m² (early start) or an estimated GFR between 5 and 7 mL/min/1.73 m² (late start), concluded that early initiation was not associated with improved survival or clinical outcomes.

- **Objective**: To assess the association between the IDEAL trial results and the proportion of early dialysis starts over time.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This interrupted time series analysis used data from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register to study adult (≥ 18 years of age) patients with incident chronic dialysis between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, in Canada, which has a universal health care system. Patients from the province of Quebec were excluded because its privacy laws preclude submission of deidentified data without first-person consent. The patients included in the study (n = 28,468) had at least 90 days of nephrologist care before starting dialysis and a recorded estimated GFR at dialysis initiation. Data analyses were performed from November 2016 to January 2019.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the proportion of early dialysis starts (estimated GFR > 10.5 mL/min/1.73 m²), and the secondary outcomes included the proportions of acute inpatient dialysis starts, patients who started dialysis using a home modality, and patients receiving hemodialysis.

### Considerations in the optimal preparation of patients for dialysis [^116je8Wb]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Every year, more than 110,000 Americans are newly diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, and in the overwhelming majority, maintenance dialysis therapy is initiated. However, most patients have received no predialysis nephrology care or dietary counseling and are inadequately prepared for starting treatment; furthermore, the majority of patients do not have a functioning permanent dialysis access. Annualized mortality in the United States in the first three months after starting dialysis treatment is approximately 45%; this high rate is possibly in part due to inadequate preparation for renal replacement therapy. Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns study suggest that similar challenges exist in many parts of the world.

Implementation of strategies that mitigate the risk of adverse consequences when starting dialysis is urgently needed. In this review, we present a step-by-step approach to tackling inadequate patient preparation, which includes identifying individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are most likely to need dialysis in the future, referring patients for education, timely placement of dialysis access, and timely initiation of dialysis therapy. Treatment with dialysis might not be appropriate for some patients with progressive CKD; these individuals can be optimally managed with nondialytic, maximum conservative management.

### When enough is enough: The nephrologist's responsibility in ordering dialysis treatments [^114oUEpe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

For more than 20 years, nephrologists have reported that they are increasingly expected to dialyze patients who may receive little benefit from dialysis therapy. During this time, substantial research about the outcomes of patients of differing ages and comorbid conditions requiring dialysis has been conducted. This research has led to the development of clinical practice guidelines for dialysis decision-making based on research evidence, ethics, and the law. The importance of palliative medicine in the care of patients throughout the continuum of kidney disease has also been recognized and described. This article summarizes these advances and provides an approach for decision-making and treatment for patients who are not likely to benefit from dialysis therapy.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^116E8gjm]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The systematic review adopted the PRISMA protocol. The quality of studies was assessed through the Newcastle–Ottawa scale.

- **Data source and search strategy**: The PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases were searched for English-language articles between January 2017 and January 2022, and with search terms as described in Supplementary Data, Table S1.

- **Study selection**: Articles should meet any of the following criteria to be included: every study with reference to "start of dialysis" decision criteria that also (i) provided outcome data in patients; (ii) reported outcome data of an interaction analysis; (iii) predefined specific levels of kidney function at which RRT was initiated that were deemed early or late start of dialysis; (iv) RRT encompassed all forms of haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Editorials, case reports, reviews, letters, and studies performed in children (age < 18 years) or animals should be excluded after screening for relevant references. Additionally, a primary study objective that was not the effect of the situation at the beginning of dialysis on prognosis, cross-sectional studies, or studies without follow-up results should be excluded.

- **Quality and risk of bias assessment**: Study quality was assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa scale for observational studies, which provides a quality score per study based on three items: study participants (0–4 points), adjustment for confounding (0–2 points), and exposure/outcome of interest ascertainment (0–3 points). A study that meets all the criteria for these three dimensions would score a maximum of 9 points.

### Protocol for a prospective, cluster randomized trial to evaluate routine and deferred dialysis initiation (RADDI) in Chinese population [^113Bv29g]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The timing of when to initiate dialysis for progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has not been well established. There has been a strong trend for early dialysis initiation for these patients over the past decades. However, the perceived survival advantage of early dialysis has been questioned by a series of recent observational studies. The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) research on this issue found that all-cause mortality, comorbidities, and quality of life showed no difference between early and late dialysis starters. To better understand optimal timing for dialysis initiation, our research will evaluate the efficacy and safety of deferred dialysis initiation in a large Chinese population.

- **Methods**: The trial adopts a multicenter, cluster randomized, single-blind (outcomes assessor), and endpoint-driven design. Eligible participants are 18–80 years old, in stable CKD stages 4–5 (eGFR > 7 ml/min/1.73 m²), and with good heart function (NYHA grade I or II). Participants will be randomized into a routine or deferred dialysis group. The reference eGFR at initiating dialysis for asymptomatic patients is 7 ml/min/1.73 m² (routine dialysis group) and 5 ml/min/1.73 m² or less (deferred dialysis group). The primary endpoint will be the difference of all-cause mortality and acute nonfatal cerebro-cardiovascular events between the two groups. The secondary outcomes include the hospitalization rate and other safety indices. The primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed by appropriate statistical methods.

- **Discussion**: This study protocol aims to provide insights into.

### Dialysis initiation for patients with decompensated cirrhosis when liver transplant is unlikely [^112T1ABD]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this review is to describe an approach that emphasizes shared decision-making for patients with decompensated cirrhosis and acute kidney injury when liver transplantation is either not an option or unlikely to be an option.

When acute kidney injury occurs against a background of decompensated cirrhosis, outcomes are generally poor, and providers can be faced with prognostic uncertainty. A lack of guidance from nephrology and hepatology professional societies means that providers often rely on expert opinion or institutional practice patterns.

For patients who are unlikely to receive liver transplantation, the occurrence of acute kidney injury represents an opportunity for a goals-of-care conversation. In this article, we share strategies through which providers can incorporate more shared decision-making when caring for these patients. The approach involves creating prognostic consensus among multidisciplinary teams and then relying on skilled communicators to share the prognosis. Palliative care consultation can be useful when teams need assistance in the conversations.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hyperoxaluria, specifically with respect to dialysis, the ERN ERKNet/OxalEurope 2023 guidelines recommend personalizing the dialysis regimen based on clinical observations of oxalosis and plasma oxalate values. The aim is to maintain plasma oxalate values within the range found in patients with kidney failure who do not have primary hyperoxaluria.

### Factors that lead to dialysis as the preferred treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease [^113zVKYX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

To describe the forces that lead to dialysis as the preferred treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease, it is important to consider recent findings. Although chronic dialysis is life-saving and the only option available for many individuals, the treatment of the underlying causes of kidney disease and transplantation may be preferable options for many patients.

- **Factors influencing dialysis preference**: Factors that favor dialysis instead of the treatment of underlying kidney disease or transplantation include the lack of proper diagnosis, lack of proper treatment of underlying kidney disease, poor compliance, lack of consideration for transplantation, early initiation of dialysis therapy, and financial incentives.

- **Developments and implications**: New developments that may reverse this trend include genetic panels that improve the diagnosis of kidney disease, new methods of transplantation, and legislation that encourages kidney transplantation.

By recognizing factors that favor dialysis over other therapies, nephrologists may be better able to provide care to their patients and prevent dialysis. Researchers may be able to focus on research that will prevent the need for dialysis, and professional societies may work to prevent unnecessary dialysis.

### Approaches to uremia [^111vUG4T]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The development of dialysis was a dramatic step forward in medicine, allowing people who would soon have died because of the lack of kidney function to remain alive for years. We have since found, however, that the "artificial kidney" does not live up fully to its name. Dialysis keeps patients alive but not well. Part of the residual illness that dialysis patients experience is caused by retained waste solutes that dialysis does not remove as well as native kidney function does. New means are available to identify these toxic solutes, about which we currently know remarkably little, and knowledge of these solutes would help us to improve therapy. This review summarizes our knowledge of toxic solutes and highlights methods being explored to identify additional toxic solutes and to enhance the clearance of these solutes to improve patient outcomes.

### Dialysis cannot be dosed [^117KWaP8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Adequate dialysis is difficult to define because we have not identified the toxic solutes that contribute most to uremic illness. Therefore, dialysis prescriptions cannot be adjusted to control the levels of these solutes. The solution to this problem is to define an adequate dose of dialysis based on the fraction of urea removed from the body. This approach has provided a practical guide to treatment as the dialysis population has grown over the past 25 years.

Indeed, a lower limit to Kt/V (urea) or the related urea reduction ratio is now established as a quality indicator by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for chronic hemodialysis patients in the United States. For now, this urea-based standard provides a useful tool to avoid grossly inadequate dialysis.

However, dialysis dosing based on the measurement of a single, relatively nontoxic solute can only offer a very limited guide toward improved treatment. Prescriptions with similar effects on the index solute can have widely different effects on other solutes. The dose concept discourages attempts to increase the removal of such solutes independent of the index solute. Furthermore, it assumes that important solutes are produced at a constant rate relative to body size, discouraging attempts to augment dialysis treatment by reducing solute production.

Identification of toxic solutes would provide a more rational basis for the prescription of dialysis and ultimately for improved treatment of patients with renal failure.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in acute kidney injury and acute-on-chronic renal failure [^1129jrwE]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The decision to provide dialytic support and choosing the ideal moment to initiate therapy are common impasses for physicians treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years, there is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal utilization of RRT in AKI. In the absence of traditional or urgent indications, there is no consensus on whether dialysis should be offered and when it should be started. The lack of agreed-upon parameters to guide the decision, the fear of the risk of the procedure, and the possible contribution to worse prognosis with RRT have resulted in a considerable variation in practice among physicians and centers. In this review, we summarize the evidence evaluating the time of initiation of RRT and discuss possible approaches for future trials in addressing this issue.

### End-stage renal disease in 2010: Timing of dialysis initiation and choice of dialysis modality [^112wtUYu]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Few, if any, doubt that renal transplantation should be the first choice of renal replacement therapy whenever this option is possible. However, at what level of remaining kidney function should patients start on dialysis, and which dialysis modality should be used? Several studies published in 2010 addressed these questions and are expected to influence dialysis initiation strategies worldwide for years to come.

### When to initiate dialysis: effect of proposed US guidelines on survival [^113KrqDY]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines from the US National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative recommend an earlier start of dialysis treatment than has been common practice. Their implementation would have a substantial effect on patients' daily lives and would increase costs. The guidelines are largely opinion-based because evidence is still lacking.

- **Methods**: As part of a prospective multicentre study in the Netherlands, we included all new patients with end-stage renal disease, for whom data were available on residual renal function 0–4 weeks before the start of dialysis, between January 1997 and May 1999. We recorded the date of death or censoring until August 2000.

- **Findings**: Of the 253 patients, 94 (37%) started dialysis treatment later than recommended by the US guideline. There was an increased mortality risk for these patients compared with those who started dialysis on time, although it was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio 1.66 [95% CI 0.95–2.89]). The adjusted difference in estimated survival time after 3 years on dialysis treatment was 2.5 months (1.1–4.0) in favor of timely starters. Conversely, the average delay in dialysis initiation for late starters, the extra time free of dialysis, was at least 4.1 months.

- **Interpretation**: Although we observed a gain in survival time with a timely start of dialysis, it is probably a reflection of initiating dialysis earlier in the disease. Given the clinical evidence and the effects it would have on patients and dialysis resource allocation, we question the benefit of putting this guideline into daily practice.

### Timing of dialysis initiation: When to start? Which treatment [^116hxVwj]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

During the late 1990s, early initiation of dialysis was introduced on a large scale, and between 1996 and 2008, the percentage of patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 10 mL/minute starting dialysis rose from 25% to 54% in the United States. However, several subsequent studies showed no survival benefit for patients commencing dialysis earlier. One possible explanation for the negative results could be that eGFR may be a flawed index; serum creatinine is lower in patients with muscle wasting or fluid overload, and these vulnerable patients with a high comorbidity burden often start "early", i.e. at higher eGFR. Another explanation could be that dialysis is, in fact, harmful; dialysis initiation with conventional thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis clearly associates with increased initial mortality risk, especially when using temporary dialysis catheters. Interestingly, patients starting on peritoneal dialysis (PD) appear to have better initial outcomes. More attention should be given to finding new objective mortality-predictive markers of uremia, reducing the use of temporary hemodialysis catheters, and increasing the use of PD as the initial dialysis modality. PD may not only provide better initial dialysis outcomes but may also preserve renal function and vessels for vascular access for the benefit of better long-term outcomes.

### Estimated GFR reporting influences recommendations for dialysis initiation [^112WLQsp]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Automated reporting of estimated GFR (eGFR) with serum creatinine measurement is now common. We surveyed nephrologists in four countries to determine whether eGFR reporting influences nephrologists' recommendations for dialysis initiation. Respondents were randomly allocated to receive a survey of four clinical vignettes that included either serum creatinine concentration only or serum creatinine and the corresponding eGFR. For each scenario, the respondent was asked to rank his or her likelihood of recommending dialysis initiation on a modified 8-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ("definitely not") to 8 ("definitely would").

Analysis of the 822 eligible responses received showed that the predicted likelihood of recommending dialysis increased by 0.55 points when eGFR was reported (95% confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.76) and this effect was larger for eGFRs greater than 5 ml/min per 1.73 m² (P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested that physicians who had been in practice for 13 or more years were more affected by eGFR reporting (P = 0.03). These results indicate that eGFR reporting modestly increases the likelihood that dialysis is recommended, and physicians should be aware of this effect when assessing patients with severe CKD.

### Indication for dialysis initiation and mortality in patients with chronic kidney failure: A retrospective cohort study [^1169bfPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Initiation of maintenance dialysis therapy for patients with chronic kidney failure is a period of high risk for adverse patient outcomes. Whether indications for dialysis therapy initiation are associated with mortality in this population is unknown.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: 461 patients who initiated dialysis therapy (hemodialysis, 437; peritoneal dialysis, 24) from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2012, and were treated in facilities operated by a single dialysis organization. Follow-up for the primary outcome was through December 31, 2013.

- **Predictor**: Clinically documented primary indication for dialysis therapy initiation, categorized into four groups: laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference category), uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown.

- **Outcomes**: All-cause mortality.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 183 (40%) patients died. Crude mortality rates were 10.0 (95% CI, 6.8–14.7), 12.7 (95% CI, 10.2–15.7), 21.7 (95% CI, 16.4–28.6), and 12.2 (95% CI, 6.8–14.7) deaths/100 patient-years among patients initiating dialysis therapy primarily for laboratory evidence of kidney function decline, uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown reasons, respectively. Following adjustment for demographic variables, coexisting illnesses, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, initiation of dialysis therapy for uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, or other/unknown reasons was associated with 1.12 (95% CI, 0.72–1.77), 1.69 (95% CI,…

### Indications and timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^116gfQtN]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The optimal timing for the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) remains uncertain. Conventionally accepted indications include volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, overt uremia, and even progressive azotemia in the absence of specific symptoms; however, precise definitions for these indications are lacking. Data from recent observational trials suggest that early initiation of RRT may be associated with decreased mortality; however, the results of these studies are inconclusive. Existing data on the timing of initiation of RRT in AKI that guide clinical practice are summarized, and issues that need to be addressed in future clinical trials are discussed.

### Earlier-start versus usual-start dialysis in patients with community-acquired acute kidney injury: a randomized controlled trial [^115pdyRa]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). High credibility.

The optimum timing of the initiation of dialysis therapy in acute kidney injury is not clear.

- **Study design**: Prospective, open label, 2-arm, randomized, controlled trial.

- **Setting & participants**: 208 adults with acute kidney injury and progressively worsening azotemia at the artificial kidney dialysis unit of a tertiary-care referral center in western India.

- **Intervention**: Earlier-start dialysis was initiated when serum urea nitrogen and/or creatinine levels increased to 70 and 7 mg/dL, respectively, whereas the usual-start dialysis patients (control group) received dialysis when clinically indicated, as judged by treating nephrologists.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and dialysis dependence at 3 months. The secondary outcome in patients receiving dialysis was the time to recovery of kidney function, computed from the time of enrollment to the last dialysis session.

- **Results**: Of 585 screened patients, 102 were assigned to earlier-start dialysis, and 106 to usual-start dialysis. Baseline characteristics were similar between randomized groups. 93 (91.1%) and 88 (83.1%) participants received dialysis in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Mean serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels at dialysis therapy initiation were 71.7 ± 21.7 (SD) and 7.4 ± 5.3 mg/dL, respectively, in the intervention group versus 100.9 ± 32.6 and 10.41 ± 3.3 mg/dL in the control group. Data on primary outcome were available for all patients. In-hospital mortality was 20.5% and 12.2% in the intervention and control groups, respectively (relative risk, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.88–3.1).

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: Nationwide cohort study [^1128y5r2]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 30,180 patients registered in the Swedish Renal Registry during the study period, 10,290 with an eGFR between 10 and 20 mL/min/1.73 m² were eligible for inclusion in our study. Supplementary figure B shows the patient selection flowchart, and table 1 describes their baseline characteristics. At baseline, patients had a median age of 73 years (interquartile range 63–80 years); 35.7% were women, and 42.1% had diabetes. The median eGFR was 16.8 mL/min/1.73 m² (14.3–18.6), and 68.9% of the study population had an eGFR between 15 and 20 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Baseline characteristics**: Patients under nephrologist care with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m² were registered in the Swedish Renal Registry during January 2007 to December 2016, both overall and stratified by early, intermediate, and late dialysis initiation. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise.

During follow-up, 3,822 patients started dialysis, most with an eGFR between 5 and 8 mL/min/1.73 m² (see supplementary figure C). Haemodialysis was the initial dialysis modality in 2,339 patients (61.2%), and peritoneal dialysis in 1,483 (38.8%).

### Starting dialysis at eGFR > 5 ml/min per 1.73 m²: Are we barking up the wrong tree [^117GptNm]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Although the goal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for chronic dialysis initiation is currently above 5 ml/min per 1.73 m², there is no convincing evidence that patients will benefit from this approach. With close follow-up of advanced chronic kidney disease patients, aiming to start dialysis at an estimated GFR (eGFR) less than 5 ml/min per 1.73 m² may result in the avoidance of potentially unnecessary end-of-life dialysis and could result in significant dialysis-free time for a large segment of the world's future dialysis population.

### Suggested guidelines for the diagnosis and management of urea cycle disorders: First revision [^113bHpNu]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for urea cycle disorders, specifically extracorporeal detoxification, the TEWG-UCD 2019 guidelines recommend initiating extracorporeal detoxification in patients with severe neurological symptoms induced by hyperammonemia, in conjunction with medical treatment. It is advised to begin extracorporeal detoxification as soon as possible unless initial medical treatment has already led to sufficient improvement in ammonia levels and the clinical situation.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^113Bbma5]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence of the benefits of augmented haemodialysis schedules, in terms of both outcome and health-related quality of life, but providing more frequent dialysis in-centre is a challenge in the UK, and it is widely recognised that augmented schedules are most easily accommodated in the home setting. The literature on home haemodialysis and augmented schedules therefore overlaps substantially, but home haemodialysis additionally is increasingly acknowledged to provide a level of convenience and flexibility not achievable in-centre.

Despite these benefits, the penetration of home haemodialysis in the UK remains low, comprising only 0.4% of incident and 2% of prevalent dialysis patients. Many organisations such as NICE and KDIGO promote universal availability for clinically suitable patients, acknowledging that collaborative working between centres may be required. However, it is clear from registry data that variability of access still exists, with some centres not offering this modality, and considerable variation in uptake between centres.

Home haemodialysis patients must be able to manage their dialysis safely and monitor their condition. Modality decisions should be supported by a full assessment of clinical and social circumstances, as well as the home environment, including a discussion of the impact of therapy on others within the household. It is essential that patient and carer expectations and fears are appropriately addressed before commencing training. Few data are available to guide on clinical suitability, but the ability to manage the treatment effectively is crucial.

### Dialysis initiation: What's the rush [^115NHERS]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The recent trend towards early initiation of dialysis, at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m², appears to be based on conventional wisdom that is not supported by evidence. Observational studies using administrative databases report worse comorbidity-adjusted dialysis survival with early dialysis initiation. Although some have concluded that the IDEAL randomized controlled trial of dialysis start provided evidence that patients become symptomatic with late dialysis start, there is no definitive support for this view. The potential harms of early dialysis initiation, including the loss of residual renal function (RRF), have been well documented.

- **Renal function trajectory**: The rate of RRF loss is an important consideration for timing the dialysis initiation decision. Patients with low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may have sufficient RRF to be maintained off dialysis for years. Delaying dialysis start until a working arterio-venous access is in place seems prudent in light of the lack of harm and possible benefit of late dialysis initiation.

Prescribing frequent hemodialysis is not recommended when dialysis is initiated early. The benefits of early initiation of chronic dialysis following episodes of congestive heart failure or acute kidney injury require further study. There are no data to show that early start benefits diabetics or other patient groups. Preemptive start of dialysis in noncompliant patients may be necessary to avoid complications. The decision to initiate dialysis requires informed patient consent and a joint decision by the patient and dialysis provider.

### Impact of incremental initiation of haemodialysis on mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZM3k1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Haemodialysis (HD) has long been established as a life-sustaining treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Despite this, mortality rates are disproportionately high, especially within the first few months following the initiation of treatment. Researchers have speculated that this may be due to difficulties in patients adjusting to the sudden intensity of haemodialysis, which is conventionally prescribed three times a week.

It has been suggested that some patients may benefit from a gentler start to dialysis treatment. In line with this, incremental HD has been proposed as an alternative to conventional HD whereby dialysis dosage can be tailored to the individual according to their level of residual kidney function (RKF). This approach allows some patients to start haemodialysis at a lower intensity (e.g. twice weekly) and gradually increase the amount of dialysis they receive as their natural kidney function declines. To achieve this, dialysis and RKF clearance are usually combined into a composite measure, and dialysis dose adjusted to ensure this total clearance remains above accepted minimum levels. Safe performance of incremental HD, therefore, requires frequent measurement of RKF and adjustment of dialysis prescription. Among potential benefits, there are suggestions that incremental HD may help preserve both RKF and vascular access function, reduce treatment burden, and even improve survival.

The Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology-Haemodialysis (SONG-HD) initiative, which aims to establish core outcomes of HD research, has listed 'dialys…

### When should renal replacement therapy be initiated for acute kidney injury [^111sTgXY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now well recognized as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality, particularly when dialysis is needed. Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been used in AKI for more than five decades, there is no standard methodology to predict which AKI patients will need dialysis and who will recover renal function without requiring dialysis.

The lack of consensus on what parameters should guide the decision to start dialysis has led to a wide variation in dialysis utilization. A contributing factor is the lack of studies in the modern era evaluating the relationship of the timing of dialysis initiation and outcomes. Although listed as one of the top priorities in research on AKI, the timing of dialysis initiation has not been included as a factor in large, randomized controlled trials in this area.

We will discuss the criteria that have been used to define early versus late initiation in previous studies on dialysis initiation. In addition, we propose a patient-centered approach to define early and late initiation that could serve as a framework for managing patients and for future studies in this area.

### Hard choices, better outcomes: A review of shared decision-making and patient decision aids around dialysis initiation and conservative kidney management [^116po5LA]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Patients reaching end-stage kidney disease face difficult decisions, including choosing among renal replacement therapies (RRTs). With an increasingly elderly and frail population, there is growing interest in conservative kidney management (CKM) as a viable alternative to dialysis. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centered approach to these decisions, in which choices are viewed within the explicitly discussed values and preferences of the patient. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools designed to facilitate these discussions. The choice between dialysis and CKM is particularly complex, given the poor prognostication data for CKM. This is an emerging area for PDAs in nephrology. This review highlights care gaps around SDM for dialysis versus CKM, presents PDAs for making choices about RRTs and CKM, and discusses exciting new work around the development of novel PDAs.

- **Recent findings**: Many PDAs have been created recently, primarily to help with decisions about RRTs. Three new PDAs are in testing phases to aid with the more complex decision of choosing between dialysis and CKM.

- **Summary**: International nephrology communities are moving toward improved SDM with their patients, and PDAs are being developed to facilitate this process.

### Determinants of urgent start dialysis in a chronic kidney disease cohort followed by nephrologists [^112n66Ca]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) registry collects dialysis initiation context for each patient starting dialysis, using a flawed definition of urgent start dialysis (USD). The main objective of this study was to identify factors associated with USD in patients regularly followed by a nephrologist, using a classification of USD that considers the preparation for renal replacement therapy.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients who started dialysis between 2012 and 2018 in the Franche-Comté region of France following a minimum of two nephrology consultations. We classified dialysis initiation context as follows: USD for patients with no dialysis access (DA) created or planned, unplanned non-urgent start dialysis (UNUSD) for patients starting with a recent or non-functional DA, and planned start dialysis (PSD) for those starting with a functional and mature DA.

- **Results**: Four hundred and sixty-five patients met inclusion criteria. According to the REIN registry, 94 (20.3%) patients were urgent starters (US), whereas with our classification, 80 (17.2%) were US and 73 (15.7%) were unplanned non-urgent starters (UNUS). The factors independently associated with USD in our classification were stroke (odds ratio (OR) = 2.76, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = [1.41–5.43]), cardiac failure (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = [1.07–2.96]), and the number of nephrology consultations prior to dialysis onset (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = [0.64–0.83]). Thirty-one patients died during the first year after dialysis start.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hyperoxaluria, more specifically with respect to dialysis, ERN ERKNet/OxalEurope 2023 guidelines recommend considering kidney replacement therapy before kidney failure has developed in patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 at high risk of systemic oxalosis because of the high plasma oxalate values or in patients already having comorbidities.

### An integrated review of "unplanned" dialysis initiation: Reframing the terminology to "suboptimal" initiation [^115PpRSr]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Results: Description of studies**: Described in Table 1, the eight studies included in this review were prospective observational or retrospective, enrolling 109 to 2815 patients, with follow-up periods ranging from 8 weeks to three years. Outcomes included clinical status (e.g. laboratory parameters) at baseline, mortality, hospitalization, and quality of life. Three studies assessed only baseline status at first dialysis. One study reported economic outcomes.

- **Definition of unplanned dialysis**: The majority of studies used the term "unplanned". Two studies used the terms "known acute" and "non-programmed". With the exception of three studies that included only patients referred to nephrology prior to first dialysis, most enrolled patients regardless of referral status to nephrology. Three studies defined unplanned dialysis as starting in a life-threatening situation. Two other studies defined unplanned as those patients that did not have a permanent access device in place.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^114TjdSP]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The exact optimal timing of dialysis for ESKD patients remains unknown. This study systematically reviewed the available evidence regarding the optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis in ESKD patients.

- **Methods**: An electronic search was performed in Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library to find studies investigating associations between variables related to the "start of dialysis" and outcomes. Quality and bias assessments were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the ROBINSI tool. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis could not be performed.

- **Results**: Thirteen studies were included; four studies included only haemodialysis patients, three peritoneal dialysis, and six both. Study outcomes included mortality, cardiovascular events, technique failure, quality of life, and others. Nine studies mainly focused on the optimal GFR for maintenance dialysis initiation. Five studies showed no association between GFR and mortality or other adverse outcomes, two studies indicated that dialysis initiation at higher GFR levels was associated with poor prognosis, and two studies showed higher GFR levels with better prognosis. Three studies focused on comprehensive assessments of uremic signs and/or symptoms for optimal dialysis initiation. Uremic burden based on seven uremic indicators (hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate) was not associated with mortality. Another equation combined sex, age, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and serum phosphorus for analysis.

### Peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis for people commencing dialysis [^113u5F5P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) are two possible modalities for people with kidney failure commencing dialysis. Only a few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated PD versus HD, and the benefits and harms of the two modalities remain uncertain. This review includes both RCTs and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of PD, compared to HD, in people with kidney failure initiating dialysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies from 2000 to June 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for NRSIs from 2000 until 28 March 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs and NRSIs evaluating PD compared to HD in people initiating dialysis were eligible.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two investigators independently assessed if the studies were eligible and then extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using standard Cochrane methods, and relevant outcomes were extracted for each report. The primary outcome was residual kidney function (RKF). Secondary outcomes included all-cause, cardiovascular and infection-related death, infection, cardiovascular disease, hospitalisation, technique survival, life participation, and fatigue.

- **Main results**: A total of 153 reports of 84 studies (2 RCTs, 82 NRSIs) were included.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111uJJ39]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Most research on dialysis dose is based on urea clearance in patients on a thrice-weekly schedule. Urea clearance can be calculated by three commonly used methods: the Urea Reduction Ratio, and the 'single pool' and 'equilibrated' formulas for Kt/V. Kt/V is less commonly calculated by Urea Kinetic Modelling. These methods are summarized mathematically in Appendix 1. The diversity of methods can lead to duplication of effort, confusion over the meaning of targets, and impede comparison between centers. Thus, a single widely used method would be desirable. As the most adjusted method and the one commonly validated in outcome literature, eKt/V seems to be optimal, and we have therefore given dose targets in terms of eKt/V. Equivalent targets using other methods may be derived for individual patients depending on their dialysis duration and fluid removal.

The literature on clinical outcomes at different doses of dialysis is dominated by two randomized studies. The National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) was the landmark study that led to the concept of a threshold dialysis dose above which treatment was deemed adequate. It also established Kt/V as the accepted index of dialysis dose. Reported in 1981, the study randomized 151 patients in a 2×2 design to high vs. low time-averaged urea and short vs. long dialysis duration. The key finding was a lower rate of treatment failure (death or hospital admission) in the low urea (high dialysis dose) group. When reanalyzing the group with the newly proposed Kt/V measure, a clear threshold effect was observed.

### Timing of dialysis initiation and survival in ESRD [^111eSU2U]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The optimal time for dialysis initiation is unclear. The goal of this analysis was to compare survival outcomes in patients with early and late start dialysis, as measured by kidney function at dialysis initiation.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients entering the U.S. Renal Data System database from January 1, 1995, to September 30, 2006. Patients were classified into groups by estimated GFR (eGFR) at dialysis initiation.

- **Results**: In this total incident population (n = 896,546), 99,231 patients had an early dialysis start (eGFR > 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²), and 113,510 had a late start (eGFR ≤ 5 ml/min per 1.73 m²). The following variables were significant (P 5 to 10 ml/min per 1.73 m²). At dialysis start, a Cox model adjusted for potential confounding variables showed an incremental increase in mortality associated with earlier dialysis start. The group with the earliest start had an increased risk of mortality, whereas a late start was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. Subgroup analyses showed similar results. The limitations of the study are its retrospective study design, potential unaccounted confounding, and potential selection and lead-time biases.

- **Conclusions**: Late initiation of dialysis is associated with a reduced risk of mortality, arguing against aggressive early dialysis initiation.

### Initiation of dialysis should be timely: neither early nor late [^1125Gsji]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States have been starting maintenance dialysis therapy at progressively higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs). Several observational studies have demonstrated an association between a higher risk of death and higher serum creatinine-based estimates of GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis. In contrast, studies measuring renal function through timed urinary collection show either a lower risk of death or no significant association with higher GFR at the time of dialysis initiation.

There are numerous potential sources of bias in such observational studies, particularly in those using serum creatinine-based eGFR. The only randomized controlled clinical trial to have examined this question did not demonstrate either benefit or harm with the initiation of dialysis at a higher level of renal function. Therefore, the data at the time of writing suggest that eGFR should not be the sole consideration when assessing the need to initiate maintenance dialysis in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Given the high societal costs of starting renal replacement therapy earlier in the course of the disease, these considerations also suggest that dialysis can be safely postponed in otherwise asymptomatic individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease. Conversely, dialysis should not be denied to individuals who could clearly benefit from renal replacement therapy merely because the GFR is too high (e.g. volume overload, refractory hyperkalemia).
