## Question

blepharitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blepharitis management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining blepharitis and its subtypes. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and key differentials. Next, I will review first-line conservative therapy and when to escalate. After that, I need to examine evidence for antibiotics, corticosteroids, and oral agents. I will then consider Demodex-specific strategies, including lotilaner. Finally, I should address special populations, follow-up, and summarize a practical algorithm with attention to evidence quality and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and classification so I don't anchor prematurely. Blepharitis is a chronic eyelid margin inflammation that can be anterior (lash base/ciliary involvement, often staphylococcal or seborrheic) or posterior (meibomian gland dysfunction), with frequent overlap and contribution from Demodex infestation, which may account for up to 70% of cases in some series, so I need to keep parasitic etiologies in mind from the outset [^112MAxKs] [^115nNzXo] [^115gEaPo].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. I should elicit symptom chronology (worse in the morning suggests blepharitis; later in the day suggests aqueous-deficient dry eye), exacerbating factors, systemic associations (rosacea, atopy), and medication exposures, and I should examine visual acuity, external lids, and perform slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the tear film, lid margins, lashes, tarsal/bulbar conjunctiva, and cornea to stage severity and look for collarettes, which are pathognomonic for Demodex blepharitis [^114SqRy3] [^111T3M9X] [^112iPCL7] [^115nNzXo].

> Hold on, I should verify the differential and red flags so I don't miss masqueraders. If inflammation is refractory, unilateral, or associated with madarosis or cicatricial conjunctival changes, I need to consider carcinoma or immune-mediated disease and refer appropriately. Likewise, any suspicious eyelid lesion warrants urgent referral to rule out malignancy [^114Xr6mJ] [^116vM4tH] [^117UWgSM].

> Next, I will establish first-line conservative therapy, but I need to ensure I'm precise about indications and technique. Warm compresses and eyelid hygiene are foundational: wet compresses help loosen anterior crusts, while dry compresses at about 40°C for at least 5 minutes twice daily can melt meibum in posterior disease; lid cleansing with dilute baby shampoo or hypochlorous acid (about 0.01%) and gentle lash-base scrubbing reduce bacterial load and debris, and I should tailor the regimen to dexterity and tolerance, emphasizing daily or several-times-weekly routines [^116s7533] [^113zowfm] [^111VeEAF] [^1112gCLG].

> I should double-check adjunctive surface support because tear film instability is common. Preservative-free artificial tears, especially oil/lipid-based formulations, can be used frequently, and if needed more than four times daily, nonpreserved drops are preferred to minimize toxicity; this is particularly helpful in posterior blepharitis/MGD where meibum deficiency destabilizes the tear film [^1153CPDs].

> Now, let me consider when to escalate to antibiotics, and I need to be careful not to overstate their role. For anterior staphylococcal or seborrheic blepharitis not controlled with hygiene, short courses of topical antibiotics such as bacitracin or erythromycin ointment applied to the lid margins once or more daily or at bedtime for a few weeks are reasonable; azithromycin can be considered off-label, but I should remember potential cardiac arrhythmias with systemic azithromycin in susceptible patients and avoid unnecessary prolonged use [^116PyvVV] [^113EpPp6] [^112fsLBF].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied oral antibiotics are broadly indicated. I should correct that. Evidence for oral antibiotics in chronic blepharitis is limited and low certainty, with small RCTs suggesting only modest symptom/sign improvements and higher adverse event rates at higher doses. Thus, oral tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline 40–100 mg) may be considered second-line for refractory posterior blepharitis/MGD, especially with rosacea, but I need to counsel on GI upset, photosensitivity, and contraindications in pregnancy and children, and I should re-evaluate early for response and tolerability [^115MWGew] [^116xxfhH] [^112YaZAP].

> I will now examine the role of corticosteroids, and I need to ensure I minimize steroid-induced risks. Short, tapering courses of low-penetration topical corticosteroids (e.g., loteprednol or fluorometholone) can rapidly control eyelid or ocular surface inflammation such as marginal keratitis or phlyctenules, but I should avoid long-term therapy, monitor IOP within a few weeks, and taper to the lowest effective dose or intermittent use for comfort [^1135sFF8] [^116rrhJm] [^116hycEh].

> But wait, what if Demodex is the driver? I should confirm how to identify and target it. Collarettes at the lash base are pathognomonic for Demodex blepharitis, and I can screen simply by having the patient look down at the slit lamp; treatment success can be monitored by collarette reduction rather than mite counts, which aligns with expert consensus and supports a practical clinical endpoint [^115nNzXo] [^111N9ebb].

> Let me consider Demodex-directed therapy, and I need to check the strength of evidence. Tea tree oil formulations (often 5–50% terpinen-4-ol) can reduce mite counts and improve symptoms in the short term, but evidence quality is limited, ocular irritation is common, and some in vitro data suggest potential meibomian gland toxicity; thus, if used, lower concentrations and careful technique are prudent, and I should monitor tolerability closely [^111frw5o] [^112PUpaj].

> Hold on, I should verify the status of newer targeted therapy. Lotilaner ophthalmic solution 0.25%, an ectoparasiticide, has FDA approval for Demodex blepharitis and shows robust mite eradication and collarette reduction in meta-analyses. Expert consensus increasingly supports it as first-line for clinically significant collarette burden, with treatment response tracked by collarette clearance, which operationalizes a clinically meaningful endpoint [^112JxPAB] [^1128Mshj] [^116GtGdo].

> I need to ensure I don't overpromise on procedural adjuncts. In-office microblepharoexfoliation (e.g. BlephEx) has been proposed to reduce biofilm burden, but a recent randomized, double-masked trial showed no significant advantage over sham for OSDI or ocular surface parameters at 4 weeks; therefore, I should not routinely recommend it outside of research or select refractory cases, and I should be transparent about the limited evidence [^117McYH4] [^112BerSc].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts so I don't miss nuances. In children, chronic blepharokeratoconjunctivitis can be severe and vision-threatening; I should maintain a high index of suspicion with recurrent conjunctivitis, keratitis, or chalazia and consider early ophthalmology referral. In patients with ocular rosacea, I should integrate BAD guidance: warm compresses, preservative-free lubricants, lid hygiene, and systemic rosacea therapies (e.g., doxycycline, azelaic acid, ivermectin) as indicated, while minimizing environmental triggers. Before intraocular surgery, I should optimize lid hygiene and consider a short preoperative topical antibiotic course to reduce bacterial load, balancing against resistance risks [^112e95Eo] [^1151T47y] [^112Q3dq4] [^115iEWgB].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and safety monitoring so care remains proactive. Mild cases can be monitored with patient-initiated follow-up if worsening, whereas moderate-to-severe disease or any corticosteroid use warrants reassessment within weeks to gauge response, check IOP, and reinforce adherence. Structured visits should include interval history, visual acuity, external and slit-lamp examination, and adjustment of therapy based on severity and comorbidities such as glaucoma [^116TLVEj] [^111w32WZ].

> Let me reconsider the overall message so expectations are realistic. Blepharitis is typically chronic and not curable, but symptoms can usually be improved with sustained lid hygiene and targeted pharmacotherapy; patient education on adherence, chronicity, and the need for maintenance is essential, and I should explicitly counsel that symptoms are rarely eliminated entirely to avoid disappointment and nonadherence [^116RkH1h] [^1111wBMF] [^115WJAmC].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while acknowledging evidence limitations. Start with warm compresses and daily lid hygiene for all. Add preservative-free artificial tears for surface symptoms. Escalate to topical antibiotics for refractory anterior disease. Consider a short, low-penetration corticosteroid burst for significant inflammation with close IOP monitoring. Reserve oral tetracyclines for refractory posterior disease, especially with rosacea. Actively screen for Demodex and treat with lotilaner when collarettes are present. Avoid routine in-office debridement given weak evidence. And maintain vigilance for atypical or nonresponsive cases to exclude malignancy or immune etiologies, adjusting the plan iteratively based on response and patient factors [^112Q3dq4] [^117D8QXZ] [^114nVCys] [^117McYH4] [^114Xr6mJ].

---

Blepharitis is a **chronic eyelid margin inflammation** [^112MAxKs] with anterior (staphylococcal/seborrheic) and posterior (Meibomian gland dysfunction) subtypes [^116aBD2n]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with hallmark signs of lid margin erythema, crusting, and collarettes; **slit-lamp exam** distinguishes anterior from posterior disease [^112iPCL7] [^1127f946]. First-line management is **daily warm compresses and lid hygiene** [^112Q3dq4]; add topical antibiotics for bacterial overgrowth [^116PyvVV], short-course topical corticosteroids for inflammation [^1135sFF8], and oral tetracyclines for refractory posterior disease or rosacea [^112Q3dq4]. Demodex blepharitis is treated with tea tree oil or lotilaner 0.25% [^112JxPAB]; most patients need ongoing maintenance to control symptoms and prevent complications [^116RkH1h].

---

## Classification and etiology

Blepharitis is classified as **anterior or posterior** based on the affected eyelid structures [^116aBD2n]:

| **Type** | **Location** | **Etiology** |
|-|-|-|
| Anterior blepharitis | External eyelid margin and eyelashes | - Staphylococcal infection <br/> - Seborrheic dermatitis <br/> - Demodex mites [^111ypS37] |
| Posterior blepharitis | Meibomian glands | - Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) <br/> - Rosacea <br/> - Demodex mites [^111ypS37] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Common **symptoms and signs** include:

- **Symptoms**: Irritation, burning, tearing, foreign body sensation, itching, photophobia, blurred vision [^114SqRy3].
- **Signs**: Lid margin erythema, thickening, crusting, collarettes (cylindrical dandruff), Meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctival injection, corneal involvement in severe cases [^112aqzMC].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and slit-lamp examination [^114qm3HF]. Key **diagnostic features** include:

- **Morning predominance**: Symptoms worse in the morning suggest blepharitis; evening predominance suggests aqueous-deficient dry eye [^111T3M9X].
- **Collarettes**: Pathognomonic for Demodex blepharitis [^115nNzXo].
- **Slit-lamp findings**: Lid margin erythema, crusting, Meibomian gland dysfunction, corneal involvement [^112aqzMC].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Blepharitis must be differentiated from other ocular surface diseases, including:

- **Dry eye disease**: Aqueous-deficient or evaporative [^111T3M9X].
- **Conjunctivitis**: Allergic, viral, bacterial [^116sHGce].
- **Keratitis**: Infectious or inflammatory [^116En9y7].
- **Eyelid malignancy**: Suspect in unilateral, refractory cases with lash loss or cicatricial changes [^114Xr6mJ].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on symptom control, reducing inflammation, and preventing complications [^115Veh5g]. A **stepwise approach** is recommended:

---

### Non-pharmacologic therapy (first-line)

- **Warm compresses**: Apply for 5–10 minutes, once or twice daily, to loosen crusts and melt Meibomian secretions [^116s7533].
- **Eyelid hygiene**: Daily cleansing with diluted baby shampoo, commercial lid wipes, or hypochlorous acid solutions [^113zowfm].
- **Artificial tears**: Preservative-free formulations for ocular surface lubrication [^1153CPDs].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **Topical antibiotics**: Bacitracin or erythromycin ointment for bacterial overgrowth; azithromycin for posterior blepharitis/MGD [^116PyvVV] [^111acjXi].
- **Topical corticosteroids**: Short-course, minimal effective dose for inflammation control; monitor IOP [^1135sFF8] [^116hycEh].
- **Oral antibiotics**: Tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline) for refractory posterior blepharitis or rosacea [^116xxfhH] [^114jSxMS].
- **Demodex treatment**: Tea tree oil (terpinen-4-ol) or lotilaner 0.25% ophthalmic solution [^112JxPAB].

---

### In-office procedures

In-office options include **meibomian gland expression** to clear blocked glands and **intense pulsed light (IPL)** for refractory MGD, though evidence is limited [^11124r5g].

---

## Complications

Untreated or poorly managed blepharitis can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Dry eye syndrome**: Chronic tear film instability [^116aBD2n].
- **Meibomian gland dysfunction**: Chronic gland dysfunction [^115RdpCr].
- **Corneal disease**: Marginal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, ulceration [^116En9y7].
- **Eyelid deformities**: Chronic inflammation causing structural changes [^115aBxUi].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Blepharitis is **chronic and recurrent**; symptoms can be controlled but rarely eliminated [^1111wBMF]. Long-term management and patient adherence are essential to prevent recurrence and complications [^116RkH1h].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Patient education is critical; clinicians should emphasize **chronicity**, the importance of adherence, and the need for ongoing maintenance therapy [^115WJAmC]. Regular follow-up visits help monitor adherence and adjust treatment as needed [^116TLVEj].

---

Blepharitis is a **chronic eyelid margin inflammation** with anterior and posterior subtypes, diagnosed clinically with slit-lamp examination. Management is **stepwise**, starting with warm compresses and lid hygiene, then adding antibiotics, corticosteroids, or oral tetracyclines as needed. Demodex blepharitis requires specific treatment, and long-term maintenance is essential to control symptoms and prevent complications.

Blepharitis — follow-up recommendations specify that patients with mild blepharitis should be advised to return to their ophthalmologist if their condition worsens, and visit intervals are dictated by severity of symptoms and signs, current therapy, and co-morbid factors such as glaucoma in those treated with corticosteroids. Patients with planned intraocular surgery should have a follow-up visit after initiating treatment to reassess control of eyelid inflammation prior to surgery. The follow-up visit should include interval history, measurement of visual acuity, external examination, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and if corticosteroid therapy is prescribed, patients should be re-evaluated within a few weeks to determine response, measure intraocular pressure, and assess treatment compliance.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111N9ebb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The DEPTH panel convened a second time with the aim of achieving consensus around aspects of treatment and management of patients with Demodex blepharitis in a clinical setting. Demodex blepharitis is a common condition and currently, there is no single therapeutic strategy for its management. The panelists concurred that some blepharitis maintenance therapies may provide temporary symptom relief but likely do not address the root cause of the disease. In the future, with a well-tolerated FDA-approved therapy, the experts believe that mechanical intervention such as lid scrubs may no longer be as necessary. The panel unanimously agreed that the key treatment goal for DB patients is the reduction or elimination of collarettes, with collarettes being a surrogate for Demodex mites. They also concurred that treatment success may be measured by the degree to which collarettes are eliminated or significantly decreased, indicating the elimination or decrease of Demodex mites. DEPTH panelists achieved consensus that, in order to assess patients for collarettes, a simple and effective technique that can easily be incorporated into the routine eye examination is as simple as having the patient look down during slit-lamp exam. Ultimately, the panel agreed, it is possible to cure Demodex blepharitis for some duration of time, although reinfestation is possible. The information from both phases of this Delphi panel can be used to increase awareness about Demodex blepharitis, leading to better care received by patients and better clinical outcomes.

Introduction

Blepharitis

Lid and ocular surface diseases often share a constellation of signs, including lid margin erythema, meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, tear film instability, and keratitis. Blepharitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease that affects the eyelid margin, frequently resulting in disruption of the ocular surface and tear film. When present, blepharitis can damage the ocular surface and exacerbate concurrent ocular surface disorders. Because of its chronic nature and frequent comorbidity with other ocular surface diseases, managing these patients can be difficult. There are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for blepharitis, so the goal is often palliative, providing short-term management of signs and symptoms, with strategies such as warm compresses and lid hygiene, topical anti-inflammatory agents, and topical and oral antibiotics. While these options may temporarily relieve patient symptoms, they rarely address the root cause of the disease.

### Psychosocial impact ofBlepharitis [^1162LhyU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study is limited by its observational nature and the fact that it relies on patient recollection of symptoms, attempted therapies, doctor visits, and prior diagnoses. However, it confirms that patients with Demodex blepharitis frequently experience and are bothered by ocular symptoms. These patients allocate time and resources to health care appointments and approaches that often do not resolve their symptoms, contributing to individual and health care system costs. Additionally, patients with Demodex blepharitis perceive significant negative effects on their daily activities, mental and physical well-being. Treatments that safely and effectively treat Demodex blepharitis and are simple to use are needed to relieve the symptom burden and reduce psychosocial effects of Demodex blepharitis.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111CT5Cg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To obtain consensus on Demodex blepharitis (DB) treatment using a modified Delphi panel process.

Methods

Literature search identified gaps in knowledge surrounding treatment of DB. Twelve ocular surface disease experts comprised the Demodex Expert Panel on Treatment and Eyelid Health (DEPTH). They completed a live roundtable discussion in addition to 3 surveys consisting of scaled, open-ended, true/false, and multiple-choice questions pertaining to the treatment of DB. Consensus for scaled questions using a 1 to 9 Likert scale was predefined as median scores of 7–9 and 1–3. For other question types, consensus was achieved when 8 of 12 panelists agreed.

Results

The experts agreed that an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of DB would likely decrease the necessity of mechanical intervention, such as lid scrubs or blepharoexfoliation (Median = 8.5; Range 2–9). When treating DB, panelists believed that collarettes serve as a surrogate for mites, and that eliminating or reducing collarettes should be the main clinical goal of treatment (Median = 8; Range 7–9). The panelists would treat patients with at least 10 collarettes, regardless of other signs or symptoms and agreed that DB can be cured, but there is always the possibility for a reinfestation (n = 12). There was also consensus that collarettes, and therefore mites, are the primary treatment target and the way by which clinicians can monitor patient response to therapy (Median = 8; Range 7–9).

Conclusion

Expert panelists achieved consensus on key facets of DB treatment. Specifically, there was consensus that collarettes are pathognomonic for DB, that DB patients with > 10 collarettes should be treated even in the absence of symptoms, and that treatment efficacy can be tracked by collarette resolution. By increasing awareness about DB, understanding the goals of and monitoring treatment efficacy, patients will receive better care and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of demodex blepharitis: the demodex expert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) [^113hAgNV]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Collarettes with symptomatic blepharitis, the panel agreed, are indicative of DB and should be treated. Restoring balance to the ocular ecology is the key to managing Demodex infestation (median score = 8; range 5–9), and mechanical intervention (e.g. lid scrubs, blepharoexfoliation) is an important part of treatment (n = 12). However, consensus about the most effective currently available over-the-counter treatment, in light of lack of any FDA-approved therapies, was not reached. Of the management options for Demodex blepharitis available at the time of this panel, the group was about evenly split between blepharoexfoliation and tea tree oil as their primary strategy.

Heat, whether warm compresses, steam-based devices, or radiant heat devices, was deemed to be minimally, marginally, or not useful (n = 10). The primary concern of panellists when treating Demodex patients is treatment efficacy (n = 11) above tolerability or safety. These experts unanimously agreed that blepharitis may be best treated via a decision tree that accounts for clinical signs and patient symptoms (n = 12). The panel also agreed that patients with no/minimal symptoms but a moderate number of collarettes would warrant a treatment trial for DB.

Areas of consensus on scaled questions are summarized in Table 1.

### Oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis [^115MWGew]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior blepharitis is common and causes ocular surface and lid damage as well as discomfort. It affects 37% to 47% of all ophthalmology patients; its incidence increasing with age. It is a multifactorial disease associated with multiple other pathologies, such as rosacea, meibomianitis, and infections. Treatment usually focuses on reliefing the symptoms by using artificial tears, lid scrubs, and warm compresses. The condition may be notoriously difficult to manage adequately once it becomes chronic. One such management approach for chronic blepharitis is the use of oral antibiotics for both their antibacterial as well as anti-inflammatory properties. There are currently no guidelines regarding the use of oral antibiotics, including antibiotic type, dosage, and treatment duration, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotic use for people with chronic blepharitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 August 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotics with placebo in adult participants with chronic blepharitis (including staphylococcal, seborrhoeic, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

We included two studies with 220 participants (numbers of eyes unclear). One parallel-group RCT comparing oral doxycycline (40 mg once a day) with placebo enrolled 70 participants with blepharitis and facial rosacea in the USA. Follow-up duration was three months. One three-arm RCT conducted in South Korea investigated the effect of high-dose (200 mg twice a day) and low-dose (20 mg twice a day) doxycycline versus placebo after one month of study medication. It enrolled 50 participants with chronic MGD in each study arm (i.e. 150 participants enrolled in total). The two studies did not evaluate the same outcome measurements, which precluded any meta-analysis. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective improvement in symptoms was very uncertain. One study suggested that there was little to no effect of oral doxycycline on subjective symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates worse condition) (mean difference (MD) 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.61 to 11.71; n = 70) and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.36; n = 70) at 12 weeks. The three-arm RCT showed that oral doxycycline may slightly improve number of symptoms (MD -0.56, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.17; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.10; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)) and proportion of participants with symptom improvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.13, 95% CI 2.61 to 14.42; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 6.54, 95% CI 2.79 to 15.30; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)) at one month, but the evidence is very uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence for subjective symptoms as very low. One study evaluated aqueous tear production by Schirmer's test (mm/5 min) (higher score indicates better condition) and tear film stability by measuring tear film break-up time (TBUT) in seconds (higher score indicates better condition) at one month. We found very low certainty evidence that oral doxycycline may improve these clinical signs. The estimated MD in Schirmer's test score after one month of treatment was 4.09 mm (95% CI 2.38 to 5.80; n = 93) in the high-dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group and 3.76 mm (95% CI 1.85 to 5.67; n = 93) in the low-dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group. The estimated MD in TBUT after one month was 1.58 seconds (95% CI 0.57 to 2.59; n = 93) when comparing the high-dose doxycycline group with the placebo group, and 1.70 seconds (95% CI 0.96 to 2.44; n = 93) when comparing the low-dose doxycycline group with the placebo group. Although there was a noted improvement in these scores, their clinical importance remains uncertain. One study suggested that oral doxycycline may increase the incidence of serious side effects: 18 (39%) participants in the high-dose doxycycline group, 8 (17%) in the low-dose doxycycline group, and 3 (6%) out of 47 participants in the placebo group experienced serious side effects (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.94 to 19.41; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.64; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)). Additionally, one study reported that one case of migraine headache and five cases of headache were observed in the oral doxycycline group, and one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was observed in the placebo group. We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse events as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions on the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Very low certainty evidence suggests that oral antibiotics may improve clinical signs, but may cause more adverse events. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective symptoms is very uncertain. Further trials are needed to provide high quality evidence on the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Goals of Treatment

The DEPTH panelists came to consensus that the primary objective when treating DB is the elimination or significant decrease of collarettes (Median = 7; Range 4–9). Similarly, when asked, "True or false: The single most important goal of treatment for Demodex blepharitis is elimination/significant reduction in collarettes", there was consensus that this statement is true (n = 9). On the other hand, there was also consensus that mite eradication should not be the goal of treatment (n = 9). While it may seem like clinicians would think that eradicating mites would be of paramount importance, discussion at the live meeting shed light on the seeming contradiction. In this discussion, the panelists clarified that although mite elimination is important, most clinicians treating DB are using collarettes, not mites, as the clinical marker for treatment success.

During the video conference, the panelists discussed the concept of collarettes serving as a surrogate for mites, and the elimination of one necessarily means the elimination of the other. Therefore, by eliminating or dramatically reducing collarettes, the mite burden is also eliminated or reduced. There was also discussion about being able to monitor the resolution of DB by looking for collarettes rather than needing to epilate lashes to look for mites. This discussion reinforced the suggestion for clinicians to perform routine slit-lamp evaluations, in which checking for the presence of collarettes should be an essential step.

The final survey helped quantify the content of the live meeting discussion. The DEPTH panelists concurred that when diagnosing and treating Demodex blepharitis, collarettes are a reasonable surrogate for mites, thereby eliminating the need to count mites and/or epilate lashes (Median = 9; Range 3–9). In another question, the group reached consensus about the statement, "The primary goal when treating DB is the elimination or significant decrease of collarettes, from which it can be extrapolated that mites would also be eliminated or decreased, leading to improvement in other signs and symptoms" (Median = 8; Range 7–9). In other words, collarettes, and therefore mites, are the primary target of treatment in clinical practice and the way by which clinicians can monitor patient response to therapy.

Demodex blepharitis

One of the most common etiologies of blepharitis is known to be Demodex infestation, representing up to 70% of all patients diagnosed with blepharitis. Demodex is a microscopic parasite commonly found on the human body. There are more than 1600 species of Demodex mites, with Demodex folliculorum (Figure 1) prevalent in the lash follicle and Demodex brevis usually in the meibomian glands. Both Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis have been associated with Demodex blepharitis (DB). These species of Demodex were first reported near the eye more than 50 years ago, but to date there have been no treatments approved by the FDA with the indication of treating Demodex blepharitis (DB).

Figure 1

Recent findings from a comprehensive study of 1032 participants from 7 geographically different clinical sites showed that nearly 58% of all-comers had Demodex blepharitis, a strikingly high percentage. When looking at specific subsets of patients, even higher proportions of patients with blepharitis (69.1%) and glaucoma (64.8%) had DB. Because of this high prevalence across both optometry and ophthalmology practices, understanding the role of Demodex is crucial to the overall understanding of blepharitis management.

Since many symptoms overlap with other ocular surface conditions, Demodex blepharitis is commonly underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. With the challenges of signs and symptoms overlapping with other ocular surface disorders, such as dry eye disease (DED) and meibomian gland dysfunction, there has been a lack of consensus among clinicians surrounding the diagnosis and management of DB. Moreover, there is currently no "gold standard" for management of Demodex blepharitis which, when coupled with poor patient compliance using current treatment options, demonstrates a need for developing consensus on, and spreading awareness of, dedicated management strategies to improve treatment outcomes.

Management — detection and clinical suspicion are emphasized. Detection and appropriate treatment can reduce signs and symptoms of blepharitis, and in severe cases it can prevent permanent structural damage and possible vision loss. This is particularly important in children, in whom chronic blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is often unrecognized and can be more severe, and it should be suspected in a child with recurrent conjunctivitis, keratitis, neovascularization, eyelid inflammation, hordeolum, chalazia, corneal opacification, and amblyopia. The presentation can be asymmetric and is often confused with herpetic disease. Tear film break-up time using fluorescein is significantly shorter in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), even if aqueous tear production is normal, which suggests that meibomian gland secretions are important in maintaining a stable precorneal tear film.

Introduction

Blepharitis is chronic ocular inflammation primarily involving the eyelid margin, found in approximately 47% of patients presenting for eye examinations. Blepharitis frequently disrupts the ocular surface, leading to conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, functional tear deficiency, and keratitis. It may also exacerbate symptoms of coexisting ocular surface diseases, including allergic conjunctivitis and aqueous tear deficiency. The chronic nature of blepharitis, its uncertain aetiology, and frequent coexistence of other ocular surface diseases contribute to the challenge of managing affected patients. With no FDA-approved treatments, management of blepharitis includes warm compresses, eyelid hygiene, topical and oral antibiotics, and topical anti-inflammatory agents. Current management strategies may address the symptoms and contributors to blepharitis but not its root cause.

Demodex, a microscopic ectoparasite, is often implicated in blepharitis. Of more than 1600 species of mites collectively known as Demodex, two — Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis — inhabit the human body. D. folliculorum live in the lash follicle, whereas Demodex brevis burrow into the sebaceous and meibomian glands. (Fig. 1) Although the presence of D. folliculorum in the eyelashes was first described by Coston over 50 years ago, the diagnosis and treatment of Demodex blepharitis (DB) remain somewhat challenging, particularly with no FDA-approved treatments currently available.

Both D. folliculorum and brevis are implicated in DB, which may represent up to 70% of all cases of blepharitis. Considering that a large subset of blepharitis patients are infested with Demodex, understanding its role can have significant impact on blepharitis management. Recent research suggests that DB is commonly misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed due to overlap in symptoms with other ocular surface diseases. Thus, there is lack of consensus surrounding the diagnosis, treatment, pathophysiology, and signs and symptoms of Demodex blepharitis.

Reported Results from 3 DEPTH Surveys

Demographic Information of the Expert Panelists

Fifteen panelists completed each survey. Twelve of the 15 panelists attended the live meeting, which was hosted and led by representatives from i2Vision. Due to scheduling conflicts, the remaining 3 panelists met with i2Vision representatives in one-on-one meetings. The panel comprised ten ophthalmologists and five optometrists in different types and durations of clinical practice. Eight panelists were women (53.3%), and 7 were men (46.7%). The participant's mean age (standard deviation [SD]; range) was 52.5 years (11.2 years; 34–76 years) and mean number of years in practice (SD; range) was 22.9 (11.2; 3–45 years). Seven of the participants practiced in an academic setting, with the remainder in private practice. All panelists were from the United States (33.3% Southeast [n = 5], 26.7% Northeast [n = 4], 20.0% West [n = 3],13.3% Southwest [n = 2], 6.7% Midwest [n = 1]).

Recommendations for a First-Line Treatment

Experts agreed that an ideal treatment for DB should have an FDA-approved indication for the condition (mean: 7.67; range: 4–9). Panelists recognized that as of 2024, lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% was the only product that fits this requirement and, therefore, should be considered as a first-line treatment for patients with DB (mean: 8.93; range: 8–9). Fourteen of 15 panelists recommended lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% as first-line treatment for this condition (Figure 2). For patients who also exhibited facial rosacea, all 15 experts recommended lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% for the treatment of DB.

Blepharitis eyelid hygiene regimen — initial steps, techniques, safety, and frequency: An initial step in treating patients who have blepharitis is to recommend warm compresses and eyelid cleansing. One regimen is to apply warm compresses to the eyelids for several minutes, and sustained warmth can be achieved by hot tap water on a clean washcloth, an over-the-counter heat pack, or a homemade bean/rice bag that can be heated in the microwave; it is very important to instruct patients to avoid compresses so hot they burn the skin. Eyelid cleansing options include brief, gentle massage; eye cleaners with hypochlorous acid at 0.01%; and cleaning the base of the eyelashes using diluted baby shampoo or a commercially available eyelid cleaner on a pad, cotton ball, cotton swab, or clean fingertip. Cleaning devices and/or digital massage may be dangerous if the patient lacks manual dexterity or the necessary skill or judgment, and there is not enough evidence to suggest superiority of one option over others; the ophthalmologist should consider the patient's ability and tailor the plan accordingly, with proper counseling for patients with neurotrophic corneas. A schedule of regularly performed eyelid cleansing, daily or several times weekly, often blunts chronic symptoms; once- or twice-daily warm compresses and massage is generally adequate, and expression of the meibomian glands may be particularly helpful in cases of MGD but must be performed with care.

Materials and methods

Trial design

The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective trial was to examine the efficacy of BlephEx™ treatment for chronic blepharitis by determining whether BlephEx™ treatment improves quality of life and ocular surface parameters in patients with chronic blepharitis compared to sham treatment. Our primary outcome was the change in the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), a validated metric for quality of life related to dry eye disease and blepharitis. Secondary outcomes included the severity of eyelid inflammation measured by the Efron grading scale for eyelid margin disease, tear break-up time (TBUT), and Schirmer's test to evaluate tear production.

This study aimed to assess whether automated eyelid margin debridement with BlephEx™ provides benefits beyond a sham procedure, which controls for mechanical eyelid stimulation and placebo effects. Patients were randomized to receive either BlephEx™ debridement per the manufacturer's instructions or sham treatment under equivalent conditions. Outcomes in the BlephEx™ group were compared to those in the sham group to determine the impact of BlephEx™ treatment relative to stimulation and placebo effects alone.

The study was conducted at the Eye Center of the University Hospital Freiburg after approval by the local ethics committee (application no. EK-Freiburg 349/17) and can be accessed in the research database of the University of Freiburg. (as of 02.01.2023). The study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial registration was carried out retrospectively on February 16, 2024 in the DRKS (German Clinical Trials Register) at) under the trial registration number DRKS00033492. A crossover design was used as a recruitment aid (study participants received verum treatment in each case) and was not considered for the statistical analysis (see Fig. 2). Therefore, only the baseline (examination before treatment) and the examination 4 weeks after treatment (switch at the time of crossover) visits were evaluated to minimize pretreatment bias. The patients were divided into 2 groups randomized to receive either BlephEx™ or sham treatment. Afterwards, the participants were switched to the alternative intervention. The observed treatment effect in this second stage was not taken into account in the statistical analysis to avoid a potential carryover effect, which could have influenced the results.

### A randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 1% azithromycin-0.1% dexamethasone combination compared to 1% azithromycin alone, 0.1% dexamethasone alone, and vehicle in the treatment of subjects with blepharitis [^112ViTKR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The same 1% azithromycin–0.1% dexamethasone combination in DuraSite has been previously studied as a treatment for blepharoconjunctivitis, where it proved to be superior to both azithromycin alone and dexamethasone alone in achieving a clinical cure and reducing bacterial colony-count scores. In this study, the combined 1% azithromycin–0.1% dexamethasone was superior to 1% azithromycin and vehicle alone, but not to 0.1% dexamethasone alone. Blepharitis and blepharoconjunctivitis represent a diverse spectrum of disease, and the difference in study outcomes may be a reflection of the multimodality of the disease state, rather than the investigated treatments. Luchs summarized several studies evaluating 1% azithromycin for blepharitis where efficacy was reported, but most of the studies were small in nature and open-label in design. In our study, both drops containing 0.1% dexamethasone were found to be superior to 1% azithromycin or vehicle alone in resolving the clinical signs of eyelid redness and eyelid debris. In this study, no evaluation of bacterial eradication was performed, and many clinicians believe the addition of an antibiotic is important to manage microbial overgrowth.

There are several strengths to this study. The first is the large number of patients enrolled. In addition, this is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a treatment for blepharitis for 6 months postdosing. In most other studies, patients were only followed until day 15 or at most 1 month. The longer follow-up was selected to detect a possible recurrence rate and evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of 1% azithromycin and 0.1% dexamethasone alone and in combination. Our study, while large and enrolling more than 900 subjects, also retained the majority of subjects through the 6-month follow-up. This suggests that longer treatment regimens may be necessary in some patients, in order to achieve and maintain complete clinical resolution.

There are some limitations to this study, however. There were a small number of patients who reached full resolution by study exit (a primary end point). This could be reflective of overall poor end-point choice, but discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration dictated these chosen end points. Unfortunately, the small numbers also mean we are unable to generalize our findings to a wider potential patient base. Finally, our QoL questionnaire had not been validated in time to generate more than subjective impressions.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of demodex blepharitis: the demodex expert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) [^115nNzXo]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Twelve ocular surface disease experts convened to achieve consensus about Demodex blepharitis (DB) using a modified Delphi panel process.

Methods

Online surveys were administered using scaled, open-ended, true/false, and multiple-choice questions. Consensus for questions using a 1 to 9 Likert scale was predefined as median scores of 7–9 and 1–3. For other question types, consensus was achieved when 8 of 12 panellists agreed. Questions were randomized, and results of each survey informed the following survey.

Results

Twelve practitioners comprised the Demodex Expert Panel on Treatment and Eyelid Health (DEPTH). Following 3 surveys, experts agreed that DB is chronic (n = 11) and recurrent (n = 12) and is often misdiagnosed. Consensus was achieved regarding inflammation driving symptoms (median = 7; range 7–9), collarettes as the most common sign (n = 10) and pathognomonic for DB (median = 9; range 8–9), and itching as the most common symptom (n = 12). Panellists agreed that DB may be diagnosed based on collarettes, mites, and/or patient symptoms (n = 10) and felt that patients unresponsive to typical therapies should be evaluated for DB (n = 12). Consensus about the most effective currently available OTC treatment was not reached.

Conclusions

The Delphi methodology proved effective in establishing consensus about DB, including signs, symptoms, and diagnosis. Consensus was not reached about the best treatment or how to grade severity. With increased awareness, eyecare practitioners can offer DB patients better clinical outcomes. A follow-up Delphi panel is planned to obtain further consensus surrounding DB treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of lotilaner ophthalmic solution (0.25%) for the treatment of demodex blepharitis: a GRADE assessed systematic review and meta-analysis of observational&experimental studies [^112JxPAB]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Several treatments have been in use for Demodex blepharitis, before the discovery of lotilaner, like tea tree oil and antibiotics; however, they either have irritable effects or systemic adverse effects, respectively. Lotilaner, a novel ectoparasiticide, has been proposed as a treatment for patients grappling with Demodex blepharitis. This review aims to assess the safety and efficacy of lotilaner in the treatment of Demodex blepharitis.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

An extensive search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar to find relevant literature till July 31, 2023 following the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 143 articles were retrieved by database searching, out of which 6 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Four randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis of mite eradication incidence. The review is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42023459997.

Results

Lotilaner is effective in eradicating Demodex mites in individuals suffering from Demodex blepharitis according to RR for the intervention versus the control group of 3.55 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.87–4.40, P < .00001, I² = 0%). The meta-analysis of clinically meaningful collarette score revealed the summary RR for the intervention versus the control group was 3.15 (95% CI: 2.56–3.89, P < 0.00001, I² = 27%). In conclusion, the results of the included studies were comparable and consistent.

Conclusions

Our results indicated that lotilaner is an effective, well-tolerated, and promising drug in treating patients with Demodex blepharitis. Lotilaner administration and cost-effectiveness should now be contemplated for the study population as these constituents have a vital impact on its treatment success.

Blepharitis Preferred Practice Pattern — topical corticosteroid and cyclosporine guidance emphasizes limited use, tapering, and safety counseling. A brief course of topical corticosteroids may be helpful for eyelid or ocular surface inflammation, and corticosteroid eye drops or ointments can be considered initially for the control of symptoms, then tapered and discontinued and used intermittently to maintain comfort. The minimal effective dose should be used, long-term therapy should be avoided if possible, and patients should be informed of risks including increased intraocular pressure and cataract; these risks may be minimized by site-specific or limited-penetration agents such as loteprednol etabonate and fluorometholone phosphate. Guidelines for maintenance therapy should be discussed, and topical cyclosporine may be helpful in some patients with posterior blepharitis.

### BlephEx-treatment for blepharitis: a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112BerSc]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on our results, however, the BlephEx™ as a method for eyelid exfoliation does not appear to provide significant added benefit over sham treatment for the general management of chronic blepharitis. The small sample size is a limitation, but the lack of meaningful effects suggests limited utility for widespread adoption of this specialized equipment. Patients could achieve similar placebo effects from simpler, cost-effective in-office eyelid hygiene techniques. These results are in line with earlier research that found conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of mechanical eyelid margin debridement in the treatment of blepharitis.

To date, only a few other studies have specifically examined the effect of BlephEx™ treatment in chronic blepharitis, and even fewer have been placebo controlled. One of the studies without a control group was conducted by Epitropoulos et al. and involved 177 patients from various centers who underwent BlephEx™ treatment in a retrospective data analysis. In this study, all the measurements (TBUT, SPEED score, and OSDI score) indicated a significant improvement following BlephEx™ treatment. Mulder et al. reported significant improvements in the TBUT, OSDI, and Efron grading scale scores after BlephEx™ treatment in a prospective study of 20 patients. However, both of these studies lacked a control group and were never published in a scientific journal. In another retrospective case series study of 24 patients with moderate to severe meibomian gland dysfunction, Moon et al. reported that eyelid debridement using BlephEx™ in combination with eyelid margin care improved clinical findings, subjective symptoms, meibomian gland function, and ocular surface MMP-9 levels. However, since no control group was included in this study either, no clear conclusion can be drawn on the real treatment effect compared to a possible placebo effect.

### BlephEx-treatment for blepharitis: a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial [^117McYH4]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Blepharitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelids that affects a large proportion of patients in eye care settings. First-line treatments provide only partial relief for many patients. The BlephEx™ device provides automated eyelid debridement and aims to remove pathogenic biofilms from the eyelid margin to treat blepharitis long-term. However, evidence supporting the efficacy of BlephEx™ is limited.

Methods

In this double-masked randomized controlled trial, 42 patients with symptomatic blepharitis refractory to treatment were assigned to the BlephEx™ treatment or sham treatment group. Outcome measures including Ocular surface disease index (OSDI), tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer test, and Efron grading scale scores were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks. A crossover design in which the treatment groups were swapped after 4 weeks was used as a recruitment tool. After receiving treatment, two patients (one per group) were lost to follow-up.

Results

The sham group exhibited a significant decrease in the Efron Grading Scale score. No significant differences were observed in the other outcomes between the two groups. The BlephEx™ group showed slightly greater decreases in the OSDI and Efron grading scale scores and an increase in the TBUT than did the sham group, but these differences were not statistically significant. Mild discomfort was the most common side effect and occurred equally in both groups.

Conclusions

No significant difference in outcomes was observed between patients who underwent BlephEx™ therapy and those who received sham treatment. BlephEx™ treatment cannot be recommended for treating blepharitis.

### Preclinical development of MGO manuka honey microemulsion for blepharitis management [^112qh8Ga]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Key messages

What is already known about this subject?

Blepharitis is a common chronic condition characterised by eyelid inflammation. Although the pathophysiology remains uncertain, bacterial overcolonisation is implicated with ocular inflammatory responses. Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are currently prescribed to treat inflammatory exacerbations; however, concerns regarding drug resistance and adverse effects necessitate development of alternative therapeutic options. New Zealand Manuka honey exhibits antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that suggest potential for the treatment of blepharitis. Complexation with α-cyclodextrin has previously been reported to enhance the antibacterial effects of Manuka honey.

What are the new findings?

In clinically applicable concentrations, cyclodextrin-complexed MGO Manuka Honey (Manuka Health New Zealand) generally exhibited greater in vitro antimicrobial effects than uncomplexed honey on bacteria commonly associated with blepharitis. In vivo safety and tolerability evaluation on rabbit eyes demonstrated that a cyclodextrin-complexed Manuka honey microemulsion (MHME), designed for topical application, did not result in significant immediate or cumulative adverse effects.

How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?

The results of this study support progress to clinical safety and tolerability trials of MHME eye cream in human subjects.

Benign Inflammatory Eyelid Processes Blepharitis One of the most common eyelid problems is blepharitis, or inflammation of the eyelid margin. Patients typically experience itching, burning, mild foreign-body sensation, tearing and crusting around the eyes on awakening. On examination, the eyelid margins are erythematous, and thickened with crusts and debris within the lashes. Conjunctival injection or a mild mucus discharge may be present. Blepharitis occurs with chronic bacterial lid infection, meibomian gland dysfunction, seborrhea and acne rosacea that affects the eye, known as ocular rosacea. 1 The diagnosis of rosacea is supported by the presence of dilated telangiectatic blood vessels on the lid margins, cheeks, nose and chin. Treatment of blepharitis consists initially of warm compresses, eyelid scrubs and application of antibiotic ointment. Warm compresses should be applied for 15 minutes twice a day.

This step loosens irritating crusts in the eyelashes and melts the oil produced by the meibomian glands, which can occlude the gland orifices. If the condition is unresponsive to treatment, eyelid cultures should be obtained to rule out the possibility of resistant organisms. Oral antibiotics may be used in such cases, or in patients with the diagnosis of ocular rosacea. If severe, blepharitis may result in corneal infiltrates or ulcers. Rarely, sebaceous cell carcinoma may masquerade as unilateral or bilateral intractable blepharitis. Patients must be cautioned that blepharitis is a chronic disease and that eyelid hygiene may need to be continued indefinitely. When the process is brought under better control, once-daily eyelid scrubs may be sufficient to keep the problem in check. Dermatochalasis Dermatochalasis, or redundant eyelid skin and fat, may result in functional loss of superior vision if the tissue hangs over the eyelid margin into the visual axis.

Surgical repair of this age-related problem is termed blepharoplasty. Bilateral blepharospasm is most commonly the result of dry eyes, corneal irritation or benign essential blepharospasm. Brain imaging is not required. Benign essential blepharospasm may be caused by an overexcitatory drive of the basal ganglia. Initial treatment is artificial tear drops and injections of botulinum toxin to weaken the affected muscles. 16.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112MAxKs]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis Preferred Practice Pattern — disease definition, patient population, and objectives describe that blepharitis is a chronic ocular inflammation that involves the eyelid margin primarily and is a common cause of chronic ocular irritation. The patient population includes individuals of all ages who present with symptoms and signs suggestive of blepharitis, such as eyelid and ocular irritation and redness. Clinical objectives include establishing the diagnosis of blepharitis, differentiating it from other causes of irritation and redness; identifying the type of blepharitis; establishing appropriate therapy; relieving discomfort and pain; preventing complications; and educating and engaging the patient in the management of this potentially chronic disease.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112899JZ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis Preferred Practice Pattern — methods and key to ratings — states that Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners, and where evidence exists to support a recommendation for care, the recommendation should be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence; to accomplish these aims, methods from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) group are used. All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually, and that grade is listed with the study citation, using SIGN levels: I++ High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias; I+ Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias; I− Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias; II++ High-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies High-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal; II+ Well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal; II− Case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal; and III Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series). Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence with GRADE-defined quality ratings: Good quality Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect; Moderate quality Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate; Insufficient quality Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate Any estimate of effect is very uncertain. Key recommendations for care are defined by GRADE as follows: Strong recommendation Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not; Discretionary recommendation Used when the trade-offs are less certain — either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced. All recommendations for care in this PPP were rated using the system described above, ratings are embedded throughout the PPP main text in italics, and literature searches to update the PPP were undertaken on March 3, 2022 and June 7, 2023 in the PubMed database.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^112PUpaj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Blepharitis can often be a non-remitting, chronic, progressive disease process that is difficult to stabilize using currently available management options. Based on findings in the literature, it is likely that a significant proportion of blepharitis has a Demodex infestation component. The available OTC treatment options provide temporary DB symptom relief at best, but none address the root cause and some are not well tolerated. In the prior study by the DEPTH panel, consensus was reached across a range of topics pertaining to DB including diagnosis, and this second Delphi process brings to light specific aspects of treatment and management.

The Delphi method has been proven a successful way to achieve consensus, historically using written surveys and more recently incorporating electronic surveys, as were used in this process. Studies have shown that online surveys have similar validity to written questionnaires. As with the first Delphi procedure undertaken by this group, this second process utilized 3 rounds of surveys, a number consistent with reports in the literature as sufficient to reach consensus. The inclusion of the live meeting, as in the current process, has also been found beneficial in reaching consensus by allowing panelists to engage in discourse with peers.

The focus for this second DEPTH Delphi panel was the treatment and management of DB in a clinical practice setting, and a number of topical areas were addressed. Consensus was achieved early about existing OTC management options. Panelists largely agreed that while tea tree oil and terpinen-4-ol-containing products are probably the most effective of the currently available OTC options, there are drawbacks to their use and limitations to their efficacy. While more work needs to be done to assess this, recent evidence suggests that even low concentrations of terpinen-4-ol can be toxic to meibomian gland epithelial cells in culture. Hirsch-Hoffman et al assessed several therapies in DB patients, including TTO ointment and TTO foam. At the end of 2 months, mean mite count from 10 epilated lashes was assessed. The TTO ointment and foam patients had 13.3 and 12.0 mites per 10 lashes, respectively. This was similar to the oral ivermectin group (12.8 mites per 10 lashes), better than the oral metronidazole group (22 mites per 10 lashes), and worse than the metronidazole ointment group (9.8 mites per 10 lashes). Ultimately, the study concluded that none of the options were effective in eradicating mites in DB patients.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^115iEWgB]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis and intraocular surgery — risk considerations and preoperative management are noted: Postoperative endophthalmitis is described as a feared complication, with causative organisms after clear corneal cataract surgery including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus [68.4%], S. aureus [6.8%], and Streptococcus species [8.2%]. It may be helpful to address moderate to severe blepharitis with topical antibiotics and eyelid hygiene prior to intraocular procedures, but long-term antibiotic treatment may result in resistant organisms. In cases where carcinoma masquerades as blepharitis, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can prevent disfigurement and may be lifesaving.

### Eyelid margin disease (blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction): clinical review of evidence-based and emerging treatments [^115HdE7o]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Blepharitis is a common ophthalmic condition with multiple etiologies and no definitive, universal treatment. The treatment modalities for managing lid margin diseases vary depending on the disease's cause, location, and severity. For anterior blepharitis, management options include eyelid hygiene with warm compresses, eyelid scrubs, baby shampoo, and over-the-counter eyelid cleansers. Topical antibiotics and antibiotic-steroid combination drops/ointments for the eye and eyelid may accompany these. For posterior blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), at-home warm compress or in-office administration of heat therapy/thermal pulsation treatment that aims to clear obstruction in the meibomian glands and restore meibum secretions to maintain a healthy tear film is recommended. In addition to the above treatment strategies, various other compounds to manage lid margin diseases are in the late stages of development. This review summarizes the available treatment modalities or those in the pipeline for treating blepharitis and MGD.

### TheExpert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) consensus regarding the preferred treatment forBlepharitis [^114nVCys]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The consensus reached in this report reflects the unmet need for patients with DB prior to FDA-approval of lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%. The panelists agreed that they would choose lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% to treat patients with Grade 2 collarettes (> 10 lashes per eyelid with collarettes) or worse in the absence of any other clinical findings. In cases where patients exhibit a less severe collarette grade, panelists agreed that one more clinical finding would be needed to trigger treatment (Figure 3). Importantly, panelists agreed that they would consider using lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% to treat patients with reported eyelid itching or eyelid margin erythema in the absence of visible collarettes so long as allergies have been ruled out, suggesting a high level of confidence in treating patients with the FDA-approved medication. These findings reflect the efficacy of lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% in eradicating Demodex mites, and the reported limitations of other treatment options.

An interesting finding from this study was the consensus reached regarding the most appropriate use of IPL therapy and blepharoexfoliation. Panelists agreed that both treatments best serve as supplements to a first-line treatment (ie, lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%). This consensus reflects prior use of these in-office procedures as adjunct therapies. During the live consensus meeting, panelists noted their reluctance to formally recommend IPL therapy or blepharoexfoliation layered on top of lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% to treat DB. This is due to lack of published evidence supporting the concomitant use of either treatment with the FDA-approved therapeutic to treat Demodex infestation in the eyelid. Future studies should aim to determine the benefits of coupling lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25% with IPL therapy or blepharoexfoliation to treat patients with DB. The confirmation of benefits should lead to additional studies to delineate an ideal, layered treatment regimen.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of demodex blepharitis: the demodex expert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) [^1156xmi6]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Following Survey 2, 5 articles about Demodex blepharitis were sent to panellists as pre-reading material. Articles chosen were recently published in well-known, geographically diverse journals with audiences of both ophthalmologists and optometrists. Studies in these articles had large patient populations followed longitudinally and focused on DB. A live video meeting was then held to discuss aspects of Demodex blepharitis. While the original Delphi methodology relied strictly on surveys to maintain anonymity, the modified Delphi process includes one or more in-person meeting and is more common recently, particularly in healthcare. The 3-hour face-to-face meeting aimed to foster discussion among the experts, considering the first 2 surveys and the pre-reading materials. The meeting was moderated, and general themes from Surveys 1 and 2 were presented. The goal was not to achieve further consensus, but rather to discuss DB and engage in robust peer-to-peer discourse.

After the face-to-face meeting, a third and final survey with 41 closed-ended questions was administered. Questions were based on outstanding areas without consensus from Surveys 1 and 2 and discussion at the live meeting. Following compilation and analysis of Survey 3 results, data from all surveys were combined; the results are presented here.

### BlephEx-treatment for blepharitis: a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial [^111HmQ5w]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, the OSDI at inclusion was significantly greater in the Sham group than in the BlephEx™ group despite randomization; however, since the difference from baseline was calculated, no pronounced bias should have arisen. The limitations of this study could be the single treatment and the short follow-up period of four weeks. However, considering the low effect sizes of the OSDI, BUT, Schirmer and Efron grading Scale, a significant difference between the groups seems unlikely even after a longer observation period.

Another limitation is that the study did not assess variables such as microorganism load, lipase activity, collarette cure, and meibomian gland secretion quantity, which could provide additional academic insights. Instead, the focus was on the OSDI score, which directly reflects the patient's subjective experience and disease burden. However, as the OSDI is a key indicator of clinical effectiveness, its relevance to patient outcomes makes it one of the most critical parameters in evaluating treatment success.

In conclusion, this study represents the first randomized double-blind controlled trial comparing BlephEx™ treatment to a sham intervention without the use of additional products containing tea tree oil. Furthermore, compared to other studies, a broad range of subjective and objective blepharitis parameters was assessed, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation. This finding revealed that the BlephEx™ treatment did not demonstrate statistically significant benefits over sham treatment for managing blepharitis in this study.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of demodex blepharitis: the demodex expert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) [^112TFELy]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

A neutral third-party medical communications company was engaged to develop, design, and oversee this Delphi panel (i2Vision, San Diego, CA). Figure 2 shows the steps undertaken. The panel included ophthalmologists and optometrists of both genders from the USA in different types and duration of clinical practice. All individuals were identified as experts in external disease, blepharitis, and ocular surface diseases. A literature search of Demodex blepharitis was conducted using key words 'collarette', 'cylindrical dandruff', ' Demodex', 'demodicosis + eye', and 'blepharitis' for clinical papers published between 2015 and 2021. The search yielded 95 papers related to Demodex and Demodex blepharitis that were used in survey creation.

Tasks undertaken as part of the DEPTH process.

To produce quantifiable results, a 1–9 Likert scale was chosen, and a portion of Survey 1 questions were structured using it. In order to prevent bias, consensus was defined prior to administering the first survey. Median scores of 7–9 and 1–3 indicated consensus at the high and low ends of the scale, respectively. A median score of 4–6 indicated consensus was not achieved, and if > one-third of the panel members selected 1–3 and > one-third of the panel members selected 7–9, this was considered disagreement. For closed-ended questions (including yes/no, true/false, and numeric), consensus was achieved when 8 of 12 panellists agreed (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
How consensus was defined.

A 1–9 Likert scale was selected, and consensus was predefined. Median scores of 1–3 and 7–9 indicated consensus on the low and high ends of the scale, respectively. Median scores of 4–6 indicated no consensus. If more than 1/3 of the panel members selected 1–3 and more than 1/3 of the panel members selected 7–9, this was considered disagreement. For the open-ended questions, including yes/no and numeric answers, consensus was achieved when 8 of 12 panellist answers agreed.

Three rounds of surveys were submitted electronically. To minimize bias from "survey fatigue", questions were randomized for each participant. All questions had to be answered before moving to the next section. The surveys contained intentionally repeated questions worded differently to provide information about consistency of panellists' responses. For example, 3 questions were asked about the predominant symptom in DB patients but were worded in different ways.

Survey 1, consisting of 154 questions, covered a range of topics related to Demodex blepharitis. The survey comprised a combination of scaled, open-ended, and closed-ended questions (yes/no or numeric) with the option for respondents to elaborate via free text. The goal of Survey 1 was to gain general understanding across a range of topics related to DB and which areas consensus existed among panellists. The results of Survey 1 were compiled and analyzed, specifically noting questions and topical areas that achieved consensus.

Survey 2 focused on confirming consensus obtained in Survey 1, both to ensure consistency of responses over time and to gain consensus on additional topics. The 47 closed-ended questions were multiple choice, yes/no, or true/false. Questions were developed based in part on answers provided by the panellists on the Survey 1 open-ended questions. As with Survey 1, the results were compiled and analyzed for consensus.

### Update on the management of demodex blepharitis [^111ypS37]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Demodex blepharitis is a common ophthalmologic disease that is often overlooked in the workup of blepharitis. Demodex infestation occurs in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals at similar rates; consequently, its role in the development of blepharitis has not been well elucidated. Two species have been confirmed to inhabit the human eyelid- Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. These species differ in their preferred location of infestation, with D. folliculorum occupying the base of the eyelash and D. brevis inhabiting the meibomian glands, contributing to anterior and posterior Demodex blepharitis, respectively. A clinical index of suspicion must be developed from the history when blepharitis, conjunctivitis, or keratitis in adults and blepharoconjunctivitis or chalazia in children are resistant to treatment. The diagnosis can be strongly suspected by the presence of cylindrical dandruff at the base of the eyelash and confirmed by light microscopy of an epilated lash or by in vivo confocal microscopy. No cure is currently available. Management most frequently includes topical tea tree oil and its active ingredient terpinen-4-ol, both of which have produced good clinical outcomes. Topical tea tree oil is typically applied by a professional due to risk of toxicity. Several second-line treatment options have been studied, including ivermectin, metronidazole, selenium sulfide, microblepharoexfoliation, and lid hygiene. Novel, targeted therapies such as TP-03 (Tarsus Pharmaceuticals) are also currently being investigated in phase 2b/3 clinical trials. The purpose of this review purpose is to characterize Demodex blepharitis in detail, including its historical perspective and various classifications, and describe the latest diagnostic and management strategies.

### Azithromycin in duraSite for the treatment of blepharitis [^111acjXi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Blepharitis is a common inflammatory disease of the eyelid. Posterior blepharitis affects the posterior lamella of the eyelid and involves inflammation of the meibomian glands, whereas anterior blepharitis affects the anterior lamella of the eyelid and the eyelashes; either version can be inflammatory or infectious in nature. Each of these conditions can incite or propagate the other; anterior blepharitis, if not treated, can lead to meibomian gland disease, and vice versa. Blepharitis is typically chronic, and can be associated with a variety of systemic diseases such as dermatitis, as well as ocular diseases such as dry eye, conjunctivitis, or keratitis. The standard treatment regimen historically consists of lid hygiene with warm compresses and eyelid scrubs, although these treatment modalities may have limited efficacy for many patients, especially those with more severe disease. Adjunctive treatment includes systemic and topical antibiotics, topical corticosteroids, and tear replacement therapy. Topical antibiotics are recommended to decrease the bacterial load, and topical corticosteroids may help in cases of severe inflammation. Azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1% in DuraSite((R)) (AzaSite((R)); Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Durham, North Carolina, USA) has been proposed as a novel treatment for posterior blepharitis, based on its well-known anti-infective profile, its anti-inflammatory properties, its excellent tissue penetration, and its regulatory approval for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. This review focuses on an off-label indication for topical azithromycin 1% in DuraSite for the treatment of blepharitis.

### Interventions for chronic blepharitis [^115aBxUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Blepharitis, an inflammatory condition associated with itchiness, redness, flaking, and crusting of the eyelids, is a common eye condition that affects both children and adults. It is common in all ethnic groups and across all ages. Although infrequent, blepharitis can lead to permanent alterations to the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial keratopathy (abnormality of the cornea), corneal neovascularization, and ulceration. Most importantly, blepharitis frequently causes significant ocular symptoms such as burning sensation, irritation, tearing, and red eyes as well as visual problems such as photophobia and blurred vision. The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown, but suspected to be multifactorial, including chronic low-grade infections of the ocular surface with bacteria, infestations with certain parasites such as demodex, and inflammatory skin conditions such as atopy and seborrhea. Blepharitis can be categorized in several different ways. First, categorization is based on the length of disease process: acute or chronic blepharitis. Second, categorization is based on the anatomical location of disease: anterior, or front of the eye (e.g. staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis), and posterior, or back of the eye (e.g. meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)). This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We searched the reference lists of included studies for any additional studies not identified by the electronic searches. There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 9 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (CCTs) in which participants were adults aged 16 years or older and clinically diagnosed with chronic blepharitis. We also included trials where participants with chronic blepharitis were a subset of the participants included in the study and data were reported separately for these participants. Interventions within the scope of this review included medical treatment and lid hygiene measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed search results, reviewed full-text copies for eligibility, examined risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were meta-analyzed for studies comparing similar interventions and reporting comparable outcomes with the same timing. Otherwise, results for included studies were summarized in the text.

Main Results

There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in this review: 20 studies (14 RCTs and 6 CCTs) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharitis and 14 studies (12 RCTs and 2 CCTs) included 508 participants with posterior blepharitis (MGD). Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included studies, with respect to follow-up periods and types of interventions, comparisons, and condition of participants, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited. Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the eyelid margin for anterior blepharitis. Lid hygiene may provide symptomatic relief for anterior and posterior blepharitis. The effectiveness of other treatments for blepharitis, such as topical steroids and oral antibiotics, were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. Any RCT designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or MGD) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type II errors). Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. It is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly.

### Management and outcomes of proteasome inhibitor associated chalazia and blepharitis: a case series [^111My2fk]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Treatment algorithm. A proposed management sequence for patients with plasma cell disorders and proteasome inhibitor-associated eyelid complications

Ocular therapy choice is up to the ophthalmologist's discretion, but we propose using hot compresses in combination with at least 1 topical antibiotic and/or steroid drop, and possible oral antibiotics as well. A prospective, randomized study conducted by the senior author of this manuscript found that hot compresses alone or in combination with tobramycin or tobramycin/dexamethasone drops and ointment are all effective first-line treatment options for conventional chalazia. In our study, no specific combination of conservative therapies could be evaluated as more effective in this population due to small sample size. If eyelid complications persist after a 1.5–2 month trial of ocular therapy alone, proceed to bortezomib omission plus continuation of ocular therapy, and consider possible switch to an alternate proteasome inhibitor (carfilzomib or ixazomib) depending on the patient's oncologic status. If eyelid signs persist after bortezomib omission, consider specific addition of oral doxycycline, which has been shown to resolve persistent blepharitis after bortezomib cessation in prior studies. If eyelid complications resolve after bortezomib omission, bortezomib may be rechallenged once, based on the patient's oncologic status and willingness depending on prior severity of eyelid complications. However, if eyelid complications recur upon bortezomib rechallenge, the drug should be discontinued again.

Limitations of our study include small sample size and retrospective design. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine the true incidence and prevalence of proteasome inhibitor-associated eyelid complications, as well as the most effective ocular treatments. More data is needed regarding specific time periods when patients can be rechallenged with bortezomib, or if they may be rechallenged at all. In our study, only one patient underwent bortezomib rechallenge, making interpretation of this clinical situation more challenging. Our study could have been strengthened by using a standardized method to grade severity of each chalazion and blepharitis episode in order to see how severity affected management and outcomes. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study, no specific severity grading systems were employed.

### TheExpert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) consensus regarding the preferred treatment forBlepharitis [^1157woxU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The absence of a previous gold standard for treating DB, along with poor patient adherence to existing treatment options, precipitated the need to establish consensus and raise awareness regarding preferred management strategies to improve treatment outcomes. To this end, a panel of ophthalmologists and optometrists, including 11 of the authors in this manuscript, convened to form the Demodex Expert Panel on Treatment and Eyelid Health (DEPTH). The group used a modified Delphi methodology to reach consensus on the pathophysiology, patient profile, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, diagnosis, and comorbidities associated with DB. The Delphi method allows a group of experts to reach agreement through anonymous participation in an iterative series of questionnaires. Various groups, including the DEPTH panelists, have since modified the Delphi strategy to include a live consensus meeting. The modified Delphi process has been used across ophthalmology and optometry to establish consensus regarding a variety of topics, including the management of ocular diseases, such as DED, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and glaucoma. In their inaugural assembly, the DEPTH panel reached consensus on several statements regarding DB, such as collarettes — cylindrical coatings at the base of the eyelashes — are the most common sign of DB and pathognomonic for the disease, epilation and visualization of mites are not necessary for diagnosis, and itching in the eyelid margin is the most common symptom.

Blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) are very common, usually underdiagnosed and underappreciated diseases. More than 50% of patients seeking ophthalmologic consultations have symptoms and signs indicating one or both entities. We summarize the key points of diagnosis and management of both diseases, comparing the work of Dry Eye Workshop II (2017) with the dry eye blepharitis syndrome unification theory. The impact of MGD/blepharitis on ocular surgery also is described. Although MGD and blepharitis seem to be uncurable, most of the time they can be successfully controlled. Different management options are available, but the key to success remains simple-routine eyelid hygiene and moisturizing with the use of preservative-free lubricants.

### BlephEx-treatment for blepharitis: a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial [^1156oKGP]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelids that can lead to dry eye disease and irritation. It affects up to 47% of patients in eye care settings. While first-line treatments such as warm compresses, eyelid massage, and lubricants provide relief for some patients, many patients continue to have persistent inflammation and symptoms that significantly impact quality of life. More intensive treatments, such as topical cyclosporine and other topical immunomodulatory drugs, require high patient compliance and proper techniques to be effective.

For patients with refractory blepharitis, new treatment options that mitigate the limitations of current therapies are needed. The BlephEx™ (Scope Ophthalmics, London, UK) device provides automated eyelid margin debridement and has been proposed as an alternative treatment for blepharitis. BlephEx™ aims to disrupt pathogenic biofilms on the eyelid margin that contribute to chronic inflammation and symptoms. It can be used to remove encrusted secretions, patches, flakes, etc. on the eyelid margins and in the excretory ducts of the meibomian glands (see Fig. 1) so that pathogenic biofilms can be removed in the long term. In the case of chronic blepharitis, treatment should be repeated every four to six months according to the manufacturer's instructions. However, evidence for the efficacy of BlephEx™ remains limited, with few controlled studies published to date.

### TheExpert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) consensus regarding the preferred treatment forBlepharitis [^116raiDF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelid margin that often leads to conjunctivitis, functional tear deficiency, and keratitis. The condition is especially challenging to manage due to its chronicity and variable etiologies, which includes Demodex mite infestation, Staphylococcus bacterial infection, and seborrheic dermatitis. Two species of Demodex mites inhabit the human body: Demodex folliculorum within the lash follicle and Demodex brevis within the sebaceous gland. Demodex mite overgrowth (ie, demodicosis) can lead to Demodex blepharitis (DB). A retrospective study of 1032 sequential patients at multiple eye care centers revealed that 69.1% of patients with blepharitis were specifically diagnosed with DB. This disease is highly prevalent, as it is estimated that roughly 25 million US eye care patients have DB. Due to frequent co-occurrence with other ocular surface conditions, such as ocular rosacea, dry eye disease (DED), and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), DB is underdiagnosed. Patients with this condition commonly experience itching of the eyelid, dry eye, blurred vision, and ocular irritation, all of which negatively impact quality of life.

The following constitutes key background information on blepharitis:

- **Definition**: Blepharitis is an inflammatory condition of the eyelid margins involving the skin, eyelashes, and meibomian glands.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of blepharitis can be categorized based on the anatomical location of the disease: anterior and posterior blepharitis. Anterior blepharitis is often associated with seborrheic dermatitis or staphylococcal infection, while posterior blepharitis is linked to meibomian gland dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of blepharitis in ophthalmological and optometric practice is reported at 37% and 47%, respectively.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for blepharitis include advancing age, inadequate eyelid hygiene, seborrheic skin type, and certain pre-existing ocular conditions.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, blepharitis presents with ocular symptoms such as burning sensation, irritation, tearing, and red eyes. Visual problems such as photophobia and blurred vision may also occur. In some cases, complications like dry eye syndrome or chalazion can develop.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of blepharitis is generally good with proper management. Although it is a chronic condition, symptoms can be effectively controlled with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of demodex blepharitis: the demodex expert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) [^111zGz5Z]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

DEPTH panellists were divided about current preferred Demodex management, half using tea tree oil and half preferring blepharoexfoliation, but the group concurred that more research is necessary and new FDA-approved treatment options that target and kill all mites are needed. Panellists agreed that presence of DB negatively impacts patients' sense of well-being and, potentially, quality of life. The Delphi panel came to consensus that reducing or eradicating mites completely is important. Literature review and the results of our study confirm the need for a more effective, safe, and well-tolerated therapy for Demodex blepharitis.

Several conditions such as rosacea, MGD, and DED often occur with DB. Since clinically these conditions are often very similar, the panel concurred that DB is frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The consensus, therefore, was that all patients presenting for an eye exam should be evaluated for collarettes, especially those with lid abnormalities or those not responding to treatment for DED or MGD. DEPTH panellists shared that slit lamp examination with the patient looking down is simple and easy to incorporate into routine exams.

As with most studies, there are some limitations to the data presented here. The expert panel was composed of 12 members, a relatively small "sample size" that may not accurately reflect diversity among clinicians, practice settings, and patient populations. Even though DEPTH consisted of panellists with known expertise in, passion for, and commitment to advancing knowledge in ocular surface disease, results from this particular group may not be repeatable with different experts. Additionally, there is always potential for bias to be introduced via the survey process, the surveys themselves, the background reading, and even the face-to-face meeting. To mitigate this possibility, steps such as predefining consensus and question randomization were taken to minimize possible sources of bias.

This study is the first to show that the Delphi methodology is effective in establishing consensus surrounding various aspects of DB. Overall, consensus was obtained across numerous aspects of the disease including signs, symptoms, diagnosis, and associated ocular conditions. Consensus was not reached on other factors, such as the best therapeutic option and the best way to grade DB. Increased awareness of Demodex blepharitis in the eyecare community will raise the level of care received by patients with blepharitis and offer some a more targeted treatment strategy and better clinical outcomes.

Because questions remain regarding the treatment of DB, another Delphi panel is being planned, focusing on treatment.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111iafyn]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Delphi Methodology

Since the 1960s, the Delphi panel methodology has been used as a way to gain consensus on a given topic. First used by the RAND Corporation in collaboration with the US Air Force, the Delphi methodology is a process by which a group of experts can come to consensus utilizing a series of questionnaires. While primarily relying on surveys, the process may be modified to include face-to-face meetings. This methodology has been used across multiple professions, including numerous areas of medicine and, specifically, eyecare.

The current group of experts, Demodex Expert Panel on Treatment and Eyelid Health (DEPTH), previously convened and obtained consensus about aspects of DB, including pathophysiology, patient profile, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and comorbidities associated with Demodex blepharitis. To the authors' knowledge, that was the first Delphi panel that had been convened to address Demodex blepharitis. While consensus was obtained about a variety of aspects of DB, consensus was not achieved surrounding aspects of treatment of this condition. This paper, therefore, describes the second Delphi methodology process undertaken by this group, focusing on the management of Demodex blepharitis.

### Tea tree oil for demodex blepharitis [^111frw5o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Demodex blepharitis is a chronic condition commonly associated with recalcitrant dry eye symptoms though many people with Demodex mites are asymptomatic. The primary cause of this condition in humans is two types of Demodex mites: Demodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis. There are varying reports of the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis among adults, and it affects both men and women equally. While Demodex mites are commonly treated with tea tree oil, the effectiveness of tea tree oil for treating Demodex blepharitis is not well documented.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of tea tree oil on ocular Demodex infestation in people with Demodex blepharitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the databases on 18 June 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with tea tree oil (or its components) versus another treatment or no treatment for people with Demodex blepharitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and then full text of records to determine their eligibility. The review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Covidence. A third review author resolved any conflicts at all stages.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (1124 eyes of 562 participants; 17 to 281 participants per study) from the US, Korea, China, Australia, Ireland, and Turkey. The RCTs compared some formulation of tea tree oil to another treatment or no treatment. Included participants were both men and women, ranging from 39 to 55 years of age. All RCTs were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. We also identified two RCTs that are ongoing or awaiting publications. Data from three RCTs that reported a short-term mean change in the number of Demodex mites per eight eyelashes contributed to a meta-analysis. We are uncertain about the mean reduction for the groups that received the tea tree oil intervention (mean difference [MD] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.16) at four to six weeks as compared to other interventions. Only one RCT reported data for long-term changes, which found that the group that received intense pulse light as the treatment had complete eradication of Demodex mites at three months. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. Three RCTs reported no evidence of a difference for participant reported symptoms measured on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) between the tea tree oil group and the group receiving other forms of intervention. Mean differences in these studies ranged from -10.54 (95% CI - 24.19, 3.11) to 3.40 (95% CI -0.70 7.50). We did not conduct a meta-analysis for this outcome given substantial statistical heterogeneity and graded the certainty of the evidence as low. One RCT provided information concerning visual acuity but did not provide sufficient data for between-group comparisons. The authors noted that mean habitual LogMAR visual acuity for all study participants improved post-treatment (mean LogMAR 1.16, standard deviation 0.26 at 4 weeks). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low. No RCTs provided data on mean change in number of cylindrical dandruff or the proportion of participants experiencing conjunctival injection or experiencing meibomian gland dysfunction. Three RCTs provided information on adverse events. One reported no adverse events. The other two described a total of six participants randomized to treatment with tea tree oil who experienced ocular irritation or discomfort that resolved with re-educating the patient on application techniques and continuing use of the tea tree oil. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

The current review suggests that there is uncertainty related to the effectiveness of 5% to 50% tea tree oil for the short-term treatment of Demodex blepharitis; however, if used, lower concentrations may be preferable in the eye care arena to avoid induced ocular irritation. Future studies should be better controlled, assess outcomes at long term (e.g. 10 to 12 weeks or beyond), account for patient compliance, and study the effects of different tea tree oil concentrations.

### BlephEx-treatment for blepharitis: a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial [^114vyLC7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent studies, such as those by Siddireddy et al. further explore the effects of microblepharon exfoliation (BlephEx™) on bacterial load and meibomian gland function. These randomized controlled trials demonstrated that microblepharon exfoliation significantly reduces the number of bacteria on the eyelid margin and improves meibomian gland secretion quality. However, it should be noted that these studies were not double-blinded and focused primarily on symptomatic contact lens wearers rather than non-contact lens patients with chronic blepharitis, as in our study. The specific population difference could account for some variability in outcomes, as the challenges of managing chronic blepharitis in a contact-lens-less population may differ from those of contact lens-related discomfort. Additionally, the lack of blinding in the Siddireddy studies may have introduced a placebo effect, as the mechanical stimulation during BlephEx™ treatment differs from that in the control treatment. This could have contributed to the positive outcomes reported in these studies. In contrast, our study was double-masked, which minimizes this type of bias and allows for a more reliable comparison of the treatment effect. This distinction may partially explain why our results did not show a statistically significant difference between BlephEx™ and sham treatment, especially in patients without contact lens wear. Additionally, while BlephEx™ may reduce bacterial load, this may not directly translate into sustained clinical improvements in symptoms for all patients with chronic blepharitis.

### Demodex folliculorum and blepharitis… [^1165S2AZ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

For many years Demodex folliculorum has been recognized as an inhabitant of the pores of the skin, particularly in the face. Except for a detailed study by Stcherbatchoff in 1903, only casual reference has been made to its presence in the eyelid structures of man. Freshly collected material from the pores and eyelashes, placed in glycerin, can be examined readily under the low power microscope for the presence of the organism. In some patients the association of a Demodex infection of the eyelids and blepharitis appear to be associated etiologically. Satisfactory, if not ideal, eyelid treatment has been devised through the careful use of Selsunef ointment. * Concurrent treatment of Demodex infestation of the face is imperative to prevent reinfection of the eyelash structures.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of demodex blepharitis: the demodex expert panel on treatment and eyelid health (DEPTH) [^1127f946]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before

Blepharitis is chronic eyelid margin inflammation found in approximately 47% of patients presenting for eye examinations.
Up to 70% of blepharitis cases may be due to Demodex infestation.
Because Demodex blepharitis shares many signs and symptoms with other ocular surface conditions, it is often mis- or underdiagnosed.

What this study adds

Through a systematic process of literature review, successive surveys, and peer-to-peer discussion, this expert panel came to consensus about many aspects of Demodex blepharitis.
Consensus was reached about the typical; patient, key signs and symptoms, effective examination strategies to best recognize Demodex blepharitis, and associated ocular and systemic conditions.
While there was agreement about some aspects of treatment, further study is warranted to reach consensus on the most effective management strategies.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^117D8QXZ]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis treatment — overall approach and therapeutic options: The patient must understand that a cure is usually not possible, but continual daily treatment can significantly improve symptoms. Treatments that may be helpful include warm compresses, artificial tears, eyelid cleansing (including eyelid massage in cases of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) to express the meibomian glands), topical perfluorohexyloctane, antibiotics (topical and/or systemic), antiparasitic medication (metronidazole, ivermectin, lotilaner), topical anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine), and in-office procedural treatments (e.g., vectored thermal pulsation, microblepharoexfoliation). These treatment options are often used in combination; eyelid hygiene may provide symptomatic relief for anterior and posterior blepharitis, eyelid cleansing may be particularly useful for anterior blepharitis, and warm compresses are especially helpful for posterior blepharitis/MGD, with the optimal regimen often requiring persistence and a trial-and-error approach.
