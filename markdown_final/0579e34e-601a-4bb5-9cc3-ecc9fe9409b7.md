management of concussion

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of concussion, preserving natural self-verification and course-correction where needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and red flags. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and standardized tools. Next, I will review acute management, especially the shift from strict rest to active recovery. After that, I need to check the graduated return-to-activity protocols for sport, school, and work. Then, I will examine management of persistent symptoms and when to escalate care. I should also consider special populations and modifiers, and finally integrate prevention, education, and quality metrics to close the loop.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and cervical spine stabilization come first, and I need to ensure there is no structural brain injury or cervical trauma before labeling this as concussion; I should double-check for red flags such as declining consciousness, focal deficits, severe or worsening headache, repeated vomiting, seizures, or anticoagulant use that would prompt urgent imaging and neurosurgical consultation, and I must remember that anticoagulated patients with even mild mechanisms can deteriorate and may require observation even with a normal initial CT if INR is supratherapeutic [^112VqMDY] [^114ZVz1w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis; concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on a compatible mechanism and characteristic symptoms across physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep domains, with the understanding that symptoms are nonspecific and may be delayed, so I should verify the temporal relationship and exclude mimics like migraine, anxiety, vestibular disorders, or cervical injury before confirming concussion [^112VqMDY] [^111EXZku].

> I need to check which tools are appropriate in which setting; on the sideline, SCAT5 or Child SCAT5 can structure evaluation, whereas in clinic I should use symptom inventories, neurocognitive testing when indicated, and balance or vestibular screens such as BESS or VOMS, but I should confirm that these tools supplement rather than replace clinical judgment and that baseline data, when available, improve interpretability [^111xeAyY] [^112VqMDY] [^11687uGt] [^113ATDsU].

> Next, I should review acute management; historically we emphasized strict rest, but wait, let me verify current guidance — most contemporary guidelines endorse a brief period of relative rest for 24–48 hours, then gradual, progressive return to cognitive and physical activity below symptom-exacerbation thresholds, with explicit counseling that transient symptom worsening with increased activity is common and manageable with pacing and slower progression [^111WDz7y] [^117GBErY] [^111E7KUa].

> I will now examine the return-to-sport protocol; athletes should not return to play on the day of injury, and progression should follow a stepwise approach from light aerobic activity to sport-specific drills, non-contact training, full-contact practice, and finally return to play only after medical clearance, with each step contingent on remaining symptom-free; I should confirm that neurocognitive testing can support but not replace clinical clearance and that state laws and sport governing bodies may impose additional requirements [^116jt8bm] [^112VqMDY] [^111Tb6NU].

> But wait, what if the patient is a student; I need to ensure return-to-learn is addressed before return-to-play, with temporary academic accommodations such as reduced workload, extended time, and environmental modifications, and I should verify that school nurses, teachers, and administrators are engaged early to support a paced, symptom-guided reintegration plan [^116jt8bm] [^111oBKyK].

> For adults returning to work, let me consider functional limitations and implement graded duty modifications, ergonomic adjustments, and cognitive pacing strategies, and I should confirm that expectations are aligned with the patient's symptom profile and job demands to avoid setbacks [^117DS6np].

> Now, I should review management of persistent symptoms; if symptoms persist beyond about 10–14 days in adults or 2–4 weeks in children, I need to reassess for contributing factors such as sleep disturbance, headache, mood disorders, cervical or vestibular dysfunction, and vision problems, and I should verify that targeted therapies are initiated: vestibular rehabilitation for dizziness and balance deficits, cognitive rehabilitation for measurable cognitive impairments, and headache management with education, sleep hygiene, trigger management, and judicious pharmacotherapy, escalating to specialty referral if refractory [^1142iYVA] [^112QGhW5] [^111gdxTe] [^1178Gv2b].

> Hold on, I should verify referral triggers; for adults with cognitive symptoms persisting beyond 30–90 days despite addressing comorbidities, referral for neuropsychological testing and structured cognitive rehabilitation is reasonable, and for children, earlier referral is often warranted given developmental considerations and the higher prevalence of prolonged recovery; multidisciplinary concussion clinics can coordinate care when symptoms cross multiple domains [^112fFPBr] [^114ofvxQ] [^115VNKmB].

> Let me think about special populations; children and adolescents generally recover more slowly and are more vulnerable to cognitive and mood effects, so I should adopt a more conservative, individualized approach with explicit return-to-learn prioritization and closer follow-up, while females may report more symptoms and have higher rates of prolonged recovery, and patients with ADHD, learning disorders, or prior concussions warrant anticipatory guidance and possibly extended recovery timelines [^111Tb6NU] [^111oBKyK] [^115SVLAp].

> I should double-check that I am not over-ordering tests; routine neuroimaging is not indicated for uncomplicated concussion, but I need to ensure a low threshold for CT when red flags are present or when anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk, and I must remember that advanced imaging or biomarkers are investigational and not for routine clinical use at this time [^112VqMDY] [^114ZVz1w] [^116HyPcY].

> Next, I should review prevention and education; preseason education for athletes, parents, coaches, and teachers improves recognition and response, and I need to ensure documentation of informed consent regarding risks, especially in youth sports, while also reinforcing rule changes, technique modification, and equipment standards that reduce exposure to high-risk impacts, even though no strategy eliminates concussion risk entirely [^114twbsE] [^114KoM7g] [^115jnVvi].

> I need to ensure quality metrics are embedded; documentation of symptom tracking, graded return-to-activity progression, and medical clearance prior to unrestricted return are standard outpatient expectations, and I should verify that my documentation distinguishes acute from post-acute phases and reflects individualized plans consistent with guideline-based care [^1122bXft] [^117G7zxf].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency: screen and stabilize, diagnose clinically with appropriate tools, initiate brief relative rest with early active recovery, implement stepwise return-to-learn and return-to-sport below symptom thresholds, proactively manage persistent symptoms with targeted therapies and timely referrals, and close the loop with education and quality tracking, adjusting the plan as new symptoms or modifiers emerge during follow-up [^112VqMDY] [^111WDz7y] [^116jt8bm] [^1159fcA8].

---

Effective concussion management centers on **early recognition** and **immediate removal from activity** to prevent second impact syndrome [^116jt8bm], followed by a brief period of rest (24–48 hours) [^111WDz7y] and then a **gradual, symptom-limited return to cognitive and physical activity** [^112JH3Ze]. Management is **individualized**, with education for patients and families [^111oBKyK], and use of validated tools (SCAT5, ImPACT) to track recovery [^111xeAyY]. Persistent symptoms (> 10–14 days) warrant targeted rehabilitation (vestibular, vision, cervical, cognitive) [^1142iYVA] and multidisciplinary care [^115PZzzh]; pharmacotherapy is reserved for specific symptoms, and return-to-play/school protocols are completed before full return [^116jt8bm].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **Clinical assessment**: Concussion is a clinical diagnosis based on mechanism, signs, and symptoms; exclude cervical spine injury and more severe TBI [^112VqMDY] [^112JH3Ze].

- **Standardized tools**: Use SCAT5, Child SCAT5, and ImPACT to aid diagnosis and monitor recovery [^115xNLfq].

- **Red flags**: Severe headache, repeated vomiting, declining consciousness, focal deficits, or seizures require urgent evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Acute management (first 24–48 hours)

During the first 24–48 hours, **rest** entails relative physical and cognitive rest — avoiding screens, school, and strenuous activity — followed by a **gradual return** as symptoms allow [^111WDz7y] [^112JH3Ze]. Provide **education** with written and verbal instructions on symptoms, recovery, and red flags [^112JH3Ze].

---

## Symptom management

- **Headache**: Use acetaminophen or NSAIDs; avoid opioids; consider migraine-specific agents if migraine features are present [^notfound].

- **Sleep disturbances**: Emphasize sleep hygiene; melatonin or short-term hypnotics may be used cautiously [^notfound].

- **Nausea**: Ondansetron or metoclopramide as needed [^notfound].

---

## Return-to-activity protocols

Return-to-activity protocols include a **stepwise progression** through graded stages (light aerobic activity → sport-specific drills → non-contact practice → full contact → return) [^116jt8bm], with each stage advanced only if asymptomatic for 24 hours; if symptoms recur, return to the prior stage [^notfound]. Medical clearance is required before full return to **sport or school** [^116jt8bm].

---

## Management of persistent symptoms

Persistent symptoms lasting > 10–14 days warrant **targeted rehabilitation** (vestibular therapy for dizziness/balance, vision therapy for convergence/accommodation deficits, cervical therapy for neck pain/headache, and cognitive rehabilitation for attention/memory deficits) [^1142iYVA] [^112QGhW5]. Multidisciplinary care involving neurology, neuropsychology, physical/occupational therapy, and mental health is recommended for **complex or refractory cases** [^115PZzzh].

---

## Special populations

Children and adolescents require a **more conservative approach**, with longer recovery times and careful return-to-learn planning [^111oBKyK]. Athletes should be managed per **sport-specific guidelines**, with strict adherence to return-to-play protocols [^116jt8bm]. Military personnel may benefit from **specialized programs** and provider training in progressive return-to-activity protocols [^111Wxxf3].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention strategies include **education** for athletes, coaches, and parents on recognition and management [^114KoM7g], enforcement of **safety rules** and proper technique to reduce injury risk [^112S7h94], and use of **protective equipment** (helmets, mouthguards), acknowledging that no equipment eliminates concussion risk [^112S7h94].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular visits** to track symptoms, recovery, and adherence to activity restrictions, along with **patient-reported outcomes** using validated symptom scales and neurocognitive testing [^112VqMDY].

---

## Current evidence and guidelines

Current evidence supports brief rest followed by **gradual, symptom-limited return to activity** [^111WDz7y]. Major guidelines from the **CDC, AAP, and AMSSM** align on individualized, multidisciplinary care and stepwise return-to-activity protocols [^1161JYbm] [^116jt8bm] [^111xeAyY].

---

Effective concussion management requires a **structured, individualized approach** that balances rest with gradual reactivation, addresses symptoms proactively, and uses multidisciplinary care for persistent cases.

### Current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of concussion in sport: a comparison of three new guidelines [^111DZ9wz]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable debate within the sports medicine community about the role of concussion and the risk of chronic neurological sequelae. This concern has led to significant confusion among primary care providers and athletic trainers about how to best identify those athletes at risk and how to treat those with concussion. During the first quarter of 2013, several new or updated clinical practice guidelines and position statements were published on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injury/concussion in sports. Three of these guidelines were produced by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, The American Academy of Neurology, and the Zurich Consensus working group. The goal of each group was to clearly define current best practices for the definition, diagnosis, and acute and post-acute management of sports-related concussion, including specific recommendations for return to play. In this article, we compare the recommendations of each of the three groups, and highlight those topics for which there is consensus regarding the definition of concussion, diagnosis, and acute care of athletes suspected of having a concussion, as well as return-to-play recommendations.

### Current concepts in the treatment of sports concussions [^113Cbzc8]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

The management of patients with sports-related concussion (SRC) is comprehensive and includes preseason planning, education, initial evaluation, postinjury assessment, disposition, return-to-play decisions, and consideration of long-term brain health. Several recent publications have addressed sports concussion management using the best available evidence, and we review them here. The diagnosis and management of sports concussion have evolved over the past several decades, and with a greater understanding of the importance of both short- and long-term sequelae, there has been a clear trend toward recognizing and treating these brain injuries more cautiously and developing a proactive approach to management and return-to-play decision making. Although each of these used different methodologies in their review of the literature, their conclusions are fairly consistent, providing basic guidelines for contemporary approaches to management of SRC. Although many questions remain unanswered, there are several areas of agreement including the importance of education, preseason assessment, the benefit and utility of a standardized multimodal assessment on the sidelines, individualized treatment and return-to-play protocols, and the benefit of a multidisciplinary team in managing complicated injuries. This paper reviews these current sports concussion guidelines and the best available evidence that guides current management of SRC.

### Sports medicine update: concussion [^112JH3Ze]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

A systematic approach is required for patients with a suspected concussion. Although standardized tools can aid in assessment, the diagnosis of concussion remains a clinical one. At the time of diagnosis, patients should be given both verbal and written review of the common symptoms of concussion, expected course of recovery, as well as strategies to manage symptoms. Most patients benefit from a brief period of rest, followed by a gradual reintroduction of activities, and a graduated return-to-sport protocol. Patients with prolonged recovery from a concussion may benefit from exercise, vestibular, and cognitive rehabilitation programs.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists over not only the incidence of long-term risks of multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injury. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to make these decisions. This has resulted in the existence of a number of published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes. Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. Delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### Contemporary diagnosis and management of mild TBI (concussions): what you need to know [^114U6mAc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents and is a form of mild traumatic brain injury that surgeons will see in their acute care practice. With a rapidly changing evidence base for diagnosis and management, we will focus on the importance of timely identification and diagnosis, as well as the early initiation of active management of pediatric concussion immediately after injury through recovery. This approach involves the application of targeted therapies for specific deficits identified after concussion, addressing the individual pattern of symptoms experienced by patients following concussion. We will review what is known about the underlying pathophysiology that drives the clinical manifestations of concussion, the targeted clinical assessments that can both aid in the diagnosis of concussion, as well as drive the active rehabilitation of deficits seen after concussion. The standardized approach to the return to activities will also be described, including return to learning and sports.

### Managing patients with prolonged recovery following concussion [^113LT7XN]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms following concussion can be debilitating for patients and challenging for clinicians; however, evidence-based approaches to symptom management are emerging. The presentation of postconcussion syndrome can be variable among patients. Given this variability, a thorough history and physical examination are necessary to tailor an individualized treatment approach. Pharmacologic interventions can be considered when prolonged symptoms are negatively affecting quality of life. This article reviews evidence available to guide such treatment decisions.

### The difficult concussion patient: what is the best approach to investigation and management of persistent (> 10 days) postconcussive symptoms? [^1142iYVA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concussion in sport typically recovers clinically within 10 days of injury. In some cases, however, symptoms may be prolonged or complications may develop. The objectives of the current paper are to review the literature regarding the difficult concussion and to provide recommendations for an approach to the investigation and management of patients with persistent symptoms.

Methods

A qualitative review of the literature on concussion in sport was conducted with a focus on prolonged recovery, long-term complications and management including investigation and treatment strategies. MEDLINE and Sports Discus databases were reviewed.

Results

Persistent symptoms (> 10 days) are generally reported in 10–15% of concussions. This figure may be higher in certain sports (eg, ice hockey) and populations (eg, children). In general, symptoms are not specific to concussion and it is important to consider and manage coexistent pathologies. Investigations may include formal neuropsychological testing and conventional neuroimaging to exclude structural pathology. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine clinical use of advanced neuroimaging techniques or genetics markers. Preliminary studies demonstrate the potential benefit of subsymptom threshold activity as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation programme. Limited research is available on pharmacological interventions.

Conclusions

Cases of concussion in sport where clinical recovery falls outside the expected window (ie, 10 days) should be managed in a multidisciplinary manner by healthcare providers with experience in sports-related concussion. Important components of management, after the initial period of physical and cognitive rest, include associated therapies such as cognitive, vestibular, physical and psychological therapy, assessment for other causes of prolonged symptoms and consideration of a graded exercise programme at a level that does not exacerbate symptoms.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^116cLsha]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guideline (CPG) — purpose, objectives, and need specifies that the primary purpose is to provide a set of evidence-based recommendations for physical therapist management of the wide spectrum of patients who have experienced a concussive event; specific objectives are to systematically review the available scientific evidence pertaining to physical therapist management, provide evidence-based recommendations to guide physical therapist treatment, and educate all stakeholders regarding physical therapy strategies, with secondary objectives to identify gaps in knowledge and provide consensus-based recommendations where evidence is lacking; it further states this CPG is the first to provide a comprehensive set of evidence-based recommendations for examination, evaluation, treatment, and outcome measurement strategies for physical therapist management of patients who have sustained a potential concussive event, notes that more research is needed to evaluate the appropriateness and feasibility of using guidelines for impairments common after a concussive event, and indicates that the recommendations were based on a critical appraisal of the studies published and/or available.

### Partnering with patients, caregivers, and clinicians to determine research priorities for concussion [^116HyPcY]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This JLA PSP gathered opinions from more than 1000 patients, caregivers, and clinicians and, through a multistep process, identified the top 10 unanswered research questions that matter most to those affected by concussion. The project brought together a broad and diverse group of patients, caregivers, and clinicians from across Canada and, to our knowledge, is the first patient-oriented research priority-setting project in concussion. The top 10 questions identify priority areas on which researchers and research networks can focus to improve outcomes for people living with concussion.

Taken as a whole, the list of research priorities is broad in scope and reflects the diverse concerns of patients, caregivers, and clinicians. Priorities include early and accurate diagnosis after a head injury, specific symptom management, approaches to ensure a safe return to physical and cognitive activities after concussion, predicting and preventing prolonged symptoms and poor outcomes, and understanding the pathophysiology of concussion.

The top-ranked question focuses on identifying patients at high risk for prolonged symptoms at the time of diagnosis and developing a personalized management strategy. With up to 30% of people with concussion experiencing symptoms longer than 1 month, early and accurate identification of risk factors for prolonged symptoms was deemed the highest priority. Risk factors associated with prolonged recovery have been identified, and a clinical risk score has been validated for pediatric patients, and is now in development for adult patients. However, despite considerable research, there are no validated physiological, serological, or radiological biomarkers that can accurately diagnose concussion and predict recovery. Therefore, more research is needed to implement existing validated tools into clinical pathways and to develop additional biomarkers and strategies to refine diagnosis and personalize therapies to improve outcomes.

Three questions focused on improving early diagnosis and management of concussion. The first concerns the role of interdisciplinary teams of health care professionals (eg, physicians, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists, occupational therapists, mental health professionals, vision specialists) in assessing and managing concussion and asks which patients should be referred early to these teams to achieve the best outcomes. A second question focused on the need to develop approaches to differentiate symptoms due to concussion from those of nonconcussion medical problems that may have similar symptoms but require different therapies. The third question concerns the variation in abilities of clinicians to recognize and manage concussion. With concussion diagnosis and management recommendations changing frequently, educating clinicians on concussion was considered important to improve recognition and standardize management.

### Current concepts in concussion: initial evaluation and management [^112VqMDY]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, is common in adults and youth and is a major health concern. Concussion is caused by direct or indirect external trauma to the head resulting in shear stress to brain tissue from rotational or angular forces. Concussion can affect a variety of clinical domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional or behavioral. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptom onset must be determined. Headache is the most common symptom. Initial evaluation involves eliminating concern for cervical spine injury and more serious traumatic brain injury before diagnosis is established. Tools to aid diagnosis and monitor recovery include symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. If concussion is suspected in an athlete, the athlete should not return to play until medically cleared. Brief cognitive and physical rest are key components of initial management. Initial management also involves patient education and reassurance and symptom management. Individuals recover from concussion differently; therefore, rigid guidelines have been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. As symptoms resolve, patients may gradually return to activity as tolerated. Those with risk factors, such as more severe symptoms immediately after injury, may require longer recovery periods. There is limited research in the younger population; however, given concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain, a more conservative approach to management is warranted.

### Fifteen minute consultation: a structured approach to the recognition and management of concussion in children and adolescents [^113VxDs1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Concussion is a disturbance in brain function caused by a direct or indirect force, which is transmitted to the head. The incidence of concussion is rising, and poor recognition of symptoms, with inappropriate management strategies, increases the risk of long-term cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications. We address some common questions that arise when assessing and managing patients with suspected concussion.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^115d3YK6]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

It is time to stop using the term concussion as it has no clear definition and no pathological meaning. This confusion is increasingly problematic as the management of 'concussed' individuals is a pressing concern. Historically, it has been used to describe patients briefly disabled following a head injury, with the assumption that this was due to a transient disorder of brain function without long-term sequelae. However, the symptoms of concussion are highly variable in duration, and can persist for many years with no reliable early predictors of outcome. Using vague terminology for post-traumatic problems leads to misconceptions and biases in the diagnostic process, producing uninterpretable science, poor clinical guidelines and confused policy. We propose that the term concussion should be avoided. Instead neurologists and other healthcare professionals should classify the severity of traumatic brain injury and then attempt to precisely diagnose the underlying cause of post-traumatic symptoms.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^114iRbPB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, numerous concussion evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), consensus statements, and clinical guidance documents have been published. These documents have typically focused on the diagnosis of concussion and medical management of individuals post concussion, but provide little specific guidance for physical therapy management of concussion and its associated impairments. Further, many of these guidance documents have targeted specific populations in specific care contexts. The primary purpose of this CPG is to provide a set of evidence-based recommendations for physical therapist management of the wide spectrum of patients who have experienced a concussive event.

Regarding medical management for concussion, more specifically with respect to management of cognitive issues, DoD/VA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider referring patients with a history of mTBI presenting with symptoms related to memory, attention, or executive function problems not resolving within 30–90 days and refractory to treatment for associated symptoms to cognitive rehabilitation therapists with expertise in TBI rehabilitation as appropriate. Consider offering a short-term trial of cognitive rehabilitation treatment to assess the individual patient responsiveness to strategy training, including instruction and practice on using memory aids (such as cognitive assistive technologies). Avoid offering a prolonged course of therapy in the absence of patient improvement.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric concussion in the acute setting [^1142a2fA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Concussion, a type of mild traumatic brain injury, is a common injury encountered by providers caring for pediatric patients in the emergency department (ED) setting. Our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis for symptom and recovery trajectories for pediatric concussion continues to rapidly evolve. As this understanding changes, so do recommendations for optimal management of concussed youth. As more and more children present to EDs across the country for concussion, it is imperative that providers caring for children in these settings remain up-to-date with diagnostic recommendations and management techniques. This article will review the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of pediatric concussion in the ED setting.

### Concussion [^1133mCG4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Concussions are a common injury for which patients often present first to primary care physicians. They can affect the day-to-day function of patients in school and work, as well as in sports and recreational activities. Recognizing common physical signs and symptoms after injury facilitates timely diagnosis and treatment, permitting initiation of an active management approach to recovery while preventing secondary injury. For persons with persistent symptoms, active rehabilitation may be utilized, with the goal of returning patients to full function.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^115pqGMd]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) position statement on sport-related concussion (SRC) states that SRC is a common injury in sport, notes progress in understanding that has driven clinical guidelines for diagnosis, assessment, and management, and provides a narrative review to assist health care providers with evaluation and management. It updates the previous position statement, addresses current evidence and knowledge gaps, and relies on the best available evidence integrated with clinical experience and patient values. The statement reviews definition, pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis and management of both acute and persistent concussion symptoms, short- and long-term risks of SRC and repetitive head impact exposure, prevention strategies, and future research directions. Writing group selection was overseen by the AMSSM Board of Directors, which appointed a chair to assemble a balanced panel experienced in SRC evaluation, management, and research, with subspecialty experts invited to provide diverse viewpoints. The AMSSM affirms commitment to best clinical practices, evidence-based research, and educational initiatives that positively impact athlete health and safety.

### Evaluation and management of concussion in young athletes [^112omjXJ]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Learning about concussion diagnosis and management is important for all individuals who will be taking care of young athletes. There are about 1.7million reported concussions per year, and, of these, about 20% are sports related. There are risks in all sports, but the highest rates of concussions are from football, rugby, and hockey, with soccer being the highest cause for girls. An on-field assessment includes evaluating airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by cervical spine assessment. Then, concussion evaluation tools can be used to aid in making the diagnosis. While concussion symptoms for the majority of youth resolve within a few weeks, some individuals may have persistence of symptoms for 3 months or more, referred to as postconcussive syndrome. Providers should consider ongoing symptoms in assessing when an athlete may safely return to sports and to learning. A major concern that has become more apparent in recent years is the possibility that concussions may have a longitudinal effect on health, such as in the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Research has shown that there is an increase in the number of patients presenting to their primary care physician with concussions. Knowing how best to prevent, diagnose, and manage concussions will help to minimize risks to young athletes.

### The diagnosis and management of concussion in children and Adolescents [^115qntFL]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Concussion is a complex brain injury that results in more than 100,000 emergency department visits for school-aged children each year in the United States. All 50 US states have passed concussion legislation designed to promote safety in youth sports. Most of these laws require medical clearance by a licensed health care provider before returning to sport, which may have contributed to an increase in pediatric subspecialty referrals, particularly referrals to the child neurologist.

Methods

We reviewed the literature on pediatric concussion.

Results

This review summarizes the current knowledge and recommendations for concussion diagnosis and management in children and adolescents, athletes and nonathletes. It highlights concussion epidemiology, pathophysiology, advances in neuroimaging, and potential health risks including second impact syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It also underscores clinical areas where evidence is lacking.

Conclusions

The diagnosis and management of concussion requires specific considerations in children. Further concussion research must be done to minimize injury risk and to optimize medical care for this common problem.

The 2016 Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport has recently been published in BJSM, as the major conduit for informing sports medicine practitioners and clinicians worldwide about the importance of this condition, its assessment and management. This information dissemination strategy has worked well for previous concussion statements and has certainly raised the profile of the issue in sports medicine circles.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^111xeAyY]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) — clinical conclusions and management: SRC is common among athletes and a common reason for medical encounters with sports medicine physicians, and concussion is a complex, heterogeneous brain injury that typically clinically resolves in 1 to 4 weeks. The diagnosis of concussion is challenging because it relies on self-reported symptoms and there are no readily available objective diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis. Sports medicine physicians and others who diagnose concussion should be familiar with the psychometric properties of the sideline and office assessment tools they are using. After a brief period of rest, acutely concussed patients can be encouraged to gradually and progressively increase their physical and cognitive activity while staying below their symptom-exacerbation thresholds. In cases of prolonged symptoms, a multidisciplinary team experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion should be considered. There are many beneficial aspects to participation in sport and exercise that should be balanced against the concern for concussion.

### Current concepts in concussion: evaluation and management [^115v7Zbm]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Concussion is a disturbance in brain function caused by direct or indirect force to the head. It is a functional rather than structural injury that results from shear stress to brain tissue caused by rotational or angular forces-direct impact to the head is not required. Initial evaluation involves eliminating cervical spine injury and serious traumatic brain injury. Headache is the most common symptom of concussion, although a variety of clinical domains (e.g., somatic, cognitive, affective) can be affected. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptoms must be determined. There are numerous assessment tools to aid diagnosis, including symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. These tools are also used to monitor recovery. Cognitive and physical rest are the cornerstones of initial management. There are no specific treatments for concussion; therefore, focus is on managing symptoms and return to play. Because concussion recovery is variable, rigid classification systems have mostly been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. A graded return-to-play protocol can be implemented once a patient has recovered in all affected domains. Children, adolescents, and those with a history of concussions may require a longer recovery period. There is limited research on the management of concussions in children and adolescents, but concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain suggests that a more conservative approach to management is appropriate in these patients.

Acute recognition and management of traumatic brain injury along the spectrum from mild to severe is essential in optimizing neurocognitive outcomes. Concussion is common following head trauma in children, and resulting symptoms can last for months if not diagnosed and managed properly. Emerging evidence and consensus demonstrate that a program of cognitive and physical activity with a graduated return to play, sport, and school may improve outcomes following concussion. "Return to Play" legislation for youth has been adopted by most states. Outcomes of patients with severe traumatic brain injury have improved.

### Centers for disease control and prevention guideline on the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury among children [^111oBKyK]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, in children is a rapidly growing public health concern because epidemiologic data indicate a marked increase in the number of emergency department visits for mTBI over the past decade. However, no evidence-based clinical guidelines have been developed to date for diagnosing and managing pediatric mTBI in the United States.

Objective

To provide a guideline based on a previous systematic review of the literature to obtain and assess evidence toward developing clinical recommendations for health care professionals related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and management/treatment of pediatric mTBI.

Evidence Review

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Board of Scientific Counselors, a federal advisory committee, established the Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Guideline Workgroup. The workgroup drafted recommendations based on the evidence that was obtained and assessed within the systematic review, as well as related evidence, scientific principles, and expert inference. This information includes selected studies published since the evidence review was conducted that were deemed by the workgroup to be relevant to the recommendations. The dates of the initial literature search were January 1, 1990, to November 30, 2012, and the dates of the updated literature search were December 1, 2012, to July 31, 2015.

Findings

The CDC guideline includes 19 sets of recommendations on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management/treatment of pediatric mTBI that were assigned a level of obligation (ie, must, should, or may) based on confidence in the evidence. Recommendations address imaging, symptom scales, cognitive testing, and standardized assessment for diagnosis; history and risk factor assessment, monitoring, and counseling for prognosis; and patient/family education, rest, support, return to school, and symptom management for treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

This guideline identifies the best practices for mTBI based on the current evidence; updates should be made as the body of evidence grows. In addition to the development of the guideline, CDC has created user-friendly guideline implementation materials that are concise and actionable. Evaluation of the guideline and implementation materials is crucial in understanding the influence of the recommendations.

### Quality improvement in neurology: concussion quality measurement set [^1122bXft]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Care setting and time since injury — application of quality measures: Concussion may be diagnosed in many different settings, including a sports sideline, emergency department (ED), urgent care, inpatient hospital, or outpatient office. Because capabilities and limitations differ across settings, expectations for appropriate concussion care also differ; for example, documentation of a return-to-play progression prior to sport clearance is standard of care in the outpatient clinic setting, but concussion clearance during ED evaluation is not advocated or performed. Future quality measures should account for these differences, and the management of prolonged symptoms after concussion differs from the management of acute symptoms; future quality measures may be adopted that are tailored to address quality measures at different time points post injury and likely differ by mechanisms of injury.

### Diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management of mild traumatic brain injury [^114ESyge]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Concussion and mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) are interchangeable terms to describe a common disorder with substantial effects on public health. Advances in brain imaging, non-imaging biomarkers, and neuropathology during the past 15 years have required researchers, clinicians, and policy makers to revise their views about mild TBI as a fully reversible insult that can be repeated without consequences. These advances have led to guidelines on management of mild TBI in civilians, military personnel, and athletes, but their widespread dissemination to clinical management in emergency departments and community-based health care is still needed. The absence of unity on the definition of mild TBI, the scarcity of prospective data concerning the long-term effects of repeated mild TBI and subconcussive impacts, and the need to further develop evidence-based interventions to mitigate the long-term sequelae are areas for future research that will improve outcomes, reduce morbidity and costs, and alleviate delayed consequences that have only recently come to light.

### Neurologic care in concussion and post-concussive encephalopathy [^113yaFgP]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2016). Low credibility.

Concussion has become a more recent "medical fad" with a lot of media coverage and hence an increasing incidence. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention there are estimates of as many as 3.8 million sport-related traumatic brain injuries occurring annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). Given these numbers, concussion care will require that both primary and specialist physicians feel comfortable in its management. This article will discuss the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical evaluation, therapies and prognosis in patients with concussion. The complex and chronic symptoms after a concussion and their management will be highlighted. Appropriate concussion care is essential for improving both the long and short term outcomes in adolescent athletes. There is an important role for the neurologist in improving the outcome in these athletes.

### Central nervous system trauma management of concussions in athletes [^113ATDsU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The care of athletes with concussions is challenging because each patient has different symptoms. An athlete should never be returned to play until completely asymptomatic. Classification systems for concussions are not based on scientific evidence and represent some practitioners' best guess at what is safe for young athletes. Many experienced team physicians believe they can allow an athlete to play safely if there are no symptoms at rest and no symptoms with increasing intensity of exercise. Abbreviated neuropsychological testing and balance tests show promise for use in the field to increase the sensitivity of our neurological evaluation on injured athletes. Any neuropsychological or balance evaluation is more helpful if baseline data is collected on athletes before they are injured.

### Partnering with patients, caregivers, and clinicians to determine research priorities for concussion [^114HCMDH]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Two highly ranked questions focused on identifying the best approach for a safe and effective return to activities. Recent evidence has shown that after a short period of initial rest (24–48 hours), mild to moderate physical and cognitive activity is beneficial for recovery. Some patients have difficulty increasing mental and physical activity without exacerbating postconcussion symptoms. Effective strategies to reintroduce cognitive and physical activities in those with refractory symptoms, to reduce time away from school, work, and/or physical activity, and to improve recovery time are needed. Two additional management-related questions focused on the effectiveness of interventions to manage concussion-related chronic headache and sleep disturbances.

Five questions were deemed to be sufficiently answered by literature review. These answered questions highlight gaps in knowledge translation and should be a priority for dissemination to stakeholders and the public to improve awareness and enhance implementation of existing research evidence.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^116V2rdh]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a common injury in recreational and organised sport. Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in our scientific understanding of SRC, which in turn has driven the development of clinical guidelines for diagnosis, assessment and management of SRC. In addition to a growing need for knowledgeable healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based care for athletes with SRC, media attention and legislation have created awareness and, in some cases, fear about many issues and unknowns surrounding SRC. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) formed a writing group to review the existing literature on SRC, update its previous position statement, and to address current evidence and knowledge gaps regarding SRC. The absence of definitive outcomes-based data is challenging and requires relying on the best available evidence integrated with clinical experience and patient values. This statement reviews the definition, pathophysiology and epidemiology of SRC, the diagnosis and management of both acute and persistent concussion symptoms, the short-term and long-term risks of SRC and repetitive head impact exposure, SRC prevention strategies, and potential future directions for SRC research. The AMSSM is committed to best clinical practices, evidence-based research and educational initiatives that positively impact the health and safety of athletes.

### Managing sports-related concussions from time of injury through return to play [^111Tb6NU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions continue to generate widespread interest. A concussion is a complex pathophysiologic process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include age < 18 years, female sex, and history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist diagnosis. Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest. A stepwise return-to-play protocol, taking into consideration state laws, with a gradual increase in activity until the athlete is able to perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a tool in management. For prolonged concussion, physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbance may be required. Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention. The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.

### Sport-related concussion [^115FnDqy]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents. Athletes seldom report concussive symptoms, which makes the diagnosis a challenge. The management of sport-related concussion has changed significantly over the last several years. The previously used grading systems and return-to-play guidelines have been abandoned in favor of more individualized assessment and management. Neuropsychological testing is being used more frequently to assist in management. After recovery, it is recommended that an athlete's return-to-play progress in a gradual, stepwise fashion while being monitored by a health care provider. Proper assessment and management of a sport-related concussion is crucial, because repeat concussions can result in decreased neurocognitive functioning, increased symptomatology, and, at times, catastrophic outcomes.

### Considerations for diagnosis and management of concussion [^11687uGt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

Concussion is an ongoing concern for health care providers. The incidence rates continue to be high and the rate of recovery is variable due to potential risk factors. With no valid biomarkers, diagnosis and assessment of concussion remain a clinical challenge. The heterogeneity in presentation following injury provides an additional level of complexity, requiring the screening and evaluation of diverse body systems, including oculomotor, vestibular, autonomic, psychiatric, cervical, and cognitive symptoms. While a few tools, such as the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening and Balance Error Scoring System, have been developed specifically for concussion, the vast majority of tests are adapted from other conditions. Further complicating the process is the overlapping and interactive nature of the multiple domains of postconcussion presentation. This commentary illustrates how clinicians can conceptualize the multiple profiles that present following concussion and describes tools that are available to assist with screening and evaluation of each area. The multifaceted nature of concussion warrants broad clinical screening skills and an interdisciplinary approach to management.

### Concussion management in combat sports: consensus statement from the association of ringside physicians [^112b68VB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Current practices in non-combat sports

In non-combat sports, it is universally agreed that, if an athlete is suspected to have suffered a concussion, he or she must be immediately removed from play and evaluated. If a concussion is diagnosed, he or she must not be allowed to return to sport (RTS) on the day of injury. The most recent consensus statement also recommends that athletes with a suspected concussion have a thorough evaluation, performed in a distraction free environment (eg, locker room and training room) rather than on the sideline. Most professional non-combat sports organisations have developed specific protocols for evaluating head injuries during a game. The overwhelming majority of non-combat sports organisations also require athletes who have sustained a concussion to go through an RTS protocol that consists of a gradual, stepwise increase in physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. Many non-combat sports organisations also require medical clearance by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussion prior to full RTS without any restriction. In some cases of professional athletics, an 'unaffiliated physician' who practices independently of the team decides final clearance to RTS.

All consensus statements agree that when an athlete sustains a concussion, an initial cognitive and physical rest period is needed prior to beginning an RTS protocol. However, what is not currently agreed on is the amount or duration of rest needed. Some statements recommend not beginning an RTS progression until the athlete no longer reports any concussion-related symptoms. Other publications recognise that (1) the current published evidence evaluating the effect of rest following a sports-related concussion is sparse and (2) light exercise may promote recovery after an initial period of rest. A 2016 publication that summarised a meeting of 37 concussion experts stated that, 'strict rest is contraindicated (after concussion) and may exacerbate the effects of (the) injury'. This same publication also summarised that concussion symptoms and impairments are treatable and that concussions in which symptoms last a prolonged period of time be managed by a multidisciplinary team with active rehabilitation depending on the individual's clinical profile. The most recent consensus statement recommends that there should be 'a brief period of rest during the acute phase (24–48 hours) after injury, patients can then be encouraged to become gradually and progressively more active while staying below their cognitive and physical symptom-exacerbation thresholds (eg, activity level should not bring on or worsen their symptoms)'.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^115rBLxs]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We propose that the term concussion should be retired because it has no clear and consistently understood definition, leads to diagnostic confusion and can limit the use of effective treatments of post-traumatic problems. Instead, neurologists should adopt a single classification system for all TBI based on injury severity and attempt a precise diagnosis of post-traumatic problems. It is important to recognise that mild TBI is not always a benign condition, and patients sometimes fail to recover from what may appear to be innocuous injuries. It is difficult to predict clinical outcome and interventions can reduce the burden of disability after TBI. Therefore, neurologists should review more patients with TBI and intervene more actively.

### Sports-related concussions [^115XD8ZS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

During the past decade, awareness of concussions has exploded as both the media and the medical literature have given more focus to this common problem. Concussions after recreational activities, especially athletics, are a frequent complaint in the emergency department. In the past few years, care of these patients has been simplified as grading systems and classifications have been abandoned. However, questions remain as to the best way to rehabilitate these patients to avoid long-term sequelae, especially in children and adolescents. The purpose of this review is to discuss the demographic characteristics, the pathophysiology, definition, clinical characteristics, and management of concussions in children and adolescents.

### Legal and ethical implications in the evaluation and management of sports-related concussion [^112Tkihc]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Beneficence and nonmaleficence in concussion management — physicians should balance short- and long-term risks, noting that while the long-term effects from a single concussion are unclear, repetitive head injuries have been associated with chronic neurocognitive deficits, neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and neurobehavioral impairments. Younger athletes are at an increased risk for more severe symptoms, cognitive deficits, and a prolonged recovery, and the probability of harmful short- and long-term sequelae likely increases with the number of concussions; providers should explore factors motivating return to play despite acknowledgment of risks, and restricting premature return, including after multiple concussions, is grounded in commitment to beneficence, recognizing that beneficence may occasionally supersede patient autonomy.

### The acute management of sport concussion in pediatric athletes [^114JnqtH]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

During the past two decades the focus on sport concussion has increased significantly. Young athletes represent the most vulnerable population to sustain a sport concussion yet receive the least amount of attention. Specifically, young athletes who sustain a sport concussion can go unrecognized and continue to participate in sport putting them at an increased risk for a more significant injury. The purpose of this review is to provide a clinical framework for the evaluation and management of sport concussion. In addition, this review provides considerations for health care professionals in regard to clinical measures and follow-up strategies during the acute phase following concussion in young concussed athletes following injury.

- reinforce strategies of cognitive and physical activity pacing and fragmentation across the day to help achieve more without exceeding tolerance levels

- encourage good sleep hygiene, especially regularity of sleep-wake schedule and avoidance of stimulants and alcohol, and proper relaxation times

- use a notebook or a diary to plan meaningful goals, record activity achievement, and identify fatigue patterns

- acknowledge that fatigue can be exacerbated by low mood or stress

- provide patients with a pamphlet containing advice on coping strategies for fatigue.

### Challenges in determining the role of rest and exercise in the management of mild traumatic brain injury [^113qqQ4b]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Current consensus guidelines recommending physical and cognitive rest until a patient is asymptomatic after a sports concussion (ie, a mild traumatic brain injury) are being called into question, particularly for patients who are slower to recover and in light of preclinical and clinical research demonstrating that exercise aids neurorehabilitation. The pathophysiological response to mild traumatic brain injury includes a complex neurometabolic cascade of events resulting in a neurologic energy deficit. It has been proposed that this energy deficit leads to a period of vulnerability during which the brain is at risk for additional injury, explains why early postconcussive symptoms are exacerbated by cognitive and physical exertion, and is used to rationalize absolute rest until all symptoms have resolved. However, at some point, rest might no longer be beneficial and exercise might need to be introduced. At both extremes, excessive exertion and prolonged avoidance of exercise (physical and mental) have negative consequences. Individuals who have experienced a concussion need guidance for avoidance of triggers of severe symptoms and a plan for graduated exercise to promote recovery as well as optimal functioning (physical, educational, and social) during the postconcussion period.

Concussion physical therapy evaluation and screening — post-concussive patients: For patients who have experienced a concussive event and report or demonstrate signs and symptoms consistent with a concussion diagnosis, physical therapists should determine whether a comprehensive physical therapy evaluation is appropriate using information from a comprehensive intake interview and clinical judgment. Physical therapists should screen patients who have experienced a concussive event for mental health, cognitive impairment, and other potential coinciding diagnoses and refer for additional evaluation and services as indicated. For patients not deemed appropriate for a comprehensive physical therapy examination (ie, they present with severe mental health concerns or health conditions that require medical clearance prior to comprehensive physical examination), physical therapists should provide education regarding concussion symptoms, prognosis, and self-management strategies and refer for consultation with other health care providers as indicated.

### Use of the progressive return to activity guidelines may expedite symptom resolution after concussion for active duty military [^111Wxxf3]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical recommendations for concussion management encourage reduced cognitive and physical activities immediately after injury, with graded increases in activity as symptoms resolve. Empirical support for the effectiveness of such recommendations is needed.

Purpose

To examine whether training medical providers on the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center's Progressive Return to Activity Clinical Recommendation (PRA-CR) for acute concussion improves patient outcomes.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

This study was conducted from 2016 to 2018 and compared patient outcomes before and after medical providers received an educational intervention (ie, provider training). Patients, recruited either before or after intervention, were assessed at ≤ 72 hours, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after a concussion. The participant population included 38 military medical providers and 106 military servicemembers with a diagnosed concussion and treated by one of the military medical providers: 58 patient participants received care before the intervention (ie, provider training) and 48 received care after intervention. The primary outcome measure was the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory.

Results

The patients seen before and after the intervention were predominantly male (89.7% and 93.8%, respectively) of military age (mean ± SD, 26.62 ± 6.29 years and 25.08 ± 6.85 years, respectively) and a mean ± SD of 1.92 ± 0.88 days from injury. Compared with patients receiving care before intervention, patients receiving care after intervention had smaller increases in physical activities (difference in mean change; 95% CI, 0.39 to 6.79) and vestibular/balance activities (95% CI, 0.79 to 7.5) during the first week of recovery. Although groups did not differ in symptoms at ≤ 72 hours of injury (d = 0.22; 95% CI, -2.21 to 8.07), the postintervention group reported fewer symptoms at 1 week (d = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52 to 10.92). Postintervention patients who completed the 6-month study had improved recovery both at 1 month (d = 1.55; 95% CI, 5.33 to 15.39) and 3 months after injury (d = 1.10; 95% CI, 2.36 to 11.55), but not at 6 months (d = 0.35; 95% CI, 5.34 to 7.59).

Conclusion

Training medical providers on the PRA-CR for management of concussion resulted in expedited recovery of patients.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^114pmYbx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guidelines — screening and diagnosis state that physical therapists must screen all individuals who have experienced a potential concussive event and document the presence or absence of symptoms, impairments, and functional limitations that may relate to a concussive event. Physical therapists must screen patients who have experienced a recent potential concussive event for signs of medical emergency or severe pathology that warrant further evaluation by other health care providers, and referral for further evaluation should be made as indicated. Physical therapists must evaluate for potential signs and symptoms of an undiagnosed concussion in patients who have experienced a concussive event but have not been diagnosed with concussion, and evaluation should include triangulation of information from patient/family/witness reports, the patient's medical history, physical observation/examination, and the use of an age-appropriate symptom scale/checklist. For patients who have experienced a concussive event and do not report or demonstrate signs and symptoms consistent with a concussion diagnosis, physical therapists should evaluate for other potential diagnoses and follow standard-of-care procedures in accordance with their findings. For patients who have experienced a concussive event and report or demonstrate signs and symptoms consistent with a concussion diagnosis, physical therapists should determine whether a comprehensive physical therapy evaluation is appropriate using information from a comprehensive intake interview and clinical judgment. Physical therapists should screen patients who have experienced a concussive event for mental health, cognitive impairment, and other potential coinciding diagnoses and refer for additional evaluation and services as indicated. For patients not deemed appropriate for a comprehensive physical therapy examination, physical therapists should provide education regarding concussion symptoms, prognosis, and self-management strategies and refer for consultation with other health care providers as indicated.

Legal and ethical implications in sports-related concussion — scope and physician duties are outlined as follows: This position paper reviews and compares the components of sports-related concussion laws, including education, removal from play, and clearance for return to play, and it highlights the challenges privacy laws present while proposing an ethical framework encompassing professionalism, informed decision-making, patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, conflicts of interest, and distributive justice. Physicians caring for concussed athletes have an ethical obligation to ensure that their primary responsibility is to safeguard the current and future physical and mental health of their patients, and physicians have a duty to provide athletes and their parents with information about concussion risk factors, symptoms, and the risks for postconcussion neurologic impairments. Physicians should facilitate informed and shared decision-making among athletes, parents, and medical teams while protecting athletes from potential harm, and including concussion evaluation and management training in neurology residency programs, as well as developing a national concussion registry, is stated to benefit patients by supporting policy and clinical guideline development.

### Establishing a clinical service for the management of sports-related concussions [^111qVEvw]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical management of sports-related concussions is a specialized area of interest with a lack of empirical findings regarding best practice approaches. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Concussion Program was the first of its kind; 13 years after its inception, it remains a leader in the clinical management and research of sports-related concussions. This article outlines the essential components of a successful clinical service for the management of sports-related concussions, using the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Concussion Program as a case example. Drawing on both empirical evidence and anecdotal conclusions from this high-volume clinical practice, this article provides a detailed account of the inner workings of a multidisciplinary concussion clinic with a comprehensive approach to the management of sports-related concussions. A detailed description of the evaluation process and an in-depth analysis of targeted clinical pathways and subtypes of sports-related concussions effectively set the stage for a comprehensive understanding of the assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation model used in Pittsburgh today.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^117GBErY]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guidelines — communication and education: Evidence from high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) state that most people recover well and typically do not have significant difficulties that last more than 1 to 3 months post injury. High-quality CPGs based on moderate-level evidence indicate that after an initial period of rest for the first 24 to 48 hours, patients with concussion should be encouraged to avoid activities that have a high risk for another concussion but gradually resume normal activity, based on their tolerance. Physical therapists must educate patients who have experienced a concussive event about self-management of symptoms, the importance of relative rest (rest as needed) instead of strict rest, the benefits of progressive re-engagement in activities, the importance of sleep, safe return-to-activity pacing strategies, and potential signs and symptoms of the need for follow-up care with a physician, physical therapist, or other health care providers, and must educate patients and their families/caregivers about symptoms and functional limitations associated with concussion and stress that most patients with concussion recover relatively quickly.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^111EVnDz]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guidance — recovery patterns and the role of physical therapy — notes that many individuals recover within a relatively short period (approximately 7–14 days post injury), yet studies have demonstrated that as many as 5% to 58% of individuals who sustain a concussion have persistent symptoms, impairments, and/or limitations, and the timing of these complaints ranges from a few days to a few weeks or longer. Although it is often reported that symptoms, impairments, and functional limitations follow a gradual pattern of improvement, the trajectory may not be linear, and many patients experience symptom exacerbations during their recovery period; in some cases, these exacerbations may be an immediate reaction to a specific mechanism or a delayed reaction associated with activities over the preceding 24-hour period or longer. Some studies suggest a second injury may worsen neurocognitive function and recovery time and put individuals at risk for additional injuries or more chronic/long-term sequelae. Since approximately 2007, clinical commentaries and studies have supported postconcussion assessment, management, and skilled rehabilitation techniques that fall within physical therapists' scope of practice, and systematic reviews support active rehabilitation strategies for concussions under the direction of a physical therapist as a promising management approach for facilitating recovery; despite this growing body of evidence, additional research is needed to provide more specific insight into factors that affect patient responsiveness and to investigate optimal approaches to physical therapy delivery, timing, and dose.

### American Academy of Pediatrics. clinical report – sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^112S7h94]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a "hot topic" in the media and in medicine. It is a common injury that is likely underreported by pediatric and adolescent athletes. Football has the highest incidence of concussion, but girls have higher concussion rates than boys do in similar sports. A clear understanding of the definition, signs, and symptoms of concussion is necessary to recognize it and rule out more severe intracranial injury. Concussion can cause symptoms that interfere with school, social and family relationships, and participation in sports. Recognition and education are paramount, because although proper equipment, sport technique, and adherence to rules of the sport may decrease the incidence or severity of concussions, nothing has been shown to prevent them. Appropriate management is essential for reducing the risk of long-term symptoms and complications. Cognitive and physical rest is the mainstay of management after diagnosis, and neuropsychological testing is a helpful tool in the management of concussion. Return to sport should be accomplished by using a progressive exercise program while evaluating for any return of signs or symptoms. This report serves as a basis for understanding the diagnosis and management of concussion in children and adolescent athletes.

For patients beyond the immediate injury period, the guideline uses "patients with symptoms attributed to mTBI", "patients with a history of mTBI", or "patients with a history of concussion", and the phrase "patients with mTBI" is discouraged. Post-injury timeframes are defined as acute 0–7 days post-injury, post-acute 1–12 weeks post-injury, and chronic > 12 weeks post-injury. When communicating with patients, the terms "concussion" or "history of mTBI" are preferred, and providers should avoid using the terms "brain damage" or "brain injury".

Setting of care for post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) — We suggest a primary care (as opposed to specialty care), symptom-focused approach in the evaluation and management of the majority of patients with symptoms attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended). The Work Group determined that evaluation and management of the majority of patients with symptoms attributed to mTBI should be driven by primary care and stated that the benefits of this approach outweigh the harms and burdens. A primary care model is preferred when developing a comprehensive and personalized treatment plan, and building a solid therapeutic patient-provider alliance is essential. Providers should acknowledge symptoms and reinforce normalcy and wellness rather than impairment and self-labeling. Regularly scheduled primary care appointments with the same team providing longitudinal care are advised rather than as-needed appointments, and PCPs should protect patients from unnecessary tests or consultations that could put them at risk or lead to more negative illness expectations. Specialty consultation is appropriate if clinically indicated but should be conducted prudently and judiciously. The page notes that symptoms attributed to mTBI are nonspecific and that there is currently insufficient evidence regarding the long-term sequelae of concussive events.

### Concussion in combination with whiplash-associated disorder may Be missed in primary care: key recommendations for assessment and management [^1147XNGn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

Whiplash and concussion may have similar presenting symptoms, biomechanical mechanisms, and neurophysiological sequelae, but neither enjoys a gold standard diagnostic test. Guidelines for whiplash and concussion are developed and implemented separately. This disparate process may contribute to misdiagnosis, delay appropriate primary care management, and impair patient outcomes. In our clinical commentary, we present 3 cases where signs and symptoms consistent with whiplash were identified in primary care. Symptoms in all cases included neck pain, headache, dizziness, and concentration deficits, raising suspicion of coexisting postconcussion syndrome. All cases were referred for specialist physical therapy. Characteristics consistent with poor recovery in both whiplash and postconcussion syndrome were confirmed, and multidisciplinary management, drawing from both whiplash and concussion guidelines, was implemented. All patients reported improvement in activities of daily living after tailored management addressing both neck and head injury-related factors, suggesting that these conditions were not mutually exclusive. Self-reported outcomes included reductions in neck disability and postconcussion symptoms of between 20% and 40%. It may be appropriate for whiplash and concussion guidelines to be amalgamated, enhanced, and mutually recognized on a patient-by-patient basis. Primary health care professionals might consider minimum screening to identify postconcussion syndrome in patients following motor vehicle collision by administering questionnaires and assessing cranial nerve function, balance, and cognition. Management should then incorporate principles from both whiplash and concussion guidelines and harmonize with available imaging guidelines for suspected spine and head trauma.

### Legal and ethical implications in the evaluation and management of sports-related concussion [^114twbsE]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Sports-related concussion — informed decision-making and duty to educate: Respect for autonomy emphasizes the importance of allowing patients and parents to participate in making medical decisions, including decisions about returning to play, and the right to refuse recommended treatment, and all physicians have an ethical duty to educate their athlete–patients and the patients' parents about concussion. Specifically, physicians have a duty to inform them in understandable language about the evidence for potential short- and long-term neurocognitive and neurobehavioral risks associated with single and multiple concussions as well as subclinical concussion manifestations, and this duty to educate is independent of whether an athlete has previously had a concussion. Physicians may choose to discuss data that demonstrate reduced learning and memory performance after playing contact sports — effects thought to be secondary to the accumulation of multiple subconcussive head impacts — even when overt concussions are not reported, and effective concussion education exists in multiple forms, including videos, Web sites, lectures, and handouts; as a result of concussion laws, many schools and physicians now require athletes and parents to sign paperwork affirming that they understand the risks of concussion before the athlete participates in a sport.

### Legal and ethical implications in the evaluation and management of sports-related concussion [^112gahYt]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Conflicts of interest in sports-related concussion care — physician reimbursement should be solely derived from patient evaluation, management, and counseling activities, and physicians and other members of concussion management teams should disclose all financial arrangements that could influence patient care decisions to athletes and parents, including contractual relationships, involvement in diagnostic or protective equipment development, and paid sponsorships; physicians who could benefit financially should disclose these potential conflicts and must ensure their primary duty is to the health of the athletes. Physicians employed by athletic teams may face pressure to prematurely clear athletes to return to play, and it is of paramount importance to affirm that their primary responsibility is to protect patient health and well-being regardless of financial interests or employment considerations; failure to prioritize patient well-being represents a breach of ethical and professional conduct and could result in termination of AAN membership, which is reportable to the National Practitioner DataBank.

### Revisiting the modifiers: how should the evaluation and management of acute concussions differ in specific groups? [^116AxGXy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

One of the key difficulties while managing concussion in sport is that there are few prognostic factors to reliably predict clinical outcome. The aims of the current paper are to review the evidence for concussion modifiers and to consider how the evaluation and management of concussion may differ in specific groups.

Methods

A qualitative review of the literature on concussion was conducted with a focus on prognostic factors and specific groups including children, female athletes and elite versus non-elite players. PubMed, MEDLINE and SportsDiscus databases were reviewed.

Results

The literature demonstrates that number and severity of symptoms and previous concussions are associated with prolonged recovery and/or increased risk of complications. Brief loss of consciousness (LOC) and/or impact seizures do not reliably predict outcomes following a concussion, although a cautious approach should be adopted in an athlete with prolonged LOC or impact seizures (ie, > 1 min). Children generally take longer to recover from concussions and assessment batteries have yet to be validated in the younger age group. Currently, there are insufficient data on the influence of genetics and gender on outcomes following a concussion.

Conclusions

Several modifiers are associated with prolonged recovery or increased risk of complications following a concussion and have important implications for management. Children with concussion should be managed conservatively, with an emphasis on return to learn as well as return to sport. In cases of concussions managed with limited resources (eg, non-elite players), a conservative approach should also be taken. There should be an emphasis on concussion education in all sports and at all levels, particularly in junior and community-based competitions.

There are several organizations that have published statements related to concussion management especially as it relates to cognitive rest. A review of these statements reveals that this issue is more complicated than proposed. Further research is needed to establish (1) the type and severity of concussion symptoms that may benefit from cognitive rest, if any, and the (2) type, degree, and duration of cognitive rest. Parents need to be counseled that definitive recommendations about cognitive rest are not currently based on sufficient research to make specific recommendations for every child with a concussion. This issue has important clinical and medicolegal ramifications to practitioners.

### Concussion basics | HEADS UP… [^115jnVvi]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury.
- The effects of a concussion can be serious.
- A child with a concussion needs to be seen by a health care provider. Concussions should be taken seriously because they can produce changes in your child's brain, body, and behavior. Most children with a concussion feel better within 2 to 4 weeks. However, some children have symptoms that effect their behavior, mood, memory, or emotions for months or longer. Symptoms that stay around can affect children as they grow up and even through adulthood. Concussion symptoms can make it hard to do regular activities at home and school. Having a history of previous concussions or experiencing more severe symptoms right after the concussion increases the chance that a child will have a longer recovery. A child with multiple concussions also has a greater chance of experiencing chronic health problems later on.

Get medical care for a concussion You might feel anxious, afraid, or uncertain if you think your child may have experienced a concussion. These feelings are normal. You can play an active role in your child's recovery by getting them checked by a health care provider. Health care providers have treatments to help. And getting care from a health care provider can help speed your child's recovery. Learn more about what do if you think your child has a concussion. See the Where to Get Help webpage if you need help finding a health care provider. Try to avoid repeat head impacts and concussions Exposure to repeated head impacts increases the chance for concussions and other TBIs, as well as the potential for changes in the brain and brain diseases. There's a bigger risk of more serious and longer-lasting symptoms when a child has multiple concussions. This is especially true when there's not enough healing time between injuries.

A child with a history of multiple concussions also may have:

- Ongoing problems with concentration, memory, headache. Physical problems, such as keeping their balance. A greater risk for mental health problems and other chronic health conditions. What you can do There are several things you can do to help prevent concussions.
- Explore concussion signs and symptoms and know what to watch for if your child experiences a bump, blow, or jolt to the head.
- Learn more about what to do after a concussion, including instructions and recovery tips.
- Get information on moderate or severe brain injury that may lead to long-term or life-long health problems.
