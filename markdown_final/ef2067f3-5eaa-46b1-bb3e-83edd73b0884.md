## Question

Differential diagnosis of glans penis swelling in a 2 year old with mild overlying erythema of foreskin, uncircumcised, sudden onset, painful but no fever, foreskin is not retracted

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of sudden, painful glans swelling in a 2-year-old uncircumcised boy with mild foreskin erythema, no fever, and the foreskin currently not retracted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate emergencies such as paraphimosis and ischemia. Then, I should verify whether a non-retractable foreskin at age 2 is physiologic versus pathologic. Next, I will consider the most likely local inflammatory causes (balanitis or balanoposthitis) and their initial management. After that, I need to plan follow-up, including when to use topical corticosteroids for symptomatic primary phimosis and when to refer for urology evaluation or consider circumcision. Finally, I should counsel on hygiene and retraction practices and set thresholds for re-evaluation and escalation of care.

> Let me first confirm foreskin physiology at this age. At 2 years old, a non-retractable foreskin is commonly physiologic (primary phimosis), reflecting normal adhesions and a narrow preputial ring, and it should not be forcibly retracted; I should double-check that recommendation about avoiding forced retraction, particularly in asymptomatic adhesions, to prevent fissuring and secondary scarring that could convert physiologic to pathologic phimosis [^113D73h4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could this be paraphimosis? Wait, paraphimosis requires the foreskin to be retracted behind the corona and trapped as a tight constricting band; in this case the foreskin is non-retractable, which actually argues against paraphimosis. Still, I need to check the exam carefully for a proximal constricting ring, distal edema, color change, or ischemia; if present, urgent manual reduction with edema compression is indicated, with options such as hyaluronidase infiltration or 20% mannitol for difficult reductions, and circumcision either immediately or later depending on findings [^113qcsY3] [^112hqpPB] [^115tV5h1].

> Given the sudden onset of pain and glans swelling without fever, the leading consideration is acute balanitis or balanoposthitis in an uncircumcised toddler, often triggered by irritants, minor trauma, or Candida overgrowth in a moist occluded environment; I should confirm that candidal and nonspecific inflammatory balanitis are common and that management is largely topical and supportive in the absence of systemic illness [^notfound] [^116zm1gg] [^116zm1gg].

> I will now examine management for mild, afebrile presentations. Gentle hygiene with warm saline or sitz soaks, avoidance of soaps and wipes on the glans, and analgesia are first steps; if the surface appears erythematous and glazed with satellite pustules suggesting Candida, I should consider a topical imidazole such as clotrimazole 1% twice daily until resolution, adding 1% hydrocortisone if inflammation is marked to reduce pain and swelling, while monitoring closely; if impetiginization or clear bacterial crusting is suspected, a short course of topical mupirocin may be reasonable, and I should obtain cultures if purulence is present to guide therapy [^113gN5in] [^116iVihC] [^114LaCis].

> Hmm, wait a minute — should I start oral antibiotics now? With no fever and only mild erythema, I should hold off on empiric systemic antibiotics, but I need to ensure prompt reassessment if pain, fever, spreading erythema, or urinary obstruction develops; if systemic bacterial infection is suspected or if there is poor response to topical care, a clinician may select an appropriate pediatric regimen guided by local patterns, recognizing that adult references list amoxicillin-clavulanate for anaerobe-associated balanitis but pediatric dosing must be calculated carefully and is not directly transferrable from adult labels [^1155HJSV] [^113gN5in].

> Let me think about foreskin management during the acute episode. I should confirm that I will not attempt forcible retraction in the inflamed phase, as this risks fissuring, bleeding, and secondary scarring; gentle partial traction only to the point of comfort for cleansing is acceptable, with retraction deferred until inflammation resolves and only as it becomes naturally more mobile over time [^113D73h4] [^113D73h4].

> Next, I should review what to do if this child has persistent symptomatic tightness or recurrent inflammatory episodes after recovery. For symptomatic primary phimosis starting at this age, topical corticosteroids to the phimotic ring (for example 0.05–0.1% class II–III) applied twice daily for 4–8 weeks with gentle stretching can increase retractability and reduce recurrence risk; I should double-check the evidence base, which includes EAU pediatric guidance and a contemporary Cochrane review showing benefit over placebo or no treatment, with good safety when used as directed [^115KEo1D] [^113qtdfR] [^112tTtbJ] [^115hyFPE] [^112Zn6Ai].

> But wait, what if this is not primary phimosis — how do I ensure we are not missing lichen sclerosus or scarred phimosis? I need to check for chronicity, pallor, atrophic or sclerotic white plaques, fissuring, meatal narrowing, or secondary scarring; although lichen sclerosus peaks later in childhood, it can cause secondary phimosis and may necessitate circumcision if scarring is present or if steroid therapy fails, with histopathology of the foreskin recommended in suspected cases and referral to urology if LS is considered [^111PwLQH] [^114SqQXY] [^1144BgGe] [^113qGTiM].

> I will now outline when to refer or escalate. I should confirm referral to pediatric urology for any suspicion of paraphimosis, urinary retention, severe or recurrent balanoposthitis, failure of medical therapy for symptomatic primary phimosis, suspected lichen sclerosus or scarred phimosis, or recurrent UTIs with urinary tract abnormalities; circumcision is reasonable for primary phimosis not responding to medical therapy or in LS/scarred phimosis, but I should also remember not to offer circumcision without a medical reason and to individualize decisions with the family [^112s6YnA] [^114SqQXY] [^113QosLd].

> Finally, I need to ensure caregiver counseling. I should double-check that I clearly advise against forced foreskin retraction, teach gentle cleansing with water only, explain signs that warrant urgent care (worsening swelling, dusky discoloration suggesting ischemia, inability to void, fever, spreading erythema), and set a short follow-up window (24–72 hours) to verify improvement; after resolution, if symptoms recur, I should reconsider cultures, dermatologic differentials, and the role of a steroid protocol to the phimotic ring to prevent future episodes [^113D73h4] [^113gN5in] [^112tTtbJ].

The most likely diagnosis is **balanoposthitis** (inflammation of the glans and foreskin) due to poor hygiene, smegma accumulation, or irritants, given the acute onset, pain, erythema, and swelling in an uncircumcised toddler with a non-retractile foreskin. **Paraphimosis** is unlikely because the foreskin is not retracted [^113qcsY3], and balanitis xerotica obliterans is rare at this age and typically chronic [^1118Gg9j]. Candidal balanitis is less likely without diabetes or immunosuppression, and trauma or insect bite should be considered if there is a clear history. For **management**, care is conservative, with gentle hygiene, warm soaks, and topical antibiotics or antifungals if discharge or exudate is present; urgent urology referral is needed if paraphimosis develops or symptoms worsen [^116j623m].

---

## Infectious causes

- **Bacterial balanoposthitis**: Common in uncircumcised toddlers due to poor hygiene, smegma, or irritants [^114Cx7H6]; presents with acute pain, erythema, swelling, and sometimes discharge or odor.

- **Candidal balanitis**: Less common in healthy toddlers [^111Wp1KV]; consider with diabetes, immunosuppression, or recent antibiotics; presents with erythema, swelling, and whitish discharge.

- **Herpetic balanitis**: Rare in this age group; typically presents with vesicles or ulcers and systemic symptoms.

---

## Inflammatory conditions

**Irritant dermatitis** is common due to soaps, detergents, or diapers and presents with erythema, swelling, and discomfort, whereas **allergic contact dermatitis** is less common and should be considered when new topical products or medications have been introduced [^1165Z5gJ].

---

## Anatomical abnormalities

**Phimosis** is physiological at this age and can cause swelling and erythema if inflamed or infected, whereas **paraphimosis** is unlikely here because the foreskin is not retracted; when present, it causes severe pain and swelling with a constricting band behind the glans [^114JQ13D].

---

## Traumatic causes

**Mechanical trauma** from manipulation, masturbation, or accidental injury presents with acute pain, swelling, and erythema. **Insect bites or stings** cause localized swelling, erythema, and pain, particularly after outdoor exposure.

---

## Rare conditions

**Balanitis xerotica obliterans (lichen sclerosus)** is chronic, progressive, and rare in toddlers, presenting with white plaques, scarring, and chronic inflammation [^1118Gg9j]. **Plasma cell balanitis (Zoon's balanitis)** is rare in children and appears as chronic, painless erythematous plaques on the glans [^114wSMvk].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

- **History**: Onset, duration, hygiene, irritants, trauma, insect bites, systemic symptoms, and medical history.

- **Physical examination**: Inspect for erythema, swelling, discharge, vesicles, ulcers, or constricting bands; assess foreskin retractability.

- **Laboratory tests**: Usually not needed; consider swab culture if discharge or exudate is present.

- **Imaging**: Not indicated unless abscess or deep infection is suspected.

---

## Management strategies

Management is **stepwise**, starting with conservative measures such as gentle hygiene, warm saline soaks, and topical antibiotics or antifungals if discharge or exudate is present. Medical therapy includes topical corticosteroids for inflammatory conditions [^112tTtbJ] and oral antibiotics for severe bacterial infections. Surgical intervention is rarely required, but it may involve circumcision or a dorsal slit for recurrent or severe cases [^112s6YnA].

---

## Indications for urgent referral

- **Paraphimosis**: Urologic emergency requiring immediate reduction [^114JQ13D] [^113qcsY3].

- **Severe infection**: Rapidly progressing swelling, systemic symptoms, or suspected deep infection.

- **Failure of conservative management**: Persistent or recurrent symptoms despite appropriate treatment [^112s6YnA].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **balanoposthitis** due to poor hygiene, smegma, or irritants. Management is conservative with hygiene, warm soaks, and topical antibiotics or antifungals if discharge or exudate is present. Urgent referral is needed if paraphimosis develops or symptoms worsen [^113qcsY3].

### Balanitis xerotica obliterans in boys [^1118Gg9j]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic dermatitis of unknown etiology most often involving the glans and prepuce but sometimes extending into the urethra. We report our 10-year experience with BXO in pediatric patients.

- **Materials and methods**: Our pathology database was queried for all tissue diagnoses of BXO from 1992 to 2002. Available charts were reviewed, and patient presentation, clinical and referral history, operative procedure(s), and postoperative course were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 41 patients had a tissue-confirmed diagnosis of BXO. The median patient age was 10.6 years. Of the patients, 85% were 8 to 13 years old, and all had referrals available for review. The most common referral diagnoses were phimosis (52%), balanitis (13%), and buried penis (10%). No patient had the diagnosis of BXO at referral. Of the patients, 19 (46%) underwent curative circumcision or redo circumcision and had no recurrence at a mean follow-up of 12.5 months (range 1 to 57). A total of 11 patients (27%) had BXO involvement of the meatus and underwent circumcision combined with meatotomy or meatoplasty. Nine patients (22%) required extensive plastic operation(s) of the penis, including buccal mucosa grafts in 2.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of BXO in pediatric patients may be higher than previously reported, with the diagnosis rarely made by pediatricians. Our study demonstrates that older patients, those with BXO involvement of the meatus, and those with a history of surgery for BXO tend to have a more severe and morbid clinical course.

### A 'snip' in time: What is the best age to circumcise [^114Cx7H6]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Infant male circumcision (MC) provides immediate protection against inflammatory penile skin conditions such as balanitis, posthitis, and balanoposthitis, which are often caused by Candida spp. Balanitis affected 5.9% of uncircumcised boys in one study and 14% in another. Among male dermatology patients, 13% of the uncircumcised had balanitis compared to 2.3% of the circumcised. After reviewing relevant studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the level of protection against balanitis, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 0.32 (95% CI 0.20–0.52).

Balanoposthitis was responsible for 26% of cases of acquired phimosis, a condition where the foreskin orifice is so narrow that the foreskin cannot be retracted. Lichen sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis resulting in white plaques and epidermal atrophy, is prevalent in uncircumcised males. It occurs in 35% to 55% of uncircumcised men with type 2 diabetes, peaking in the 30s. Although MC is the most effective cure, it is preferable to prevent it through infant MC. Delaying circumcision results in increased exposure of males to the risk of penile inflammation.

### Zoon balanitis revisited: Report of balanitis circumscripta plasmacellularis resolving with topical mupirocin ointment monotherapy [^111pUmKZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Zoon balanitis is an idiopathic, benign inflammatory condition of the glans penis and prepuce. A patient with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of Zoon balanitis who was successfully treated with topical mupirocin ointment monotherapy is described.

- **Method**: A search using the PubMed database was performed using the following terms: Zoon balanitis (cases, diagnosis, treatment of), balanitis circumscripta plasmacellularis, and mupirocin. Relevant papers and their reference citations were reviewed and evaluated.

- **Results**: The gold standard of treatment for Zoon balanitis has previously been circumcision. More recently, topical calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to be effective. Our patient had successful resolution of his Zoon balanitis after 3 months of mupirocin ointment monotherapy. Zoon balanitis is a benign inflammatory dermatosis. Previous successful treatment modalities include circumcision, phototherapy, laser therapy, and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical mupirocin ointment twice daily resulted in the resolution of Zoon balanitis in our patient. Additional evaluation of mupirocin ointment as a therapeutic agent should be considered as a potential first-line therapy in patients with Zoon balanitis.

### Outpatient management of phimosis following newborn circumcision [^114kGZDm]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

We reviewed our experience in treating patients with a trapped penis due to phimosis following newborn circumcision. The outcome of treatment of this condition at the outpatient clinic was examined. Possible etiological factors leading to this complication were determined.

- **Methods**: A total of 521 pediatric patients underwent Gomco circumcision while under local anesthesia at our outpatient clinic between 1994 and 1999. Phimosis was noted in 15 patients (2.9%), and an additional 13 patients were referred to our clinic with phimosis after undergoing circumcision elsewhere. These 28 patients underwent treatment for the phimosis at the outpatient clinic. The phimotic ring was manually dilated with a fine hemostat. Careful traction with sterile gauze was then used to reduce the phimotic band below the glans penis. No evidence of glans ischemia was noted. Mild edema of the pericoronal skin collar was common. Cases referred after age 6 months or those weighing more than 14 pounds were treated as an elective outpatient surgical procedure.

- **Results**: Three patients had recurrence of the phimosis. These cases were managed with manual retraction of the prepuce at the clinic. At 1 month follow-up, 27 patients had resolution of the phimosis. One infant was lost to follow-up. Factors contributing to the development of phimosis after newborn circumcision were reviewed. Ten of the patients had obvious poor penile skin attachment with concealment of the penis even after resolution of the phimosis. Phimosis occurred more frequently in older patients undergoing circumcision; 15 patients were identified in this category.

### Association of a pediatric gynecology eLearning module with resident knowledge and clinical skills: A randomized controlled trial [^112fmKeM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

The objective was to assess whether a pediatric and adolescent gynecology electronic learning (eLearning) module improves knowledge and clinical performance among obstetrics and gynecology residents.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multi-institutional, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial across four university programs. Three programs included pediatric and adolescent gynecology rotations, and two had pediatric and adolescent gynecology fellowship-trained faculty. By applying permutated block randomization, residents were assigned either to no intervention or to complete a validated eLearning module on prepubertal bleeding. All residents subsequently undertook a pediatric and adolescent gynecology-related knowledge assessment addressing prepubertal bleeding. Additionally, an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) evaluated skills in history collection, performance of a prepubertal genital examination, vaginal culture, and vaginoscopy for a pediatric patient. OSCEs were videotaped and reviewed by two faculty members, blinded to the randomization group. The interrater reliability score was 97%. We calculated descriptive frequencies and compared randomization groups using chi-square analyses and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, along with median tests for continuous variables. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

- **Results**: From July 2018 to June 2019, we invited 115 residents to participate; 97 (83%) completed both the OSCE and follow-up knowledge assessments. Most participants were female (91%), and the majority reported limited pediatric and adolescent gynecology experience.

### Steglujan [^111joqPR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform male patients that yeast infections of the penis, such as balanitis or balanoposthitis, may occur, particularly in uncircumcised males. Provide them with information on the signs and symptoms of these conditions, including rash or redness of the glans or foreskin of the penis. Advise them on treatment options and when to seek medical advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Inform patients that allergic reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of sitagliptin, a component of Steglujan. If symptoms such as rash, hives, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty breathing or swallowing occur, instruct patients to stop taking Steglujan and seek medical advice promptly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Severe and disabling arthralgia**: Inform patients that severe and disabling joint pain may occur with this class of drugs. The onset of symptoms can range from one day to years. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if severe joint pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

- **Bullous pemphigoid**: Inform patients that bullous pemphigoid may occur with the DPP-4 class of drugs. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if blisters or erosions occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

- **Fetal toxicity**: Advise pregnant patients of the potential risk to a fetus with treatment with Steglujan. Instruct patients to immediately inform their healthcare provider if pregnant or planning to become pregnant.

### Balanitis associated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy [^114B2RZx]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A rare case of chemotherapy-associated balanitis and toxic erythema of chemotherapy (TEC) responding to topical steroid treatment is described. A review of the literature identified a single report of balanitis in the setting of 5-FU treatment. However, that report described erosive balanitis in a patient with stomatitis in the setting of mucositis, which commonly occurs with 5-FU treatment. In contrast, our report describes a patient with no erosions or stomatitis and an eruption extending beyond the glans penis. Individual cases of balanitis have also been reported in association with other chemotherapies, including bicalutamide, doxorubicin, methyl GAG (Methylglyoxal bis[guanylhydrazone], mitoguazone), cetuximab, and capecitabine, which are not applicable in this case.

TEC in association with 5-FU is well recognized to occur in approximately 15% to 34% of patients treated with continuous infusion of 5-FU. The pathogenesis of balanitis in this setting remains unclear but is likely related to the pathogenesis of acral erythema. Acral erythema is thought to occur from the direct toxic effect of the chemotherapeutic agent on eccrine glands. In this case, balanitis occurred 7 days after cycle 2 of FOLFIRI therapy. It is important to recognize and manage balanitis in a timely manner to minimize impact on quality of life and determine whether dose modification of chemotherapy is indicated. Chemotherapy-associated balanitis requiring chemotherapy discontinuation and treated with pyridoxine was previously reported.

### An unusual and difficult to detect cause of infection in two trauma patients [^1161Rq8B]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Mollicutes should be considered a potential cause of infection in patients with disruptions to the genitourinary tract mucosa or when there is difficulty isolating an organism, or an inadequate response to empiric antibiotics targeting more common organisms. There are limitations to susceptibility testing of these organisms. Empiric treatment of non-genital infections with fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines should be considered.

### Differentiation between balanitis and carcinoma in situ using reflectance confocal microscopy [^114GcSf6]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Zoon plasma cell balanitis is a benign inflammatory disease of genital skin. It may be challenging to clinically distinguish between balanitis and carcinoma in situ (CIS); thus, a biopsy may be needed to exclude malignant disease. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an in vivo imaging method that provides morphologic information about architecture and single cells in the skin.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the ability of RCM to differentiate between balanitis and CIS compared with the gold standard histopathologic methods.

- **Design**: Observer-blinded study.

- **Setting**: A referral center.

- **Participants**: Fifteen patients with balanitis or CIS.

- **Intervention**: Patients were assessed by clinical, histologic, and RCM findings. All lesions were imaged with the Vivascope 1500. In five cases of balanitis, the surrounding, non-involved skin was also evaluated.

- **Main outcome measures**: Local recurrence, nodal metastasis, disease-specific death, overall death.

- **Results**: The clinical diagnoses showed nine cases of balanitis and six cases of CIS. With histopathologic analysis, 12 cases of balanitis and cases of CIS were diagnosed, and RCM evaluation confirmed these diagnoses. The most relevant RCM criteria for CIS were atypical honeycomb pattern, disarranged epidermal pattern, and round nucleated cells. Balanitis showed a nucleated honeycomb pattern and vermicular vessels. Scattered small bright cells and round vessels were present in all lesions. The adjacent normal skin showed a typical honeycomb pattern and round papillary vessels.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: The study demonstrated the capability to differentiate between balanitis and CIS using RCM.

### Successful use of dapsone for the management of circinate balanitis [^113qw3nN]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Circinate balanitis is the most common cutaneous manifestation of reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome), but it can also occur independently. Topical corticosteroid therapy is the most commonly used treatment, and topical calcineurin inhibitors have also been used successfully. We report a case of a 20-year-old man who presented with discrete erythematous patches with slightly raised keratotic annular borders on his glans penis. He also developed geographic tongue and severe arthritis. A clinical diagnosis of circinate balanitis was made, which was supported by the psoriasiform features observed in the skin biopsy. The patient failed to respond to topical 0.05% clobetasol propionate cream. However, a novel approach using a combination of dapsone and topical 0.1% tacrolimus ointment successfully cleared his rash.

### Zoon's plasma cell balanitis associated with male genital lichen sclerosus [^116bhsEs]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old man with a history of cholecystectomy and viral hepatitis presented with redness of the glans penis and dribbling without phimosis for several months. Clinical examination revealed well-circumscribed red, moist patches involving the dorsal glans and a mirrored lesion on the mucosal surface of the foreskin, surrounded by a hypopigmented patch (see Fig 3, A). A coronal sulcus biopsy showed thinning of the epidermis without atypia. The papillary and mid dermis contained homogeneous, almost hyaline fibrosis with a band-like lymphoplasmacytic subepidermal infiltrate and dilated capillaries. Orcein staining revealed a reduction in elastic fibers in the fibrotic area without iron deposit (refer to Fig 3, B). The diagnosis of plasma cell balanitis (PCB) associated with male genital lichen sclerosus (MGLS) was made. The patient was referred to a urologist, and a posthectomy was performed. At the 6-month follow-up, he experienced significant clinical improvement in both MGLS and PCB.

- **Figure 3**:
	- **A**: Well-circumscribed red moist patches involve the dorsal glans and a mirrored lesion on the mucosal surface of the foreskin, associated with hypopigmented patches.

### Comparative analysis of two methods in circumcision: A new disposable device versus classic sleeve technique [^1176CSP4]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Circumcision is the most common surgical procedure performed in males. Medical circumcision is recommended for diseases such as phimosis, paraphimosis, balanoposthitis, and common urinary tract infections, although there is no exact indication. Conversely, Jewish and Muslim individuals commonly undergo circumcision regardless of medical necessity. Circumcision devices are designed to shorten surgery time, achieve an aesthetic appearance, and ensure safe surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the NeoAlis clamp, a disposable circumcision device, by comparing it with the sleeve technique in children.

- **Materials and methods**: Between 2017 and 2023, a retrospective evaluation of 2626 patients who underwent circumcision using either the NeoAlis clamp (group 1) or the sleeve technique (group 2) was conducted. Operation time, results, cost, and complications were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: The study encompassed 2626 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Group 1 comprised 2403 patients, whereas group 2 consisted of 223 patients. The overall complication rate, as denoted by n = 47, was 1.7%. Group 1 operation time was shorter than group 2. Bleeding, the most feared complication in the early period, was higher in the second group. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding cost comparison.

- **Conclusion**: The primary concern during circumcision is to avoid complications related to general anesthesia in newborns and infants. The use of disposable ring devices has been facilitated by the shorter operation times observed with the NeoAlis clamp.

### Veregen [^112eMH6E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Phimosis occurred in 3% of uncircumcised male subjects (5/174) treated with Veregen and in 1% (1/99) in the vehicle group.

The maximum mean severity of erythema, erosion, edema, and induration was observed by week 2 of treatment.

Less common local adverse events included urethritis, perianal infection, pigmentation changes, dryness, eczema, hyperesthesia, necrosis, papules, and discoloration. Other less common adverse events included cervical dysplasia, pelvic pain, cutaneous facial rash, and staphylococcemia.

In a dermal sensitization study of Veregen in healthy volunteers, hypersensitivity (type IV) was observed in 5 out of 209 subjects (2.4%) under occlusive conditions.

Most common adverse reactions are local skin and application site reactions including erythema, pruritus, burning, pain/discomfort, erosion/ulceration, edema, induration, and rash vesicular, with an incidence of ≥ 20%.

### ESCMID rapid guidelines for assessment and management of long COVID [^1132mkzF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for long COVID, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, the ESCMID 2022 guidelines recommend excluding other serious or life-threatening conditions, including previously overlooked conditions such as malignancy, and complications of acute COVID-19, such as thromboembolic events, myopericarditis, and encephalitis, before diagnosing long COVID in symptomatic patients. Evaluation for other conditions should be guided by symptoms, signs, and other tests obtained according to the physician's discretion.

### "Bone in the penis" or fasciitis ossificans of the penis - a first time description of a pseudo-tumor at an extraordinary site [^117QwJgF]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old man presented at the outpatient clinic with sudden paraphimosis accompanied by a tumor measuring 2 × 2 cm arising from the glans penis, causing narrowing of the external urethral meatus and painful swelling of the penis persisting for the last two weeks. He had noticed the tumor on the day of presentation and was experiencing pain due to acute paraphimosis. A slight and slow swelling of the entire penis had begun a couple of weeks prior to his visit, starting the day after he underwent a rigid cystoscopy at a urology practice. During this cystoscopy, the patient experienced sudden severe pain and subsequently suffered from gross hematuria. In the following days, the swelling of the penis increased and then stabilized, while the hematuria ceased the day after the traumatic cystoscopy. The patient noticed swelling at that time, with no further increase until about two weeks before the consultation in the outpatient clinic.

He avoided returning to the urological practice where the cystoscopy was performed. The urologist there had noted only a stenotic external urethral meatus without further findings during his cystoscopy. The patient had reported urinary difficulties without pain or hematuria for several weeks before seeking urological consultation. Approximately six months prior to this visit, a routine check-up had been conducted without any abnormalities.

### Pseudoepitheliomatous, keratotic and micaceous balanitis after penile squamous cell carcinoma [^115qqXjH]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pseudoepitheliomatous keratotic and micaceous balanitis (PKMB) is a rare form of balanitis, with only a handful of cases reported since the disease was first described. Although the condition has been described as benign, there is increasing evidence of its premalignant potential, with several of the reported cases progressing to verrucous or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We report a case of PKMB following penile SCC and discuss the literature on this rare condition.

### Developing and updating differential diagnosis tables in emergency medicine for potentially life-threatening diseases [^11374uWf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

No study has verified whether the published differential diagnosis tables cover all potentially life-threatening diseases observed in real-world clinical practice and updated the tables using real-world data.

- **Objectives**: To create initial differential diagnosis tables based on published resources, and to validate and update the tables using the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) database as a real-world reference. We created the initial differential diagnosis tables using published textbooks, UpToDate®, BMJ Best Practice, and databases (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases) without language restrictions from their inception to September 22, 2022. Then, we extracted chief complaints and diagnosis lists from the NHAMCS database of emergency patients aged ≥ 16 years between November 2016 and 2019. Finally, we compared the diagnosis lists from the NAMCS database and the initial tables to cover all potentially life-threatening diseases.

- **Results**: We created the initial tables for 78 chief complaints and 2,054 differential diagnoses (554 and 1,500 in the red and yellow categories, respectively). Additionally, we created 71 chief complaints and 1,468 differential diagnoses from the NHAMCS database. We found 114 potentially life-threatening diseases associated with 39 chief complaints not covered by the initial tables. Finally, the initial tables were updated to include 78 chief complaints and 2,168 differential diagnoses.

### Zoon's plasma cell balanitis associated with male genital lichen sclerosus [^116wygh1]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

PCB is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of circumscribed lesions of the glans penis. PCB needs to be differentiated from in situ squamous cell carcinoma, fixed drug eruption, psoriasis, lichen planus, and candidiasis.

Histologic features of PCB typically include epidermal atrophy without keratinocytic atypia, even though epidermal thickening can be seen as an early change. Spongiosis, neutrophilic exocytosis, and subepidermal clefts can be rarely seen. The papillary dermis initially contains a subepidermal band-like infiltrate of plasma cells and lymphocytes, with scattered neutrophils and eosinophils. This infiltrate can extend to the mid dermis. Usually, plasma cells are predominant, sometimes comprising 50% of all cells. Plasmocytic infiltrate is usually associated with numerous dilated capillaries, hemosiderin deposits, and extravasated erythrocytes.

In the literature, MGLS in association with PCB is reported infrequently. In a case series of 15 patients with PCB, Retamar et al. reported on a patient who had MGLS involving the foreskin three years after he was treated for PCB with a carbon dioxide laser on the glans penis. In his clinicopathologic study of 112 cases of PCB, Kumar et al. reported on six patients with a clinical presentation compatible with PCB but with MGLS on histopathology. MGLS and PCB are both triggered by chronic irritation, such as that elicited by preputial trapping of urine. Porter and Bunker proposed that PCB arises from irritation of the moist environment of the preputial recess, resulting from a dysfunctional foreskin.

### Ertapenem [^112BxCiT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ertapenem has been studied in various clinical contexts for its efficacy:

- **Complicated intra-abdominal infections**: Ertapenem was evaluated in adults for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trial. This trial compared ertapenem (1 g intravenously once a day) with piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g intravenously every 6 hours) for 5 to 14 days, enrolling 665 patients with localized complicated appendicitis and other complicated intra-abdominal infections, including colonic, small intestinal, biliary infections, and generalized peritonitis. At 4 to 6 weeks posttherapy (test-of-cure), the combined clinical and microbiologic success rates in the microbiologically evaluable population were 83.6% (163/195) for ertapenem and 80.4% (152/189) for piperacillin/tazobactam.

- **Complicated skin and skin structure infections**: Ertapenem was evaluated in adults for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections in another randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trial. This trial compared ertapenem (1 g intravenously once a day) with piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g intravenously every 6 hours) for a duration of 7 to 14 days, and enrolled 540 patients, including those with deep soft tissue abscess, posttraumatic wound infection, and cellulitis with purulent drainage. The clinical success rates at 10 to 21 days posttherapy (test-of-cure) were 83.9% (141/168) for ertapenem and 85.3% (145/170) for piperacillin/tazobactam.

### Circumferential dissection of deep fascia as ancillary technique in circumcision: Is it possible to correct phimosis increasing penis size [^115W8ez9]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Phimosis is a clinical condition in which the foreskin, due to adhesions or a fibrotic preputial ring, cannot be pulled back to expose the glans penis. Phimosis can be classified into two groups: congenital and acquired.

The first type is usually seen in young children and could be considered physiological. Acquired phimosis, however, is mostly seen in adolescents and adults. Apart from discomfort during coitus in adult life, if the distal preputial ring is too narrow, it can cause ballooning during voiding, making it difficult to maintain penile hygiene. This can lead to chronic balanoposthitis. This chronic condition results in the development of adhesions between the glans and the inner leaf of the prepuce, as well as the formation of a fibrotic ring, severely narrowing the opening of the prepuce.

In 1996, Kayaba et al. classified phimosis into four grades according to the level of preputial retractability:

- **Type I**: The preputial retractability is totally absent.

- **Type II**: The preputial opening allows only exposure of the external urethral meatus.

- **Type III**: The preputium can be partially retracted from the apex to the middle of the glans.

- **Type IV**: The preputium can be retracted sufficiently to expose above the crown of the glans due to adhesions between the inner leaf of the prepuce and the corona.

Despite various techniques of preputial plasty described in the literature, the most commonly performed surgical treatment is still conventional circumcision.

Post-MC penile hypo- or hyperpigmentation may occur after various conditions affecting the penis, such as balanitis and meatitis (33%). These pigmentary changes can also be secondary to topical medications applied after MC or a tight bandage, which may cause spotty pigmentation of the glans. Biopsy and histology are indicated when history is unclear or the causative agent is no longer present. Further follow-up and appropriate therapy are mandatory for such cases.

### High incidence of balanitis xerotica obliterans in boys with phimosis: Prospective 10-year study [^111PwLQH]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This prospective study was designed to address the incidence and clinical and histologic characteristics of balanitis xerotica obliterans in a large random pediatric population with phimosis. We investigated 1,178 boys who presented consecutively with phimosis between 1991 and 2001. All patients underwent complete circumcision, and surgical specimens were typed histologically as early, intermediate, or late forms of this disorder, or as nonspecific chronic inflammation. Patients with balanitis xerotica obliterans were monitored at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, then yearly.

Balanitis xerotica obliterans was found in 471 of the 1,178 patients (40%), with the highest incidence in boys aged 9 to 11 years (76%). Secondary phimosis occurred in 93% of boys with balanitis xerotica obliterans and in 32% of those without the disorder.

- **Treatment and outcomes**:
	- In six instances of balanitis xerotica obliterans, a meatotomy and in one, a meatoplasty, was performed, in addition to circumcision. On histologic evaluation, we found 19% had the early, 60% the intermediate, and 21% the late form of balanitis xerotica obliterans. Glanular lesions disappeared completely within 6 months in 229 out of 231 patients.

Our data strongly suggest that the true incidence of childhood balanitis xerotica obliterans is higher than previously assumed. Its incidence peaks in the 9 to 11 years age group, in whom secondary phimosis was almost exclusively caused by balanitis xerotica obliterans.

### Diagnostic issues in the paraphilias [^115s9co5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine the empirical bases underlying the diagnoses of the paraphilias. We address issues concerning the reliability of these diagnoses and their implications for etiology, treatment, and prognosis.

Recent findings indicate that research on the paraphilias is quite limited, except for those whose interests lead them to sexually offend. Even among these individuals, research has largely failed to distinguish those who meet criteria for a paraphilia from those who do not, limiting our ability to draw firm conclusions regarding the value of a paraphilic diagnosis. Speculations regarding the etiology of paraphilias are mostly confined to those who sexually offend, and these theories do not distinguish between those who meet paraphilic criteria and those who do not. Treatment of sex offenders, when effective, appears to have the same impact regardless of whether clients meet criteria for a paraphilia. In terms of prognosis, it was only among untreated child molesters that a paraphilic diagnosis (in this case "pedophilia") predicted long-term outcome. In the face of these problems, we suggest that a dimensional approach to diagnoses may represent an improvement over the categorical model.

### Balanitis associated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy [^114KueGb]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A man in his 50s with esophageal cancer was admitted to the hospital for intractable diarrhea. His chemotherapy regimen had recently been switched to FOLFIRI for esophageal cancer. During admission, he complained of a pruritic rash on his hands and a painful rash on his penis associated with dysuria. These symptoms started with the second cycle of chemotherapy. He self-treated the rash with emollients but had limited relief. He was afebrile.

On the circumcised glans penis, extending over the corona and onto the distal penile shaft, there was a circumferential confluent red plaque with serous crust and scale. On his palmar hands, bilaterally overlying joints, there were moderate pink plaques with scaling. There was notable xerosis of the palms and fissuring at finger bases. There was no melanonychia, serpentine skin hyperpigmentation, stomatitis, or mucosal dyspigmentation. He had no history of asthma or atopic dermatitis and did not take any over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements.

Urine testing found negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites, and urine chemistry values were within normal limits. A superficial wound culture of the penis found normal flora, with no Pseudomonas aeruginosa, β-hemolytic Streptococci, or Staphylococcus aureus, and no leukocytes detectable by staining. Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was negative, venereal disease research laboratory findings were nonreactive, and thrombocyte count was within normal limits. The patient never received hematopoietic cell transplantation.

### Comparative analysis of two methods in circumcision: a new disposable device versus classic sleeve technique [^112xdTyD]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Circumcision is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in males. While there is no precise medical indication for its necessity, it is often recommended for conditions such as phimosis, paraphimosis, balanoposthitis, and frequent urinary tract infections. Additionally, circumcision is traditionally practiced among Jewish and Muslim individuals, irrespective of medical necessity.

Circumcision devices are designed to reduce surgery time, achieve an aesthetic appearance, and ensure safe surgery. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the NeoAlis clamp, a disposable circumcision device, by comparing it with the classic sleeve technique in children.

Between 2017 and 2023, a retrospective evaluation of 2,626 patients who underwent circumcision using either the NeoAlis clamp (group 1) or the sleeve technique (group 2) was conducted. Operation time, results, cost, and complications were compared between the two groups.

The study encompassed 2,626 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Group 1 comprised 2,403 patients, whereas group 2 consisted of 223 patients. The overall complication rate was 1.7% (n = 47). Group 1 experienced shorter operation times compared to group 2. Notably, bleeding, the most feared early complication, was higher in group 2. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding cost comparison.

The primary concern during circumcision is to avoid complications related to general anesthesia in newborns and infants. The use of disposable ring devices has been facilitated by the shorter operation times they offer.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116zm1gg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Candidal balanitis is defined as inflammation of the glans penis in the presence of Candida spp. and accounts for less than 20% of all balanoposthitis. Candidal balanitis is generally sexually acquired and is more common in patients with diabetes and in uncircumcised men. Infections are almost always opportunistic and often occur in patients with primary inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis. Symptoms include local burning, soreness, and pruritus; clinical features include pronounced erythema and papules. Diagnosis is often based on clinical appearance, but European consensus guidelines recommend performing a subpreputial culture to confirm the presence of Candida.

European guidelines for the management of candidal balanitis recommend treatment with 1% clotrimazole cream applied twice daily until symptoms resolve, or, if symptoms are severe, oral fluconazole 150 mg once daily (strength of recommendation for both: A). Application of 2% miconazole cream twice daily until symptoms resolve is also recommended, or nystatin cream (100,000 units/g) if resistance or allergy to imidazoles is suspected (strength of recommendation for both: B). Topical imidazole with 1% hydrocortisone can be used if marked inflammation is present (strength of recommendation: C).

### Topical treatment for phimosis: Time span and other factors behind treatment effectiveness [^114wkAMM]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To study the factors that may influence the effectiveness of 0.2% betamethasone/hyaluronidase cream in the treatment of phimosis, we treated 427 patients (aged 3–10 years, mean age 6.33) in a prospective, randomized, blind study. This involved 214 patients on a 4-week course and 213 patients on an 8-week course. All patients were evaluated monthly for at least 6 months post-treatment. The penis was photographed to objectively assess treatment response. A therapeutic response was classified as total success with complete glans exposure, partial success with half glans exposure impeded by balanopreputial adherence or ring fibrosis, and therapeutic failure with no or less than 50% glans exposure.

The results showed that after treatment, 92.1% of patients experienced total or partial success. However, during the follow-up period (mean 9.36 months, range 6–13 months), 29.5% failed to maintain these results, with failure rates of 22.6% and 37.6% for the 8-week and 4-week treatments, respectively. During treatment, 13.6% of patients experienced side effects such as prepuce ardor (6.1%), hyperemia (4.6%), and paraphimosis (0.0098%), but none required intervention or interruption of treatment. Both groups were statistically similar across all parameters, although an 8-week treatment duration, previous urethral meatal exposure, and absence of previous balanoposthitis increased the chance of total success. Surgery was indicated for failure or relapse in 181 patients (42.38%).

In conclusion, treatment with topical 0.2% betamethasone/hyaluronidase cream for 8 weeks is effective and safe, particularly if the urethral meatal exposure is present and there is no history of balanoposthitis.

### Treatment of plasma cell balanitis associated with male genital lichen sclerosus using abrocitinib [^1179tEDr]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Plasma cell balanitis (PCB) is a rare benign skin disease characterized by a shiny and well-defined reddish patch on the glans penis. Male genital lichen sclerosus (MGLS) is characterized by atrophic ivory plaques, and some scholars link it to autoimmunity. Both PCB and MGLS can arise from redundant prepuce and exposure to chronic irritation such as prolonged urine infiltration, making their simultaneous occurrence in a patient possible. Treatments for PCB include calcineurin inhibitors, steroid ointments, and circumcision. However, achieving a definitive treatment approach that fully satisfies patients with PCB associated with MGLS remains a complex and unmet clinical need.

In recent years, abrocitinib, a selective Janus kinase-1 inhibitor, has gained recognition for its potential in addressing a wide spectrum of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. A previous study has shed light on abrocitinib's promising role in the treatment of MGLS, offering hope to those afflicted by this challenging dermatologic disorder.

We present a successful case study illustrating the application of abrocitinib in the treatment of a patient with concurrent PCB and MGLS.

### Zoon balanitis: Not a distinct clinicopathological entity [^111Cj3jF]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Zoon balanitis (ZB) was originally described in the 1950s in patients with clinical features resembling erythroplasia of Queyrat but with histology that demonstrated a plasma cell infiltrate without evidence of dysplasia. Subsequently, ZB has been extensively reported in the literature, reflecting widespread acknowledgment as an established distinct clinicopathological entity. However, its existence as such has been questioned, and there have been suggestions in the literature that ZB represents either a nonspecific irritant reaction pattern or a part of the heterogeneous clinicopathological complex of male genital lichen sclerosus (MGLSc).

In this study, the entire historical literature of published cases of ZB was subjected to review to determine whether clinical or histological features of MGLSc had been present and overlooked. A total of 101 papers were reviewed. Seventy-five contained images purporting to be of ZB. Images that were deemed inadequate in quality or presented uninformative anatomical views were excluded. The images in 66 papers were amenable to scrutiny. Of these, 98.5% demonstrated clinical signs of MGLSc, such as adhesions, effacement of the coronal sulcus and the frenulum, tightening of the prepuce, constrictive posthitis, etiolation of the glans, lichenoid inflammation, and sclerosis.

These findings strongly suggest that ZB occurs in the vast majority of cases as a manifestation of MGLSc, and its recognition as a distinct clinicopathological entity should be questioned, if not discontinued.

### Non-infectious inflammatory genital lesions [^1165Z5gJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The genitalia may be the site of non-infectious inflammatory lesions that are generally manifested as balanoposthitis and vulvovaginitis. In men, these forms constitute 50% of all balanoposthitis forms, and in women, the frequency of vulvovaginitis is even higher. These lesions consist of genital manifestations of general skin diseases such as psoriasis, lichen planus, and lichen sclerosus. Additionally, other clinical entities with distinct characteristics, such as Zoon's balanitis-vulvitis, may also be present. Diagnosis of genital non-infectious inflammatory lesions is usually made based on clinical criteria. A biopsy is necessary only for the identification of clinical conditions that may simulate inflammatory forms but are actually premalignant processes.

### Postoperative occlusion of visual axis with fibrous membrane in the presence of anterior capsular phimosis in a patient with pseudoexfoliation syndrome: a case report [^1128CNFP]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

In this case, AS-OCT was used to visualize the anterior capsular phimosis and formation of the membrane occluding the capsular opening.

The occluding membrane and the anterior capsular phimosis were detected at two months postoperatively, aligning with previous reports that the maximal rate of capsular contraction occurs within six weeks post-surgery. A clear visual axis was observed one month after the Nd:YAG laser treatment. As capsular stability is reported to be achieved three months postoperatively, we expect capsulorhexis stabilization. However, further follow-up is needed as there is the possibility of additional capsular contraction, particularly because the patient has pseudoexfoliation syndrome.

- **Mechanisms of anterior capsular phimosis**: Capsular shrinkage likely due to actin filaments within residual lens epithelial cells (LECs), and proliferation and fibrous metaplasia of these residual LECs, which lead to the reduction of the capsulorhexis opening size. Histopathological examination showed the proliferative membrane was composed of subcapsular fibrous tissue interspersed with proliferated fibrocytic cells derived from residual LECs. Using a scanning electron microscope, Ueno et al. demonstrated the presence of fibroblast-like cells in the area of the anterior capsular occlusion. Kurosawa et al. revealed that anterior capsular phimosis involved outgrowth of fibrous tissue from the capsule margin and its contraction.

### Topical corticosteroids for treating phimosis in boys [^1179XkRP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Until recently, phimosis has been treated surgically by circumcision or prepuceplasty; however, recent reports of non-invasive treatment using topical corticosteroids applied for four to eight weeks have been favorable. The efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids for treating phimosis in boys have not been previously systematically reviewed.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to 1) compare the effectiveness of the use of topical corticosteroid ointment applied to the distal stenotic portion of the prepuce in the resolution of phimosis in boys with the use of placebo or no treatment and 2) determine the rate of partial resolution (improvement) of phimosis, rate of re-stenosis after initial resolution or improvement of phimosis, and the rate of adverse events of topical corticosteroid treatment in boys with phimosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Date of last search: 16 June 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any topical corticosteroid ointment with placebo ointment or no treatment for boys with phimosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed titles, abstracts, and the full-text of eligible studies, extracted data relating to the review's primary and secondary outcomes, and assessed the studies' risk of bias. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113jmgF9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Several conditions may mimic pityriasis rosea (PR) and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:

- **Secondary syphilis**: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution. Lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.

- **Tinea corporis**: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.

- **Erythema multiforme**: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.

- **Guttate psoriasis**: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis. Scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.

- **Pityriasis lichenoides chronica**: Chronic, scaly, red-brown papules may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution. One or more of them show a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.

- **Pityriasis alba**: Hypopigmentation resembling PR can occur.

### Zoon's plasma cell balanitis associated with male genital lichen sclerosus [^1176sXgb]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Zoon's plasma cell balanitis (PCB), also known as balanitis circumscripta plasmacellularis, is a disease affecting middle-aged to elderly men. It manifests as a solitary, smooth, shiny, red to orange plaque on the glans penis, often with a mirrored or "kissing" lesion on the mucosal surface of the foreskin. Tan-brown macules may also appear within the smooth plaque. The etiology of PCB remains unknown. It may result from irritation or mild trauma to keratinized skin in a moist environment. Some investigators propose that PCB is a nonspecific inflammatory reactive pattern. This pattern may occur as an isolated finding or complicate other conditions of the glans penis or foreskin, particularly in uncircumcised men. Male genital lichen sclerosus (MGLS) is a common chronic inflammatory dermatosis that affects the genitalia. It frequently presents as acquired phimosis in adults, leading to splitting, fissuring, or maceration, which may contribute to the development of PCB. This report presents a series of three patients with MGLS-associated PCB.

### Lichen sclerosus and phimosis - discrepancies between clinical and pathological diagnosis and its consequences [^112yuHP8]. Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of clinical diagnoses and determine the true incidence of lichen sclerosus (LS) in patients with phimosis.

- **Materials and methods**: The study included 92 adult male patients who were qualified for circumcision due to phimosis. These patients were clinically diagnosed by both a urologist and a dermatologist before the surgical procedure. After circumcision, the resected foreskins were examined by two independent uropathologists.

- **Results**: A preoperative clinical diagnosis of LS was established in 54 patients (58.7%), while 26 patients (28.3%) had healthy-looking skin, and 12 patients (13.1%) had other penile diseases. After histopathological examination, LS was confirmed in 62 patients (67.4%). However, only 44 of these had a previous clinical diagnosis of LS. LS was histopathologically confirmed in 18 other patients who were clinically diagnosed with healthy skin (n = 17) or lichen planus (n = 1). Conversely, healthy skin was histopathologically confirmed in 10 cases where patients were clinically diagnosed with LS. The remaining 15 histopathological diagnoses included Zoon balanitis (n = 3), nonspecific balanitis (n = 5), lichen planus (n = 1), psoriasis (n = 1), invasive penile cancer (n = 3), Bowen's disease (n = 1), and penile intraepithelial neoplasia 2 usual type (n = 1).

- **Conclusion**: LS was the most common histopathological diagnosis in patients undergoing circumcision in this study. Histopathological examination appears to be necessary to exclude LS.

### Topical corticosteroids for treating phimosis in boys [^112tTtbJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. Phimosis is a condition in which the prepuce (foreskin) cannot be fully retracted past the head of the penis (glans). Phimosis is often treated surgically by circumcision or prepuce plasty; however, reports of non-invasive treatment using topical corticosteroids applied for four to eight weeks have suggested favorable outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical corticosteroids applied to the stenotic portion of the prepuce for the treatment of phimosis in boys compared with placebo or no treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrial.gov. We checked reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for additional studies. There were no restrictions on the language of publication. The date of the last search was 4 October 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any topical corticosteroid with placebo or no treatment for boys with any type or degree of phimosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data related to the review's primary and secondary outcomes, and assessed the studies' risk of bias. We used the random-effects model for statistical analyses and expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We contacted the authors of the primary articles to request details of the study design and specific outcome data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

### Cicatricial pemphigoid-induced phimosis [^1131b72e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease with a predilection for mucous membranes, often resulting in scarring. We describe a case of cicatricial pemphigoid with severe involvement of the glans penis, which, despite systemic therapy, led to phimosis.

### Circinate erythematous penile plaque [^114BH95T]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis question**: What is the diagnosis?

		A. Behçet disease
		B. Erosive lichen planus
		C. Extramammary Paget disease
		D. Erythroplasia of Queyrat
		E. Zoon's balanitis

- **Answer**:

A. Behçet disease – Incorrect. Behçet disease is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome defined by mucosal ulcerations of the mouth and genitalia, ocular anomalies, and cutaneous lesions. Clinically, oral ulcers develop a yellow pseudomembrane surrounded by erythema, while the anogenital aphthae can be painful and have irregular margins. Histologic characteristics demonstrate an angiocentric neutrophilic infiltrate with vasculitic features.

B. Erosive lichen planus – Incorrect. Erosive lichen planus can be a clinical mimicker of squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS); however, the histopathology would discriminate between them. Key histology findings include interface dermatitis with a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, granular layer accentuation, saw-toothed rete ridges, Civatte bodies, pigment incontinence, and subepidermal clefting.

C. Extramammary Paget disease – Incorrect. Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a rare neoplastic condition that can be either primary or secondary in nature due to an underlying contiguous or noncontiguous adenocarcinoma or visceral malignancy. Histology demonstrates pagetoid cells (large vacuolated cells with abundant cytoplasm) that display variable immunohistochemical staining patterns depending on whether or not the tumor is primary or secondary. Primary EMPD would be negative for stains such as p63 and cytokeratin 5/6, which were positive in this case.

### Balanitis associated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy [^112CUzWv]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This case shows that, after excluding infectious etiologies and graft-versus-host disease, FOLFIRI-associated balanitis may be effectively treated with potent topical corticosteroids. Application of topical corticosteroids to the face and genitalia requires proper application instruction, patient understanding, and a high level of caution. Side effects such as skin atrophy, striae, dermatitis, acne, purpura, hypertrichosis, delayed wound healing, and dyspigmentation may develop, and exacerbation of infections is seen less frequently.

In our case, a daily skin examination was performed by the dermatology team while the patient was on the inpatient medical floor. Other treatment options described in the literature include topical tacrolimus, testosterone propionate ointment, carbenoxolone gel, saline soaks, and intralesional corticosteroids. Although not present in this patient, the individual contribution of foreskin presence to chemotherapy-associated balanitis has not been reported in the literature, but it is an important question that should be explored in additional studies.

### Treatment of Zoon's balanitis with imiquimod 5% cream [^116jaVEL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 43-year-old uncircumcised Caucasian, diabetic man with a 4-year history of Zoon's balanitis unresponsive to topical steroids, in whom control of the disease was achieved with topical imiquimod. A histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen was performed before and after treatment with imiquimod 5% cream applied three times a week. A moderate to marked increase in local skin reaction occurred several times throughout the treatment period, necessitating multiple rest periods of several days' duration. Clinical but not histological resolution was obtained after four months of treatment, with no relapses at an 18-month follow-up. This positive treatment outcome indicates that imiquimod may have a role in the management of Zoon's balanitis. However, the dose and duration of therapy required to achieve a complete clinical response still need to be established. Also, the question of whether normalization of histology can be achieved with topical imiquimod has yet to be answered.

### Neupogen [^116JbyHZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage in patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy**: The recommended dosage of Neupogen for mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day, given by subcutaneous injection. Administer Neupogen for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of Neupogen administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established, administration for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5, 6, and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of Neupogen, and discontinue if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100,000/mm³.

- **Dosage in patients with severe chronic neutropenia**: Prior to starting Neupogen in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts, and assessing bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of Neupogen prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition, other than SCN, causing the neutropenia.

	- The recommended starting dosage for patients with congenital neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection. For idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection.

### Simple method of paraphimosis reduction revisited: Point of technique and review of the literature [^114JQ13D]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Paraphimosis is a urologic emergency that poses a risk of serious penile injury, including gangrene and tissue necrosis, if not promptly addressed. Numerous techniques for the reduction of paraphimosis have been suggested. This paper introduces a novel approach to paraphimosis reduction using CoFlex(®), a flexible self-adhering bandage. Additionally, a detailed review of the literature concerning conservative management options for paraphimosis is provided.

### Paraphimosis: Current treatment options [^116j623m]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Paraphimosis is a urologic emergency occurring in uncircumcised males, where the foreskin becomes trapped behind the corona, forming a tight band of constricting tissue. Often iatrogenically induced, paraphimosis can be prevented by returning the prepuce over the glans after penile manipulation. Treatment typically begins with the reduction of edema, followed by various options including mechanical compression, pharmacologic therapy, puncture technique, and dorsal slit. Prevention and early intervention are key elements in the management of paraphimosis.

### Spectrum and the management of glanular-preputial adhesions after ritual male circumcision [^111mTCD3]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

After reviewing a diversity of post-male circumcision glanular-preputial adhesions, we confidently classified these complications into early fibrinous adhesion, skin bridges, and cicatricial phimosis. Skin bridges are further classified as single or multiple and, according to their location, as dorsal, lateral, or ventral, the latter subtype is usually associated with penile bending.

Cicatricial phimosis may be associated with other sequelae such as meatal stenosis and ascending urinary tract infections (UTIs). If glanular-preputial adhesions are not treated early and properly, they may result in different forms and degrees of penile bending. These adhesions may harbor smegma particles, debris, and dirt, which can lead to various forms of balanitis or specific penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis. This may develop secondary to chronic exposure to urine, which has been proposed to play a role in its etiology. It is postulated that dribbled urine becomes trapped between the inner preputial remnants and the glans. This occlusion and koebnerization precipitate inflammation, which may progress to the characteristic sclerosis of penile lichen balanitis.

Several other factors, such as genetic susceptibility, autoimmunity, and infections, have also been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis, which is uncommon in children. Its diagnosis is almost always clinical and supported by histology. The detection and confirmation of three cases of penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis among this group of children with glanular-preputial adhesions could reveal the substantial hazards associated with these adhesions.

### Zoon's balanitis [^1167F1KA]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Zoon's balanitis typically affects older, uncircumcised males and can manifest as asymptomatic, pruritic, or dysuric conditions. It is characterized by erythematous, discrete, moist plaques with a "cayenne pepper" speckled appearance and an orange hue on the glans penis and sometimes the prepuce. These regions may exhibit "kissing lesions" on areas that are in direct contact with the lesions. Over time, these may erode and leave a "rusty stain". Histologically, the condition shows a dense lichenoid infiltrate in the upper and mid dermis with abundant plasma cells.

### An unusual cause of paraphimosis: Hemangioma of the glans penis [^1135f7Vo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Paraphimosis is a urologic emergency that occurs in uncircumcised boys. If untreated, paraphimosis can lead to increasing edema caused by vascular and lymphatic obstruction, resulting in serious outcomes such as penile gangrene, which can progress to autoamputation within days or weeks. Most instances of paraphimosis are iatrogenic; however, this condition can also arise from unusual causes. We present a very rare case of paraphimosis that developed in a patient with a hemangioma of the glans penis. We propose that the swelling of the hemangioma pushed the penile skin backward, resulting in paraphimosis. To our knowledge, such a presentation has not been previously reported in the English literature.

### Ulcerative balanoposthitis of the foreskin as a manifestation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: case report and review of the literature [^117WqVQz]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Ulcerative lesions of the penis have many possible etiologies, including infectious, neoplastic, traumatic, drug-induced, and autoimmune causes. Although the most frequent neoplasm presenting as an ulcerative penile lesion is squamous cell carcinoma, it may rarely be a manifestation of other malignancies, including those of hematolymphoid origin. We report a case of ulcerative balanoposthitis as a manifestation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other hematolymphoid malignancies should be considered in the large differential diagnosis of nonhealing penile ulcers.

### Prevalence of phimosis in males of all ages: Systematic review [^1179g3Ha]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Phimosis is considered virtually universal in newborn males and is likely to resolve within a few years. Persistent phimosis can result in pain, sexual dysfunction, and an increased risk of penile inflammatory conditions and penile cancer. There are two forms: primary phimosis and secondary phimosis, with the latter often representing a consequence of lichen sclerosis, diabetes, and obesity.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review to determine the prevalence of phimosis at different ages.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, and bibliographies of original studies were searched using the keyword phimosis.

- **Study selection**: Studies containing original data on phimosis at any age.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently verified study design, extracted data, and rated studies for quality.

- **Results**: Forty-three eligible studies were included: 27 from PubMed, 4 from Google Scholar, and 12 from bibliography searches. Phimosis was reported in most newborns and then gradually decreased in prevalence. Most studies did not differentiate primary from secondary phimosis, so values reported were net phimosis prevalence. There were 13 studies with data for males aged ≥ 18 years. In all, 962 of 17,136 men had been diagnosed with phimosis (range 0.5%-13%). A random effects model found the risk of phimosis in men was 3.4% (95% CI 1.8%-6.6%).

- **Conclusion**: Phimosis takes many years to resolve. Apart from spontaneous resolution, clinical interventions also contribute to the gradual reduction in prevalence among uncircumcised boys.

### Severe phimosis as a notable sequela of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in boys [^1159TpnS]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has improved the survival rates of patients with hematologic and metabolic disorders, as well as those with malignancies or immunodeficiencies. Although various complications have been reported following allogeneic SCT, phimosis has rarely been documented, and the predisposing risk factors for phimosis have not been determined. In this study, the occurrence of severe phimosis following allogeneic SCT in boys was analyzed, and its risk factors were identified. The patients were under 15 years of age. Phimosis was observed in 32.6% of 46 patients after allogeneic SCT; 13.0% of these cases required surgical intervention.

- **Univariate analysis**: Risk factors for severe phimosis included chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the use of a conditioning regimen that included anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).
- **Multivariate analysis**: Chronic GVHD was shown to be an independent risk factor for severe phimosis.

Severe phimosis is, therefore, an important complication of SCT in boys, particularly in patients with chronic GVHD.

### EAU guidelines on paediatric urology [^113qcsY3]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for phimosis, particularly in patients with paraphimosis, the EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend performing manual repositioning. This involves compressing the edematous tissue followed by an attempt to retract the tightened foreskin over the glans penis for the treatment of patients with paraphimosis.

### Circumferential dissection of deep fascia as ancillary technique in circumcision: Is it possible to correct phimosis increasing penis size [^111QRKFE]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The ancillary technique we described is safe and easy to perform. It does not significantly increase operative time, as the degloving procedure takes just 15 minutes, nor does it raise the complication rate compared to the conventional procedure. For these reasons, it could be performed on any adult patient affected by phimosis, regardless of grade, who undergoes a circumcision procedure.

### Circumcision devices versus standard surgical techniques in adolescent and adult male circumcisions [^115pmyVL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Medical circumcisions are among the most common surgical procedures performed in males. The usual indications include phimosis, which is the inability to completely retract the foreskin to expose the glans due to a congenital or acquired constriction of the prepuce; paraphimosis, where the foreskin is not pulled back over the glans after retraction, resulting in a tight constricting band causing swelling of the distal penis and acute discomfort; balanoposthitis, characterized by erythema and edema of the prepuce and glans; and balanitis, where inflammation is confined to the glans, and the foreskin is usually non-retractile.

Circumcision devices have been developed to shorten operative time, simplify techniques, and improve safety and cosmetic outcomes. These devices generally aim to crush the foreskin while simultaneously creating hemostasis; the foreskin is then excised or allowed to slough off. Their use is purportedly safer and easier to replicate than standard dissection techniques. There are at least 20 devices for male circumcision on the market, yet their effectiveness has not been reviewed at the time of writing.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of device-based circumcisions compared with standard surgical techniques in adolescent and adult males (10 years old and above).

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, trials registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings up to 16 April 2020.

### Zoon's plasma cell balanitis associated with male genital lichen sclerosus [^112n3x1d]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

An 80-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and basal cell carcinoma of the chest was referred to the dermatology clinic for relapsing-remitting balanitis of 5 years' duration. He had no dermatologic symptoms but reported urinary dribbling. A bacterial skin swab showed normal cutaneous flora. Clinical examination revealed dark erythematous purpuric moist patches on the glans penis, hypopigmented macules on the foreskin, and balano-preputial adhesions (Fig 1, A). A foreskin biopsy indicated thinning of the epidermis without cell atypia, lymphocyte and neutrophil exocytosis, and localized basal vacuolization. The superficial chorion contained horizontal homogenic hyaline fibrosis with subepidermal lympho-plasmocytic infiltrate, more scattered in the middle chorion. No iron deposit was found after Perls staining (Fig 1, B). The diagnosis of plasma cell balanitis (PCB) associated with male genital lichen sclerosus (MGLS) was made. He was treated medically with daily applications of topical clobetasol and was lost to follow-up.

### Plasma cell balanitis presenting in a patient with a history of syphilis [^114wSMvk]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Plasma cell balanitis (PCB), also known as Zoon balanitis, is a benign, asymptomatic, but chronic and erosive inflammatory condition of the glans penis and prepuce that generally affects uncircumcised men in later years. The clinical presentation involves a single, shiny, well-defined reddish patch. We describe the first case of PCB ever reported in a patient with a previous history of syphilis and include a review of the literature.

A 57-year-old Hispanic man with a remote history of syphilis presented with a 6-month non-healing, granulating ulcer of the foreskin and glans penis that had been repeatedly mistaken for syphilis. It was treated unsuccessfully with circumcision three weeks previously. A biopsy of the glans penis demonstrated sections with denuded chronic granulation tissue showing a fibrotic stroma with numerous blood vessels and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including scattered plasma cells. It is important to differentiate PCB from a syphilitic chancre in a patient presenting with a non-healing penile lesion. This case report demonstrates that these entities may be seen in the same patient at different times.
