## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which immunosuppressive agent should be chosen next for a 26-year-old woman with newly diagnosed lupus nephritis, given the clinical context and biopsy confirmation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the lupus nephritis subtype. Then, I should verify the severity and activity of renal involvement to determine the intensity of therapy. Next, I will align treatment choices with contemporary guideline recommendations for proliferative lupus nephritis. Finally, I will weigh the risks and benefits of each option and select the best initial agent accordingly, ensuring I justify why alternatives are less appropriate in this scenario.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its implications. The patient has proteinuria with hematuria, edema, hypertension, and impaired renal function, and the renal biopsy confirms lupus nephritis; this establishes a systemic lupus erythematosus–related glomerulonephritis that warrants immunosuppression beyond corticosteroids alone, particularly given the elevated creatinine and active urinary sediment with proteinuria, which point toward proliferative disease rather than pure membranous involvement [^4032204d] [^4a95c237].

> Wait, let me verify the likely histologic class. Although the exact ISN/RPS class isn't specified, the combination of hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and reduced eGFR strongly suggests proliferative lupus nephritis (class III or IV), which carries a higher risk of progression and mandates aggressive immunosuppression; guidelines emphasize tailoring therapy to class and activity, and in the absence of a specified class, proliferative features justify standard-of-care induction with a steroid plus a second immunosuppressant [^4a95c237] [^7b360cbb].

> I need to check the severity and activity to calibrate intensity. The creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL indicates impaired kidney function, and the proteinuria with active sediment signals active inflammatory disease; this profile supports full-dose induction rather than conservative approaches, and it aligns with guidance to escalate promptly when there is active proliferative LN with reduced eGFR or significant proteinuria [^7b360cbb] [^113a401b].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant first-line therapy for proliferative lupus nephritis. Contemporary ACR and KDIGO guidance recommend glucocorticoids plus either mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide as standard initial regimens; azathioprine is not recommended for induction in active proliferative disease, and calcineurin inhibitors are generally reserved for specific scenarios or as part of triple therapy rather than as standalone induction agents [^7b360cbb] [^a5f517b8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about azathioprine. My first instinct might be to consider azathioprine because it is an immunosuppressant, but wait, I should double-check the evidence base; azathioprine is inferior to cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate for induction of proliferative lupus nephritis and is not recommended as initial therapy in this setting, though it may be used in maintenance or in special circumstances such as pregnancy planning or intolerance to other agents [^7fb92e8a] [^cb7e28f5].

> I will now examine cyclosporine. Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that can reduce proteinuria, but it is not a standard first-line induction agent for proliferative lupus nephritis; it is more appropriate in selected contexts such as membranous disease with nephrotic syndrome, intolerance to standard regimens, or as a component of triple therapy in refractory cases, so choosing cyclosporine now would deviate from best practice for active proliferative LN [^ed61be70] [^7b360cbb].

> Let me consider cyclophosphamide carefully. Cyclophosphamide remains a guideline-endorsed first-line induction option for proliferative lupus nephritis, particularly when there is impaired kidney function or high-risk histology; historical and contemporary data support its efficacy in preserving renal function, and it is especially appropriate when rapid disease control is needed, as in this patient with reduced eGFR and active nephritis [^a5f517b8] [^7b360cbb].

> But wait, what if mycophenolate mofetil is equally reasonable? It is, and in many patients MMF is an excellent first-line alternative to cyclophosphamide; however, the question forces a single best choice among the listed options, and given the impaired eGFR and the need for robust induction, cyclophosphamide edges out azathioprine and cyclosporine as the most appropriate selection from the provided alternatives, with the understanding that in real practice MMF would also be acceptable per guidelines [^7b360cbb] [^a5f517b8].

> I should confirm the role of corticosteroids. Regardless of the second agent, pulse intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone with a taper is standard to control acute inflammation; thus, corticosteroids are mandatory but are not the best answer among the choices because the question is asking for the additional immunosuppressant to pair with steroids in induction, and corticosteroids alone are insufficient for proliferative lupus nephritis [^0e212993] [^7b360cbb].

> Putting this together, the next best step is to initiate cyclophosphamide alongside corticosteroids for induction of proliferative lupus nephritis, given the active renal disease with impaired kidney function; azathioprine is inappropriate for induction, and cyclosporine is not a standard first-line agent in this scenario, whereas cyclophosphamide is guideline-supported and offers the most compelling balance of efficacy and appropriateness among the listed options [^7b360cbb] [^a5f517b8].

---

The next best step is **corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide** for induction therapy in proliferative lupus nephritis, as this regimen reduces the risk of renal failure and improves long-term outcomes [^a5f517b8] [^7fb92e8a]. Azathioprine and cyclosporine are **not first-line** for induction in this setting, though they may be considered for maintenance or in special circumstances [^7b360cbb] [^cb7e28f5]. Immediate initiation of **high-dose corticosteroids** is essential to control inflammation while awaiting biopsy results, followed by cyclophosphamide to achieve durable remission [^0e212993] [^7fb92e8a].

---

## Rationale for corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide

- **Corticosteroids**: High-dose corticosteroids are the cornerstone of induction therapy, rapidly suppressing inflammation and immune-mediated renal injury [^0e212993] [^b749058e].

- **Cyclophosphamide**: Adding cyclophosphamide to corticosteroids significantly improves renal outcomes, including reduced risk of doubling serum creatinine and progression to end-stage renal disease [^7fb92e8a] [^a5f517b8].

- **Guideline support**: Both the ACR and KDIGO guidelines recommend corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide as a first-line induction regimen for proliferative lupus nephritis (class III/IV) [^7b360cbb] [^a5f517b8].

---

## Alternative immunosuppressive agents

| **Agent** | **Role in lupus nephritis** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Azathioprine | Maintenance therapy or mild disease | Less effective for induction in proliferative LN; reserved for maintenance or intolerance to other agents [^cb7e28f5] [^cea7b60f] |
| Cyclosporine | Not first-line for induction | Limited evidence for proliferative LN; may be considered in refractory cases or specific scenarios [^ed61be70] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide

- **Randomized controlled trials**: Multiple RCTs have demonstrated the superiority of corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide over corticosteroids alone, with significant reductions in renal failure and mortality [^7fb92e8a] [^a5f517b8].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Patients receiving corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide have improved long-term renal survival and reduced risk of relapse compared to corticosteroids alone [^7fb92e8a] [^a5f517b8].

- **Guideline consensus**: Both ACR and KDIGO guidelines consistently recommend this regimen as standard of care for proliferative lupus nephritis [^7b360cbb] [^a5f517b8].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age and fertility**: Younger patients may have concerns about fertility; cyclophosphamide carries gonadotoxic risks, but its benefits in preventing renal failure often outweigh these risks [^7fb92e8a].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring for adverse effects, including infection, hematologic toxicity, and gonadal dysfunction, is essential during cyclophosphamide therapy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The next best step is to initiate **corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide** for induction therapy in this patient with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. This regimen is supported by robust clinical evidence and current guidelines, offering the best chance for renal recovery and long-term disease control [^7fb92e8a] [^7b360cbb].

### Lupus nephritis: redefining the treatment goals [^1639f3ce]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

The course of proliferative lupus nephritis is characterized by flares of activity alternating with periods of quiescence against a background of chronic immune dysregulation. An accurate assessment of disease activity is of unassailable importance to tailor therapy. In the present communication, we discuss the available clinical, serologic, and histologic tools to evaluate disease activity and how they may be applied to redefine the treatment goals in lupus nephritis. Traditionally, treatment response is judged by the degree of proteinuria reduction and improvement of kidney function, but this fails to differentiate ongoing inflammatory disease from chronic damage. Despite intensive research, no novel biomarker has proved useful for clinical practice, and we continue to rely on anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels to assess serologic activity. Repeat kidney biopsies sometimes reveal persistent inflammation despite apparent clinical remission, giving credibility to the conviction that histologic remission should be a treatment goal and protocol biopsies be part of the decision-making process. However, the discrepancies between clinical and histologic responses to therapy can be explained by persistent systemic autoimmunity with low-grade immune complex deposition or, alternatively, by delayed clearance of intrarenal inflammation once immunologic remission has been achieved. Because persistent immune dysregulation is the motor of disease activity in lupus nephritis, it should be the principal focus of therapy and monitoring. We propose to replace the traditional induction-remission maintenance protocol by a more dynamic and individualized approach and aim for 3 treatment goals, concomitantly rather than sequentially: (i) clinical remission, by attenuating renal inflammation, using microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and complement levels as biomarkers; (ii) immunologic remission, by decreasing immune complex generation, using anti-double-stranded DNA antibody as a biomarker; and (iii) preservation of kidney function, by curtailing chronic kidney damage, using estimated glomerular filtration rate slope as a biomarker.

Renal response and related definitions — complete renal response (CRR) is defined as occurring "Within 6–12 months of starting therapy (may take > 12 months)" with "Stabilization or improvement in kidney function", while partial renal response (PRR) within 6–12 months requires "Reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to < 3 g/g (300 mg/mmol)… AND Stabilization of kidney function". Inadequate renal response/nonresponse is "Lack of achieving at least a PRR… by 6–12 months", and refractory disease is "absence of at least a PRR to at least two different appropriate 6-month courses of therapy for active LN of any class". Proteinuria measurement is defined as "24-hour collection (g/24hr) or random urine protein-creatinine ratio (g/g)", and glomerular hematuria as "Urine sediment positive for acanthocytes, ≥ 5%, RBC casts".

### Ten common mistakes in the management of lupus nephritis [^3f6f8476]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Management of patients with lupus nephritis can be complex and challenging. We suggest that there are some widely held misconceptions about lupus, and unfortunately, these underpin the treatment of many patients. There is little evidence to support the common assumption that intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide is the best treatment for lupus nephritis. Although there is much focus on which immunosuppressive agent to use, too little attention is paid to the proper dose and duration of corticosteroids and concomitant therapy with antimalarial agents. Many clinicians reflexively perform kidney biopsies when these biopsies may be high risk and not influence therapy. There is little emphasis on or awareness of nonadherence to therapy, which is an underappreciated cause of treatment resistance. Resolution of proteinuria and hematuria can take a long time, and immunotherapy should not be intensified based on urine sediment alone. Furthermore, the intensity of the immunosuppression must be considered in the context of lupus nephritis class and duration of kidney damage. Finally, clinicians are aware of the risks of pregnancy in the face of active lupus, but assume that their patients also are aware of this and forget to discuss this with them. With a combined experience of more than 50 years in managing children and adults with lupus, we offer our impression of recurrent mistakes in the management of lupus in general, with a focus on treatment of lupus nephritis.

### A proteinuria cut-off level of 0.7 g / day after 12 months of treatment best predicts long-term renal outcome in lupus nephritis: data from the MAINTAIN nephritis trial [^11218f05]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since permanent renal impairment is mostly a late event in LN, only trials or cohorts with long-term follow-up can unmask patients with poor renal outcome and allow us to test the validity of short-term predictors, such as the kinetics of proteinuria decrease during the 1st year of treatment. The data shown here, computed from the MNT, demonstrate (1) that achievement of a proteinuria value < 0.7 g/day at month 12 best predicts good renal outcome at 7 years; and (2) that inclusion of microscopic haematuria in the set of outcome criteria at month 12 undermines the sensitivity of early proteinuria decrease for the detection of patients with good outcome.

These observations are consistent with those derived from the ELNT. Thus, Dall'Era et al demonstrated that a cut-off proteinuria value < 0.8 g/day at month 12 maximised sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of good renal outcome and that addition of the results of urinalysis negatively impacted early identification of patients with good outcome, with a very comparable drop in sensitivity from 81% to 47%. We suggest that such a consistency across two distinct trials strengthens the validity of our conclusions.

The finding that haematuria did not contribute as a surrogate for long-term kidney outcomes is not so surprising. In a multicentre trial, it is difficult to ensure that the analysis of the urine sediment is done uniformly. The number of RBCs/hpf depends on the volume in which the pellet of sediment is resuspended. This is not standardised and if the volume is large the cellular elements in the pellet will be diluted and the counts inaccurate. The time of urine collection is important, and how long urine sits before urinalysis may affect the sediment, especially RBC casts. Additionally, there are many reasons for haematuria in a population of mainly young women. The red cells specific for glomerular bleeding, and thus indicative of LN, are dysmorphic and are called acanthocytes. While these cells are enumerated in centres that specialise in glomerular diseases, in clinical trials all RBCs are counted, and these are often eumorphic and from the lower urinary tract. We do not discount the value of urine sediment examination. If urine handling could be standardised and the reader focused on the elements of the urine that truly indicate glomerular injury, urinalysis may contribute to a surrogate end point of renal response.

Monitoring lupus nephritis activity — The gold standard for assessing proteinuria, the 24-hour urine collection, is challenging to implement in clinical practice; random urine protein-to-creatinine ratios are usually adequate. The first void of the day sample is the most accurate for the spot urine collection but may not be feasible, and unexpected results on random testing should be followed by a 24-hour collection, especially before any change in therapy. In people with LN who have not achieved CRR, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria at least every 3 months; in people with LN in sustained clinical renal remission, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months.

Lupus nephritis — management algorithm for patients with unsatisfactory response to initial therapy outlines the following steps. Verify adherence to treatment. Ensure adequate dosing of immunosuppressive medications by measuring plasma drug levels if applicable or available (check mycophenolic acid level if on mycophenolic acid analogs/check infusion records if on cyclophosphamide). Repeat biopsy if concern for chronicity or other diagnosis (e.g., thrombotic microangiopathy). Consider switching to an alternative recommended treatment regimen when there is persistent active disease. Consider the following in patients refractory to first-line treatment regimens: Addition of rituximab or other biologic therapies; Extended course of i.v. pulse cyclophosphamide; Enrollment in clinical trials if eligible.

### One-third of patients with lupus nephritis classified as complete responders continue to accrue progressive renal damage despite resolution of proteinuria [^a2941b1e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge that proteinuria remains an important biomarker in current clinical practice. At the population level, proteinuria is still generally successful at risk stratifying which patients will progress to severe CKD, especially ESRD. Follow-up analyses of both the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trialand the Euro-Lupus Nephritis cohortdetermined that proteinuria of < 700–800 mg/g after 12 months of treatment was generally predictive of a positive long-term renal outcome, defined as a serum creatinine of ≤ 1.0 mg/dL after 7 years in these studies. The sensitivity and specificity of this proteinuria threshold in predicting a positive long-term outcome were 70%–80% in both cohorts. While this demonstrates the broad prognostic ability of proteinuria, it also indicates that there were a significant portion of patients for whom reduced proteinuria did not portend long-term renal protection or vice versa. This is conceptually consistent with the results of our work and likewise highlights the limitation of proteinuria as a metric of treatment success for any given individual. It is additionally worth noting that a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL would represent a 20%–30% loss of eGFR for most young women who start with an eGFR of > 100 pre-LN, as in the patients in this study.

Our work complements prior studies which used protocol kidney biopsies in LN, which have shown that proteinuria can be absent in the presence of active renal histology (or vice versa). Wakasugi et al performed renal biopsies on nearly 200 patients with lupus with and without clinical renal involvement, which was defined as proteinuria > 400 mg/g, active urinary sediment, and/or eGFR < 67 mL/min/1.73 m² in their analysis. They discovered that up to 20% of cases of class III, IV and V LN diagnosed on biopsy were entirely clinically silent based on the criteria above. More recently, De Rosa et al performed per protocol renal biopsies on a subset of patients with LN who had been in renal remission for at least 12 months. Persistent histological activity was present in 44% of these participants (despite resolution of proteinuria), and the activity index on biopsy could accurately predict which participants would experience a renal flare when immunosuppression was tapered. Malvar et al similarly identified a discordance between clinical and histological features in patients with proliferative LN: one-third of patients with clinical response had persistently high histological activity, and roughly two-thirds of patients in histological remission would still be considered clinically active based on the presence of proteinuria.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^5de0c42d]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis — Diagnosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) emphasizes longitudinal surveillance, risk vigilance, and biopsy interpretation: Patients with SLE should be actively and regularly monitored, and a high index of suspicion should be maintained for patients of Asian, African/Caribbean, and Hispanic descent; childhood-onset SLE is associated with a higher incidence of lupus nephritis (LN) and more severe disease than adult-onset SLE. Although a proteinuria level of 500 mg/d is suggested as a threshold for further investigations, clinicians are cautioned that proteinuria severity may appear relatively "insignificant" despite severe active nephritis. Because clinical findings do not always correlate with the extent or severity of kidney involvement, a kidney biopsy is useful to confirm the diagnosis and for the assessment of activity and chronicity features that inform treatment decisions and prognosis. Kidney biopsies should be read by an experienced kidney pathologist and classified according to the International Society of Nephrology (ISN)/Renal Pathology Society (RPS) scheme; electron microscopy, where available, is helpful, and clinicians should pay attention to descriptions that distinguish potentially reversible active lesions from chronic damage not reversible by immunosuppressive medications.

Class III/IV (± V) LN after triple immunosuppressive therapy — management by response: In people who have undergone triple immunosuppressive therapy and achieved a complete renal response, we conditionally recommend continuing the same immunosuppressive regimen. In those with a partial renal response (PRR), we conditionally recommend individualizing therapy depending on clinical factors that include the trajectory of response. If the patient with PRR is improving with reduction in proteinuria and increasing/stabilization of eGFR, continuation of the initial triple regimen with continued glucocorticoid taper is reasonable; however, if there are indications of worsening disease activity, we suggest altering therapy. A repeat kidney biopsy may be helpful, and a specific duration of therapy is not recommended due to variability in clinical presentations.

### Renal biopsy in lupus patients with low levels of proteinuria [^e09ac847]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Early and accurate detection of kidney involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) improves outcomes. Renal biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis of lupus nephritis (LN). In the absence of acute renal failure (ARF), moderate levels of proteinuria (> 1000 mg/24 h) have been recommended by some to justify biopsy. We investigated whether patients with lower levels of proteinuria without ARF have significant renal disease and should be routinely biopsied.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 21 SLE patients with 24-h urine protein < 1000 mg who underwent kidney biopsies. Indications for biopsy included new-onset proteinuria, increasing proteinuria, or hematuria (> 5 red blood cells per high power field). No patient had ARF.

Results

Sixteen of 21 (77%) biopsies were diagnostic of LN: 3 class II, 10 class III (5 superimposed class V), 2 class IV (one superimposed class V), and one with class V. One patient had thrombotic microangiopathy. The remaining 4 (23%) patients had non-lupus renal disease. Thirteen patients with class III or greater LN required alterations in therapeutic regimen because of biopsy findings. Of 7 patients without hematuria at the time of biopsy, 4 (57%) had class III, IV, or V LN. One patient without hematuria and < 500 mg/24 h proteinuria had class III LN.

Conclusion

We found significant renal involvement (Class III, IV, or V LN) in SLE patients with < 1000 mg proteinuria with or without hematuria. Our findings suggest that biopsy be strongly considered in this patient population.

### Case report: lupus nephritis with autoantibodies to complement alternative pathway proteins and C3 gene mutation [^7e82cf89]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

In 1997, a 20 year-old woman was admitted to the hospital due to renal insufficiency and nephrotic syndrome. She presented lower extremity oedema and high blood pressure, but no articular or cutaneous manifestations. Laboratory analysis showed serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dl, serum albumin 2.2 g/dl and proteinuria 4.7 g/24 h with hematuria. C3 and C4 levels were reduced (12.2 and 5.9 mg/dl, respectively), anti-nuclear and anti-DNA autoantibodies were positive. Other autoantibodies, including anti-GBM and C3NeF, were negative. A renal biopsy showed generalized and diffuse glomerular involvement, endocapillary hypercellularity with luminal occlusion and hyaline thrombi. Moderate mesangial proliferation in addition to acute inflammatory infiltrate was observed. Subendothelial deposits with wire loop images were present. On direct immunoflourescence, irregular deposits of C3, C1q, IgM, IgG and IgA were evident in the capillary walls and mesangium. The patient was diagnosed with active, diffuse, global, proliferative glomerulonephritis class IV-G lupus nephritis (Figure 1 A).

### Lupus nephritis in Africa: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^e29250da]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

This systematic review identified and analyzed sixteen cases of lupus nephritis (LN) reported from four African countries: Tunisia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Ghana. The cases included both individual case reports and case series published between 2018 and 2024. The patients were mostly female, with a female-to-male ratio of 7:1. Their ages ranged from 22 to 82 years, with clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, biopsy classification, treatment regimens, and clinical outcomes detailed in the respective studies in Table 2.

Table 1
Quality assessment summary of included studies

Table 2
Clinical characteristics of lupus nephritis cases in Africa

Several case reports/series published in French and Arabic could not be included due to translation limitations, which may bias the results.

Demographic characteristics

Out of the 16 patients, 14 (87.5%) were female, and 2 (12.5%) were male. The age distribution ranged from 22 years (a Ghanaian male) to 82 years (a Tunisian male), with most patients in their third to fifth decades of life. This aligns with the known epidemiological pattern of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and LN, which predominantly affects women of reproductive age.

Clinical presentations

The predominant presenting symptoms included nephrotic syndrome (defined by significant proteinuria and edema), hypertension, and generalized fatigue. Patients from Nigeria and Tanzania, especially those in the case series by Sulaiman et al. and Ghosh et al. commonly presented with recurrent leg swelling, facial puffiness, dyspnea, and hypertension. The 38-year-old Tunisian woman presented with lower extremity edema, weight loss, and fatigue, symptoms consistent with nephrotic-range proteinuria and systemic illness. Meanwhile, the 82-year-old Tunisian male reported vague systemic symptoms including abdominal discomfort and breathlessness.

One Ghanaian case by Tannor et al. involved a 22-year-old male who presented with hematuria, oliguria, and signs of advanced renal failure, including markedly reduced urine output and hypertensive urgency.

### Very delayed lupus nephritis: a report of three cases and literature review [^e6423c3c]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Case 2

A 15-year-old Indian woman was diagnosed with SLE after she presented with an inflammatory polyarthritis, headaches, fatigue, malar rash and alopecia. She had a positive ANA (> 1:320), anti-Ro and anti-dsDNA antibodies with normal C3 levels. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine and afterwards with azathioprine and prednisolone for a period of 2 years. Subsequently, she was maintained only on hydroxychloroquine.

Seven years after diagnosis she developed a flare consisting of vasculitis of her fingers and toes, arthritis, facial rash and alopecia, dyspnoea and mouth ulcers. Steroid therapy was not effective and she was treated with one cycle of cyclophosphamide and two infusions of rituximab to achieve disease control. She had subsequent mild flares of arthritis and vasculitis well controlled with steroids despite shingles and chest infections.

Immunologically, she usually had a normal anti-dsDNA antibody level, a low C3 level and mainly normal values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In the last 2 years, her anti-dsDNA antibody levels increased with worsening low C3, despite being asymptomatic.

After 17 years of SLE, age 32, she developed proteinuria for the first time with a UPCR of 148 mg/mmol. Her inflammatory markers were low, C3 and anti-dsDNA levels stable. A urine sample was repeated to confirm the proteinuria which was negative.

About 5 months after, she had another flare with dyspnoea, arthritis, malar rash and mouth ulcers. She was again found to have proteinuria, this time with mild hypertension and oedema. The UPCR was now 986 mg/mmol and the eGFR fell to 69 mL/min/1.73 m². Inflammatory markers were only slightly elevated (ESR = 28 mm/hour; CRP = 3.6 mg/L) but there was evidence of SLE serological activity (anti-dsDNA = 1847 IU/mL; C3 = 0.38 g/L). She underwent a kidney biopsy which confirmed the LN diagnosis consistent with WHO active class IV+V with patchy background parenchymal oedema without chronic damage. She was started on MMF 2 g/day with prednisolone 1 mg/kg (followed by a decreasing dose until reaching 20 mg/day) and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day. Later, two infusions of rituximab (1 g each) were given due to incomplete response. She is currently stable in complete remission. Her levels of anti-dsDNA and C3 normalised.

### Lupus nephritis management guidelines compared [^a43c40fc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

In the past years, many (randomized) trials have been performed comparing the treatment strategies for lupus nephritis. In 2012, these data were incorporated in six different guidelines for treating lupus nephritis. These guidelines are European, American and internationally based, with one separate guideline for children. They offer information on different aspects of the management of lupus nephritis including induction and maintenance treatment of the different histological classes, adjunctive treatment, monitoring of the patient, definitions of response and relapse, indications for (repeat) renal biopsy, and additional challenges such as the presence of vascular complications, the pregnant SLE patient, treatment in children and adolescents and considerations about end-stage renal disease and transplantation. In this review, we summarize the guidelines, determine the common ground between them, highlight the differences and discuss recent literature.

### Etiology and clinical diagnosis… [^dc34d34f]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Radiographic Assessment of the Upper Urinary Tract Intravenous urography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography often are used to evaluate the upper urinary tract of persons with microscopic hematuria. Although many studies have been conducted comparing the three radiographic methods, no clear evidence-based imaging guidelines are available.

1. INTRAVENOUS UROGRAPHY Traditionally, intravenous urography has been the initial radiographic approach for the evaluation of the upper urinary tract in patients with microscopic hematuria. 7, 20 It defines the anatomy of the urologic tract from the kidney to the bladder, and its advantages include relatively low cost and ready availability. 8 One concern regarding intravenous urography as the sole radiographic evaluation of microscopic hematuria is its limited sensitivity for detecting small renal masses.

21 In a recent study, 21 investigators found that intravenous urography identified 85 percent of lesions greater than 3 cm in diameter but only 21 to 52 percent of smaller lesions. Intravenous urography is superior to CT in detecting transitional cell carcinoma involving the kidney or ureter but has limited application in the evaluation of the bladder and urethra. 7 Patients undergoing intravenous urography are exposed to contrast media that is potentially nephrotoxic, especially to patients with renal insufficiency. The cost savings of intravenous urography may be offset by the frequent need for follow-up study with ultrasonography or CT for indeterminate findings or to better characterize a renal lesion as cystic or solid. RENAL ULTRASONOGRAPHY Ultrasonography is the least expensive and safest choice for evaluating microscopic hematuria because it does not expose the patient to intravenous radiographic contrast medium.

It is also an appropriate choice for the evaluation of hematuria during pregnancy. Although ultrasonography is limited in its ability to detect solid tumors that are less than 3 cm in diameter, 22 masses 3 cm or greater in diameter, cysts, and hydronephrosis are detected with a high degree of sensitivity. 20 Ultrasonography has been found to be more sensitive than intravenous urography in detecting renal cell carcinoma but less so in detecting urothelial transitional cell carcinoma. 1, 20 The sensitivity of ultrasonography for detecting renal calculi has been found to be 64 to 96 percent, significantly lower than with noncontrast CT.
20. COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY Microscopic hematuria associated with renal colic is best evaluated with CT in light of its high sensitivity for identifying renal calculi.

21, 23 Unenhanced helical CT is more accurate for evaluating patients with renal colic compared with ultrasonography, intravenous urography, or plain radiography and has replaced these imaging techniques as the test of choice in many institutions. 23 When compared with intravenous urography, unenhanced helical CT has the advantage of higher accuracy, decreased radiation dose, faster examination time, and improved sizing and localization of stones. Contrast-enhanced CT has favorable sensitivity over intravenous urography or ultrasonography for identifying small renal parenchymal masses. Contrast-enhanced CT also enables detection of aneurysms in vessels that run along the ureter, a potentially life-threatening, albeit uncommon, condition. 21 Renal and perirenal abscesses are best evaluated by contrast-enhanced CT.

### Is per-protocol kidney biopsy required in lupus nephritis? [^1fefa8b4]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Baseline kidney biopsy is recommended in lupus nephritis (LN). Biopsy allows to classify different forms of LN and differentiate other forms of renal involvement, such as tubulo-interstitial nephritis or thrombotic microangiopathy. The indications for repeat biopsy are more controversial. Some authors feel that good clinical monitoring is sufficient to assess prognosis and make therapeutic decisions. Based on the recently demonstrated discordance between clinical and histological response, some physicians recommend per-protocol biopsies either at 6 months in stable patients to verify the response to induction therapy, or after one-to-two years to assess treatment efficacy and tune the duration of maintenance therapy. Others recommend repeating kidney biopsy in case of incomplete response or to discriminate between active and chronic lesions. By definition, a per-protocol kidney biopsy differs from a repeat biopsy in that the former is foreseen at fixed timepoints, regardless of the clinical response. Although any decision should always consider the patient's overall clinical condition, there are no doubts that repeat kidney biopsy represents a useful tool in difficult cases to evaluate treatment response, modulate treatment intensity, and predict long-term renal outcome both in quiescent lupus and during flares. How to harmonize per-protocol biopsies in the LN course remains challenging.

### Treatment for lupus nephritis [^7fb92e8a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Lupus nephritis is the renal manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - a disease mainly affecting young women with substantial morbidity and mortality. It is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria I - VI based on histology. WHO Class IV is a diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis which has the worst prognosis without treatment, with a reported 17% five year survival in the era 1953–1969. This survival was 82% in the early 1990's and continues to improve. An important factor behind this has been the use of cytotoxics such as cyclophosphamide in addition to steroids.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different treatments in biopsy-proven proliferative lupus nephritis (LN).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (January 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Randomised Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966–31 January 2003), EMBASE (1980–31 January 2003) and handsearched reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing treatments for PLN in both adult and paediatric patients with Class III, IV, Vc, Vd lupus nephritis were included. All treatments were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted and quality assessed independently by two reviewers, with differences resolved by discussion. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RR) and measurements on continuous scales are reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analysis by study quality, drug type and drug route have been performed where possible to explore reasons for heterogeneity.

Main Results

Of 920 articles identified, 25 were RCTs suitable for inclusion, which enrolled 915 patients. The majority compared cyclophosphamide or azathioprine plus steroids versus steroids alone. Cyclophosphamide plus steroids reduced the risk of doubling of serum creatinine (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.88) compared to steroids alone but had no impact on mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.82). The risk of ovarian failure was significantly increased (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.34). Azathioprine plus steroids reduced the risk of all cause mortality compared to steroids alone (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.99), but did not alter renal outcomes. Neither therapy was associated with increased risk of major infection. No benefit was found with addition of plasma exchange to cyclophosphamide or azathioprine plus steroids for mortality (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.02), doubling of serum creatinine (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.26) or end-stage renal failure (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.57). There was also no increased risk of major infection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.37).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Until future RCTs of newer agents are completed, the current use of cyclophosphamide combined with steroids remains the best option to preserve renal function in proliferative LN. The smallest effective dose and shortest duration of treatment should be used to minimise gonadal toxicity, without compromising efficacy.

Pure class V lupus nephritis — active, newly diagnosed or flare — is managed using a proteinuria threshold and response milestones. The decision node is "Proteinuria ≥ 1g". If no, treat with "Hydroxychloroquine + renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors + glucocorticoids AND / OR mycophenolic acid analogs OR AZA OR CNI". If yes, use "Hydroxychloroquine + renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors + GC: pulse IV + 0.5 mg/kg/day oral (max 40 mg) with taper AND mycophenolic acid analogs AND calcineurin inhibitor". The initial response target is "At least PRR in 6–12 months"; if achieved, aim for "Goal GC dose ≤ 5 mg/day by 6 months" and "Once complete renal response is achieved, continue therapy for 3–5 years". If not achieved, "Assess adherence" and "Switch to alternate triple therapy that may include anti-CD20 agents", then reassess for "At least PRR to 2nd course of therapy in 6–12 months". If still not achieved, "Assess adherence", "Consider repeat kidney biopsy to rule out other diagnoses or advanced chronicity", and "Consider anti-CD20, combination therapy with MPAA, belimumab and CNI, or referral to investigational therapy". A footnote states that "Treatment should be escalated or changed earlier, even at ≤ 3 months, in patients with rapidly declining GFR or increasing proteinuria due to risk for potentially irreversible damage", and that anti‑CD20 examples include "Rituximab, obinutuzumab or others".

### Repeated renal biopsy – A predictive tool to assess the probability of renal flare in lupus nephritis [^e8401451]. American Journal of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

How one responds to treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) is based on clinical features, but the activity in renal biopsy (RB) is uncertain. We have described the therapeutic decisions after performing a repeated RB on the assessment of response to intravenous cyclophosphamide (IC) and the possible prognostic role of this repeated RB.

Methods

Clinical, laboratory and histological features at the initial RB and repeated RB were analyzed in 35 patients.

Results

Data in the initial versus the repeated RB were serum creatinine 1.23 ± 1.08 and 0.96 ± 0.45 mg/dl (p < 0.05), glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min in 12 and 5% patients and proteinuria 4.1 ± 2.8 vs. 0.6 1.1 g/day (p < 0.05). Significant differences were detected in hematuria, nephrotic syndrome and serological immune features. Complete renal remission was reached in 60% (n = 21) at the time of the repeated RB, partial remission in 31.4% (n = 11), and no response IC in 8.6% (n = 3). Nine patients showed proliferative forms in the repeated RB, 3 of them had proteinuria < 1 g/day. Just after the repeated RB, 34.3% increased or started a new immunosuppressive therapy, 17.1% remained with the same complementary IST, and 14.3% decreased or stopped it. In the follow-up post repeated RB, 34.5% without active lesions showed a renal flare versus 77.8% with active lesions (p = 0.04). The mean time was 120 and 45 months, respectively.

Conclusion

A repeated biopsy in LN distinguishes patients in true remission from those in apparent remission. By doing this, we can identify patients who could benefit from intensified treatment and for whom unnecessary treatment methods can be modified or eliminated.

### Lupus nephritis: clinical presentations and outcomes in the 21st century [^cea7b60f]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Standard of care (SoC)

The improvement in survival over the past decades among LN patients was mainly due to the introduction of effective and less toxic drugs and more tolerated regimens. GC monotherapy, especially in the form of intravenous (i.v.) pulses, was implemented after 1980 with the association of immunosuppressants such as azathioprine (AZA) or CYC. The concept of maintenance therapy has established beside induction, becoming part of the clinical practice. In the past decade, the use of AZA for induction and maintenance has decreased in favour of MMF, which has become a mainstay in the treatment as it was shown to be as efficacious but less toxic than CYC in the induction phase and more effective than AZA during maintenance for flare prevention. At the turn of the new millennium, in view of optimizing efficacy and reducing side effects, the low-dose i.v. CYC induction protocol was approved for the treatment of LN as it was demonstrated to be safer and equally effective compared with the high-dose regimen hitherto in use.

According to current recommendations, the therapeutic strategy for LN aims to achieve rapid remission or at least partial response within 6–12 months (discussed below), to prevent flares and preserve renal function, reduce morbidity and mortality and preserve fertility. The choice of the treatment mainly depends on the histological class, on activity and chronicity indexes and includes immunosuppressants, adjuvants and symptomatic drugs.

For Class II, current recommendations do not suggest immunosuppression, while previous recommendations indicated low-to-moderate dose of GC alone or in combination with AZA if proteinuria > 1 g/24 h, especially in the presence of glomerular haematuria.

For class III and IV, there is unanimous agreement on an induction treatment based on high dose pulses of methyl-prednisolone followed by oral GC and MMF or i.v. CYC.

### Very delayed lupus nephritis: a report of three cases and literature review [^3c42a0f9]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) affects up to 50% of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with a worse prognosis. LN usually develops within the first 5years of the onset of the disease. We report three patients with very delayed LN (DLN) diagnosed after 15 or more years after SLE diagnosis. The three patients were non-Caucasian women with adolescent or adult-onset SLE. Each had antinuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-Ro antibodies. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed for each. Their disease courses were characterised by sporadic non-renal flares controlled by steroids and, in two cases, by one cycle of rituximab. Unexpectedly, they developed proteinuria, haematuria and lowering of estimated glomerular filtration rate with clinical signs of renal disease. LN was confirmed by renal biopsy. Reviewing them, each showed serological signs of increasing disease activity (rising levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and fall in C3) that predated clinical or laboratory signs of LN by 1-3years. Reviewing the literature, we found a lack of knowledge about DLN starting more than 15 years after SLE diagnosis. With the increasing life expectancy of patients with SLE it is likely that more cases of very DLN will emerge.

Operational definition

Lupus nephritis

An inflammation which affects the nephrons within the kidneys as a result of the complication of SLE. The patient should fulfill the diagnosis of KDIGO criteria. These includes; proteinuria of 0.5 g/d and above, serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl and above or evidence of decreased or decreasing eGFR, active urinary sediment (≥ 5% RBC/HPF, ≥ 5% WBC/HPF cellular casts) and biopsy-proven LN.

Complete renal remission

The KDIGO guideline defines complete remission as a reduction in proteinuria to < 0.5 g/g measured as the urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) from 24-h urine collection and stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10–15% of baseline) within 6–12 months of starting therapy, but could take more than 12 months.

Partial renal remission

According to the KDIGO guideline partial remission is defined by a reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to < 3 g/g measured as the UPCR from 24-h urine collection and stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10–15% of baseline) within 6–12 months of starting therapy.

No response/non responders

Failure to achieve a partial or complete response within 6–12 months of starting therapy.

Baseline serum creatinine

The initial value of serum creatinine recorded.

Good prognosis

Patients that achieve complete or partial remission during the study period are used as favorable clinical outcomes.

Poor prognosis

Patients that have no response, progression to ESRD or death at the end of the study period are used as unfavorable clinical outcomes.

Hypertension

Blood pressure above or equal to 140/90 mmHg or using of antihypertensive medications on regular follow-up.

Leucopenia

WBC count of < 4000/mm³ in the absence of other causes (at least once ruled out other causes).

### The KDIGO practice guideline on glomerulonephritis: reading between the (guide) lines – application to the individual patient [^dd974ea3]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guideline for glomerulonephritis is designed to assist health-care providers in treating patients with glomerular diseases. A guideline is not a set of rules but is intended to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on the available evidence. Due to its general nature and the variability of strength of the available studies, it is often difficult to directly apply a guideline to the care of an individual patient. This commonly relates to the limited generalizability of the evidence, i.e., does not cover every clinical scenario. To underscore this point, we have introduced within the context of the glomerulonephritis guideline cases with specific features to illustrate the constant need for clinical judgment. These vignettes are intended to demonstrate how the best treatment plans should be individualized and take into account patient preference and clinical acumen, as well as the best available evidence.

### 2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis [^113a401b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Inadequate renal response or refractory lupus nephritis — In people with any LN class with inadequate renal response (i.e., have not achieved at least a partial renal response by 6–12 months), we conditionally recommend consideration of escalation strategies based on prior regimen: for initial dual therapy, escalate to triple therapy (glucocorticoids plus either MPAA plus belimumab, MPAA plus CNI, or ELNT CYC plus belimumab); for initial triple therapy, change to an alternative listed triple therapy or consider addition of an anti-CD20 agent to MPAA or ELNT CYC. Close monitoring is emphasized because treatment should be escalated or changed earlier, even at ≤ 3 months, in patients with rapidly declining GFR or increasing proteinuria due to risk of potentially irreversible damage. GPS states medication dose and patient adherence should be assessed regularly throughout treatment as an important first step in evaluating inadequate response or refractory LN. For refractory disease (ie, failed two standard therapy courses), we conditionally recommend treatment escalation to a more intensive regimen, including the addition of anti-CD20 agents, combination therapy with three non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressive agents (ie, MPAA, belimumab and CNI), or referral for investigational therapy; when refractory LN is diagnosed, one may consider a kidney biopsy, and in cases of true refractory LN, meta-analyses suggest that 80–90% of patients convert to partial or complete responders with rituximab.

### Case report: anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease with normal renal function [^ad5b9cc2]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis caused by autoantibodies against the α3-chain of type IV collagen in the GBM.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old girl with hematuria and proteinuria due to anti-GBM nephritis was diagnosed with hematuria and proteinuria during a school urine screening program. Her blood pressure and serum creatinine levels were normal. Her hematuria and proteinuria persisted for several months. Since a spot urine protein to creatinine ratio was around 7 g/g Cre, a percutaneous renal biopsy was performed. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated a linear pattern for immunoglobulin G along the entire GBM. Chest computed tomography was normal. Anti-GBM antibody assays were reported as slightly raised; thus, the diagnosis was anti-GBM disease with normal renal function. Treatment included plasma exchange, intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone, and cyclophosphamide as a mainstay medication. The treatment was rapidly effective with an immediate decrease in anti-GBM titers and proteinuria.

Conclusions

Cases of anti-GBM disease with normal renal function in children are rare. Treatment in children has not been established; therefore, clinicians need to carefully select an effective treatment because the prognosis is poor.

### New-onset autoantibody-mediated nephritis during ustekinumab therapy for psoriasis in patients with and without prior systemic lupus erythematosus [^20ebaf49]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case reports

Case 1

A woman in her 30s presented with hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, and pericarditis. SLE was the diagnosis. Treatment included plasmapheresis, high-dose prednisone, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine. One year later, biopsy-proven psoriasis developed. Multiple therapies including methotrexate, acitretin, and antimalarial withdrawal failed to improve her skin condition (Fig 1). Her psoriasis worsened over 6 years. She was started on ustekinumab (45 mg every 12 weeks). This treatment improved her skin condition at 4 months (Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index [PASI], 13.3 to 1.8). Anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies developed shortly after the initiation of ustekinumab. She presented 6 months later with increasing fatigue, vasculitis, and vasculopathic skin lesions on both palms and proximal nail fold, increasing anti–double-stranded DNA, and hypocomplementemia. This condition was treated as a lupus flare with intravenous methylprednisone followed by prednisone. Twenty months after ustekinumab initiation, she had worsening fatigue, bilateral pleural effusions, pancytopenia, and increased inflammatory markers. Prednisone and azathioprine dosage were increased. Scaly plaques to both palms were noted with histopathology consistent with acral discoid LE. At 24 months, she had proteinuria and hematuria. Renal biopsy showed class IV S(A) diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis with lupus microangiopathy (Fig 1). She was treated with cyclophosphamide, a switch from azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil, and ustekinumab discontinuation.

### One-third of patients with lupus nephritis classified as complete responders continue to accrue progressive renal damage despite resolution of proteinuria [^df424433]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuric response at 1 year did not predict early CKD

Proteinuric response status was determined for each participant as described in the Methods section. Response status at 1 year did not differentiate between the eGFR trajectory groups (table 4). Notably, 55% of participants with progressive eGFR loss (n = 6 of 11) would have been classified as complete responders, traditionally viewed as low risk for ongoing renal damage, based on < 500 mg/g urine protein at 1 year after biopsy. Among all complete responders at 1 year, 33% continued to accrue significant renal damage despite standard of care therapy (n = 6 of 18). These results were unchanged when we repeated this analysis using a slightly relaxed threshold of < 700 mg/g urine protein as the definition of response. Three additional participants would be classified as responders per this threshold, where two maintained a stable eGFR, and one experienced progressive eGFR loss. Thus, again, 33% of responders (n = 7 of 21) experienced eGFR loss despite proteinuric response. In the eGFR decline group, 64% would be classified as responders (n = 7 of 11) compared with 58% (n = 14 of 24) responders in the stable eGFR group (p = 1.0).

Table 4
Response status (based on proteinuria < 500 mg/g) at 1 year per eGFR trajectory group

Serum albumin and the presence of active urine sediment (ie, > 5 red blood cells per high-power field and/or presence of cellular casts) at 1 year also did not significantly differ between the eGFR trajectory groups. After 1 year, the mean serum albumin was 3.7 g/dL in the stable eGFR group vs 3.6 g/dL in the declining eGFR group (p = 0.67). Active urine sediment was present in 20% (n = 5 of 25; one patient had missing urine microscopy) of the stable eGFR group vs 0% (n = 0 of 11) of the declining eGFR group (p = 0.30).

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the management of lupus Nephritis [^bd2ad5d3]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases was published in 2021. Since then, the pace of drug development for glomerular diseases has accelerated, due in large part to rapidly accumulating insights into disease pathogenesis from genetic and molecular studies of afflicted patients. To keep the Glomerular Diseases Guideline as current as possible, KDIGO made a commitment to the nephrology community to provide periodic updates, based on new developments for each disease. After the 2021 guideline was published, two novel drugs received regulatory approval for the management of lupus nephritis, leading to the first KDIGO guideline update. Herein, an executive summary of the most important guideline changes from the Lupus Nephritis chapter is provided as a quick reference.

### Prolidase deficiency associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): single site experience and literature review [^d2ec9d10]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Three years later the patient was admitted following seven days of fever, with left lower lobe pneumonia, macroscopic hematuria and proteinuria. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated acute renal failure, pancytopenia and hypoalbuminemia. Immunological studies showed a highly positive antinuclear antibodies assay (ANA), and a positive double stranded DNA titer. There were low levels of C3 and C4. Anti-Ro/SS-A anti La/SS-B, anti-RNP, anti-SM and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were negative by immunodiffusion. A direct Coombs test was positive. A renal biopsy was performed and demonstrated glomerular changes consistent with WHO Class IV Lupus nephritis. Following diagnosis of SLE, treatment with pulse methylprednisolone and pulse cyclophosphamide was begun. Nevertheless, the patient's renal function deteriorated rapidly; she became anuric and required hemodialysis. With continuing medication and dialysis over five months, the renal function improved, and the patient could gradually be weaned off hemodialysis, although massive proteinuria persisted. A few months later she presented with a focal seizure on her left side and hypertension. She underwent further evaluation including MRI of the brain which showed multiple bilateral subcortical white matter lesions mainly over the parietooccipital area with leptomeningeal enhancement. Her lumbar puncture results were normal. The findings were consistent with CNS vasculitis. The patient was treated with pulse methylprednisolone and continued therapy with pulse cyclophosphamide. Her seizures stopped and she recovered completely. Eventually, end-stage renal failure developed in spite of therapy with high dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and anti-hypertensive drugs. The patient has recently undergone successful renal transplantation. Her lupus disease has been inactive for the last year on only a low dose of daily steroids.

2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) lupus nephritis guideline — scope, methods, and key treatment principles: The objective is to provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis. The Core Team developed clinical questions using the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome); systematic literature reviews were completed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used, with the Voting Panel achieving a consensus ≥ 70% on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. The guideline presents 28 graded recommendations (7 strong, 21 conditional) and 13 ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the screening and management of lupus nephritis. Recommendations emphasize the unifying principle that lupus nephritis therapy is continuous and ongoing, rather than consisting of discrete induction/initial and maintenance/subsequent therapies, and specify that therapy should include pulse glucocorticoids followed by oral glucocorticoid taper and two additional immunosuppressive agents for 3–5 years for those achieving complete renal response.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^fa36a244]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) response definitions in clinical trials specify thresholds for proteinuria, kidney function, and timing. Complete response requires reduction in proteinuria < 0.5 g/g (50 mg/mmol) measured as the protein–creatinine ratio (PCR) from a 24-h urine collection, stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10%–15% of baseline), and achievement within 6–12 mo of starting therapy, though it could take more than 12 mo. Primary efficacy renal response is defined by PCR ≤ 0.7 g/g (70 mg/mmol) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that was no worse than 20% below the pre-flare value or ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², with no use of rescue therapy for treatment failure. Partial response requires a reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to < 3 g/g (300 mg/mmol) measured as the PCR from a 24-h urine collection, stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10%–15% of baseline), and achievement within 6–12 mo of starting therapy. No kidney response is failure to achieve a partial or complete response within 6–12 mo of starting therapy. For children < 18 years old, complete response is defined as proteinuria < 0.5 g/1.73 m² per day or < 300 mg/m² per day based on a 24-hour urine specimen.

### Tale of two nephropathies; co-occurring Alport syndrome and IgA nephropathy, a case report [^60f41a6f]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 27-year-old male with no prior past medical history presented to the Emergency Department complaining of 3 days of increased urinary frequency, dysuria, nocturia, and intermittent hematuria. The patient indicated episodes of tinnitus that predated urinary symptoms. He reported no constitutional symptoms and denied noticeable hearing loss, visual changes, flank pain, polydipsia, penile discharge, or genital sores prior to presentation. Notably, multiple family members had a history of kidney disease. His mother has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with no pertinent histologic findings on renal biopsy. The patients' elder brother died from renal failure of unknown cause at age 26 years.

Our patient presented with a blood pressure of 160/85 mmHg. His vitals were otherwise within normal limits. Physical exam showed no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness; his cardiopulmonary, ophthalmologic, and lower extremity exams showed no abnormalities. His labs were notable for elevated creatinine of 176.8 μmol/L (2.0 mg/dL), with a BUN of 5.7 mmol/L (16 mg/dL). Urine Dipstick revealed the presence of 2+ blood, 3+ protein; urine microscopy showed 6–10 Red Blood Cells (RBC) per high-powered field. His fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) was 0.6%, and serum osmolality was 295 mmol/kg (295 mOsm/kg).

The patient was admitted for observation due to his elevated blood pressure and pre-renal acute kidney injury with proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. He received intravenous fluids, however, creatinine remained between 165.35 to 171.53 μmol/L (1.87 to 1.94 mg/dL). The calculated GFR was 48 mL/min/1.73 m² using the CKD-EPI Creatinine equation. Twenty-four-hour urinary collection revealed non-nephrotic range proteinuria of 1.4 g. Further workup during this hospitalization, including serum creatinine kinase, protein electrophoresis, C3, C4, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), were all within normal limits. Renal ultrasound showed bilaterally increased echogenicity consistent with CKD, and no calculi or signs of hydronephrosis.

Regarding medical management for lupus nephritis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressive therapy, pure class V LN, ACR 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a triple immunosuppressive regimen consisting of pulse IV corticosteroids (250–1,000 mg methylprednisolone daily for 1–3 days, followed by oral corticosteroids at ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day with taper; maximum dose 40 mg/day), mycophenolic acid analog, and calcineurin inhibitor in patients with proteinuria ≥ 1 g/g.

### A proteinuria cut-off level of 0.7 g / day after 12 months of treatment best predicts long-term renal outcome in lupus nephritis: data from the MAINTAIN nephritis trial [^20771f9b]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The first lesson learned from these analyses is that assessment of microscopic haematuria should not be part of the response criteria used in LN trials, in contrast to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations, more so as interpretation of urinalyses is complicated by delays in sample examination, the use of automated techniques instead of microscopic reading and interference by menstrual-related haematuria.

The second implication deals with treatment options at the bedside after 1 year. Patients meeting the 0.7 g/day proteinuria target at month 12 (ie, 64% of the MNT cohort) can be reassured regarding their final renal outcome, based on the very high PPV (94%). In such patients, glucocorticoid tapering and withdrawal could be considered, based on their well known contribution to damage accrual, although only a controlled trial could test the safety of this proposal in terms of renal relapse rates. On the other hand, treatment decision will be more difficult in patients not achieving the 0.7 g/day target at month 12, due to the low NPV: two-thirds of these patients will still experience a good outcome in the long run. In this respect, the fact that the NPV is twice as high in patients with a low baseline proteinuria compared with those with higher values suggests that a treatment switch might be more appropriate for the former compared with the latter. The kinetics of proteinuria decrease is obviously pivotal in this decision process. Again, only a controlled trial could test the possibility that optimising therapy in partial responders would be beneficial, a hypothesis tested in the RING trial (RI tuximab in lupus N ephritis with remission as a G oal).

We acknowledge the limitations of our work. Data were acquired in a small patient population. Most subjects were Caucasians (79%) and suffered from their first episode of LN (87%). Further work is needed to improve the NPV which was not ameliorated by the use of a more stringent target, taking into account additional criteria, such as renal function or urinalysis. Yet, the robustness of our conclusions stems from the very similar results obtained in two prospectively followed cohorts.

### One-third of patients with lupus nephritis classified as complete responders continue to accrue progressive renal damage despite resolution of proteinuria [^2bdf22c4]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Treatment response in lupus nephritis (LN) is defined based on proteinuria, yet protocol kidney biopsy studies have shown that patients with lupus can have active nephritis in the absence of proteinuria. Using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) trajectories, we characterised early chronic kidney disease in LN and examined whether certain patients continue to accrue renal damage despite proteinuric response.

Methods

We conducted a single-centre study of patients diagnosed with their first episode of biopsy-proven class III, IV, and/or V LN (n = 37). For each patient, eGFR trajectory was graphed over 5 years following renal biopsy. Participants were divided into those with progressive eGFR loss (eGFR slope < −5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) versus those with stable eGFR. Participant demographics, renal biopsy features and response status at 1 year (urine protein to creatinine ratio < 500 mg/g) were compared between eGFR trajectory groups.

Results

Overall, 30% (n = 11) of participants accrued progressive eGFR loss despite standard of care therapy over the first 5 years following renal biopsy. There were no significant differences in baseline renal biopsy features, medication regimens or comorbidities between eGFR trajectory groups. Resolution of proteinuria at 1 year did not differentiate between groups: 6 of 18 (33%) of complete responders continued to accrue renal damage compared with 5 of 17 (29%) of non-responders. Response status could not be assigned for two participants in the stable eGFR group due to missing clinical information at 1 year.

Conclusions

We identified an understudied category of patients with LN who accrue progressive renal damage despite apparent response to standard of care therapy. Better definitions and biomarkers of response are needed to improve renal outcomes and trial design.

KDIGO practice points — In addition to graded recommendations, "KDIGO guidelines include 'practice points' to help clinicians better care for individual patients". "Practice points are consensus statements about a specific aspect of care, and they supplement recommendations for which a larger quantity of evidence was identified". "Although systematic reviews are not performed for clinical questions underlying practice points, they are often crafted to help readers implement the guidance from graded recommendation". "Practice points represent the expert judgment of the guideline Work Group, but they may also be based on limited evidence". "For example, practice points were provided on monitoring, frequency of testing, dosing adjustments for the severity of chronic kidney disease, and use of therapies in specific subgroup populations". "Practice points were sometimes formatted as a table, a figure, or an algorithm to make them easier to use in clinical practice".

KDIGO 2024 lupus nephritis guideline — recommendation rating key states that recommendation strength is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2 and the certainty of supporting evidence is graded A, B, C, or D. Level 1 implies for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action" and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 implies for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Certainty grades are defined as A High ("We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect".), B Moderate ("The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), C Low ("The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect".), and D Very low ("The estimate of the effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect".). Practice points are described as "consensus-based statements representing the expert judgment of the Work Group and are not graded" and "should not be seen as less important or a downgrade from graded recommendations".

### Renal response at 2 years post biopsy to predict long-term renal survival in lupus nephritis: a retrospective analysis of the hopkins lupus cohort [^f6a5f27a]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and severe manifestation of SLE that is present in 38% of patients at SLE diagnosis, and occurs in as many as 70% of patients with SLE during the course of their disease, depending on factors such as age, gender, race and ethnicity.LN accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. One study reported that patients with SLE and LN had an approximately threefold higher standardised mortality ratio than patients with SLE without LN (6.8 vs 2.4). End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition that ~22% to 26% of patients develop within 15 years after LN diagnosis and is a strong indicator of poor prognosis. Identifying early-stage predictors of long-term renal outcomes would allow for optimisation of LN treatment in clinical practice and a consistent and accurate evaluation of treatments in LN clinical trials.

Renal response is a frequently used treatment target in LN clinical trials. Most studies have used proteinuria level and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in their definition of renal response; however, there is no consensus on the precise combination and threshold levels for these outcome measures. As a result, the renal response endpoints used in LN clinical trials lack uniformity and it is questionable whether they accurately predict long-term kidney survival.

A retrospective analysis of real-world data from the Hopkins Lupus Cohort by Davidson et al examined the renal response definition used in the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab in Patients With Active Lupus Nephritis (BLISS-LN; GSK Study BEL114054; NCT01639339) clinical trial. The Hopkins Lupus Cohort is a prospective, longitudinal, real-world study of lupus activity, organ damage and treatment of patients with SLE, which began in 1987. Within this analysis, the renal response definition was largely aligned with the BLISS-LN primary endpoint at that time (ordinal response: complete, partial, no response) but with a modification to exclude urinary sediment. This response category assessed at 2 years post biopsy was found to be a predictor of long-term (up to 25 years) renal outcomes.

Class V lupus nephritis — treatment approach includes a suggested algorithm that divides patients into those with low-level proteinuria, whose treatment should be guided by extrarenal manifestations of SLE, and those with nephrotic syndrome, for whom corticosteroids in combination with another immunosuppressive agent may be more appropriate. Immunosuppressive therapy for isolated membranous LN (class V) depends on the level of proteinuria and should be given universally in patients with nephrotic syndrome.

### The management of lupus nephritis as proposed by EULAR / ERA 2019 versus KDIGO 2021 [^50890c92]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2019 and 2021, the European League for Rheumatism (EULAR) jointly with the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), respectively, released updated guidelines on the management of lupus nephritis (LN). The Immunology Working Group of the ERA reviewed and compared both updates. Recommendations were either consistent or differences were of negligible clinical relevance for: indication for kidney biopsy, kidney biopsy interpretation, treatment targets, hydroxychloroquine dosing, first-line initial immunosuppressive therapy for active class III, IV (± V) LN, pregnancy in LN, LN in paediatric patients and LN patients with kidney failure. Relevant differences in the recommended management relate to the recognition of lupus podocytopathies, uncertainties in steroid dosing, drug preferences in specific populations and maintenance therapy, treatment of pure class V LN, therapy of recurrent LN, evolving alternative drug options and diagnostic work-up of thrombotic microangiopathy. Altogether, both documents provide an excellent guidance to the growing complexity of LN management. This article endeavours to prevent confusion by identifying differences and clarifying discrepancies.

Objective

The objective is to provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis.

Methods

The Core Team developed clinical questions for screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis using the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were completed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the quality of evidence and to formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus ≥ 70% on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present 28 graded recommendations (7 strong, 21 conditional) and 13 ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the screening and management of lupus nephritis. Our recommendations focus on the unifying principle that lupus nephritis therapy is continuous and ongoing, rather than consisting of discrete induction/initial and maintenance/subsequent therapies. Therapy should include pulse glucocorticoids followed by oral glucocorticoid taper and two additional immunosuppressive agents for 3–5 years for those achieving complete renal response.

Conclusion

This guideline provides direction for clinicians regarding screening and treatment decisions for management of lupus nephritis. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each individual patient.

Class V lupus nephritis — suggested management is organized by proteinuria severity after "Kidney biopsy showing Class V lupus nephritis". The algorithm distinguishes "Low-level proteinuria" from "Nephrotic-range proteinuria", and advises to "Monitor the level of proteinuria and prevent or treat complications (e.g., thrombosis, dyslipidemia, edema)". For low-level proteinuria: "1 Renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control", "2 Immunosuppressive treatment guided by extrarenal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", and "3 Hydroxychloroquine". For nephrotic-range proteinuria: "1 Renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control", "2 Combined immunosuppressive treatment with glucocorticoid and one other agent (e.g., mycophenolic acid analogs, cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitor, rituximab, azathioprine). Insufficient data for recommendation of glucocorticoid regimen, but moderate or reduced dose preferred. Please refer to Practice Point 10.2.3.1.1"., and "3 Hydroxychloroquine". The terminal note states, "If proteinuria worsens and/or complications of proteinuria develop (e.g., thrombosis, dyslipidemia, edema), consider immunosuppressive therapy".

### Evaluation and randomised controlled trial of home urinalysis testing in patients with SLE at elevated risk for developing lupus nephritis: a study protocol [^2fb4d268]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods and analysis

Using a mixed methods approach, this study will develop, adapt and evaluate a home urinalysis protocol for patients at elevated risk of de novo LN or relapse. The initial approach is a feasibility pilot using a single-group trial design (n = 18), during which we will conduct a feasibility assessment and debriefing interviews to further refine the intervention. The final step is a larger comparative effectiveness trial (n = 160) and economic evaluation of the home urinalysis protocol.

Study population

The study includes patients with SLE considered at high risk of either developing de novo LN or having a relapse (flare) of pre-existing LN. Details on the New York University (NYU) Lupus Cohort, which is 91% women, 30% Hispanic, 16% Asian, 31% black and 46% white, have been published previously. The cohort members receive care at three dedicated sites including a public hospital. The inclusion criteria will be as follows:

The patient had previous kidney disease (documented UCPR > 0.5 as part of criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, The SLE International Collaborating Clinics Group or European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology and preferably a biopsy such that class can be recorded) and is in clinical remission as defined by a UPCR < 0.3 at the current visit regardless of any serologic activity. We include these patients because relapse of LN occurs in over one-third of patients.
Patients without any history of previous kidney disease require a diagnosis of SLE within 5 years of the current visit, a positive anti-dsDNA and or low C3 or C4 levels and current UPCR < 0.3. These parameters were chosen since the development of LN is generally within the first years of SLE diagnosisand often patients have serologic activity antedating clinical proteinuria.
There are no restrictions related to medications, gender or ethnicity/race, with all participants ages 18 and over with the ability to speak English, Spanish or Mandarin. Pilot study is in English only.
Must own a mobile phone with texting capability.
For all patients meeting the above criteria, the first home dipstick recording must be N or T, indicating either negative or trace of protein. If it is one or more, the patient will be considered a screen failure (see scoring rules below).

Any participant will be considered lost to follow-up if they are consistently non-compliant with the home-based urinalysis tests and cannot be reached after 10 consecutive attempts by telephone calls, email and/or letters.
