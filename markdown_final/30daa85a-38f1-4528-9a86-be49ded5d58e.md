## Question

How to document the sound of a systolic flow murmur

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to document a systolic flow murmur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational definitions and the Levine grading framework. Then, I should verify the core acoustic features that distinguish a flow murmur from pathologic murmurs. Next, I will review standardized location terminology and radiation patterns. After that, I need to check associated findings and maneuvers that modify the murmur. Then, I will consider physiologic modifiers and high-output states. I should also confirm when to document "innocent" versus "likely physiologic". Finally, I will synthesize a concise, standardized documentation template and ensure it aligns with contemporary data standards and evidence on murmur clinic workflows and echocardiography triage.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions and grading so I don't gloss over basics. A systolic murmur is a series of audible vibrations created by turbulent blood flow during ventricular systole, and its intensity is traditionally graded 1/6 through 6/6 using the Levine scale, which remains the standard framework for bedside documentation and has historical and contemporary support in clinical practice and teaching [^116AYFBz]. Wait, I should verify the timing categories too; ACC/AHA data standards require documenting timing as systolic, diastolic, continuous, or other, which I need to ensure is captured explicitly in the note [^116ESBre].

> Now, I will examine the core acoustic features that characterize a systolic flow murmur. A flow murmur is typically soft, short, early-to-mid systolic, crescendo–decrescendo in configuration, and ends well before S2; it is often described as blowing or musical, and the second heart sound is normal or well heard, which helps distinguish it from pathologic murmurs that may obscure S2 or persist through systole [^117Njb84] [^114ggdRX]. Hold on, I should verify the frequency content; phono-spectrographic studies in children show innocent ejection murmurs often have lower peak frequencies, frequently below 200 Hz, and shorter duration than pathologic murmurs, which tend to have broader frequency spectra and longer duration, supporting the "soft, short, early" descriptor at the bedside [^114Ejhmr] [^114Ejhmr].

> Next, I should review standardized location terminology so documentation is interoperable. I need to ensure I use the ACC/AHA precordial locations: apex, left lower sternal border, left middle sternal border, left upper sternal border, and right upper sternal border, and I should specify the intercostal space when relevant, for example "left upper sternal border at the 2nd intercostal space" for the pulmonic area or "right upper sternal border at the 2nd intercostal space" for the aortic area [^116amTZ7]. Let me double-check that I also note radiation; innocent flow murmurs generally do not radiate widely, whereas significant aortic stenosis may radiate to the carotids and mitral regurgitation to the axilla, so documenting "no radiation" or "radiates to… " materially changes pretest probability for structural disease [^116erdhe].

> I will now examine associated findings and dynamic auscultation because these refine classification. A normal S1 and S2, no extra clicks, no S3/S4, and no diastolic component support a benign flow murmur, whereas a soft S2, ejection click, or fixed split S2 should prompt reconsideration of pathology such as bicuspid aortic valve or ASD, respectively [^117Njb84] [^112Xqb9H]. Wait, let me verify the effect of position; innocent murmurs often increase in intensity when supine and decrease when standing, so I should document positional variation explicitly, and if a murmur intensifies with standing or Valsalva, I need to consider dynamic outflow obstruction such as HCM, which changes management implications [^114ggdRX] [^114wrRYP].

> But wait, what if the murmur is in a high-output state rather than truly innocent? I need to check for physiologic modifiers like anemia, fever, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, or arteriovenous fistula, because these conditions increase stroke volume and can generate flow murmurs that resolve with correction of the underlying state; documenting these contexts prevents mislabeling as structural disease and guides follow-up [^116UVnrG] [^116fv56o]. Hold on, I should verify that I also record heart rate and blood pressure at the time of auscultation, since hemodynamics influence murmur intensity and may be relevant if echocardiography is later obtained [^116BFF45].

> Let me consider when it is appropriate to label a murmur as "innocent" versus "likely physiologic". If the murmur is grade 1–2/6, early systolic, crescendo–decrescendo, with normal S1/S2, no radiation, and no concerning associated findings, it is reasonable to document it as a likely innocent flow murmur; if any red flags are present or if the patient is an adult with a new murmur, I should avoid prematurely labeling it innocent and instead document the features objectively and arrange appropriate follow-up or echocardiography triage [^114ggdRX] [^1161nxm9]. I should double-check that my threshold for further testing is aligned with contemporary pathways; murmur clinics and basic/level 1 echocardiography protocols emphasize selective imaging rather than blanket comprehensive studies, which improves resource use and detection yield for significant valve disease [^1161nxm9] [^115UDnxA].

> Next, I should review how to synthesize all of this into a concise, standardized documentation string. A practical template is: "Grade II/VI soft, short, early-to-mid systolic, crescendo–decrescendo murmur at the left upper sternal border, 2nd intercostal space; S1 and S2 normal; no extra sounds; no radiation; increases when supine and decreases when standing; likely innocent flow murmur", ensuring I include timing, intensity, quality, configuration, location with interspace, radiation, heart sounds, and dynamic features, and that I avoid conclusory diagnostic language unless justified by the totality of findings [^116amTZ7] [^117Njb84]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include "musical" for all innocent murmurs, but I should correct that. "Musical" is classically associated with Still's vibratory murmur in children, whereas many adult flow murmurs are simply soft and blowing, so I should reserve "musical" for the characteristic pediatric vibratory quality and otherwise describe the quality accurately without overstatement [^11435sjy] [^112WpNAw].

> I need to ensure the documentation aligns with data standards and supports downstream decisions. Using ACC/AHA permissible values for murmur timing and standardized location terms facilitates interoperability, and explicitly noting the absence of diastolic components, abnormal S2, or radiation reduces ambiguity and supports watchful waiting in low-risk cases [^116ESBre] [^116amTZ7]. Hold on, I should verify that my note also sets expectations for follow-up; if any red flags are present or the clinical context is uncertain, I should document a plan for echocardiography or murmur clinic referral rather than asserting benignity, consistent with contemporary triage models that combine focused auscultation with selective point-of-care or transthoracic imaging [^1161nxm9] [^115UDnxA].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure internal consistency and clinical safety. A well-documented systolic flow murmur is soft, short, early, with normal S1/S2, no radiation, and position-responsive. When these features are present in the right clinical context, the probability of significant structural disease is low, though not zero, and careful follow-up or targeted imaging remains appropriate when uncertainty persists or when the patient develops symptoms or new findings [^117Njb84] [^114ggdRX]. I should double-check that my plan matches the patient's risk profile and local pathways, and that I have documented the hemodynamic context and any reversible contributors, so that subsequent clinicians can interpret the murmur consistently and decide on the need for echocardiography or specialist referral [^116UVnrG].

A systolic flow murmur is best described as a **soft, short, early-to-mid systolic, crescendo–decrescendo murmur** [^114ggdRX] that begins just after S1, peaks in early systole, and ends before S2, with a **grade 1–2/6 intensity** [^114ggdRX] and a blowing or musical quality [^114Ejhmr]. It is typically best heard at the left upper sternal border or apex, does not radiate, and varies with position or respiration [^114ggdRX]; S1 and S2 are normal, and there are no extra sounds or diastolic murmurs [^117Njb84]. Document as: "Grade 1–2/6 soft, short, early-to-mid systolic crescendo–decrescendo murmur at [location], no radiation, normal S1/S2, no extra sounds or diastolic murmur, varies with position/respiration, consistent with innocent flow murmur" [^116amTZ7].

---

## Acoustic characteristics

- **Timing**: Early-to-mid systolic, starting just after S1 and ending before S2 [^114ggdRX].
- **Configuration**: Crescendo–decrescendo (diamond-shaped) [^112WpNAw].
- **Intensity**: Soft, typically grade 1–2/6 [^116AYFBz].
- **Quality**: Blowing or musical (vibratory) [^112WpNAw].
- **Duration**: Short, occupying less than half of systole [^notfound].

---

## Auscultation locations and radiation

- **Common locations**: Left upper sternal border (pulmonic area), apex, or left lower sternal border [^116amTZ7].
- **Radiation**: Typically does not radiate; if present, usually limited [^notfound].
- **Respiratory variation**: May vary with respiration or position [^114ggdRX].

---

## Associated heart sounds and findings

Associated heart sounds include **normal S1 and S2**, with **no extra sounds** such as clicks, gallops, or rubs [^117Njb84]. Diastolic murmurs are absent, and there are **no pathological findings** — no cardiomegaly, abnormal pulses, or signs of heart failure [^116erdhe].

---

## Clinical documentation template

A standardized documentation template for a systolic flow murmur might read: "Grade 1–2/6 soft, short, early-to-mid systolic crescendo–decrescendo murmur at the [left upper sternal border/apex], **no radiation**, normal S1 and S2, **no extra sounds or diastolic murmur**, murmur varies with position/respiration, consistent with an innocent flow murmur" [^114ggdRX].

---

## Differentiation from pathological murmurs

| **Feature** | **Innocent flow murmur** | **Pathological murmur** |
|-|-|-|
| Intensity | Soft (≤ grade 2/6) [^116AYFBz] | Loud (≥ grade 3/6) [^114ggdRX] |
| Duration | Short (< half of systole) [^notfound] | Long (holosystolic or late systolic) [^113TraFJ] |
| Quality | Blowing or musical [^114Ejhmr] | Harsh or coarse [^1174QtzH] |
| Associated sounds | Normal S1/S2, no extra sounds [^117Njb84] | Abnormal S2, clicks, gallops [^113yZD8w] |
| Radiation | None or limited [^notfound] | Wide radiation [^112pur5r] |
| Clinical findings | No pathological signs [^116erdhe] | Pathological signs present [^1158pR7y] |

---

## Clinical significance

Benign nature: Innocent murmurs are common in children and adolescents and **typically require no further evaluation** [^116erdhe]. Follow-up: Reassurance and routine follow-up are generally sufficient unless new symptoms or signs develop [^116erdhe]. A systolic flow murmur is a **soft, short, early-to-mid systolic crescendo–decrescendo murmur** with normal heart sounds and no radiation, typically requiring only reassurance and routine follow-up [^114ggdRX].

We investigated which physical parameter has the greatest impact on the perceived loudness of a systolic murmur in aortic stenosis. Loudness of murmur in aortic stenosis correlated best with peak momentum transfer — and thus with body size — so that loud murmurs predict severe disease less reliably in larger patients.

### Should functional cardiac murmurs be diagnosed by auscultation or by Doppler echocardiography? [^116kgfrL]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

For many years, cardiac auscultation has been the only available method for distinguishing between functional and organic murmurs; however, a more reliable differential diagnosis can now be achieved with Doppler echocardiography. The question remains as to whether a Doppler echocardiogram needs to be routinely recorded in the presence of a heart murmur or whether the auscultatory diagnosis of a functional murmur is sufficient.

Hypothesis

This prospective study attempts to answer this important question at a time when medical costs have to be curbed.

Methods

The three cardiologists involved in this study saw 516 new patients in their private practice over a 10-month period; of these, 321 (63.6%) underwent Doppler echocardiography. All patients underwent careful auscultation prior to echocardiography. At the end of their examinations, the cardiologists noted whether they considered the murmur to be of functional or organic origin. Minimal mitral or aortic regurgitations of short duration and low velocity occurring on non-thickened valves were considered functional.

Results

The results for cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography were considered to be concordant, that is, both techniques diagnosed either a functional or organic murmur in 250 of 321 patients (77.9%). The results for cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography showed a major discordance in just six cases (1.9%). All were mitral regurgitations of moderate severity.

Conclusion

The prevalence of cardiac murmurs in the general population is very high. As echocardiography currently represents a significant proportion of cardiac medical expenditure, it would be wise to limit the use of this technique to essential indications. This study confirms that both cardiac auscultation and Doppler echocardiography possess important limitations. Nevertheless, it also shows that well-trained cardiologists can identify the vast majority of functional murmurs on auscultation. Better training of nonspecialist physicians in cardiac auscultation may help in containing medical expenses.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^112TRM75]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Over 90% of heart murmurs in children are physiological. Moreover, 75% of them are innocent vibratory murmurs (39, 40, 41, 42). The physician needs to quickly confirm the benign nature of the heart murmur and thus to avoid misdiagnosis. The combination of a spectrogram and a traditional phonocardiogram can be an adequate method for distinguishing innocent murmurs from pathological. When quantitative analysis is used systematically, the clinician should know what signals the system is processing and how. Visual analysis is the first step towards understanding automatic analysis, and it is a more reliable way to classify the findings as pathological or non-pathological than auscultation alone. Interpretation of the spectrogram helps to understand the hemodynamic events and the origin of heart sounds. Laminar flow will cause a harmonic wave movement in surrounding tissues, as exemplified by vibratory murmur with a peak frequency of approximately 150 Hz, which has also been reported in earlier studies. Rapid flow will cause turbulence. The faster the flow velocity, the higher the sound frequencies. These findings are also illustrated by the analysis of aortic stenosis or ventricular septal defect.

### Initial clinical evaluation of cardiac systolic murmurs in the ED by noncardiologists [^113tRtbb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

It is not exactly known how ED physicians perform in evaluating cardiac systolic murmurs. In 203 consecutive medical ED patients with systolic murmur, we compared the initial clinical evaluation, including auscultation, with transthoracic echocardiography. Of the 203 patients, 132 (65%) had innocent murmurs and 71 patients (35%) had valvular heart disease. Sensitivity and specificity of the initial clinical routine evaluation in diagnosing echocardiographic valvular heart disease were 82% (70%-86%) and 69% (60%-76%), respectively. Independent significant positive predictors of valvular heart disease were grade > 2/6 systolic murmur (odds ratio [OR], 8.3; confidence interval [CI] 3.5–19.7, P < .001) and pathologic electrocardiogram (ECG) (OR, 8.4; CI, 3.2–22, P < .001. Patients younger than 50 years with a systolic murmur graded ≤ 2/6 had innocent murmurs in 98%. The initial clinical evaluation, including auscultation, by experienced ED physicians in internal medicine distinguishes well between innocent murmurs and valvular heart disease in medical patients with cardiac systolic murmurs.

Tricuspid atresia/single ventricle — presentation and clinical examination note that those with no prior operation or with only a systemic-to–pulmonary artery shunt or cavopulmonary shunt can present with cyanosis, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, complete AV block, stroke, worsening exercise ability, bacterial endocarditis, or thromboembolism. Patients who have not had a Fontan operation usually will have cyanosis, clubbing, increased precordial activity, and a single S2; murmurs may include continuous murmurs of aortopulmonary shunts, systolic murmurs of AV valve regurgitation, systolic murmurs of LV or RV outflow obstruction, and diastolic murmurs of semilunar valve regurgitation. Those with ventricular dysfunction may have an S3, jugular venous distention, and hepatomegaly; brachial pulses may be absent on the side of a prior Blalock-Taussig shunt and in the left arm after a subclavian flap procedure for coarctation; scoliosis is common.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) adult presentation scenarios — In adults with previously unrecognized isolated VSD, it is unlikely to present without prior workup; possible scenarios include an asymptomatic patient with a systolic murmur previously thought to be an innocent murmur, fever and bacteremia secondary to IE, a new diastolic murmur of AR secondary to aortic valve prolapse, and cyanosis and exercise intolerance secondary to the progressive development of pulmonary vascular disease.

### Evaluation of cardiac auscultation skills in pediatric residents [^114k7tZg]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Auscultation skills are in decline, but few studies have shown which specific aspects are most difficult for trainees. We evaluated individual aspects of cardiac auscultation among pediatric residents using recorded heart sounds to determine which elements pose the most difficulty.

Methods

Auscultation proficiency was assessed among 34 trainees following a pediatric cardiology rotation using an open-set format evaluation module, similar to the actual clinical auscultation description process.

Results

Diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing normal from abnormal cases was 73%. Findings most commonly correctly identified included pathological systolic and diastolic murmurs and widely split second heart sounds. Those least likely to be identified included continuous murmurs and clicks. Accuracy was low for identifying specific diagnoses.

Conclusions

Given time constraints for clinical skills teaching, this suggests that focusing on distinguishing normal from abnormal heart sounds and murmurs instead of making specific diagnoses may be a more realistic goal for pediatric resident auscultation training.

### Etiology and diagnosis of systolic murmurs in adults [^112pur5r]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether echocardiography can provide insights into the origin of systolic murmurs and the modern value of bedside cardiovascular diagnosis.

Methods

The author examined 376 inpatients and compared their physical findings to transthoracic echocardiography, exploring the associations between echocardiography and systolic murmurs and investigating the diagnostic accuracy of physical examination for pathologic murmurs.

Results

Four echocardiographic variables predict the presence of systolic murmurs: peak aortic velocity (P < .001); mitral regurgitation severity (P < .001); mitral valve E-point velocity (P = 0.09); and absence of pericardial effusion (P = 0.09). When diagnosing murmurs, the most helpful finding is its distribution on the chest wall with respect to the 3(rd) left parasternal space, a landmark that distinguishes murmurs into 6 patterns. The "apical-base" pattern indicates increased aortic velocity (likelihood ratio [LR] 9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 6.7–14): a delayed carotid upstroke (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 4.0–11.5); absent S2 (LR 12.7; 95% CI; 5.3–30.4); and humming quality to the murmur (LR 8.5; 95% CI; 4.3–16.5) further increase the probability of aortic valve disease. The "broad apical" murmur pattern suggests significant mitral regurgitation (LR 6.8; 95% CI; 3.9–11.9); and the "left lower sternal" murmur pattern indicates significant tricuspid regurgitation (LR 8.4; 95% CI; 3.5–20.3): additional bedside observations refine these diagnoses. Nonetheless, this study shows that some classic physical findings are no longer accurate, that physical examination cannot reliably distinguish severe aortic stenosis from less severe stenosis, and that classic physical findings, despite having proven value, are absent in many patients with significant cardiac lesions.

Conclusions

In the diagnosis of systolic murmurs, physical examination has limitations but also unappreciated value. A simple system using onomatopoeia and classifying systolic murmurs into 1 of 6 patterns is diagnostically helpful.

CCTGA — clinical examination in the unoperated patient: Clinical features depend on the presence or absence of associated lesions; those without associated lesions may show an abnormal ventricular impulse with an RV parasternal lift and a palpable second sound (loud A2) related to the anterior aorta. AV valve regurgitation produces a holosystolic murmur at the apex or lower left sternal border; PS produces an ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal border, often in the third interspace; VSD produces a holosystolic murmur similar to normal connections; patients with a VSD and PS may have cyanosis, and the diagnosis should always be considered in dextrocardia.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^115VATYc]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The three most common innocent murmurs, i.e. vibratory murmur, pulmonary ejection murmur and venous hum, and the five most common congenital heart defects, i.e. ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic valve stenosis (AS), pulmonary valve stenosis (PS), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and atrial septal defect (ASD), are presented as examples of the whole data set.

To differentiate between innocent and pathological murmurs, 50 vibratory innocent heart murmurs, 25 innocent pulmonary or aortic ejection murmurs and 50 mild pathological systolic murmurs with intensity equal to or less than grade 3/6 were selected from a larger heart sound database for more detailed analysis. 14 of the selected pathological cases were small VSD, 5 hemodynamically loading ASD secundum, 8 PS with a pressure gradient less than 30 mmHg, 8 AS with a pressure gradient less than 30 mmHg, 3 bicuspid aortic valves with velocity less than 2.0 m/s, 1 mild CoA with a measured 15 mmHg RR difference, 1 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) with a septum thickness of 12 mm but with laminar aortic flow, 5 mitral leakage with or without prolapse (MI) and 3 tricuspid valve leakage (TI).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography appropriate use criteria — key clinical definitions include Arrhythmia as "Documented irregular and/or abnormal heart rate or rhythm" and Palpitations as "An unpleasant sensation of rapid, irregular, and/or forceful beating of the heart". Desaturation is defined for pediatric patients other than newborns as "an oxygen saturation < 95% as measured by pulse oximeter", and for newborns "for newborns ≥ 24 hours of age, an oxygen saturation that is (a) < 90% in the initial screen or in repeat screens", with additional criteria "(b) < 95% in the right hand and foot on 3 measures, each separated by 1 hour, or (c) a > 3% absolute difference in oxygen saturation between the right hand and foot on 3 measures, each separated by 1 hour". Hypertension is "Average systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure that is ≥ 95th percentile for gender, age, and height on 3 or more occasions". Innocent murmurs are characterized by "most innocent murmurs are soft (less than or equal to grade 2/6), heard in early systole, characterized as crescendo-decrescendo type, and may vary with position", whereas a Pathologic murmur includes "grade 3/6 systolic murmur or louder" and murmurs that are "provoked or become louder with changes in position (from squatting to standing) or during the strain phase of a Valsalva maneuver". A Neonate is "A child that is less than or equal to 28 days old". Neurocardiogenic syncope is defined as "A type of syncope typically occurring in the upright position, in which the triggering of a neural reflex results in a usually self-limited episode of systemic hypotension and/or bradycardia or asystole", and Syncope is "Sudden temporary loss of consciousness associated with a loss of postural tone and with spontaneous recovery that does not require electrical or chemical cardioversion".

### Evaluation of children with heart murmurs [^1167QhXY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac murmurs can be a source of anxiety for both physicians and parents until serious cardiac disorders are excluded. The innocent cardiac murmur is still the most common finding in healthy children and can usually be diagnosed through obtaining a complete history and performing a complete physical examination. However, a cardiac murmur may be the first sign of a structural cardiac disease and should not be ignored. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation is required when murmur assessment is not clear and diagnostic uncertainty is present. Educating and reassuring parents remains an important aspect of this evaluation. This article discusses features of innocent and pathological murmurs and provides an approach to cardiac murmurs in children.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^114TpJ2g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of Structural Heart Murmurs

All prior epidemiological studies of murmurs suffer from the inherent subjectivity and interobserver variability in the bedside identification of murmurs by clinicians. Furthermore, in many screening programs, the presence of a murmur alone may trigger an echocardiogram, even if the yield for diagnosis is poor. Thus, a contemporary and reliable epidemiologic description of murmur prevalence itself would be valuable to the field. To address this gap in knowledge, we used our murmur classification algorithm as a standardized observer on a random subset of 1 million unlabeled heart recordings obtained in routine practice from clinicians using Eko devices (Figure 5). Mirroring our results from the controlled studies, most (79.2%) of the sounds passed the signal quality classifier. Among these, approximately 15% of the heart sounds were classified as structural murmur. As expected, the majority (83%) of these were isolated systolic murmurs. However, this also means that a substantial minority (17%) were classified as having at least some diastolic component. These data highlight the potential of this technology to enable descriptions of examination findings that were not previously possible, and also challenge the conventional wisdom that diastolic murmurs are rare.

The other sounds/poor sound quality includes recordings users have taken at different body locations (eg, lung and bowel sounds), recordings under the minimum 5‐second requirement, and poor heart sound signals.

### The maverick heart sound [^113Q71Si]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

An asymptomatic 29-year-old woman presented for prenatal counselling. She had a history of a heart murmur since childhood and a previous echocardiogram suggesting 'enlargement of the heart'. Physical exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and contour. Precordial palpation was unremarkable. Auscultation, however, was abnormal; findings on inspiration and expiration are presented in Figure 1, sound clip.

Question

Based on the phonocardiogram and online supplementary audio clip, which of the following is correct? An early diastolic filling sound (S3) is heard, indicating increased right ventricular filling pressures. An ejection click without respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. An ejection click with respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with pulmonic valve stenosis. A holosystolic murmur with inspiratory augmentation is heard, indicating tricuspid regurgitation.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^113VWcmk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We chose to compare the performance of the murmur classification algorithm against 10 independent clinicians to best mirror the use of our algorithm in the clinic. Notably, the clinicians performed their assessment in a more controlled setting than would be expected in actual practice, effectively biasing the results toward the null. Despite this, the clinicians still exhibited marked variability in detecting structural murmurs, consistent with previous literature (Table 11). Moreover, even with this bias, the murmur classification algorithm proved more successful at detecting SHD. Given the inevitable distractions in an actual medical setting, we anticipate that the algorithm will show an even greater improvement over actual clinician performance under real‐world conditions.

Consistent with prior literature, we found a correlation between murmur grade and disease severity across our population. That this correlation is weak implies that lower‐grade murmurs (< 2) can still correspond to more severe SHD, allowing it to go undetected (Table 12). We expect this finding to resonate with the anecdotal experience of practicing clinicians. Importantly, the murmur classification algorithm demonstrated a higher sensitivity of detection for all severities of SHD, with the largest benefit for mild SHD (improvement of 10.8%). To the extent the severity of SHD reflects earlier stages of disease progression, the murmur classification algorithm could improve detection of subclinical disease and facilitate treatments that improve outcomes associated with that disease. The assessment of the clinician's and algorithm's ability to detect specific disease types yields, on average, higher performance than that of the algorithm when assessed on the full test data set. This is attributed to the analysis only using the recording location where each disease is expected to be best heard (eg, aortic stenosis at aortic location). As such, radiating murmurs that are less audible are excluded from this analysis. This is consistent with the methodology and results in Thompson et al.

### Deep learning analysis of blood flow sounds to detect arteriovenous fistula stenosis [^112h98b1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Examining the frequency spectrums in our illustrative examples of stenosis at each location (Supplementary Fig. 1b–f, Supplementary Fig. 2a–f), one can see that a stenosis is characterized by a "double-peak". The left (lower frequency peak) corresponds to diastole (when the heart's ventricles relax) and the right (higher frequency peak) corresponds to systole (when the heart's ventricles are contracting). During systole, there is a momentary increase in the velocity of blood flow all throughout the vasculature, including the AVF. The increased velocity through a stenosed AVF directly contributes to increasing the jet Reynolds number. The flow regime is more likely to transition to turbulent flow at the site of the stenotic lesion during systole because at baseline (during diastole) the stenotic lesions is already characterized by higher Reynolds number by virtue of the diminished lumen diameter and its direct effect on increasing velocity. This increased propensity to develop turbulent flow during systole at the stenotic site is responsible for the second higher frequency peak seen in our frequency spectrums and clinically corresponds to the "high-pitched systolic bruit of thrill" heard during auscultation. A patent AVF is better able to accommodate the increased throughput of blood during systole, and the second higher frequency peak is not as prominent or entirely absent. Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 provides more illustrative examples of patent and frequency spectrums at each location.

### Presentation of atrial septal defect in the pediatric population [^112am4Ff]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Our recent experience indicates that patients with a hemodynamically significant atrial septal defect secundum (ASD2) do not necessarily present with classic physical and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. The purpose of the study was to review the records of patients either receiving a catheter device or undergoing surgical repair for the closure of ASD2 to determine their initial physical and ECG findings. Therefore, we did a retrospective review of 47 consecutive patients who had echocardiographic evidence of a hemodynamically significant isolated ASD2 and who underwent ASD2 closure. Of these 47 patients, the presenting complaints were murmur (n = 36), chest pain (n = 6), seizure (n = 1), stroke (n = 1), syncope (n = 1), Kawasaki's disease (n = 1), and cardiomegaly (n = 1). Charts were reviewed for the evaluation of four abnormal physical findings: hyperactive right ventricular impulse, split fixed second heart sound, systolic and diastolic flow murmurs; and three ECG abnormalities: right axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. In all, 30% of patients had either one or no typical physical findings, 18% had normal ECG findings, and 7% had no physical or ECG findings. On physical examination and ECG, the abnormalities due to ASD2 may be too subtle to detect. Although it is well known that variations can occur in the clinical signs and symptoms typical of ASD2, dependence on classical physical and or ECG findings may result in the underdiagnosis of a significant number of patients.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^117DhVwQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

A ground truth label of innocent murmur was assigned to a heart sound if an audible murmur was indicated by the expert annotators, and the corresponding echocardiogram confirmed that no structural heart disease was present (Table 2). We defined SHD as the presence of any nonphysiological valvular regurgitation or stenosis, congenital heart disease, or prosthetic valves. A ground truth label of structural murmur was assigned to a heart sound if an audible murmur was indicated by the expert annotators, and the corresponding echocardiogram confirmed the presence of structural heart disease. All heart sounds where the expert annotators indicated no audible murmur were assigned the ground truth label of absent murmur, irrespective of the corresponding echocardiogram finding. Of these, N = 141 (22.9%) were identified as having no audible murmur, at any auscultation location, by the panel of experts.

Table 2
Definition of Ground Truth Labels for Murmur Types Based on Auscultation and Echocardiogram Findings

Of the 2375 recordings in the Eko test data set, 299 underwent additional annotation by 3 expert cardiologists to obtain the timing of the S1 and S2 sounds. This sub‐data set was used for validation of the heart sound timing algorithm performance, and no part of this database was used for algorithm training.

Eko Murmur Timing Data Set

Due to the low prevalence of audible diastolic murmurs in regular clinical practice, we created an additional enriched test set to evaluate the murmur timing algorithm, specifically that of the diastolic murmur detection algorithm. This has been a recurring limitation of previous research, wherein the sample size of diastolic murmurs was too low for reliable conclusions to be drawn. Recordings with a high probability of a diastolic murmur from our ongoing clinical studies and user database were identified via an exhaustive search of echocardiogram findings and clinician notes. All recordings were annotated by the same expert cardiologists using the same annotation strategy as the Eko test data set. A recording was assigned the label diastolic murmur if at least 3 expert auscultators indicated the presence of a diastolic murmur.

The Eko murmur timing test data set contained 516 unique heart sound recordings from 305 unique subjects. Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the Eko test set and the Eko murmur timing data set.

### Comparison of two educational interventions on pediatric resident auscultation skills [^116UKXxK]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Multiple cross-sectional physician surveys have documented poor cardiac auscultation skills. We evaluated the impact of 2 different educational interventions on pediatric resident auscultation skills.

Methods

The auscultation skills of all first-year (PGY1; n = 20) and second-year pediatric residents (PGY2; n = 20) were evaluated at the beginning and end of the academic year. Five patient recordings were presented: atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary valve stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve with insufficiency, and innocent murmur. Residents were asked to classify the second heart sound, identify a systolic ejection click, describe the murmur, and provide a diagnosis. All PGY1 and most PGY2 (14 of 20) participated on the inpatient cardiology service for 1 month. PGY2 on the cardiology service also attended outpatient clinic. PGY1 did not attend outpatient clinic but were allotted 2 hours/week to use a self-directed cardiac auscultation computer teaching program.

Results

Resident auscultation skills on initial evaluation were dependent on training level (PGY1: 42 ± 15% correct; PGY2: 53 ± 13% correct), primarily as a result of better classification of second heart sound (PGY1: 45%; PGY2: 63%) and diagnosis of an innocent murmur (PGY1: 35%; PGY2: 65%). There was no difference in the ability to identify correctly a systolic ejection click (20% vs 23%) or to arrive at the correct diagnosis (35% vs 40%). At the end of the academic year, the PGY1 scores improved by 21%, primarily as a result of improved diagnostic accuracy of the innocent murmur (35% to 65%). PGY2 scores remained unchanged (53% vs 51%), regardless of participation in a cardiology rotation (cardiology rotation: 50%; no cardiology rotation: 51%). Combined, diagnostic accuracy was best for ventricular septal defect (55%) and innocent murmur (60%) and worst for atrial septal defect (18%) and pulmonary valve stenosis (15%). However, 40% identified the innocent murmur as pathologic and 21% of pathologic murmurs were diagnosed as innocent.

Conclusions

Pediatric resident auscultation skills were poor and did not improve after an outpatient cardiology rotation. Auscultation skills did improve after the use of a self-directed cardiac auscultation teaching program. These data have relevance given the American College of Graduate Medical Education's emphasis on measuring educational outcomes and documenting clinical competencies during residency training.

Results

Illustrative examples of most common heart murmurs

The system was able to display and reproduce cardiovascular sound events. The musical murmur caused by harmonic movements of the heart or the vasculature, of which vibratory innocent murmur is a good example, was usually visualized as a well-defined area or line in the spectrogram. Innocent systolic murmur appeared to have a lower peak frequency, below 200 Hz, and shorter duration than pathological murmurs, and it always faded before the second heart sound. The higher the velocity of flow in echogardiography, the more intensive the murmur and the wider the frequency scale. This phenomenon was clearly visible in the spectrogram.

The attached illustrations (Figures from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) show examples of the most typical murmurs in children. The upper part is a traditional phonocardiogram showing the relative amplitude of the sound. The lower part, i.e. the spectrogram, shows the sound intensity as colors on a frequency scale of 0–1000 Hz. The corresponding intensity scale in decibels is shown on the left. The duration, peak frequency and volume of the murmur were estimated based on a mean of three sequential beats. Volume was compared to the mean of the amplitudes of S1 and S2, obtained from the traditional phonocardiogram.

Quantitative comparison of innocent and confusing pathological systolic murmurs

The mean and standard deviation of the patients' ages for the three groups are presented in Table 2. The patients with innocent vibratory murmurs were referred for examination at a younger age than those with ejection murmurs, which seemed confusing to the examiners and were referred closer to school age. The pathological murmurs in this series included recordings of both new patients and repeated control recordings of outpatients.

Table 2
Mean and standard deviation of patients' ages in the three groups

There were no significant differences in the duration of S1 and S2 between the pathological and physiological systolic murmurs (Table 3). Although S2 was constantly split in ASDs, the duration of S2 in these cases did not differ from the average in the series. By contrast, the pathological murmurs, measured in either absolute or relative terms, were longer than the innocent vibratory or ejection systolic murmurs (p < 0.001).

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) stenosis — problems and pitfalls are highlighted as follows: The click murmur of a BAV may be misdiagnosed as mitral valve prolapse, and a systolic murmur may be thought to be "benign" because an ejection click is not recognized. For assessment, mean gradient and aortic valve area should be used rather than relying only on peak systolic gradient, and the aortic valve area should be indexed to body surface area to correct for different body sizes and habitus. Progressive aortic dilatation may occur in patients with BAV even without significant aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic regurgitation (AR), and when left ventricular (LV) dimensions are increased with normal wall thickness, LV mass is increased and LV mass calculations should be indexed to body surface area.

### Usefulness of a new sound spectral averaging technique to distinguish an innocent systolic murmur from that of aortic stenosis [^111Be1Cb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We present a new method to record and display heart sounds that uses a hand-held computer and stethoscopic recording device. It allows for rapid spectral and waveform displays of murmurs and provides a means for signal averaging of spectral frequency content. Compared with aortic stenosis, innocent murmurs primarily contain frequencies of < 300 Hz and persist for a shorter duration at the upper-frequency levels. This method provides for rapid characterization of innocent murmurs, a means for comparison with other murmurs, and transmission of acoustic data to distant sites.

### Understanding intracranial aneurysm sounds via high-fidelity fluid-structure-interaction modelling [^115Xk8tZ]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1960s, the origins of intracranial aneurysm bruits and musical murmurs have been debated, with proposed mechanisms ranging from self-excitation (i.e., resonance) by stable pulsatile flow, to vibration caused by unstable (laminar vortex shedding or turbulent) flow. This knowledge gap has impeded the use of intracranial sounds a marker of aneurysm remodelling or rupture risk. New computational techniques now allow us to model these phenomena.

Methods

We performed high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulations capable of understanding the magnitude and mechanisms of such flow-induced vibrations, under pulsatile flow conditions. Six cases from a previous cohort were used.

Results

In five cases, underlying flow instabilities present as broad-band, random vibrations, consistent with previously-described bruits, while the sac also exhibits resonance, rocking back and forth in different planes of motion, consistent with previously described musical murmurs. Both types of vibration have amplitudes in the range of 0.1 to 1μm. The murmurs extend into diastole, after the underlying flow instability has dissipated, and do not exhibit the characteristic repeating frequency harmonics of previously hypothesized vortex-shedding mechanisms. The remaining case with stable pulsatile flow does not vibrate. Spectrograms of the simulated vibrations are consistent with previously reported microphone and Doppler ultrasound recordings.

Conclusions

Our results provide a plausible explanation for distinct intracranial aneurysm sounds and characterize the mechanical environment of a vibrating aneurysm wall. Future work should aim to quantify the deleterious effects of these overlooked stimuli on the vascular wall, to determine which changes to the wall makeup are associated with vibration.

### Definition and management of segmental pulmonary hypertension [^112sRhzB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Assessment of Segmental PH in TOF With Pulmonary Atresia

Patients with complex pulmonary atresia in TOF are cyanosed at birth, because of obligatory mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood within the aorta. 6 Low or decreasing systemic oxygen saturations in complex pulmonary atresia may be related to PH or inadequate lung perfusion (eg, stenosis of collateral arteries or of a previously placed shunt). The first heart sound is normal but the second heart sound is typically single and loud, not because of PH, but because of the anterior positioning of the enlarged aorta below the chest wall. Continuous murmurs relating to the PDA or MAPCAs can be heard throughout the chest but become systolic and less prominent when PVR increases in the vascular bed distal to such vessels. Aortic regurgitation and stenosis may also develop in older patients, because of progressive aortic dilation.

The ECG usually shows signs of RV hypertrophy and right atrial dilatation. Echocardiography is essential when screening for PH, but is not sufficient for firmly establishing the diagnosis of segmental PH, and clearly less adequate for full definition of branch PA anatomy. It is important to remember that, in the absence of communication between the RV and PAs, neither estimates of RV pressure (using the tricuspid regurgitation velocity by Doppler) nor any property of the RV (eg, size or function) provide any insight into the state of the pulmonary circulation. However, Doppler can be used to interrogate flow through collateral vessels or surgical shunts, providing rough estimates of gradients between the aorta and the PAs. Continuous flow with a high peak velocity (> 4 m/s in the presence of normal systemic pressures) can be taken as an indirect sign that no significant rise in pressure has occurred in the segment of lung fed by the interrogated shunt; a low peak velocity, in contrast, with a shunt that is mainly systolic suggests that PH and pulmonary vascular remodeling are likely.

Figure 3
Venous hum in a 1.7-year-old. Auscultation revealed a systolic-diastolic second-degree murmur that was loudest in early diastole (DM = Diastolic Murmur). Venous hum is sometimes a misleadingly loud murmur. It is caused by flow in the jugular veins under the clavicle into the superior vena cava. This sound is intensified when the head is turned left and disappears when lying supine. The hum is heard best at the right second intercostal space and medially up behind the sternum. The hum is not necessarily heard on every auscultation. The phonogram shows a rather flat contour, and the spectrogram contains 300 Hz and 400 Hz frequencies at the beginning of diastole, when venous return is fastest. Respiratory sounds are also loud in the area of auscultation, which sometimes makes the interpretation of the curves difficult. Age 1.7 years. Auscultation area: right second intercostal space (RIC2). Duration 100% of systole and diastole, peak frequency 368 Hz and volume 49%, at the beginning of diastole.

Figure 4
Aortic stenosis in a 7-month-old. A third-degree coarse, stenosis-type murmur that does not last until the end of systole is heard in the aortic area. Echocardiography revealed aortic valve stenosis with a 45-mmHg flow gradient. The phonogram shows a diamond-shaped murmur, and the spectrogram contains early systolic sound waves of approx. 500 Hz that coincide with the peak aortic flow. Age 0.6 years. Auscultation area: left third intercostal space (LIC3). Duration 98%, peak frequency 530 Hz and volume 92%.

Figure 5
Pulmonary stenosis in a 9-year-old. Haemodynamically insignificant pulmonary stenosis, with a 17–22 mmHg flow gradient on echocardiography. On auscultation a second-degree coarse, low-frequency systolic ejection murmur was heard. The phonogram shows the diamond shape compatible with stenotic murmur. Flow velocity is highest at the beginning of systole, and the peak frequencies also occur in early systole, with a descending frequency contour. The findings resemble ASD, the main difference being that P2 is quieter than normal. Because the stenosis is mild, however, P2 can be heard. Area of auscultation: left second ic space (LIC2). Duration 90%, peak frequency 264 Hz, volume 52%.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^111CwFxP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

By applying the suite of algorithms to 1 million recordings from our database of sounds obtained from routine clinical practice, we can estimate the prevalence of structural murmurs and their characteristics in a manner not previously possible. Overall, our poor signal rate reflects that seen in our validation sets, underscoring the generalizability of our prior findings. The observed prevalence of structural heart murmurs is sizeable (Figure 5), suggesting that a large amount of subclinical disease exists in the community. Furthermore, although diastolic murmurs were rarer than systolic murmurs, they were more common than we expected based on prior reports or clinical anecdotes. Because diastolic murmurs are typically driven by lower pressure differentials, and therefore more difficult to identify than systolic murmurs, this may further reflect the usefulness of the technology presented. These epidemiological investigations should be considered exploratory, given that we are not privy to the underlying ground truth of these patients. To our knowledge, this is both the largest analysis of heart sounds to date and the first large‐scale study of the prevalence of structural heart murmurs themselves. We acknowledge a degree of selection bias in the Eko database, because clinicians are more likely to capture a recording of either an abnormal heart sound or a sound from a patient with known SHD. As such, the reported prevalence of such murmurs may be higher than in the overall population. Limitations in the curation and lack of ground truth for this data set should therefore be considered when interpreting the results of this analysis.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Ebstein's anomaly — clinical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest x-ray features: Patients with mild disease may show minimal findings other than a murmur; the jugular venous pressure is often normal even with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) due to a large compliant right atrium, central cyanosis may occur from a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD), the first sound is loud with 1 or more systolic clicks, and the murmur of TR is holosystolic at the lower left sternal border and increases on inspiration. Characteristic ECG findings include very tall and peaked P waves ("Himalayan P waves"), a QR pattern often seen in lead V1 that may extend to V4, and QRS duration that is usually prolonged with a right bundle-branch block pattern that is often "splintered", followed by inverted T waves. Chest x-ray may be nearly normal in mild cases but in more severe cases shows severe enlargement, with right atrial enlargement prominent with a "globular" cardiac contour and clear lung fields, and the great arteries are usually small with an aortic root that is inconspicuous or absent.

Valve and vascular anomalies — definitions: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a congenital or acquired cardiac finding of retrograde flow through the mitral valve, mitral stenosis (MS) is a congenital or acquired cardiac malformation of narrowing or stricture of the orifice of the mitral valve (obstruction to flow), and mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a congenital or acquired cardiac malformation in which 1 or both leaflets move to the atrial side of the plane of the annulus in systole. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) is a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which 1 or more (but not all) of the pulmonary veins connect anomalously to the right atrium or to 1 or more of its venous tributaries with the remaining pulmonary veins connecting to the left atrium. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a congenital cardiovascular finding in which the arterial duct is open beyond the normal age of spontaneous closure, and trivial and silent PDA is hemodynamically insignificant with murmur not heard on auscultation.

### Heart murmurs in children: evaluation and management [^116erdhe]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Up to 8.6% of infants and 80% of children have a heart murmur during their early years of life. The presence of a murmur can indicate conditions ranging from no discernable pathology to acquired or congenital heart disease. In infants with a murmur, physicians should review the obstetric and family histories to detect the possibility of congenital heart pathologies. Evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist is indicated for newborns with a murmur because studies show that neonatal murmurs have higher rates of pathology than in older children, and neonatal murmur characteristics are more difficult to evaluate during examination; referral is preferred over echocardiography. All infants, with or without a murmur, should have pulse oximetry screening to detect underlying critical congenital heart disease. In older children, most murmurs are innocent and can be followed with serial examinations if there are no findings of concern. Findings in older children that warrant referral include diastolic murmurs, loud or harsh-sounding murmurs, holosystolic murmurs, murmurs that radiate to the back or neck, or signs or symptoms of cardiac disease. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is indicated when a pathologic murmur is suspected. Electrocardiography, chest radiography, and other tests should not be reflexively performed as part of all murmur evaluations because these tests can misclassify a murmur as innocent or pathologic, and they are not cost-effective. Emerging technologies include phonocardiography interpretation of murmurs and artificial intelligence algorithms for differentiating innocent from pathologic murmurs.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^113MwjC9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We foresee that these algorithms will improve the screening for SHD, ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing the overall cost of care. Earlier detection of SHD could allow more patients to be monitored and treated at appropriate time points, before the development of advanced or refractory disease. Additionally, discriminating murmurs associated with SHD from those not associated (ie, innocent murmurs) could both reduce expensive and unnecessary tests (eg, echocardiography) and properly triage resources when they are scarce. As such, even a small increase in the sensitivity of SHD detection could result in meaningful benefit for both the patient and provider.

There are several limitations to this work to be addressed in future research. First, the current algorithm analyzes individual recordings instead of a composite 4‐point auscultation. Standard practice incorporates auscultation from multiple locations with a patient history to localize a potential structural defect and guide any imaging studies. Incorporating data from multiple locations has been the focus of other investigations. Because many of the subjects in this data set have a complete 4‐point auscultation, this will be a continuing area of research for us. Second, as with previous murmur classification algorithms, we have not yet assessed how these algorithms function directly in clinical practice, so we have not directly assessed their effects on patient care. However, given the findings we present here, this limitation should motivate real‐world studies wherein the algorithm is used under controlled clinical environments to assess the effect on patient outcomes. This is also an area of active research for our research group. Third, our ground truth assessment of disease pathology comes from a clinical echocardiogram read, which is less standardized than a centralized read from a core research echocardiography laboratory. However, this mirrors routine practice, increasing the generalizability of our study to the clinic. We additionally note the unbalanced, predominantly White, racial breakdown of the testing data sets, and therefore we are unable to confidently comment on the generalization of the algorithms to other racial groups. Last, we note that our algorithm requires the presence of a murmur to diagnose a disease state. We plan to explore further disease‐specific algorithms in the future to address clinical situations where no murmur is present.

### Low-grade systolic murmurs in healthy middle-aged individuals: innocent or clinically significant? A 35-year follow-up study of 2014 Norwegian men [^11591RX4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a low-grade systolic murmur, found at heart auscultation, in middle-aged healthy men influences the long-term risk of aortic valve replacement (AVR) and death from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Setting and subjects. During 1972–1975, 2014 apparently healthy men aged 40–59years underwent an examination programme including case history, clinical examination, blood tests and a symptom-limited exercise ECG test. Heart auscultation was performed under standardized conditions, and murmurs were graded on a scale from I to VI. No men were found to have grade V/VI murmurs. Participants were followed for up to 35years.

Results

A total of 1541 men had no systolic murmur; 441 had low-grade murmurs (grade I/II) and 32 had moderate-grade murmurs (grade III/IV). Men with low-grade murmurs had a 4.7-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–11.1] increased age-adjusted risk of AVR, but no increase in risk of CVD death. Men with moderate-grade murmurs had an 89.3-fold (95% CI 39.2–211.2) age-adjusted risk of AVR and a 1.5-fold (95% CI 0.8–2.5) age-adjusted increased risk of CVD death.

Conclusions

Low-grade systolic murmur was detected at heart auscultation in 21.9% of apparently healthy middle-aged men. Men with low-grade murmur had an increased risk of AVR, but no increase in risk of CVD death. Only 1.6% of men had moderate-grade murmur; these men had a very high risk of AVR and a 1.5-fold albeit non-significant increase in risk of CVD death.

Murmur Timing

We then assessed the murmur timing algorithm among the structural murmurs identified by both the expert annotators and the murmur detection algorithm. Owing to the low prevalence of diastolic murmurs (n = 3) in the Eko test data set, we also assessed murmur timing assignments in the Eko murmur timing data set, which includes 26 diastolic murmurs. We observed excellent sensitivity and specificity (97.5% and 100%, respectively) for systolic murmur detection in the test data set, and lower sensitivity and specificity, relative to the systolic murmur detection algorithm (80.8% and 89.8%, respectively) for diastolic murmur detection in the murmur timing data set (Table 10).

Assessment Against Independent Clinicians

To best assess the clinical usefulness of our tools, we directly compared the performance of our murmur classification algorithm in detecting a structural murmur against 10 independent clinicians given the same task. Notably, the clinicians were provided an idealized, distraction‐free listening environment to optimize their performance. Despite this, the algorithm performed significantly better than the average clinician (P < 0.001, 84.7% versus 77.9% accuracy; Table 11). Moreover, no individual clinician outperformed the algorithm (Table 11; Figure 3).

### Understanding intracranial aneurysm sounds via high-fidelity fluid-structure-interaction modelling [^115WeYKK]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, the spectra of computational aneurysm vibrations resembled spectra from clinical recordings of blood flow sounds. In contrast with our previous studies using steady or simplified flow conditions, these pulsatile simulations show the temporal evolution of the bruits and musical murmurs, illustrating how they arise and subside over the cardiac cycle as, respectively, the flow destabilizes and then relaminarizes. Since the whole cardiac cycle is captured in power spectra in the present study, the power spectra and spectrograms from these simulations can now be more reliably compared to previous sound recordings from patients, while previous steady flow simulations only represent the flow and vibrations at peak systole. The wall spectra in the current study bear resemblance to the variety of spectra observed in previous sound recordings of vessel wall abnormalities (aneurysms, stenoses, vasospasm, arteriovenous malformations). In Kurokawa et al. sonic recordings at the eyes of patients were found to exhibit a variety of spectral phenomena, including (i) a normal spectrum like a patient with no aneurysm (their Fig. 3), (ii) a single sharp peak (their Fig. 4), and (iii) multiple peaks (their Fig. 6), all in the range of 100–800 Hz. As shown in Fig. 7a, our FSI simulations exhibited comparable trends, as there were aneurysms with little sound (Case 11) to no sound (Case 8), a single strong peak (Case 3), or multiple peaks (Cases 9, 12, and 16). In the current study, the frequencies were in the same range (100–500 Hz) as in Kurokawa et al. but tended to be lower in frequency on average, especially in the larger aneurysms. In contrast to our findings, in that study there was no correlation between aneurysm size and frequency. We suspect that modelling aneurysmal contact with its surroundings would likely constrain the larger aneurysms and increase the effective stiffness and modal frequencies; this is analogous to a fixed-fixed beam, where the addition of one constraint results in much higher modal frequencies than a cantilever beam. The FSI models exhibited sharper peaks than the clinical recordings; this could be explained by the transmission of vibration through other tissues (eye, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.) in the clinical recordings, which would likely make the frequency peaks broader and less pronounced.

### The systolic murmur… [^111hrJQx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The physical causes or mechanism of the systolic murmur and its clinical significance have been matters of much discussion for many years. There was a time, not so very long ago, when on hearing a systolic murmur over the heart, even in the absence of any other important abnormalities, the physician would pronounce the ominous verdict that the patient was suffering from organic heart disease with mitral insufficiency. He would also imply in this diagnosis a serious prognosis and institute restrictions in the mode of life for his patient. More recently, systolic murmurs have been found so often to be benign that an entirely opposite point of view has developed. It has become the teaching in many localities that "systolic murmurs have no significance whatever, " that "organic mitral insufficiency does not exist except with mitral stenosis" and even that "auscultation is of no great importance, " for it is not the.

### Innocent murmurs: a suspect diagnosis in non-pregnant adults [^116fv56o]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The physics of turbulence include Reynolds numbers, but they argued that these do not apply for biomedical applications. However, the 2 key variables, viscosity and flow velocity, are conceptually useful. They also warned that turbulence and murmurs are not equivalent, obvious from Doppler studies of children with innocent murmurs who demonstrate no turbulence or abnormal velocities. The musical Still's murmur contrasts with the noise generated by abnormalities of heart valves. McKusick compared the Still's murmur with the Aeolian harp's strings set into vibration by the wind. He looked for analogues in the heart and suggested false chords, but he failed to acknowledge that these become flaccid during systole. McKusick did not suggest the normal chords of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve that are tightened in systole by papillary muscles and traverse the pulmonary outflow, nor has anyone else, to the author's knowledge. The location of the Still's murmur was found in the pulmonary outflow by microphonic catheterization. The innocent ejection murmurs in children and pregnant women are not musical but are associated with decreased hematocrit and increased ejection velocity compared to nonpregnant adults. The aorta has been suggested as the origin of Still's murmur, but that study was done in older adults with angina who presumably had aortic valvular sclerosis. In conclusion, innocent murmurs in childhood are not normally found in adults, except for pregnant women whose blood viscosity and velocity resemble children's. When murmurs are found in nonpregnant adults, echocardiography is prudent.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Physical examination limits and lesion-specific clues — mitral, aortic, and tricuspid regurgitation: In left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, "patients with LV dysfunction and secondary MR often have very soft murmurs even when the MR is severe", and "it is also important to recognize that even mild degrees of MR… identify patients at considerable risk of heart failure and death in the setting of LV dysfunction and secondary MR". For aortic regurgitation (AR), "the diastolic murmur of AR is often barely audible or may be completely absent, and the only appreciable murmur may be a systolic outflow murmur related to the high SV", with "additional physical findings such as a wide pulse pressure or bounding carotid pulses" suggesting significant AR; "AR is often first identified on echocardiograms performed to investigate a systolic murmur". For tricuspid regurgitation (TR), "TR is also often not identified clinically prior to echocardiography but identified as an important concomitant lesion in patients with MR", and in primary TR, "there are often no clinical manifestations when the TR is mild", whereas "severe TR caused by primary disorders is almost invariably associated with a systolic murmur with respiratory variation, elevated V waves in the jugular venous pulse, and an RV heave as evidence of RV volume overload".

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Intermediate–high risk stable chest pain with no known CAD — left ventricular function assessment and sequential/add-on testing: In patients who have pathological Q waves, symptoms or signs suggestive of heart failure, complex ventricular arrhythmia, or a heart murmur with unclear diagnosis, use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is effective for diagnosis of resting left ventricular systolic and diastolic ventricular function and detection of myocardial, valvular, and pericardial abnormalities. For patients with known coronary stenosis of 40% to 90% in a proximal or mid coronary segment on CCTA, fractional flow reserve CT (FFR-CT) can be useful for diagnosis of vessel-specific ischemia and to guide decision-making regarding coronary revascularization. After an inconclusive or abnormal exercise ECG or stress imaging study, CCTA is reasonable; after inconclusive CCTA, stress imaging is reasonable. For patients undergoing stress testing, the addition of CAC testing can be useful. After a negative stress test but with high clinical suspicion of CAD, CCTA or invasive coronary angiography (ICA) may be reasonable.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^115UDnxA]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first published description of a specialist murmur clinic. The majority (70%) of patients referred from the community with a murmur had structurally normal hearts and could safely have been screened using the limited views of a point-of-care scan.

The sensitivity of auscultation by the scientist was 83% compared with 91% by the cardiologist, a difference that was not statistically significant although with wide 95% CIs reflecting the small population size. We estimate that a sample size of 580 would be necessary to investigate equivalence between scientist and cardiologist with 80% power and assuming an acceptable difference in performance of < 5%. By contrast, the point-of-care scan had a sensitivity of 100% when performed by either scientist or cardiologist showing its superiority over auscultation for the detection of valve disease. We believe that auscultation should still be included in the assessment at a murmur clinic since a number of uncommon abnormalities (eg, muscular ventricular septal defect, aortic coarctation or pulmonary stenosis) would usually be associated with obvious systolic murmurs but might not be detected by a point-of-care scan. Conversely, diastolic murmurs as a result of mitral stenosis or pulmonary or aortic regurgitation may be hard to hear but should be obvious on a point-of-care echocardiogram. An abnormal murmur or point-of-care scan should prompt a TTE.

National workforce and organisational differences mean that the disciplines running a murmur clinic may vary. Often a cardiologist will run a murmur clinic either separately or within a specialist valve clinic, but in some countries, a specialist senior nurse might be trained for the role. In the UK, the cardiac physiologist career structure is now expanding with a Higher Specialist Scientific Training programme designed to produce a new class of consultant clinical scientists. A murmur clinic is consistent with the extended clinical role expected of this discipline.

Figure 6
Ductus arteriosus in a 2.6-year-old. On auscultation, a fourth-degree continuous murmur with throbbing pulses. Echocardiography showed a large ductus arteriosus but no other defects. The phonogram shows a consistent (systolic-diastolic) murmur that becomes louder towards endsystole and is quieter in diastole. The flow is rapid in systole, which is when the spectrogram shows the highest frequencies. Area of auscultation: left second ic space (LIC2). Pansystolic (duration 100%) and pandiastolic, peak frequency 786 Hz and volume 150%, both in systole.

Figure 7
Fairly large perimembranous VSD in a 7-month-old. A fairly large perimembranous VSD with normal pulmonary artery pressure (RESP = Respiration). On auscultation a fourth-degree systolic murmur was heard, and on palpation a small thrill was felt in the left third intercostal space. The phonogram shows a pansystolic murmur, but S1 and S2 are distinguishable. P2 is not enhanced and is split normally. This also suggests that pulmonary resistance is normal. Area of auscultation: left third ic space (LIC3). Pansystolic (duration 100%), peak frequency 523 Hz and volume 61%.

Figure 8
ASD in an 11-year-old. On auscultation a quiet systolic ejection murmur was heard in the pulmonary area. It resembled the physiological sound but was longer. The second heart sound was clearly and constantly split. The finding is well depicted on the phono- and spectrograms. Echocardiography showed a 13 x 8 mm secundum type ASD. Pulmonary artery flow velocity was 1.7 m/s and aortic flow 0.9 m/s. Because the ASD secundum murmur is caused by increased pulmonary artery flow, the sound is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the physiological sound. In such cases, attention should be given to the possible splitting of the second heart sound. Area of auscultation: left second ic space (LIC2). Duration 91%, peak frequency 126 Hz, volume 19%.

### Cardiac auscultation: a glorious past – and it does have a future! [^115CeLed]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiac auscultation remains an important part of clinical medicine. The standard acoustic stethoscope, which has been useful for more than a century, cannot process, store, and play back sounds or provide visual display, and teaching is hindered because there is no means to distribute the same sounds simultaneously to more than one listener. Modern portable and inexpensive tools are now available to provide, through digital electronic means, better sound quality with visual display and the ability to replay sounds of interest at either full or half speed with no loss of frequency representation or sound quality. Visual display is possible in both standard waveform and spectral formats. The latter format is readily available and provides certain advantages over the time-honored waveform (phonocardiographic) method. Both methods, however, can and should be used simultaneously. Sound signals obtained electronically may then be subjected to objective visual and numerical analysis, transmitted to distant sites, and stored in medical records. Signal analysis shows early promise for clinical application, such as in the assessment of severity of aortic stenosis and in the separation of innocent from organic murmurs. In addition to their clinical value, these methods provide a critical vehicle for the teaching of cardiac auscultation, a method that can and should be preserved for future generations.

### Heart murmurs… [^117YRXnj]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points A Heart murmur results from turbulent blood flow. A complete history and physical examination are most important for evaluating a cardiac murmur. The intensity of a murmur does not necessarily reflect the severity of abnormality. Innocent murmurs are systolic, less than grade 3 in intensity, and louden when the patient moves from an upright position to a supine position. Electrocardiography and echocardiography are usually performed to define the cause of a pathological murmur.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^11435sjy]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

More than 90% of heart murmurs in children are innocent. Frequently the skills of the first examiner are not adequate to differentiate between innocent and pathological murmurs. Our goal was to evaluate the value of a simple and low-cost phonocardiographic recording and analysis system in determining the characteristic features of heart murmurs in children and in distinguishing innocent systolic murmurs from pathological.

Methods

The system consisting of an electronic stethoscope and a multimedia laptop computer was used for the recording, monitoring and analysis of auscultation findings. The recorded sounds were examined graphically and numerically using combined phono-spectrograms. The data consisted of heart sound recordings from 807 pediatric patients, including 88 normal cases without any murmur, 447 innocent murmurs and 272 pathological murmurs. The phono-spectrographic features of heart murmurs were examined visually and numerically. From this database, 50 innocent vibratory murmurs, 25 innocent ejection murmurs and 50 easily confusable, mildly pathological systolic murmurs were selected to test whether quantitative phono-spectrographic analysis could be used as an accurate screening tool for systolic heart murmurs in children.

Results

The phono-spectrograms of the most common innocent and pathological murmurs were presented as examples of the whole data set. Typically, innocent murmurs had lower frequencies (below 200 Hz) and a frequency spectrum with a more harmonic structure than pathological cases. Quantitative analysis revealed no significant differences in the duration of S1 and S2 or loudness of systolic murmurs between the pathological and physiological systolic murmurs. However, the pathological murmurs included both lower and higher frequencies than the physiological ones (p < 0.001 for both low and high frequency limits). If the systolic murmur contained intensive frequency components of over 200 Hz, or its length accounted for over 80% of the whole systolic duration, it was considered pathological. Using these criteria, 90% specificity and 91% sensitivity in screening were achieved.

Conclusion

Phono-spectrographic analysis improves the accuracy of primary heart murmur evaluation and educates inexperienced listener. Using simple quantitative criterias a level of pediatric cardiologist is easily achieved in screening heart murmurs in children.

### Deep learning algorithm for automated cardiac murmur detection via a digital stethoscope platform [^114GrNnR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Last, our validation set consisted primarily of patients presenting through both tertiary care centers and a community cardiology clinic diagnosed with severe VHD via standard transthoracic echocardiography. Thus, subjects requiring other diagnostics to confirm disease severity, such as dobutamine stress echocardiography for low‐flow, low‐gradient AS, or 3‐dimensional transesophageal echocardiography for MR, were not captured. Similarly, our algorithm was developed on a training set from subjects seen in actual clinical practice. Although these subjects may well represent the US population, they may not be reflective of developing countries, where the prevalence and cause of VHD are different. Because these populations would likely benefit from an accessible and low‐cost decision‐support tool, like the one tested herein, further investigations are warranted.

Our results also illustrate several physiologic principles within cardiovascular disease. Although our algorithm evaluates for murmurs, auscultatory findings are much richer than this. AS is an excellent example, as the intensity of the A2 component of the second heart sound and the timing of the peak of the systolic murmur are considered indicators of disease severity. 13 An extended algorithm inclusive of other predictors of VHD, beyond the presence of a murmur, may improve disease screening performance. In addition, both the cardiologists and the algorithm perform better in detecting AS than detecting MR. This may be attributed to AS having a more discernible auscultatory signature. Physiologically, MR produces a load‐dependent murmur, with the severity of regurgitation dependent on minute‐to‐minute hemodynamics. Moreover, MR can be directional, and therefore may not manifest a murmur at a predefined auscultatory location. Additional recording positions or physiologic maneuvers might also improve disease screening performance.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^111kjxZe]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

Point-of-care scans have been shown to be safe and effective in acute medical presentationsbut have not previously been examined in patients with a murmur, although their use has been suggested in an international opinion paper. We found that only 30% of patients with an asymptomatic murmur had any grade of valve disease which is similar to the 29% and 31% frequencies shown in large series of open access echocardiograms in the UKand Holland. This is also consistent with recently published workshowing that auscultation by general practitioners has a sensitivity of only 44% and specificity of 69% for the detection of significant valve disease on TTE. In an analysis of open access echocardiography, we detected significant valve disease in 127 (18%) of 706 patients referred because of a murmur but in 267 (15%) of 1745 patients when we extended the indications for echocardiography to include a potentially cardiac symptom, or atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, descriptive surveyssuggest that general practitioners may not have time to auscultate. A murmur auscultated by a general practitioner will remain important but echocardiography is the 'gold standard' for detection. A point-of-care scan would allow basic echocardiography to be more widely available to patients with any risk factor for valve disease including abnormalities on the history, examination or ECG or potentially age > 75.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^111YN4V2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background The success of cardiac auscultation varies widely among medical professionals, which can lead to missed treatments for structural heart disease. Applying machine learning to cardiac auscultation could address this problem, but despite recent interest, few algorithms have been brought to clinical practice. We evaluated a novel suite of Food and Drug Administration-cleared algorithms trained via deep learning on > 15000 heart sound recordings. Methods and Results We validated the algorithms on a data set of 2375 recordings from 615 unique subjects. This data set was collected in real clinical environments using commercially available digital stethoscopes, annotated by board-certified cardiologists, and paired with echocardiograms as the gold standard. To model the algorithm in clinical practice, we compared its performance against 10 clinicians on a subset of the validation database. Our algorithm reliably detected structural murmurs with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.4%. When limiting the analysis to clearly audible murmurs in adults, performance improved to a sensitivity of 97.9% and specificity of 90.6%. The algorithm also reported timing within the cardiac cycle, differentiating between systolic and diastolic murmurs. Despite optimizing acoustics for the clinicians, the algorithm substantially outperformed the clinicians (average clinician accuracy, 77.9%; algorithm accuracy, 84.7%.) Conclusions The algorithms accurately identified murmurs associated with structural heart disease. Our results illustrate a marked contrast between the consistency of the algorithm and the substantial interobserver variability of clinicians. Our results suggest that adopting machine learning algorithms into clinical practice could improve the detection of structural heart disease to facilitate patient care.

### Separation and characterization of maternal cardiac and vascular sounds in the third trimester of pregnancy [^111v8GCX]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the vascular sounds of the uteroplacental blood flow obtained by microphones.

Methods

The present retrospective study took place in an anechoic chamber facility at Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2012, and included pregnant participants aged 18–40 years with a singleton pregnancy at 32–36 weeks and a parity of 0–2. Abdominal Doppler ultrasonography was performed bilaterally on the uterine arteries. Subsequently, in the same positions, sound recordings were performed with microphones. The derived raw sound signal was separated into two frequency ranges, and characterized accordingly.

Results

The mean pregnancy length among 25 participants was 33.6 ± 2.0 weeks. The pulsatility index of the uterine artery was 0.67 ± 0.24. All 50 recordings displayed the first and second maternal heart sounds (frequency 25–100 Hz), and in 17 of 50 recordings, maternal vascular murmurs (frequency 200–800 Hz) were present. The average pulse wave velocity between the maternal aortic valve and the uterine artery was estimated to be 6.6 ± 1.5 m/s.

Conclusion

Maternal vascular murmurs in the frequency range of 200–800 Hz were identified as a possible marker of abnormal uteroplacental blood flow, and provide a means to measure the arterial pulse wave velocity.

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^1161nxm9]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3.3 Recommendation 3

Requests in asymptomatic murmur without a previous echocardiogram, a basic/level 1 study should be used to triage the need for a minimum standard TTE.

1.3.3.1 Background to Recommendation 3

In TTE indicated for a murmur, the yield of moderate or severe HVD is 11%–18%. Over half have no disease and many do not even have a murmur when auscultated at a specialist murmur clinic.

Differentiating a flow murmur from a pathological murmur from the request alone is usually impossible, since the required characteristics for example, soft second heart sound are not included. Furthermore, the accuracy of auscultation skills of clinicians is declining therefore making the original description of the murmur less reliable.

It is therefore inappropriate use of resources to perform comprehensive studies in all patients referred with a diagnosis of a murmur as the majority will have no valve disease.

The basic/level 1 study needs to be performed by a fully accredited and experienced clinical scientist or physiologist who can recognize signs of mild disease requiring a minimum standard TTE (Table 1).

One model, as used at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London, is a murmur clinic but requests can also be included in a general basic/level 1 list. An alternative model is a focussed study with "add‐ons" of a pulmonary valve view and a color map of the ventricular septum in the 4‐chamber view.

Further time saving can be arranged locally using health care assistants to prepare patients for all scans including basic/level 1 studies, an approach we highly recommend as it allows the physiologist to focus on the echo studies, be more efficient and is cost‐effective.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^111HNHTp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previously, the application of machine learning to heart sound analysis has been hindered by inconsistent data sets, a lack of true clinical validation, and the inherent subjectivity of the auscultatory exam when defining the ground truth. Here, we demonstrated the ability of a novel suite of machine learning algorithms to automate the evaluation of heart sounds on the largest and most diverse database to date. Our algorithm performed well across both adults and children over a wide range of diseases. The data set was collected in real clinical environments and annotated with the best subjective ground truth possible, that of a panel of expert cardiologists. Furthermore, as a newly Food and Drug Administration‐cleared tool on a commercially available device, these algorithms can be brought immediately to clinical practice for maximal impact.

The signal quality algorithm behaves intuitively when compared against the expert annotators. Consistent with the recordings being taken in actual clinical environments, the good signal rate reflects actual clinical experience, differing only by 3.1% between the algorithm (84.3%) and the expert annotators (87.4%). Because signal quality is inherently a subjective measure, we used the average value for the final signal quality label. There may well be instances wherein one annotator cannot detect heart sounds, yet the others can. A recording could thus be labeled as poor signal quality from an averaged signal quality score, falsely lowering the expert good signal rate. The algorithm's good signal rate of 33.5% on recordings with the lowest signal quality annotation (Figure 2B) may be explained by this phenomenon.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^116BFF45]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Valvular regurgitation grading — integrative assessment and documentation: Characterization of the severity of regurgitant lesions is among the most difficult problems in valvular heart disease, with difficulty related to the lack of a true gold standard and dependence on hemodynamic conditions at the time of evaluation. For CMR, the evaluation involves fewer parameters, is mostly quantitative, but is still influenced by technical and physiologic factors; to mitigate these effects, quantitative internal checks should be employed, and for isolated MR the difference between the LV SV and aortic total forward flow should match the difference between the LV SV and the pulmonary artery total forward flow or RV SV. Thus, an integrative, comprehensive approach is essential, and interpreters must integrate information and disregard outlying data to make a best estimate of severity. The consensus of the writing group is to classify grading into mild, moderate, and severe; "Trace" regurgitation is used when regurgitation is barely detected, is usually physiologic particularly in right heart valves and MV, and may not produce an audible murmur. Because severity may be influenced by hemodynamic conditions, it is essential to record blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm at the time of the study and note the patient's medications whenever possible.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — current symptoms and signs: physical examination — define data elements and permissible values for documentation. Body mass index has permissible values of Numeric, kg/m² or Unknown. Third heart sound (S3) is recorded as presence of a third (mid-diastolic) heart sound, and fourth heart sound (S4) as presence of a fourth (late-diastolic) heart sound, with permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown. Heart murmur status is captured as presence of heart murmur(s), and heart murmur timing is documented as Systolic, Diastolic, Continuous, or Other. Lung (pulmonary) examination findings specify findings on auscultation of the lungs with permissible values including Clear or normal, Rales, Decreased breath sounds or dullness, Rhonchi, Wheezing, Crepitations, Pleural friction rub, Absent breath sounds, and Other findings, with example permissible value definitions such as Lungs are normal on auscultation and Abnormal breath sounds (crackles) heard on auscultation indicating inflammation, fluid, or infection of the lung.

Mitral regurgitation — auscultatory clues distinguishing primary versus secondary MR: In primary MR, the presence of a diastolic filling complex (S3 plus short diastolic murmur) is usually associated with a significant regurgitant volume and severe MR, and one or more non‑ejection clicks may be audible. Differential radiation can suggest leaflet pathology, with murmurs from anterior leaflet flail directed to the axilla and left infrascapular area, whereas murmurs from posterior leaflet flail radiate anteriorly and can be confused with systolic ejection murmurs. With secondary MR, the murmur is usually best heard at the apex and radiates to the axilla, and an S3 gallop is harder to interpret because it may reflect underlying LV dysfunction.

Table 3
Duration of S1, S2, systolic murmur and relative duration of systolic murmur

Although the pathological systolic murmurs were somewhat louder than the physiological ones, there were no significant differences between the groups (Relative Amplitude in Table 4). This confirmed that the series fulfilled our aim to select easily confusable cases. However, the pathological murmurs included both lower and higher frequencies than physiological ones (p < 0.001 for both low and high frequency limits).

Table 4
Relative amplitude and low and high frequency limits of systolic murmur

Sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 84% were achieved using a cut-off value of 65% for the relative duration of systolic murmur to differentiate between pathological and physiological murmurs (Table 5 and Figure 9 – upper left). Using that cut-off, 12 (24%) pathological and 12 (16%) physiological murmurs were misclassified.

We next assessed the performance of the murmur classification algorithm for all recordings with good signal quality by both the experts (signal quality ≥ 2) and the signal quality detection algorithm (N = 1895). The initial panel of experts consisted of 3 board‐certified cardiologists who annotated all recordings, yielding a κ statistic of 0.61, indicating modest agreement. In the cases where a consensus annotation was not achieved (N = 1175), an independent fourth board‐certified cardiologist provided an additional annotation such that for this subset of recordings, the majority vote was used as the ground truth label. We defined a structural murmur as one in which both an audible murmur was detected by the annotators and SHD was identified on the echocardiogram. We observed high test performance for this task, with a sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.4% (Tables 6 and 7).

Murmur Classification Algorithm Sensitivity and Specificity at Detecting Structural Murmurs

The confusion matrix in Table 6 yields metrics (with 95% CIs) given in Table 7.

Upon stratifying murmurs by grade, we observed progressively better test characteristics with louder murmurs (Table 8).

Observed Murmur Classification Algorithm Performance Across Different Grades of Systolic Murmurs

Test characteristics for the algorithm were similar across auscultation locations (Table S4). The algorithm performed slightly better in an adult population than a pediatric population (Table S5). However, for clearly audible murmurs, defined as a mean annotation of grade ≥ 2, the structural murmur detection algorithm showed similarly excellent sensitivity (98%) in both populations (Table 9).

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) clinical examination — VSD is characterized clinically by a systolic murmur usually maximal at the left lower sternal border; when RV pressure is low the murmur is blowing and pansystolic; with incremental increases in RV pressure, the murmur is shorter, softer, and lower pitched; and small, muscular VSDs are very high-pitched and occupy early systole only because muscular contraction closes the defect.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — postrepair clinical examination: The typical postrepair patient has a soft ejection systolic murmur from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT); a low-pitched, delayed diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area is consistent with pulmonary regurgitation, and such patients usually have an absent P2 component of the second sound. Additional findings may include a pansystolic murmur of a VSD patch leak and a diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR). Some adults may present after only a palliative shunt, and such patients usually have cyanosis and clubbing with a continuous murmur if the shunt is patent.

### Echocardiographic study on the origin of the innocent flow murmurs [^111LEzUt]. Pediatric Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

To investigate the origin of the pulmonary systolic ejection innocent flow murmur (IFM), echocardiographic examinations were undertaken in 30 children with IFM and in a control group consisting of 28 healthy children without murmur. Compared to the controls, the diameters of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and aortic valve annulus and aortic valve area tended to be smaller, whereas stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output were slightly greater in children with IFM, but they were not statistically significant. Mean fractional shortening was significantly higher in children with IFM. Peak flow velocity of LVOT, right ventricular outflow tract, aorta, and pulmonary artery, mean velocity and velocity time integral of the aortic and pulmonary flow, and maximal acceleration of the aortic flow were all significantly higher in the IFM group compared to the controls. The variables of left-sided flow velocities in the same individuals with IFM were significantly higher compared to those derived from the right heart. The ratios of the SV to the LVOT diameter and to the aortic valve area were found to be significantly greater. It was concluded that IFM originates from higher blood flow velocities in the region of LVOT and aortic valve annulus, and that the increased flow velocity results from the larger SV passing through the relatively narrow LVOT and aortic valve in children with IFM.

### Audible coronary artery stenosis [^115tocLt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses generate turbulent blood flow patterns that manifest as intracoronary murmurs. This study aims to evaluate the performance of modern acoustic detection of these murmurs by acoustic signals captured from patients undergoing gold standard comparative coronary angiography.

Methods

We prospectively studied 156 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography, excluding those with acute coronary syndrome, prior chest surgery, or significant valvular disease. Acoustic signals were captured before arterial access. Angiographic degree of stenosis in each coronary artery was graded blinded to clinical and acoustic data. Acoustic data were analyzed blinded to clinical and angiographic data, categorizing subjects as "normal", "diseased", or "inconclusive". Of 156 patients examined, 123 generated analyzable data.

Results

Angiographically significant stenosis (≥ 50%) prevalence was 52% (18%, 23%, 11% with 1-, 2-, 3-vessel disease, respectively). Acoustic detection sensitivity and specificity for stenosis ≥ 50% in any vessel were 0.70 and 0.80, respectively (negative predictive value, 0.71; positive predictive value, 0.79). Acoustic detection optimally identified stenosis ≥ 50% with an area under the curve of 0.75. For stenosis ≥ 50% in major vessels only (left main, proximal-mid left anterior descending, proximal-mid circumflex, proximal-mid right coronary), prevalence was 46%; sensitivity and specificity were 0.72 and 0.76, respectively (negative predictive value, 0.76; positive predictive value, 0.72; area under the curve, 0.76).

Conclusions

Acoustic signal patterns and modern analysis techniques may be used to identify intracoronary murmurs generated by hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses in all major vessels. Further investigation is warranted to compare the clinical performance of this modality with current noninvasive approaches that evaluate patients at risk for atherosclerotic and obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^112WpNAw]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Parameters

The timings, the intensities and the frequency contents of the sounds were manually extracted from the phono-spectrogram using the software's graphical measurement tools (see any of the Figures from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). First, the whole recording is listened to carefully. The locations of S1 and S2 are recognized from the graphical presentation showing a moving marker over the phono-spectrogram during replaying. Then, a shorter interesting area containing three whole heart cycles is selected by zooming the signal. The timings are read from the time-scale (at the bottom) by graphically studying both the phonocardiogram and the spectrogram, deciding the duration of the sound events and dragging the marker over the selected time segment. The intensities of S1, S2 and the murmur are read from the scale (on the right) by moving the marker with the mouse over the phonocardiogram. The loudness of the murmur was estimated from the phonocardiogram by comparing the maximum amplitude of the murmur to the average value of the maximum first and second heart sounds Finally, the frequencies in Hertz are read by moving the marker over the spectrogram. The typical intensity for the high and low frequency limits of the systolic murmurs was around -45–50 dB.

Figure 1
Innocent vibratory murmur in a 7-year-old. On auscultation, the typical early and midsystolic low-vibrating murmur is best heard at the left fourth intercostal space and the apex (S1 = First heart sound, S2 = Second heart sound, SM = Systolic Murmur). The phonogram shows a rising and falling early-to-midsystolic murmur, and the spectrogram shows a typical dense configuration and a descending frequency with a maximum gradient of approx. 150 Hz. The auscultation area was the left fourth intercostal space (LIC4). Duration 56%, peak frequency 149 Hz and volume 32%.

Figure 2

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Physical examination — auscultated heart sound findings include third heart sound (S3), fourth heart sound (S4), rub, and heart murmur. Third heart sound (S3) is the presence of a third (mid-diastolic) heart sound and fourth heart sound (S4) is the presence of a fourth (late-diastolic) heart sound. A rub is an auscultated finding describing high or medium pitched and scratchy sound, generated by inflammation of the pericardial sac. A heart murmur is an auscultated finding describing a series of audible vibrations of varying intensity, frequency, quality, configuration, and duration created by turbulent blood flow in the heart or surrounding vessels. Each of these entries uses permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown.

### Automated cardiac auscultation for detection of pathologic heart murmurs [^1174QtzH]. Pediatric Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Experienced cardiologists can usually recognize pathologic heart murmurs with high sensitivity and specificity, although nonspecialists with less clinical experience may have more difficulty. Harsh, pansystolic murmurs of intensity grade ≥ 3 at the left upper sternal border (LUSB) are likely to be associated with pathology. In this study, we designed a system for automatically detecting systolic murmurs due to a variety of conditions and examined the correlation between relative murmur intensity and likelihood of pathology. Cardiac auscultatory examinations of 194 children and young adults were recorded, digitized, and stored along with corresponding echocardiographic diagnoses, and automated spectral analysis using continuous wavelet transforms was performed. Patients without heart disease and either no murmur or an innocent murmur (n = 95) were compared to patients with a variety of cardiac diagnoses and a pathologic systolic murmur present at the LUSB (n = 99). The sensitivity and specificity of the automated system for detecting pathologic murmurs with intensity grade ≥ 2 were both 96%, and for grade ≥ 3 murmurs they were 100%. Automated cardiac auscultation and interpretation may be useful as a diagnostic aid to support clinical decision making.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^1175HKfj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps more importantly, such algorithms require regulatory approval to even be incorporated into clinical practice. Although several have received Food and Drug Administration clearance, the performance in true clinical environments remains unknown, either because the test characteristics seen in realistic clinical validation cohorts are lower than the original reports (SensiCardiac, K131044), or the algorithms are confined for use on discontinued devices (eMurmur, K181988).

In this research we present a novel suite of Food and Drug Administration‐cleared algorithms that characterize and classify heart sounds at the point of care. The algorithms screen signal quality and identify fundamental heart sounds (first and second heart sounds [S1 and S2]), murmurs associated with SHD (pathological murmurs), and murmur timing within the cardiac cycle (systolic and diastolic). We validate our algorithm with the largest data set to date entirely from real clinical environments, featuring a consistent data collection protocol, a diverse patient population, and clear ground truth labels from both expert cardiologists and echocardiograms as the clinical gold standard. Our findings illustrate the potential of a fully automated suite of machine learning algorithms to successfully and objectively detect SHD at the bedside as part of routine clinical care.

### Exertional dyspnoea in a 28-year-old woman [^111jnuKu]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 28-year-old woman with a history of critical pulmonic stenosis, status postsurgical valvotomy and subsequent pulmonary valve replacement, presented to the cardiology clinic with 1year of progressive exertional dyspnoea. She has a heart rate of 75 bpm and blood pressure of 110/55mm Hg. Cardiac auscultation reveals a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternum and an early 3/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram is obtained (figure 1).

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^1164rWah]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The first evaluation of children's heart murmur is one of the basic tasks of welfare clinic practitioners and school medical officers. However, based on their frequently limited auscultation experience, they might not be able to recognize the innocence of a heart murmur. Even the auscultation skills of pediatric residents have been found to be suboptimal. Several healthy children are referred to pediatric cardiologists or for echocardiography. Parental anxiety may also be a reason to refer the patient for unnecessary examinations, and it is important to recognize an innocent murmur as soon as it is found. Auscultation training will naturally improve practitioners' listening skills.

Previous studies have shown that pediatric cardiologists, based on clinical examination, can differentiate innocent from pathological murmurs with high sensitivity (82.92%) and specificity (76.99%). Even better results have been attained by using advanced signal processing and pattern recognition tools. Artificial neural network-based screening is reported to have 100% sensitivity and specificity.

The capability of a doctor or a computerized system to differentiate between pathological and innocent murmurs depends on the quality of the pathological murmurs. It is easy to recognize loud murmurs as pathological by means of clinical or digital analysis. Serious defects are seldom missed, and the challenge is actually to detect mild defects. Small muscular VSD, mild PS or AS causes no hemodynamic harm, but they may require endocarditis prophylaxis. ASD secundum may also be hard to diagnose only by auscultation.

The purpose of this article was to demonstrate the capabilities of a modern digital system for phonocardiographic recording and analysis and to evaluate its potential for differentiating the characteristic features of heart murmurs in children. Another goal was to investigate how the numerical features measured from a phono-spectrogram can be used to distinguish innocent systolic murmurs from pathological murmurs, which are generally hard to identify in a routine clinical examination. This article additionally concludes more than ten years' experience of studying heart sounds.

### Murmur clinic: validation of a new model for detecting heart valve disease [^117Njb84]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Analysis

Auscultation was classed as normal if there was no murmur heard or a likely benign systolic flow murmur (soft, short ejection systolic murmur with a well-heard second sound). Auscultation was classed as abnormal if there was a loud, long ejection systolic murmur or a soft, or absent second sound or a pansystolic or diastolic murmur. The point-of-care scan was classed as normal if there was no more than minimal thickening or trivial regurgitation. It was classed as abnormal if there was anything more than mild thickening or trivial regurgitation. The TTE was classed as: normal, mildly abnormal (advised to have serial TTE after 3 years as per international guidelines), moderately abnormal (offered follow-up in a specialist valve clinic) and severely abnormal (requiring an immediate cardiology opinion). For the purposes of comparison with auscultation or point-of-care echocardiography, the three grades of abnormal (mild, moderate and severe) were combined.

Mean age was calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy and positive and negative likelihood of auscultation and point-of-care scans against standard echocardiography were calculated. Comparison of results for auscultation and point-of-care scans against standard TTE was with a two-tailed exact McNemar's test. The results of auscultation between scientist and cardiologist was with a two-sided Fisher's exact test. Calculations were performed using Stata V.14.2. Costs were estimated using the current National Health Service tariff of £81.73 for a standard simple echocardiogram in an adult. An estimate of £27.24 was made for a point-of-care scan since three can be performed in the time taken for one standard study.

### Can cardiologists distinguish innocent from pathologic murmurs in neonates? [^1157TQov]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical assessment of murmurs in neonates, as performed by pediatric cardiologists, and to identify clinical features that predict the presence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in this population.

Study Design

Neonates (n = 201) referred for outpatient evaluation of a heart murmur were enrolled consecutively. After a clinical evaluation, the cardiologist documented whether the murmur was "likely innocent" or "likely pathologic". The cardiologist repeated his/her assessment after an electrocardiogram. Echocardiography served as the gold standard.

Results

The median age was 12 days (range, 2–31 days). CHD was present in 113 of 201 (56%). Clinical assessment alone identified patients with CHD with a sensitivity of 80.5% (95% CI, 73.2–87.8), specificity of 90.9% (95% CI, 84.9–96.9), positive predictive value of 91.9% (95% CI, 86.6–97.3), and negative predictive value of 78.4% (95% CI, 70.4–86.4). The addition of an electrocardiogram did not improve these test characteristics. Features that were predictive of CHD were murmur quality (P < .0001), location (P = 0.02), and timing (P = 0.04). No patients requiring catheter or surgical intervention were missed by clinical assessment.

Conclusions

The prevalence of CHD in this referral population was high. Clinical assessment detected all complex CHD, although some simple lesions were missed. Murmur quality, location, and timing were predictive of CHD.

Physical examination in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — Classically, patients with HCM have a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur often due to SAM of the mitral valve with LVOTO, with additional findings including prominent apical point of maximal impulse, abnormal carotid pulse, and a fourth heart sound; presence of outflow tract obstruction should be sought at rest and with provocative maneuvers when possible; SAM related to an elongated anterior mitral valve leaflet and papillary muscle abnormalities may result in leaflet separation or poor coaptation with posteriorly directed MR in late systole over the mitral position; and those without LVOTO may have a normal physical examination.

### Tricuspid regurgitation: a review of current interventional management [^112nXE2e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Physical Examination

The classic murmur of TR is a holosystolic murmur heard best at the right or left midsternal border depending on the degree of right ventricle (RV) remodeling. Any maneuver that increases venous return will augment a TR murmur intensity. Carvallo sign is the increased intensity of the holosystolic murmur with inspiration. Severe TR may not have an appreciable murmur on examination due to equalization of pressures between the RA and RV and loss of turbulent flow.

Lancisi sign references large, systolic, and monomorphic jugular vein pulsations that commonly are mistaken for carotid pulsations. During systole, retrograde blood flows through the incompetent TV into the RA and the internal jugular vein.

In severe TR the liver may be pulsatile, and a systolic murmur may be heard over the liver. Massive and torrential TR may induce a diastolic flow rumble. Signs of right heart failure (HF) are common including peripheral edema. Severe right HF with severe TR can result in significant hepatic and gastrointestinal congestion. The liver is often enlarged and tender due to hepatic venous congestion. Chronic hepatic venous congestion can precipitate hepatic insufficiency. Similarly renal venous congestion can lead to cardiorenal syndrome with poor urine output. Advanced right HF can result in shock due to lesser forward cardiac output, which presents with typical signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock.

### Should we cross the valve: the risk of retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle in patients with aortic stenosis [^116AwyRX]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario

A 67-year-old man is referred to your cardiology clinic complaining of worsening angina and dyspnea on exertion. Physical examination reveals a harsh grade IV/VI late-peaking crescendo-decresendo systolic murmur, loudest at the upper sternal border. The aortic closure sound is diminished. Echocardiography demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 50%, no evidence of mitral regurgitation, and severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a peak aortic gradient of 4.8 m/s (92 mm Hg) and a mean aortic gradient of 55 mm Hg. You schedule him for coronary angiography but wonder whether you should reevaluate his aortic valve gradient invasively.

Literature Search

Combining the keywords "aortic valve stenosis" and "heart catheterization/adverse effects", you find 72 articles. From these you choose the following: Omran H, Schmidt H, Hackenbroch M, et al. Silent and apparent cerebral embolism after retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve in valvular stenosis: a prospective randomized study. Lancet 2003;361:1241–6.

Question

What is the stroke risk of retrograde catheterization of the aortic valve in patients with AS?

Design

The study was prospective and randomized; unblinded treatment but with blinded assessment of outcomes.

Setting

The study was conducted at a single center in Bonn, Germany.

Patients

A total of 152 patients with known or suspected AS undergoing cardiac catheterization were randomized to catheterization with or without retrograde passage of the aortic valve in a 2:1 randomization format. Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the day before and within 48 hours after cardiac catheterization. Patients with unclear echo findings or contraindications to MRI or transesophageal echocardiography were excluded. There were no significant baseline differences between the 2 groups: mean age 70.5 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 62%, and mean aortic valve gradient 51 mm Hg. All patients were evaluated in the groups to which they had been randomized and, other than the experimental intervention, the 2 groups were treated similarly (with the exception of the administration of 5000 units of intravenous heparin to the group receiving retrograde aortic catheterization). A control group of 32 patients without aortic valvular stenosis was evaluated as well.

Intervention

The intervention consisted of retrograde passage of the aortic valve for the purpose of obtaining an invasive aortic valve pressure gradient.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome measures were acute cerebral embolic events, defined by MRI findings within 48 hours after catheterization (as compared to precatheterization MRI) and by clinical examination.

Main Results

Twenty-two of 101 patients (22%) assigned to retrograde catheterization developed new focal MRI abnormalities consistent with acute cerebral embolic events. Three of these patients (3%) demonstrated clinically apparent neurologic deficits. None of the patients who did not undergo retrograde catheterization — and none of the control patients — had MRI or clinical evidence of cerebral embolism.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^112yi7Tn]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

It is not simple to estimate absolute volume of heart sound. The point of maximal intensity of the murmur and the thickness of the chest vary and affects on the intensities of the sound components. In our study, the sound volume of murmur was calculated as a percentage of the volume of murmur compared to the mean volumes of S1 and S2. This may be misleading, as we can see in case 4. The volume of the aortic closure sound is decreased because of valvular stenosis, and the volume of murmur is over estimated compared to auscultation findings.

By analyzing the combined phono-spectrogram, it is possible to achieve the level of an experienced pediatric cardiologist in screening heart murmurs. In this study, by using special criteria, sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 91% were attained. Both sensitivity and specificity were higher than using phonocradiographic or spectral analysis alone. The results were less good than those obtained in previous studies using the methods of advanced signal processing, pattern recognition and artificial networks. In these previous studies, however, the series consisted of pathological cases with distinct and easily recognizable features of heart sounds and murmurs. We agree that it is easy to distinguish fast turbulent flow with a pressure gradient of over 25 mmHg, and in such cases phono-spectral analysis is reliable. We here examined the grey area, i.e. typical physiological cases compared to mildly pathological murmurs, and the most common pitfalls.

### A systolic murmur is a common presentation of aortic regurgitation detected by echocardiography [^113u4SNP]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The finding of aortic regurgitation at a classical examination is a diastolic murmur.

Hypothesis

Aortic regurgitation is more likely to be associated with a systolic than with a diastolic murmur during routine screening by a noncardiologist physician.

Methods

In all, 243 asymptomatic patients (mean age 42 ± 10 years) with no known cardiac disease but at risk for aortic valve disease due to prior mediastinal irradiation (≥ 35 Gy) underwent auscultation by a noncardiologist followed by echocardiography. A systolic murmur was considered benign if it was grade ≤ II/VI, not holosystolic, was not heard at the apex, did not radiate to the carotids, and was not associated with a diastolic murmur.

Results

Of the patients included, 122 (49%) were male, and 86 (35%) had aortic regurgitation, which was trace in 20 (8%), mild in 52 (21%), and moderate in 14 (6%). A systolic murmur was common in patients with aortic regurgitation, occurring in 12 (86%) with moderate, 26 (50%) with mild, 6 (30%) with trace, and 27 (17%) with no aortic regurgitation (p < 0.0001). The systolic murmurs were classified as benign in 21 (78%) patients with mild and 8 (67%) with moderate aortic regurgitation. Diastolic murmurs were rare, occurring in two (14%) with moderate, two (4%) with mild, and three (2%) with no aortic regurgitation (p = 0.15).

Conclusions

An isolated systolic murmur is a common auscultatory finding by a noncardiologist in patients with moderate or milder aortic regurgitation. A systolic murmur in patients at risk for aortic valve disease should prompt a more thorough physical examination for aortic regurgitation.

Statistics

To find statistically significant parameters, two-tailed heteroscedastic t-test for independent samples was used to calculate the p-values. Three sequential beats were manually selected from each recording. The mean value and standard deviation of the parameters over three beats were calculated. Based on the statistical results, the relative duration of the systolic murmur (percentage of murmur duration out of the interval between the end of S1 and the beginning of S2) and the occurrence of intensive high-frequency components were used as criteria for testing the pathology of the murmur.

### Samuel A. levine and the history of grading systolic murmurs [^116AYFBz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Murmurs were described first by Laennec in 1819, after which the significance of a murmur became a matter of debate. By the late 19th century, many physicians regarded systolic murmurs as "organic", whereas others believed that they were often "functional". Samuel Levine became a central figure in separating functional from organic systolic murmurs. Freeman and Levine's 1933 study of 1,000 "noncardiac" subjects determined the frequency, cause, and significance of systolic murmurs. Murmurs were rated on a scale of 1 to 6 grades of intensity. Approximately 20% of their patients had grade 1 or 2 systolic murmurs. Hypertension, fever, tachycardia, and anemia were common factors, and the murmurs were considered functional because they would often disappear when these causes were controlled. Of 19 subjects with grade 3 or 4 murmurs, all were determined to have organic heart disease or anemia. Thus, louder systolic murmurs were found to be a significant finding, as were the cause, location, and effects of posture. They concluded that systolic murmurs often have an explanation and that their grade can be useful in the diagnosis and prognosis. They cautioned that a loud systolic murmur did not necessarily indicate a bad prognosis or even serious heart disease. Levine's system of grading a systolic murmur is valuable and persists into the 21st century.

### Evaluation and management of heart murmurs in children [^1158pR7y]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heart murmurs are common in healthy infants, children, and adolescents. Although most are not pathologic, a murmur may be the sole manifestation of serious heart disease. Historical elements that suggest pathology include family history of sudden cardiac death or congenital heart disease, in utero exposure to certain medications or alcohol, maternal diabetes mellitus, history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, and certain genetic disorders. Physical examination should focus on vital signs; age-appropriate exercise capacity; respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations of congestive heart failure; and a thorough cardiovascular examination, including features of the murmur, assessment of peripheral perfusion, and auscultation over the heart valves. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a pathologic murmur include a holosystolic or diastolic murmur, grade 3 or higher murmur, harsh quality, an abnormal S2, maximal murmur intensity at the upper left sternal border, a systolic click, or increased intensity when the patient stands. Electrocardiography and chest radiography rarely assist in the diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for patients with any other abnormal physical examination findings, a history of conditions that increase the likelihood of structural heart disease, symptoms suggesting underlying cardiac disease, or when a specific innocent murmur cannot be identified by the family physician. Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis and is recommended for evaluation of any potentially pathologic murmur, and for evaluation of neonatal heart murmurs because these are more likely to be manifestations of structural heart disease.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^113XiFuM]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Slight tricuspid leakage is a harmless finding. Mitral valve leakage and bicuspic aortic valve should be recognized because they require endocarditis prophylaxis. The patient with mitral leakage was a fearful retarded boy, and the recorded signal was weak in amplitude, which is why the highest frequencies were missed in the analysis, but the murmur was sustained until the beginning of the second heart sound, implying a pathological finding. The murmurs due to a bicuspic aortic valve without stenosis or with slight stenosis did not differ from the hyperkinetic aortic ejection murmur. The murmur of the patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy resembled vibratory innocent murmur. The difference between these murmurs was hardly seen in the spectrogram. Typically, the frequency of vibratory innocent murmur decreases within the systolic interval, while in this case of hypertropic cardiomyopathy it remained constant. The ECG finding was pathological, and the diagnosis was known beforehand. This particular murmur was rather loud, 31% in spectral analysis and 3/6 estimated clinically. However, 10 (20%) of vibratory murmurs were equal to or louder than 30% measured from phonogram.

As the examples show, the method did not recognize hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or mild aortic valve malformation and failed with the mitral leakage, because the recording was suboptimal. We recommend an echocardiography, when the vibratory or aortic ejection murmur is repeatedly found in adolescent age or when the recording is suboptimal. Naturally, young babies need always an echocardiography, because their pulmonary pressure may still be high and the results of heart sound analysis can be misleading.

Modern electronic stethoscopes are suitable for heart sound recording. Visual presentation of the auscultation finding provides an opportunity to study more objectively and quantitatively the timing, quality (frequency contents) and intensity of different heart sound and murmur components and helps us to understand and learn about the hemodynamics of the heart and the origin of cardiac murmurs.

Computer analysis is a powerful tool in teaching an unexperienced listener the art of auscultation. Furthermore, we believe that computer analysis can be a promising new diagnostic method that has a potential to reduce medical costs by eliminating unnecessary referrals, visits to specialists and echocardiograms, especially when the systolic murmur is weak. Recording of auscultation findings also makes teleconsultations possible and gives an opportunity to save cardiac or respiratory sounds, phonograms and spectrograms in electronic patient documents.

### Deep learning algorithms to detect murmurs associated with structural heart disease [^115oE1F4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The heart sound timing algorithm detects the S1 and S2, and has been referred to as heart sound segmentation in previous literature. The Eko DUO device is uniquely positioned to leverage the single lead ECG waveform to improve both S1 and S2 detection due to the alignment of the ECG R wave and the onset of S1. Intriguingly, including the single‐lead ECG with the heart sounds only improves S1 sensitivity by roughly 3% (Table S3). This underscores the success of our underlying heart sound segmentation algorithm from the raw audio itself. Similarly, murmurs have interfered with the segmentation techniques used in prior studies due to their additional high‐frequency content. However, our heart sound timing algorithm performs equally well in the presence of murmurs (Table S2).

Although the detection of the fundamental heart sounds may appear to have limited usefulness at the bedside, they facilitate the creation of a unique user interface to visualize algorithm results, namely an average heart sound waveform. This is analogous to the use of a signal‐averaged ECG beat for interpretation, which can reduce noise and reveal subtleties that influence clinical decisions, such as the presence of a P wave. Just as average ECG beats require identification of individual R waves, S1 detection from our algorithm allows the creation of a novel average heart sound waveform, facilitating additional interpretation at the bedside (Figure S2).

We anticipate that the murmur classification algorithm will have the most direct clinical application among our findings, because it can guide important clinical decisions such as obtaining a confirmatory echocardiogram. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate successful murmur classification, as opposed to murmur detection, on a diverse population across all ages and across the primary cardiac auscultation locations. Similar to previous research, and consistent with our pathophysiologic understanding of many forms of SHD, the sensitivity of the murmur classification algorithm increases proportionately with the expert‐assigned structural murmur grade. Murmur classification is subtly but significantly different from murmur detection. Murmur classification intends to identify and distinguish murmurs associated with echocardiogram‐confirmed SHD. By contrast, murmur detection solely reports the presence or absence of any murmur, with no insight into an underlying cause. As such, murmur classification, but not murmur detection, is capable of differentiating innocent from pathological murmurs.

Additional supporting data are available on request from the corresponding authors. All requests for raw phonocardiogram and/or clinical data will be expeditiously reviewed by the Eko legal team and appropriate institutional review boards to balance intellectual property and patient privacy with the need to advance the field. The algorithm was developed by Eko Devices (Oakland, CA) and received clearance (K213794) from the Food and Drug Administration in June 2022. The algorithm was trained on heart sound recordings from a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act‐compliant collection of recordings from Eko CORE and DUO electronic stethoscopes, combining data from both Eko's proprietary database populated by real‐world users and ongoing clinical studies at the London Health Sciences Center, London, Ontario, Canada and Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru. India. The algorithmic sequence is demonstrated in Figure 1.

Heart sound signal quality is first evaluated using a deep neural network model trained to classify heart sound recordings as either poor signal or good signal quality. Only heart sound recordings classified as good signal quality undergo further analysis. The murmur classification algorithm was trained to classify good quality heart sound recordings as either structural murmur or no structural murmur. Simultaneously, the heart sound timing algorithm identifies the locations of the first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2, respectively) within the phonocardiogram. If a structural murmur is detected, the S1 and S2 are used to determine the timing within the cardiac cycle as either systolic murmur, diastolic murmur, or systolic and diastolic murmur. When an Eko DUO device is used for data collection, the simultaneously measured single‐lead ECG is used for detection of the fundamental heart sounds via R‐wave detection.

### Understanding intracranial aneurysm sounds via high-fidelity fluid-structure-interaction modelling [^115mTc6u]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While there are no known studies that show the variation of frequency content over the cardiac cycle for an isolated aneurysm, Aaslid and Nornespresented Doppler ultrasound recordings of aneurysms with vasospasm. In one particular case, the recording had a strong band, which they called a musical murmur, at ~550 Hz superimposed over a systolic bruit ranging from 100 to 1500 Hz, with the band extending past the bruit into diastole (Fig. 7b). This recording resembles the spectrograms in the present study (Fig. 7b), which also have bands in the hundreds of Hz that extend into diastole beyond the underlying bruit. In Aaslid and Nornes, the band dissipates in the middle of diastole, while in the current study, the bands extended longer into diastole due to the lack of external damping, as noted earlier. Again, the frequencies of the bands in the present study were lower than those in Aaslid and Nornes, and notably, the bands were less sloped with time. However, the slope of the bands in FSI simulations should depend on the wall thickness and pressurization, e.g. in preliminary parametric studies, we have noted that the bands can be more sloped if the effective stiffness of the sac is lowered. Aaslid and Nornes postulated that the strong correlation of the murmur frequency to the flow velocity indicated that the musical murmurs were caused by a vortex shedding phenomenon. However, past CFD studies have typically shown that harmonic vortex shedding presents as strongly repeated banding structures starting in the lower frequency (25–100 Hz) range. Aaslid and Nornes noted that a harmonic of the band in their recording (Fig. 7b) was an artefact of their ultrasonic demodulation process. Our results suggest that single, narrow bands extending into diastole are modes of the vessel wall structure. As seen in the present study, in diastole these bands also vary in frequency, not due to the proportionality to flow velocity directly, but due to the change in internal fluid pressure, which stiffens the structure during systole and increases the modall frequencies.

### Teenage heart murmurs [^111e1G25]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The first-time appearance of a murmur in an adolescent can create a substantial amount of anxiety in the parents and the teenager. The appropriate evaluation and diagnosis is very important in decision-making regarding sports participation in this population. Accurate identification of the innocent murmurs can obviate the need for echocardiography. Identification of a pathologic murmur may reduce morbidity and, possibly, mortality in critical lesions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This article discusses the physiology and characteristics of different murmurs, and outlines an approach to cardiac murmurs in adolescents.

### Sudden hypoxemia after uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy: another form of SAM presentation [^112tMEt6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment for pulmonary edema caused by SAM-induced MR differs from treatment of other forms of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, even though left atrial pressure is increased in both conditions. The accepted treatments for cardiogenic pulmonary edema, such as diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropes, may worsen hypoxemia in patients with pulmonary edema caused by SAM-induced MR or even lead to cardiogenic shock or sudden death from LVOTO, if the cause remains unrecognized. Correct diagnosis of the underlying condition, i.e. SAM, is thus critically important for initiating appropriate treatment. Although the most common clinical finding in SAM or LVOTO is a new onset of systolic murmur peaking late, it is often difficult to obtain clear heart sounds during surgery or in the critical care setting, because of interference from noise induced by mechanical ventilation and other surrounding monitoring devices.

Bedside TTE may be an important first-line diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of SAM. It is also very helpful for differentiating SAM-related pulmonary edema from other forms of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Echocardiographic visualization of the mitral leaflet–ventricular septum contact during systole on 2D or M mode, or shark-tooth velocity contour in the LVOT on continuous Doppler flow are diagnostic for SAM. In addition, mosaic flow pattern in the LVOT and a posteriorly directed MR jet on CFD may suggest LOVOT and MR, respectively, secondary to SAM. In this case, the initial TTE revealed only the mosaic pattern in the LVOT with a slight MR jet. However, careful examination of TTE using sublingual nitrate clearly demonstrated a posteriorly directed MR jet and an increase in the LVOTO mosaic pattern. We could thus establish a diagnosis of SAM and secondary MR as the cause of hypoxemia in this patient.

TEE for the diagnosis of SAM is limited mostly to intraoperative intubated patients, because of its invasiveness. However, TEE could have clearly revealed systolic contact of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve to the septum. It is thus advisable to use TEE in patients for whom a bedside TTE is not sufficiently informative to diagnose SAM, especially hemodynamically unstable patients.

The present case underscores the fact that to make a diagnosis of SAM, it is important to bear in mind its possibility when unexplained hypoxemia or hypotension occur, even in patients without apparent structural abnormalities of the heart. Clinicians can then listen for systolic murmur or perform bedside TTE under vasodilation with nitrate, if necessary, and eventually perform TEE for timely initiation of appropriate treatment.

### ACC / AHA 2008 guidelines for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines on the management of adults with congenital heart disease) [^111xpC49]. Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta — clinical features and examination of unrepaired adults emphasize upper–lower extremity blood pressure differences, pulse delays, and characteristic murmurs. Hypertension is described in the right arm relative to the legs unless there is an anomalous right subclavian artery, and a pulse delay between the right arm and femoral or popliteal arteries may be present. Murmurs or bruits can be heard in the left interscapular area or over parasternal regions due to collaterals, and auscultation should assess for findings suggesting bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, or aortic regurgitation (AR).

Initial assessment of chest pain — terminology, examination, and chest X-ray guidance include using the terms "cardiac, possible cardiac, and noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause; clinical assessment "should include the chest pain description and associated symptoms, onset, duration, location, radiation, and precipitating and relieving factors"; there are "no physical examination findings specific for coronary ischemia", so the exam "should be targeted to identify findings associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in ACS, or to the presence of potential alternative diagnoses", with high-risk findings including "signs of low cardiac output… heart failure… and a new systolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect"; as part of the initial assessment, "a chest X-ray should be performed in almost all patients with possible ACS", given its potential to identify high-risk and noncardiac causes, and "performance of a chest X-ray should not delay emergent interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention for those with a definitive STEMI".

### Clinical relevance of musical murmurs in color-coded carotid and transcranial duplex sonographies [^111k9rnR]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Musical murmurs (MMs), sometimes called seagull cry, goose cry, honks, or cooing murmur, are murmurs with a single frequency that sounds like a musical tone. Doppler detections usually show mirror-image parallel strings or bands of low to moderate frequency. Musical murmurs are mostly described in cardiac murmurs and have seldom been mentioned in cerebrovascular disease.

Methods

A retrospective review of 12,000 patients from our neurosonographic data base of the past 7 years was conducted to find patients who had MMs during color-coded carotid and transcranial duplex sonographies.

Results

Sixty-six musical murmurs were found in 60 patients (0.5% of all studied patients). There were 44 men and 16 women with a mean age of 63.8 years. Musical murmurs may occur with or without simultaneous turbulent flows, or very close to a high-intensity frequency (with systolic spindles) turbulent flow. Musical murmurs are detected more frequently in intracranial vessels (94%) than in extracranial cervical arteries. The pathologic changes corresponding to the area of MMs were high-grade stenosis of the arteries (58 MMs), small arteries serving as collateral circulation (5 MMs), carotid cavernous sinus fistulas (2 MMs), and Moyamoya disease (1 MM). Fifty (88%) of 57 patients with stenotic arterial lesions had histories of cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack, and 64% of the cerebrovascular events occurred on the side appropriate to the MMs.

Conclusions

The presence of MMs in color-coded carotid duplex and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography imply severe underlying vascular diseases that require prompt treatment. Further cerebral angiographic study is warranted to clarify the underlying pathology in patients with MMs.

### Assessing children's heart sounds at a distance with digital recordings [^116Mut6c]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess whether computer-stored digital sound recordings can be used to distinguish innocent from pathologic systolic murmurs.

Methods

Recordings of 55 children aged 1 month to 19 years were made remotely with the use of a digital stethoscope and were e-mailed to a computer in our center for later assessment. Eight-second recordings were made by a physician in 2 to 4 locations on the chest. Three cardiologists who were blinded to the diagnosis reviewed the recordings independently using stethophones to assess the splitting of the second heart sound and whether murmurs were innocent or pathologic. Diagnoses were confirmed with echocardiography.

Results

Seventeen children had innocent murmurs and 38 had pathologic murmurs. For the 3 cardiologists, sensitivity was 0.87 to 1.0, specificity was 0.82 to 0.88, negative predictive value was 0.75 to 1.0, and positive predictive value was 0.93 to 0.95. Assessment of splitting of second heart sound was highly accurate.

Conclusions

Digital recordings of children's heart sounds allow reliable differentiation between innocent and pathologic murmurs. Use of this technology may allow remote diagnosis of childhood murmurs and avoid the expense and stress of travel to pediatric cardiology centers for some children. Cardiologists who use recordings should assess their diagnostic accuracy before clinical application.

### Phono-spectrographic analysis of heart murmur in children [^111WR97T]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Typically, the screening method is allowed to include some false positive cases, but false negatives are unacceptable. In this study, ten (10) small muscular ventricular septal defects, three (3) cases of mild aortic stenosis, one (1) mild peripheral pulmonary stenosis, one (1) mitral valve prolapse with leakage and one tricuspid leakage fell below the 80% duration criterion. However, each of these cases exceeded the 200 Hz frequency limit. Three (3) atrial septal defects and one (1) slight pulmonary valve stenosis included frequencies below 200 Hz, but each of them was sustained for over 80% of the systolic duration. Five (5) of the pathological murmurs were not caught with either of these two criteria. One (1) of them was a clinically insignificant tricuspid valve leakage, one (1) a very mild mitral valve leakage, one (1) a bicuspic aortic valve without stenosis and one (1) a bicuspic aortic valve with slight stenosis (pressure gradient 16 mmHg). The last and the worst missed pathological murmur was recorded from a three-year-old boy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickness of ventricular septum 12 mm). Seven out of 75 innocent murmurs exceeded one of the defined screening criteria. None of the ejection murmurs exceeded the 80% duration limit, and 3 cases exceeded the frequency limit. All of these cases were aortic ejection murmurs with aortic velocity of 1.5–1.8 m/s. Of the vibratory murmurs, one (1) continued for over 80% of the systolic duration, three (3) contained frequency components of over 200 Hz, but none of them exceeded both limits.
