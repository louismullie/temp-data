## Question

renal artery stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about renal artery stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will review clinical presentation and when to suspect RAS. After that, I need to check the diagnostic algorithm and hemodynamic thresholds. Then, I will examine medical therapy and its nuances. Next, I should review revascularization indications by etiology and guideline alignment. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and synthesize a practical decision framework, making sure each step is supported by current guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing of one or both renal arteries that can restrict renal blood flow enough to activate the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, producing secondary hypertension and, when severe or bilateral, ischemic nephropathy and cardio-renal syndromes such as flash pulmonary edema, so I need to ensure I anchor on RAAS activation and downstream effects when interpreting symptoms and labs.

> I should confirm the epidemiology and risk profile before jumping to testing. Atherosclerotic RAS is common in older adults with cardiovascular disease, with imaging prevalence up to 14–40% in some hypertensive cohorts, but only a small fraction (about 0.1–5%) is hemodynamically significant enough to cause renovascular hypertension; FMD is less prevalent overall but predominates in younger women and can be missed if I assume atherosclerosis in all older patients, so I need to keep both etiologies in mind during triage [^111roWzE] [^115xsHGK] [^115poDRj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms. I should review the clinical clues that raise suspicion. Onset of hypertension before age 30 or severe hypertension after 55, accelerated or resistant hypertension, unexplained renal asymmetry or atrophy, sudden flash pulmonary edema, and new or worsening azotemia after starting ACE inhibitors or ARBs are classic triggers to evaluate for RAS; an abdominal bruit may be present but is neither sensitive nor specific, so I should weigh the constellation rather than any single sign [^115akfnS] [^115SsmBi] [^115FVuVt].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic algorithm and make sure I'm aligned with guidelines. Duplex renal artery ultrasound is first-line because it is noninvasive and functional, though operator dependence and body habitus can limit accuracy; CTA or MRA are preferred for anatomic delineation and treatment planning when noninvasive imaging is inconclusive or revascularization is contemplated; catheter angiography remains the anatomic reference but should be reserved for cases where hemodynamic assessment or intervention is planned, and I should double-check that I'm not overcalling moderate lesions without gradients [^113tUjmN] [^113owcU9] [^116XJPx5].

> Wait, let me verify hemodynamic thresholds because angiographic severity alone is misleading. For atherosclerotic lesions, a stenosis of 70–99% is generally considered hemodynamically significant, while 50–69% lesions require objective confirmation of significance by a systolic gradient greater than 20 mmHg or a distal-to-proximal pressure ratio less than 0.9; I should confirm gradients invasively when the clinical stakes are high and the noninvasive data are equivocal, to avoid unnecessary stenting of non–flow-limiting disease [^1147DVZn] [^111DWXfK] [^115ZvBtg].

> I will now examine medical therapy, since that is the foundation for virtually all patients with atherosclerotic RAS. I need to ensure blood pressure targets follow contemporary guidance: for most adults, aim for less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, with adjustments by age and comorbidity; ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line even in unilateral RAS, and can be used cautiously in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney with close monitoring of creatinine and potassium; add statins, antiplatelet therapy, smoking cessation, and diabetes control as part of guideline-directed medical therapy, and I should double-check that I'm not withholding RAAS blockade out of undue fear in unilateral disease [^114ZXQyV] [^114A5rvY] [^111qvRAE] [^111AgBiw].

> But wait, what if the patient has resistant hypertension or progressive renal dysfunction despite optimal medical therapy? I should review when revascularization is reasonable. In atherosclerotic RAS, indications include resistant hypertension on at least three drugs including a diuretic, recurrent flash pulmonary edema or acute heart failure despite maximal therapy, rapidly worsening kidney function suggesting ischemic nephropathy, bilateral severe stenosis or stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney with high-risk features, and hemodynamic severity confirmed as above; I need to ensure I document failure of medical therapy and the presence of high-risk features before proceeding [^1147DVZn] [^11723rCL] [^114V7VJq] [^117K5vvi].

> Let me consider FMD separately because the calculus changes. For FMD-related RAS, balloon angioplasty without routine stenting is preferred and often curative for hypertension. I should confirm that stenting is reserved for dissection or failed angioplasty, and remember that FMD can occur in older adults too, so I shouldn't dismiss it solely based on age. Guidelines also support considering revascularization in symptomatic FMD with organ ischemia or resistant hypertension [^111Gbwrk] [^116YB4nv] [^115UEmZp] [^115poDRj].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence for stenting in atherosclerotic RAS so I don't overstate benefits. Large randomized trials like ASTRAL and CORAL did not show superiority of stenting over aggressive medical therapy in unselected patients, likely due to inclusion of many with moderate disease and exclusion of the highest-risk phenotypes; nonetheless, subgroup analyses and comparative effectiveness reviews suggest potential benefit in severe, hemodynamically significant lesions with resistant hypertension, ischemic nephropathy, or flash pulmonary edema, so patient selection is paramount [^111DWXfK] [^1164HnPF] [^111roWzE].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases so I don't miss nuanced scenarios. In dialysis patients with intradialytic hypertension, bilateral RAS or mixed atherosclerotic/FMD disease may contribute via RAAS activation. Evaluating and treating RAS in this setting can improve blood pressure control and reduce pill burden, though evidence is largely case-based and requires careful selection. In young patients with severe or malignant hypertension, I need to maintain a high index for FMD and proceed with appropriate angioplasty when indicated [^1144fEux] [^1161urkb] [^111Gbwrk].

> I need to ensure the follow-up plan is explicit and evidence-based. After any intervention, continuation of RAAS blockade, statin, and antiplatelet therapy is essential. Surveillance for restenosis with duplex ultrasound at 6–12 months and annually thereafter is reasonable, recognizing in-stent restenosis rates of roughly 10–25% and the need to reassess symptoms, blood pressure, and renal function at each visit. If restenosis is hemodynamically significant, repeat endovascular therapy may be warranted [^111AgBiw] [^113M1k95] [^115xsHGK].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic-performance caveat so I don't overpromise on imaging. Duplex ultrasound, while excellent in experienced hands, can miss accessory renal arteries and overestimate severity in some settings; CTA and MRA improve anatomic sensitivity but may require contrast and have their own limitations; when the clinical picture and noninvasive tests diverge, invasive angiography with pressure gradients resolves uncertainty and guides therapy, which I should document clearly in the chart [^112AXS77] [^116XJPx5] [^115ZvBtg].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with aggressive risk factor modification and guideline-directed medical therapy for all with atherosclerotic RAS. Reserve diagnostic imaging for those with high clinical suspicion. Confirm hemodynamic significance before considering stenting. Refer for revascularization only when high-risk features are present and medical therapy has failed or when FMD is the etiology with symptomatic disease. This approach minimizes unnecessary procedures while capturing the subset most likely to benefit, which aligns with contemporary ESC, ESVS, and AHA/ACC guidance [^1147DVZn] [^114V7VJq] [^117K5vvi].

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is most often due to **atherosclerosis** [^111AgBiw] and can cause secondary hypertension, renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular complications [^115xsHGK]. Diagnosis relies on **duplex ultrasound** as first-line imaging [^113tUjmN], with CTA/MRA or invasive angiography for confirmation [^113QoQAK]. Medical therapy is first-line [^115oSZNK] — especially **ACE inhibitors/ARBs** with close monitoring [^111qvRAE] — and revascularization is reserved for resistant hypertension, progressive renal dysfunction, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema despite optimal therapy [^11723rCL]. Prognosis depends on severity, comorbidities, and response to therapy; early detection and risk-factor control improve outcomes [^115xsHGK].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

RAS has two main etiologies: **atherosclerotic RAS** accounts for ~90% of cases, typically in older adults with cardiovascular risk factors [^111roWzE]; **fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD)** accounts for ~10%, more often in younger women [^115xsHGK]. Pathophysiologically, reduced renal perfusion activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), causing hypertension, sodium retention, and renal ischemia [^115xsHGK].

---

## Clinical presentation

RAS is often silent; when symptomatic, it presents with:

- **Hypertension**: Secondary, resistant, or malignant [^111AgBiw].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Progressive CKD or acute kidney injury [^115xsHGK].
- **Cardiovascular syndromes**: Flash pulmonary edema, recurrent heart failure, or unstable angina [^11723rCL].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Non-invasive imaging

- **Duplex ultrasound**: First-line; high sensitivity/specificity in experienced hands [^113tUjmN] [^113owcU9].
- **CTA/MRA**: High accuracy; preferred when ultrasound is inconclusive or for treatment planning [^116XJPx5].
- **ACE inhibitor renography**: Functional test for renovascular hypertension [^1171Y3ez].

---

### Invasive imaging

Invasive imaging includes **catheter angiography**, the gold standard for anatomical definition and hemodynamic assessment [^111frmTH] [^115BCgwQ], and **intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)**, which refines lesion assessment and guides intervention [^111Sp8Qe].

---

## Indications for intervention

Intervention is considered when medical therapy fails or specific high-risk features are present:

| **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Resistant hypertension | Uncontrolled despite ≥ 3 antihypertensives, including a diuretic [^115SsmBi] |
| Progressive renal dysfunction | Declining eGFR or rising creatinine despite optimal therapy [^1156Xfgv] |
| Flash pulmonary edema | Recurrent, sudden pulmonary edema without cardiac cause [^113rLun3] |
| Hemodynamically significant stenosis | ≥ 70% or 50–69% with significant gradient [^11723rCL] |

---

## Treatment strategies

### Medical management

Medical management emphasizes **antihypertensive therapy** — ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^114A5rvY] [^111qvRAE] — plus **risk-factor modification** with statins, antiplatelet therapy, smoking cessation, and glycemic control [^111AgBiw].

---

### Revascularization

- **Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stenting**: Preferred for atherosclerotic RAS; high technical success and patency [^115Jhpof].
- **Balloon angioplasty alone**: Preferred for FMD; stenting reserved for complications [^115UEmZp].
- **Surgical revascularization**: Reserved for failed or unsuitable endovascular cases [^1113ZPcv].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis varies with severity, comorbidities, and treatment response. Medical therapy controls blood pressure in most patients, though **resistant hypertension** persists in some [^117K5vvi]. Revascularization improves blood pressure, renal function, and quality of life in selected patients, with **restenosis occurring in 10–25%** [^115xsHGK] [^112pnLNi]. Cardiovascular risk remains elevated due to systemic atherosclerosis, necessitating **aggressive risk-factor management** [^114hLyxU].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to track **blood pressure**, **renal function**, and **medication adherence**. Imaging surveillance with duplex ultrasound or CTA is recommended after intervention to detect restenosis or progression [^111Sp8Qe].

---

Renal artery stenosis is a significant cause of **secondary hypertension** and renal dysfunction. Medical therapy is first-line, with **revascularization** for resistant cases or high-risk features. Early detection, **accurate diagnosis**, and individualized management are key to improving outcomes.

### Managing acute presentations of atheromatous renal artery stenosis [^114SWFGc]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Acute presentations of atheromatous RAS are relatively uncommon but should be considered in patients presenting with severe hypertension, acute heart failure syndromes or with rapidly deteriorating renal function, especially AKI, particularly if there is evidence of widespread atheromatous disease. A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of RAS in these instances so that timely revascularization can be undertaken to restore or preserve renal function and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions for heart failure syndromes. These are situations in which targeted early renal revascularization has a genuine chance of improving survival.

Summary

What is known about this topic

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a prominent cause of secondary hypertension. Treatment is primarily with anti-hypertensive medications, with vascular intervention in the form of angioplasty and/or stenting reserved for refractory cases.
The role of renal artery stenting is uncertain as two large randomised controlled trials failed to identify significant cardiovascular or renal benefits in heterogeneous populations undergoing renal artery stenting.
These trials, however, were designed to study a well-defined population in which high-risk patients who were most likely to benefit were excluded. Furthermore, they did not analyse outcomes based on the therapeutic aim of the procedure.

What this study adds

This study stratifies patients by the clinical indication for renal artery intervention; be it refractory hypertension, renal dysfunction, or an acute cardio-renal syndrome.

The results of this study demonstrate that renal artery stenting is effective in treating the indication for which it is performed, and by comparing the study cohort to exclusion criteria used in the largest randomized trial, shows that these findings extend to a group of patients excluded from major trials.

### Diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis [^1141u3Yn]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

A reduction in the diameter of the renal arteries can lead to hypertension, renal dysfunction and/or pulmonary edema. About 90% of patients with renal artery stenosis have atherosclerosis, and 10% have fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common condition that typically occurs in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease with coexistent vascular disease at nonrenal sites. Patients who undergo revascularization to treat hypertension associated with atherosclerotic stenosis need to continue medication with statins, antiplatelet agents and renin-angiotensin antagonists after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Two recent trials compared renal outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic stenosis who were treated with antihypertensive medication plus stenting with those in patients who were treated with medication alone. Available results favor a conservative approach (medication only) for most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. These results, however, concern patients with stable clinical conditions and, in many cases, only moderate renal artery lesions. Blood pressure outcome after angioplasty is more favorable in patients with fibromuscular renal artery disease, who usually do not have renal failure, than in those with atherosclerosis.

### Update on intervention versus medical therapy for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^115xmSne]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is known to be one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension, and early nonrandomized studies suggested that renal artery stenting (RASt) improved outcomes. The vascular community embraced this less invasive treatment alternative to surgery, and RASt increased in popularity during the late 1990s. However, recent randomized studies have failed to show a benefit regarding blood pressure or renal function when RASt was compared with best medical therapy, creating significant concerns about procedural efficacy. In the wake of these randomized trial results, hypertension and renal disease experts along with vascular interventional specialists now struggle with how to best manage atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. This review objectively analyzes the current literature and highlights each trial's design weaknesses and strengths. We have provided our recommendations for contemporary treatment guidelines based on our interpretation of the available empirical data.

### Successfully treated bilateral renal artery stenosis in a patient with coronary artery disease [^114LErcm]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and accounts for approximately 1–3% of all causes of hypertension. Over 90% of RASs are caused by atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic RAS is increasingly common in aging populations, particularly elderly people with diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, aortoiliac occlusive disease, coronary artery disease or hypertension. Three therapeutic options are currently available for patients with renovascular hypertension: medical antihypertensive therapy, surgical revascularisation and transluminal angioplasty including stent implantation. We present in this report a male patient with bilateral severe ostial stenosis and coronary artery disease, and who was successfully treated with renal stent implantation in one session.

### Atherosclerotic process, renovascular disease and outcomes from bench to bedside [^1151xMk9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has become an important cause of secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction in the aging population. Its presence increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality independent of other atherosclerotic risk factors. Therefore, novel renoprotective strategies are needed to decrease the impact of this disease.

Recent Findings

Although medical therapy can be effective in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and mild renal dysfunction, revascularization is desirable for patients with target-organ injury. Technical developments (such as drug-eluting or low-profile stents and distal protection devices) have increased the safety and effectiveness of renal revascularization, but in a significant proportion of patients renal function is not fully restored. Recent experimental evidence suggests that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is associated with the activation of intrarenal fibrogenic and inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and microvascular remodeling, and blocking these mechanisms can improve renal hemodynamics and function.

Summary

Despite significant advances in revascularization techniques, it remains unclear why the kidney affected by atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis often does not improve or even progressively deteriorates. In addition to the restoration of blood flow, targeted interventions to attenuate injurious intrarenal mechanisms should probably become part of a comprehensive management plan to preserve the ischemic kidney.

### Technical discussion of diagnostic angiography and intervention of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^111Sp8Qe]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenting remains an important adjuvant treatment for true-resistant hypertension, although recent disappointing randomized trials highlight the importance of careful patient selection. Safe and successful renal interventions begin with critical core knowledge regarding renal artery anatomy and understanding the often hostile nature of the parent vessel (pararenal aorta). Armed with fundamental knowledge about anatomy and renal ostial disease pathology, it becomes easier to understand the advantages of less traumatic access techniques and how low-profile contemporary flexible stents have enhanced outcomes. In addition to suggested techniques based on detailed understanding of the vessel architecture and pathology, we will review the current available US Food and Drug Administration-approved balloon-expandable on-label renal stents and discuss the role of intravascular ultrasound for definition of lesion severity, stent sizing, and stent apposition. The durability of renal stenting will also be discussed, as will the velocity criteria for duplex surveillance. Lastly, the current empirical data related to renal embolic protection is provided, along with insight into technical issues in this domain.

### Management of renal artery stenosis: the case for intervention, defending current guidelines, and screening (drive-by) renal angiography at the time of catheterization [^111h8fSa]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

There is little debate that an untreated significant obstruction of blood flow to the kidney, most often due to atherosclerosis, is potentially hazardous to the health of patients. The treatment of atherosclerotic renovascular disease has evolved over the past 20 years from open surgery with its inherent morbidity and risk of mortality to percutaneous endovascular treatment with stents. The current debate is on the question of which patients are offered any additional advantage by revascularization for renal artery stenosis over medications alone. The primary issue is patient selection, including the most appropriate screening strategies for renal artery stenosis, which must be balanced against the risk of procedure-related complications. The goal of this paper is to explore the most appropriate utilization of revascularization with renal stent placement.

### Renal artery stenosis: to intervene, or not to intervene, "that is the question" [^116hczKV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) due to atherosclerosis continues to be a major cause of secondary hypertension. It can also lead to renal dysfunction due to ischemic nephropathy. While major clinical trials have emphasized that medical management should be preferred over angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of renal artery stenosis, clinical scenarios continue to raise doubts about the optimal management strategy. Herein, we present two cases that were admitted with hypertensive emergency and renal function deterioration. Medical therapy failed to control the blood pressure and in one patient, renal failure progressed to a point where renal replacement therapy was required. Both patients underwent angioplasty (for > 90% stenosis) and stent insertion with successful resolution of stenosis by interventional radiology. Postoperatively, blood pressure gradually decreased with improvement in serum creatinine. Dialysis therapy was discontinued. At 4- and 8-month follow-up, both patients continue to do well with blood pressure readings in the 132–145/70–90 mmHg range. This article highlights the importance of percutaneous interventions in the management of atherosclerotic RAS and calls for heightened awareness and careful identification of candidates who would benefit from angioplasty and stent insertion.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: is a revascularization necessary or redundant? [^115ZvBtg]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In the screening diagnosis of RAS, Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) is of primary importance. The performance and interpretation of the result requires a great deal of experience, and the difficulties in the examination are encountered in overweight patients. It is worth remembering that DUS may overestimate the degree of stenosis in relation to the reference test, which is digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with pressure measurements. The latter one is performed especially in situations of inconclusive noninvasive findings or when revascularization is being considered. The significance of stenosis is confirmed by a systolic pressure gradient more than 20 mmHg or a ratio of pressure behind the lesion to pressure before the lesion of less than 0.9. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) also play an important role in the diagnosis.

The mere finding of RAS does not imply the need for treatment, especially endovascular one. The basis is the elimination of cardiovascular risk factors, treatment with a statin and acetylsalicylic acid in atherosclerotic cause. The occurrence of hypertension requires taking steps in accordance with the relevant guidelines, with ACEIs, or ARBs as first-line pharmacotherapy, because they improve the prognosis in this group of patients, including mortality reduction. The exception is when the stenosis is bilateral or involves a single kidney, in which case these medicines may lead to a significant reduction in glomerular filtration. Therapy with ACEi and ARBs in this subgroup of patients can be used exceptionally, but it should only be performed under strict monitoring. In addition, diuretics, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are effective.

### Renal artery stenosis… [^114hLyxU]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Renal artery stenosis is a narrowing of the arteries to one or both of the kidneys that can cause hypertension and, sometimes, reduced kidney function and size. It occurs more commonly in older people with atherosclerosis. Hypertension caused by RAS is called secondary hypertension. This means that, unlike essential or primary hypertension, secondary hypertension does have a specific cause. In some cases, diagnosing and treating RAS can result in decreasing or eliminating the need to take medication for hypertension.

The narrowing of the kidney arteries in RAS is usually due to atherosclerosis; more rarely it can be caused by abnormal growth of tissue within the wall of the artery. The latter condition, called fibromuscular dysplasia, is potentially curable and is more common in women and younger age groups but can also occur later in life. When atherosclerosis is the cause of RAS, it is especially important to be evaluated and treated for related diseases of the heart and brain, since they are also susceptible to narrowed arteries. Atherosclerosis in those organs can lead to heart attack or stroke. The November 5, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about an 82-year-old woman with hypertension and renal artery stenosis. Symptoms Most often, renal artery stenosis does not cause any specific symptoms. Rarely, a person may have symptoms related to high blood pressure such as fatigue, headache, or dizziness.

Diagnosis New onset of high blood pressure in someone younger than 35 or older than 55 Worsening control of previously well-controlled hypertension, or very high blood pressure, especially if it is affecting other organs in the body. Treatment Take medication to control blood pressure. This may require 3 or more different drugs. Don't smoke. Control diabetes if it is present. Control cholesterol, taking medications if necessary. Renal artery angioplasty and stenting are only done if blood pressure cannot be controlled with medications or if blood tests indicate a significant worsening of kidney function.

### Limitations of angiography for the assessment of renal artery stenosis and treatment implications [^116Kr5pG]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Renovascular hypertension due to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Percutaneous catheter-based renal artery revascularization has been increasingly utilized for the treatment of renal artery stenosis. Renal artery stenting has a high technical success rate, but the rate of improvement in hypertension is somewhat less than expected with this technique. Misinterpretation of angiographic images may play a role in these unfavorable clinical results. We present a case in which the diagnosis of severe renal artery stenosis was not apparent by angiography. Intravascular ultrasound and translesional pressure gradient measurements during arteriography can help to determine the precise severity of stenosis and may augment the clinical results of percutaneous renal artery stent placement.

### A case report of malignant hypertension in a young woman [^115PsJ97]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant hypertension is a condition characterized by severe hypertension and multi-organ ischemic complications. Albeit mortality and renal survival have improved with antihypertensive therapy, progression to end-stage renal disease remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The underlying cause of malignant hypertension, which can be primary or secondary hypertension, is often difficult to identify and this can substantially affect the treatment outcomes, as we report here.

Case Presentation

A 33-year-old woman presented with severe hypertension and acute renal failure. Initial evaluation demonstrated hyperreninemia with hyperaldosteronism and a possible renal artery stenosis at the contrast-enhanced CT scan. Although this data suggested the presence of a secondary form of hypertension, further exams excluded our first diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. Consequently, the patient did not undergo renal angiography (and the contrast media infusion associated with it), but she continued to be medically treated to achieve a tight blood pressure control. Our conservative approach was successful to induce renal function recovery over 2 years of follow-up.

Conclusion

This case highlights the difficulty in differentiating between primary and secondary forms of malignant hypertension, particularly when the patient presents with acute renal failure. Clinicians should consider renal artery ultrasound as a first level diagnostic technique, given that the presentation of primary malignant hypertension can often mimic a renal artery stenosis. Secondly, adequate control of blood pressure is essential for kidney function recovery, although this may require a long time.

### Therapy for renal artery stenosis: a call for change [^113jiHMw]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Impact

We present a brief case description of a patient who benefitted from stenting in ARAS and provide a comprehensive review of ARAS; its prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment. We review the evidence for and against stenting in ARAS as well as consensus guidelines for stenting. Our review is valuable as we argue that stenting in ARAS is underutilized and the randomized control data for stenting in those patients who may benefit most is lacking. Our review will provide an important perspective for clinicians faced with decisions of how to treat ARAS.

### Catheter-based therapy for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^115Jhpof]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) is more common than was previously thought, particularly in patients with known coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular atherosclerosis. Clinical subsets in which RAS is more common include patients with uncontrolled hypertension, renal insufficiency, and/or sudden onset ("flash") pulmonary edema. Renal artery atherosclerosis progresses over time and is associated with loss of renal function regardless of medical therapy. Patients with symptomatic (hypertension, renal insufficiency, or flash pulmonary edema) and hemodynamically significant RAS are potential candidates for revascularization. The current standard of care is stent placement for aorto-ostial atherosclerotic lesions. Procedure success rates are very high (≥ 95%), with infrequent major complication rates. Five-year primary patency rates are 80% to 85%, and secondary patency rates exceed 90%. The key element in managing patients with RAS is selecting those most likely to benefit, that is, those with blood pressure control, preservation or improvement of renal function, and control of flash pulmonary edema from renal revascularization. This article will highlight the anatomical features, physiologic parameters, and biomarkers that may be helpful in optimally selecting patients for renal artery revascularization.

### When and how should we revascularize patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis? [^111DWXfK]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the leading cause of secondary hypertension and may lead to resistant (refractory) hypertension, progressive decline in renal function, and cardiac destabilization syndromes (pulmonary edema, recurrent heart failure, or acute coronary syndromes) despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Although randomized controlled trials comparing medical therapy with medical therapy and renal artery stenting have failed to show a benefit for renal artery stenting, according to comparative effectiveness reviews by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the trials may not have enrolled patients with the most severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, who would be more likely to benefit from renal stenting. Because of limitations of conventional angiography, it is critical that the hemodynamic severity of moderately severe (50% to 70%) atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis lesions be confirmed on hemodynamic measurement. The authors review techniques to optimize patient selection, to minimize procedural complications, and to facilitate durable patency of renal stenting. The authors also review the current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions appropriate use criteria as they relate to renal stenting.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common cause of secondary hypertension (HTN) and may lead to resistant (refractory) HTN despite guideline directed medical therapy. Although randomized controlled trials comparing medical therapy to medical therapy and renal artery stenting have shown no benefit with renal artery stenting, according to comparative effectiveness reviews by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the trials did not enroll patients with the most severe RAS who would be more likely to benefit from renal stenting.

We review techniques to optimize patient selection, to minimize procedural complications, and to facilitate durable patency of renal stenting. We also review the current ACC/AHA Guidelines and SCAI Appropriate Use Criteria as they relate to renal stenting.

### Renal artery stenosis and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: a case report and review of the literature [^112dkz52]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension. Elderly patients with atherosclerosis and young women with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are particularly at risk. Blood pressure screening is often key to this diagnosis, although the reliability of clinical screening has been questioned, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) likely offers superior ability to diagnose poorly controlled hypertension. In patients with RAS, medical management should be the primary means of therapy; however, in a select group of these patients, renal revascularization may be considered, and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and stabilize chronic kidney disease. In this report, we present a patient diagnosed with RAS due to FMD, found to have significant hypertension via ABPM, and treated successfully with percutaneous renal artery angioplasty; importantly, continuous 24-hr ambulatory monitoring after pressure gradient guided renal angioplasty confirmed reduction in blood pressure.

### Stenting for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^111MwwG3]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in the adult population. ARAS may result in progressive renal impairment, renovascular hypertension, and/or cardiac disturbance syndromes. Because medical therapy does not affect the progressive nature of this disease process, more aggressive treatments are needed to definitively treat ARAS. When performed correctly, renal artery stenting has been shown to stabilize or improve renal function and/or renovascular hypertension in 65–70% of carefully selected patients with ARAS. Therefore, percutaneous renal artery stenting should be considered the primary treatment for patients with symptomatic ARAS.

### Bilateral renal artery stenosis as a cause of refractory intradialytic hypertension in a patient with end stage renal disease [^1161urkb]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a 61-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) complicated by intradialytic hypertension (IDH). Increased sympathetic drive leading to increased stroke volume and/or vasoconstriction with an inappropriate increase in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) has been postulated to be the cause of IDH.

Case presentation

Attempts to control her blood pressure by reducing her goal weight; increasing dialysis times/ frequency and decreasing her sodium concentrate in the dialysis fluid were unsuccessful. Acting upon literature evidence suggesting renovascular disease as a cause of IDH, we referred her to an interventional radiologist for evaluation of the renal arteries. Selective angiogram of both renal arteries revealed right sided atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) treated with insertion of a balloon mounted 6 mm stent and left sided fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) treated with 5 mm balloon angioplasty.

Conclusions

This case highlights the need for interrogating the renal arteries radiologically for a potential cause in difficult to control IDH and comments on the association between PKD and FMD that has not yet been reported.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis — epidemiology and treatment effects: Renal artery stenosis refers to a narrowing of the renal artery that can result in a hemodynamically significant restriction of blood flow, usually by > 75%. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease, of which fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common, is much less prevalent and tends to occur in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension; however, only a small fraction (0.1%-5%) is considered to be hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Several trials designed to compare the efficacy of these procedures with medical therapy suggested no benefit over aggressive medical therapy alone among adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Nonetheless, there may be benefit in certain subgroups of individuals with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who were not represented in the trials, including those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema. The absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

Renovascular hypertension is a common cause of pediatric hypertension. In the fraction of cases that are unrelated to syndromes such as neurofibromatosis, patients with a solitary stenosis on a branch of the renal artery are common and can be diagnostically challenging. Imaging techniques that perform well in the diagnosis of main renal artery stenosis may fall short when it comes to branch artery stenosis. We report 2 cases that illustrate these difficulties and show that a branch artery stenosis may be overlooked even by the gold standard method, renal angiography.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: current status and future directions [^113JheFh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common, progressive problem that increases in prevalence with age. It can have important clinical consequences such as hypertension, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. In addition, it is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. The purpose of this review is to describe the current status of knowledge and future directions for this evolving field.

Recent Findings

In patients who are suspected of having the disease, duplex Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography remain the most promising noninvasive screening tests. Percutaneous revascularization continues to advance, and technical success is possible in the vast majority of patients. Revascularization for hypertension is of modest clinical benefit. Limited information is available on the effect of revascularization on preservation of renal function or cardiovascular events and mortality.

Summary

Further studies are still needed focusing on the identification of which patients will derive benefit from percutaneous revascularization and whether intervention provides an advantage over medical therapy, particularly with respect to preservation of renal function and reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Bilateral renal artery stenosis as a cause of refractory intradialytic hypertension in a patient with end stage renal disease [^1144fEux]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms of hypertension in FMD appear to overlap with the proposed pathogenic mechanisms for IDH. FMD is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vascular disease that may result in arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, or dissection. Reduction in arterial lumen and the subsequent reduction in perfusion pressure by a unifocally or multifocally stenosed artery leads to activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, with volume expansion and hypertension. We hypothesize that ultrafiltration worsens the gradient of renal artery stenosis leading to additional upregulation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and subsequent further upsurge in blood pressure. This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of concurrent FMD in an individual with ESRD from ADPKD. Studies of renal angiograms in potential renal donors revealed a prevalence of asymptomatic FMD at close to 4% with an average age of 50 years. No studies have yet been done to study the prevalence of FMD in the dialysis population. We hope that our case report encourages care givers to consider investigating for renovascular disease in patients with refractory IDH.

Bilateral renal angioplasty in our patient led to impressive reductions in blood pressure and allowed a decrease of 2 drugs. Our case illustrates that in patients with ESRD and difficult to treat IDH, there is value in imaging the renal arteries to evaluate for renal artery stenosis.

Renal artery stenosis is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and predominantly caused by atherosclerosis. In suspected patients, a non-invasive diagnosis with ultrasound is preferred. Asymptomatic, incidentally found RAS does not require revascularization. In symptomatic patients requiring revascularization, renal artery stenting is the preferred therapy. Selecting appropriate patients for revascularization requires careful consideration of lesion severity and is optimized with a multidisciplinary team. All patients with atherosclerotic RAS should be treated with guideline-directed medical therapy, including hypertension control, diabetes control, statins, antiplatelet therapy, smoking cessation and encouraging activity.

### Diagnosis and management of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: improving patient selection and outcomes [^112v5rLA]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is common among patients with atherosclerosis, and is found in 20–30% of individuals who undergo diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Renal artery duplex ultrasonography is the diagnostic procedure of choice for screening outpatients for RAS. Percutaneous renal artery stent placement is the preferred method of revascularization for hemodynamically significant RAS, and is favored over balloon angioplasty alone. Stent placement carries a class I recommendation for atherosclerotic RAS according to ACC and AHA guidelines. Discordance exists between the very high (> 95%) procedural success rate and the moderate (60–70%) clinical response rate after renal stent placement, which is likely to be a result of poor selection of patients, inadequate angiographic assessment of lesion severity, and the presence of renal parencyhmal disease. Physiologic lesion assessment using translesional pressure gradients, and measurements of biomarkers (e.g. brain natriuretic peptide), or both, could enhance the selection of patients and improve clinical response rates. Long-term patency rates for renal stenting are excellent, with 5-year secondary patency rates greater than 90%. This Review will outline the clinical problem of atherosclerotic RAS and its diagnosis, and will critically assess treatment options and strategies to improve patients' outcomes.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common disorder in adults with atherosclerosis and is associated with hypertension, impaired renal function, congestive heart failure, and angina pectoris. The incidence of RAS is increasing because of the aging of the US population and increasing prevalence of atherosclerosis. The case of Mrs S, an 82-year-old woman with long-standing hypertension and unilateral RAS detected by magnetic resonance angiography, illustrates the challenges surrounding indications for revascularization. The discussion reviews the clinical presentation and natural history of RAS and strategies for diagnosis. The role of medical therapy, surgery, and endovascular therapy are reviewed, particularly in the context of guidelines and systematic reviews to help clinicians and patients facing this challenging decision.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a potentially curable cause of renovascular hypertension (RVH) and is caused by either atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia in the vast majority of patients. Although intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography is still considered the standard of reference test for the anatomic diagnosis of RAS, MR angiography and functional renal MR imaging are promising alternatives that also allow for functional characterization of RAS. This article provides an overview of these techniques and discusses their relative merits and shortcomings. Because missing RVH may have serious consequences the most important requirement for an alternative test is that it has high sensitivity. An unresolved issue is the prediction of functional recovery after therapy.

### Total renal artery occlusion: recovery of function after revascularization [^112pnLNi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Current trends in managing atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis favor medical therapy, on account of negative results from prospective trials of revascularization, such as CORAL and ASTRAL. One result of this trend has been encountering occasional patients with progressive disease, sometimes leading to total arterial occlusion. We illustrate a case of accelerated hypertension with complete renal artery occlusion in which the patient recovered function after surgical bypass and we review the clinical approach used and the advanced imaging modalities available to us. A high index of suspicion and careful radiologic imaging play important roles in selecting patients who may have residual function and may benefit from revascularization. This case illustrates an example whereby restoring renal artery perfusion for carefully selected patients can be life changing, with recovery of kidney function and improved blood pressure, pill burden, and overall quality of life.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^115BCgwQ]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal artery disease

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension in adults, however in younger women fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. Luminal obstruction and hypoperfusion of the kidney activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and leads to systemic hypertension. All patients with significant atherosclerotic RAS should be managed with blood pressure control, statin and antiplatelet therapy. Patients with bilateral RAS can still safely be treated with ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers, provided that they have close follow-up of renal function.

Three major RCTs (STAR (Stent placement and blood pressure and lipid-lowering for the prevention of progression of renal dysfunction caused by atherosclerotic ostial stenosis of the renal artery), ASTRAL (angioplasty and stenting for renal artery lesions) and CORAL (cardiovascular outcomes in renal atherosclerotic lesions) have not found benefit for revascularisation over medical therapy, although these trials have been criticised for flaws in trial design and inclusion of some patients with only moderate disease. Still, due to lack of supporting evidence, renal revascularisation should be reserved for selected patients with FMD, recurrent congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension despite adequate medical therapy (at least three antihypertensive agents including a diuretic agent) or progressive renal failure with renal ischaemia. Because of the associated morbidity and mortality of open surgery, endovascular treatment is the preferred technique for patients who need revascularisation. If a lesion is not obviously severe at the time angiography, confirmation of haemodynamic significance can be performed with measuring translesional systolic pressure gradient or renal fractional flow reserve. Before planned revascularisation, renal resistive index obtained by ultrasound can provide additional information on viability of the kidney and predicted response to revascularisation.

### Renal artery stenosis: a cardiovascular perspective [^111frmTH]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is an important clinical entity that can lead to uncontrolled hypertension and progressive renal failure. The most common causes of RAS are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia. Because the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension is established only when revascularization of a stenosed renal artery results in cure or improvement in patients hypertension, establishment of a causal relationship between RAS and hypertension continues to present a challenge. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is essential in the diagnosis of this condition.

Methods

Multiple tests, both invasive and noninvasive, are available as screening methods. Angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis of RAS. Besides its value in establishing the diagnosis, it provides anatomic information regarding the site and severity of stenoses and appropriate revascularization strategies. Magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasonography are the most promising and accurate noninvasive screening tests available, even in the presence of renal insufficiency. With advances in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty techniques, including renal artery stenting, many more patients are eligible for less invasive and effective revascularization strategies compared with the traditional surgical procedures.

Results

Revascularization of a stenosed renal artery is associated with preservation of renal function and better control of hypertension, unstable angina, and congestive heart failure. Because atherosclerotic RAS is associated with generalized atherosclerosis, aggressive risk factor modification and antiplatelet therapy are integral in the management of RAS regardless of the revascularization strategy.

### A review of the current treatment of renal artery stenosis [^112rYdZx]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is associated with morbidity and mortality consequent to progressive ischemic renal failure and the cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. There is considerable uncertainty concerning the optimal management of patients with this condition. This review considers the aetiological factors and the physiologic consequences of ARAS and compares the results of clinical studies of medical and endovascular therapies on blood pressure control and preservation of renal function.

Results

Although, in patients with fibromuscular disease the results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) are clearly superior to medical therapy and surgery, in asymptomatic patients with ARAS the antihypertensive benefits and preservation of renal function of endovascular, surgical and medical therapies appear similar. In selected symptomatic patients interventions may, however, be life-saving. Surgery is generally reserved for arterial occlusions with preserved renal parenchyma and function.

Conclusions

The results of larger, multicentre, randomised, controlled trials are required to clearly clarify the role of interventional therapy in asymptomatic patients.

### Bilateral renal artery stenosis as a cause of refractory intradialytic hypertension in a patient with end stage renal disease [^112JPfop]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension on renal replacement therapy (RRT) is best managed by optimizing goal weight, tight fluid control, salt restriction, increased dialysis times/frequency, decreasing sodium in the dialysate and transitioning to home hemodialysis. While ultrafiltration on hemodialysis typically lowers blood pressure, some patients have a paradoxical rise in blood pressure called intradialytic hypertension (IDH).

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: current therapy and future developments [^112eUTdH]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis affects between 2 and 4 million people in the United States alone and likely has a higher prevalence than previously thought. Renal artery stenosis has been increasingly recognized in recent years, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease. It has been associated with hypertension, renal dysfunction, and sudden onset of pulmonary edema. Patients with symptomatic and hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis are candidates for revascularization. Revascularization is most often accomplished by renal artery stenting, which has high success rates in terms of patency and low complication rates. An important element in managing patients with renal artery stenosis is selecting those patients who are most likely going to benefit from revascularization. This review article focuses on the clinical diagnosis, current treatment options, and future directions regarding treatment of patients with renal artery stenosis.

### Diagnostic criteria for renovascular disease: where are we now? [^115esLhs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease, especially atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) in older subjects, is commonly encountered in clinical practice. This is at least in part due to the major advances in non-invasive imaging techniques that allow greater diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy than ever before. Despite increased awareness of ARAS, renal revascularization is less commonly performed, likely as a result of several prospective, randomized, clinical trials which fail to demonstrate major benefits of renal revascularization beyond medical therapy alone. Primary care physicians are less likely to investigate renovascular disease and nephrologists likely see more patients after a period of unsuccessful medical therapy with more advanced ARAS. The goal of this review is to revisit current diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms in order to characterize more clearly which patients will likely benefit from further evaluation and intensive treatment of renal artery stenosis.

### Renal artery stenosis: optimizing diagnosis and treatment [^112Dx2Ma]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, with fibromuscular dysplasia being the most frequent among other less common etiologies. A high index of suspicion based on clinical features is essential for diagnosis. Revascularization strategies are currently a topic of discussion and debate. When revascularization is deemed appropriate, atherosclerotic RAS is most often treated with stent placement, whereas patients with fibromuscular dysplasia are usually treated with balloon angioplasty. Ongoing randomized trials should help to better define the optimal management of RAS.

### Treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis [^116V3erj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) has prompted in recent years a more aggressive treatment of this condition for reducing BP and for preserving the jeopardized renal function. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA), alone or in conjunction with stent implantation, may be useful for both these goals. However, despite the methodological improvements that make this procedure much safer than surgery, caution must be applied before PTRA is extended to all patients with ARAS. Indeed, PTRA is associated with a 23% rate of major/minor complications and with a 20% rate of restenosis, even in arteries implanted with stent. Moreover the cure rate of hypertension achievable with PTRA is, at best, around 10%, with a 40% rate of improvements. Even for rescuing the ischemic kidney, PTRA/stent implantation are not always effective; only 35% of patients with ARAS have some improvement in renal function. These data indicate that there is an urgent need of rigorous criteria for selecting among the many patients with ARAS those who may actually benefit from the dilation procedure.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension: pragmatism, pitfalls, and perspectives [^115q2btt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For many years and even decades, a diagnostic work-up to look for a secondary form of hypertension, particularly of renovascular origin, has been a central tenet in medicine. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is considered the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. However, advances in understanding the complex pathophysiology of this condition and the recently documented futility of renal revascularization bring into question whether atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis truly causes "renovascular hypertension". From a clinical point of view, a clear distinction should be made between hypertension associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis do not have a form of hypertension that is remediable or improved by angioplasty; to expose them to the cost, inconvenience, and risk of a diagnostic work-up add up to little more than a wild goose chase. However, with very few exceptions, medical therapy with antihypertensives and statins remains the cornerstone for the management of patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension.

Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease — most commonly fibromuscular dysplasia — is less prevalent and occurs more often in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 14% to 40% of adults with hypertension, but only a small fraction (0.1%-5%) is hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Trials comparing endovascular procedures with medical therapy showed no benefit over aggressive medical therapy alone in adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, although there may be benefit in subgroups such as those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema. The absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

### Revascularization for renovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115xsHGK]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on renal artery stenosis:

- **Definition**: Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or both renal arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common causes of renal artery stenosis are atherosclerosis and FMD, accounting for approximately 90% and 10% of renal artery stenosis cases, respectively. Renal artery stenosis decreases renal perfusion, triggering the RAAS, which leads to renovascular hypertension and may cause ischemic nephropathy, resulting in progressive renal dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in the general population is estimated at 5–10%, and as high as 25% in elderly patients with hypertension.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for renal atherosclerosis include older age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, PAD, and a family history of CVD. Risk factors for FMD include female sex, tobacco use, and a family history of FMD.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, renal artery stenosis can present with refractory hypertension, impaired renal function, pulmonary edema, and congestive HF. Physical examination may reveal an abdominal bruit.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of renal artery stenosis can be severe if left untreated, potentially leading to CKD or ESRD. Patients undergoing revascularization for hypertension related to atherosclerotic stenosis should continue pharmacotherapy after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events. Restenosis occurs in 10–25% of cases.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: is a revascularization necessary or redundant? [^113rLun3]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) refers to the presence of a lesion that narrows the vessel lumen by at least 60%, the hemodynamic significance of which can be further confirmed by determining the pressure gradient with endovascular methods. It can occur in up to 5–10% of the general population, and its main cause is the presence of atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, the prevalence of the disease increases with age and correlates with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, male sex, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or a family history. In 20%, it occurs bilaterally or involves the single functioning kidney. Rarer causes include fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a history of or active vasculitis including the presence of Takayasu arteritis (type 3, 4 or 5 disease). FMD occurs in a younger population, is nine times more common in women and is more common in people without cardiovascular risk factors, except for smoking, which contributes to its occurrence. It develops in less than 1% of the general population and is usually diagnosed in the fifth decade of life, often incidentally during diagnostic imaging performed for other clinical indications, but cases diagnosed in childhood have also been described. The pathogenesis of FMD is not fully understood. There are suggestions that it is related to the presence of genetic and environmental factors, smoking and estrogens. In 10%, the disease occurs in a family member. FMD takes the form of narrowing or widening (ectasias, aneurysms) of medium-sized arteries, and the sudden dissection of the vessel at the site of the primary lesion may occur. The condition most often affects the arteries of the central nervous system and renal arteries, less often other locations in the abdomen and vessels of the extremities. RAS, regardless of the cause, can lead to a number of adverse consequences. Reducing the flow behind the stenosis results in increased secretion of renin in the affected kidney, which leads to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system and consequently the development of secondary hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. RAS is the most common form of renovascular hypertension and one of the most common (5–28%) of secondary hypertension in general. Progressive renal ischemia may contribute to the deterioration of its excretory function and lead to chronic kidney disease and, in advanced cases, to loss of function and atrophy of the organ. During RAS, there may also be recurrent pulmonary oedema with abrupt onset (flash pulmonary edema), and in those cases, exclusion of structural disease in the heart suggests the presence of RAS. Other conditions that raise suspicion of renal artery disease include onset of hypertension less than 30 years of age, rapid acceleration of previously well controlled blood pressure, onset of resistant hypertension, hypertensive crisis (acute heart failure, hypertensive encephalopathy), unexplained renal atrophy or disproportion in kidney size, unexplained kidney failure, worsening of kidney function after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB).

### Radiologic evaluation of suspected renovascular hypertension [^113QoQAK]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

More than 72 million Americans have hypertension, and the majority of these persons have essential hypertension. However, a significant subset has a secondary cause. The most common cause of secondary hypertension is renal vascular hypertension, of which renal artery stenosis is the leading pathology. Up to 5 percent of all occurrences of hypertension are caused by renal artery stenosis, equating to as many as 3.5 to 4 million occurrences in the United States. Detecting renal artery stenosis is particularly important for ensuring that this potentially curable form of hypertension is identified and treated properly. Duplex Doppler ultrasonography is a good screening test in many patients, but it has limitations in larger persons and can overlook small accessory arteries. For patients with normal renal function but a high clinical index of suspicion for renovascular disease, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomographic angiography are the most accurate imaging tests. For patients with diminished renal function, gadolinium-enhanced contrast magnetic resonance angiography is the best imaging test. However, caution is warranted because exposure to gadolinium contrast agents is associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with renal failure. The American College of Radiology has developed appropriateness criteria for imaging tests related to the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. This article is a summary of the recommendations, with the advantages and limitations of each test.

- resistant hypertension, hypertension of abrupt onset or worsening or increasingly difficult to control, flash pulmonary edema (atherosclerotic), early-onset hypertension, especially in women (fibromuscular hyperplasia)

- abdominal systolic-diastolic bruit, bruits over carotid (atherosclerotic or FMD) or femoral arteries.

### Bilateral renal artery stenosis in a young man [^115PkTXH]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 34-year-old patient with a short history of severe hypertension was admitted to our hospital. Considering the young age and the severity of hypertension, we investigated the most common causes of secondary hypertension. Exposure to a single dose of an ACE inhibitor resulted in a rapid decline of the renal function. Further MRIrevealed a tight stenosis of both renal arteries closely to the ostium. In young patients, the most common cause of bilateral renal artery stenosis might be expected to be fibromuscular dysplasia. After recovery of renal function, invasive angiography, however, confirmed severe atherosclerotic lesion of both renal arteries. Therefore, angioplasty of both renal arteries was performed as a staged procedure. Hence, renal function showed rapid improvement and the patient had to be treated with a combination of a low-dose calcium antagonist and valsartan and especially a high-intensity statin.

### Balloon angioplasty, with and without stenting, versus medical therapy for hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis [^116xEx6D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Balloon angioplasty with stenting is widely used for the treatment of hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis but the effectiveness of this procedure in treating hypertension, improving renal function and preventing adverse cardiovascular and renal events remains uncertain. This is an update, to include the results of recent, important large trials, of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of balloon angioplasty (with and without stenting) with medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. The following outcomes were compared: blood pressure control, renal function, frequency of cardiovascular and renal adverse events, presence or absence of restenosis of the renal artery, side effects of medical therapy, numbers and defined daily doses of antihypertensive drugs.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 4). Bibliographies were also reviewed and trial authors were contacted for more information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing balloon angioplasty with medical therapy in hypertensive patients with haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (greater than 50% reduction in luminal diameter) and with a minimum follow-up of six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently on trial design, participants, interventions and outcome measures. A formal meta-analysis was completed to assess the effect on blood pressure, renal function and cardiovascular and renal adverse events. Peto's odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous variables were calculated.

Main Results

Eight RCTs involving 2222 participants with renal artery stenosis were included in the review. The overall quality of evidence included in this review was moderate. Limited pooling of results was possible due to the variable presentation of some of the trial outcomes. Meta-analysis of the four studies reporting change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) found a small improvement in diastolic BP in the angioplasty group (MD -2.00 mmHg; 95% CI -3.72 to -0.27) whilst the meta-analysis of the five studies reporting change in systolic BP did not find any evidence of significant improvement (MD -1.07 mmHg; 95% CI -3.45 to 1.30). There was no significant effect on renal function as measured by serum creatinine (MD -7.99 µmol/L; 95% CI -22.6 to 6.62). Meta-analysis of the three studies that reported the mean number of antihypertensive drugs found a small decrease in antihypertensive drug requirements for the angioplasty group (MD -0.18; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03). Repeat angiography was only performed on a small number of participants in a single trial and it was therefore not possible to comment on restenosis of the renal artery following balloon angioplasty. Based on the results of the seven studies that reported cardiovascular and renal clinical outcomes there were no differences in cardiovascular (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11) or renal adverse events (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.38) between the angioplasty and medical treatment groups. A small number of procedural complications of balloon angioplasty were reported (haematoma at the site of catheter insertion (6.5%), femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (0.7%), renal artery or kidney perforation or dissection (2.5%) as well as peri-procedural deaths (0.4%)). No side effects of medical therapy were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The available data are insufficient to conclude that revascularisation in the form of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, is superior to medical therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with hypertension. However, balloon angioplasty results in a small improvement in diastolic blood pressure and a small reduction in antihypertensive drug requirements. Balloon angioplasty appears safe and results in similar numbers of cardiovascular and renal adverse events to medical therapy.

### Is duplex scanning the best screening test for renal artery stenosis? [^112AXS77]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Screening for renal artery stenosis is indicated in patients with suspected renovascular hypertension or ischemic nephropathy to identify those who could benefit from renal artery interventions. The critical requirements for a clinically useful screening test include safety, low cost, and a high sensitivity or low false-negative rate. Arteriography remains the "gold standard" for the anatomic diagnosis of renal artery disease, but it is unsuitable for screening because of its high cost and invasive nature. Although renal duplex scanning technically is difficult, experienced laboratories have been able to achieve sensitivities and specificities in the range of 93% to 98% for identification of stenoses in the main renal arteries. Renal duplex scanning also provides a method for assessing the renal parenchyma and predicting the clinical outcome of renal revascularization. The principal limitation of renal duplex scanning is failure to identify accessory renal arteries. The finding of one or more widely patent main renal arteries makes ischemic nephropathy unlikely, because this condition results from "total" renal ischemia. However, renovascular hypertension can be present with normal main renal arteries when there are isolated stenoses involving accessory renal arteries, so further testing may be indicated in selected hypertensive patients with normal main renal arteries by duplex scanning. Currently, duplex scanning in a qualified vascular laboratory arguably is the best screening test for renal artery stenosis. Other methods for assessing the renal arteries, particularly spiral computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography, are evolving rapidly and also may play a role in screening of selected patients.

### Renal artery stenosis: prevalence of, risk factors for, and management of in-stent stenosis [^113M1k95]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is common and is associated with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. More frequent use of percutaneous renal artery stent placement for the treatment of renal artery stenosis during the past 2 decades has increased the number of patients with implanted stents. In-stent stenosis is a serious problem, occurring more frequently than earlier reports suggest and potentially resulting in late complications. Currently, there are no guidelines covering the approach to restenosis after renal artery stent placement. This article reviews data on the prevalence of and risk factors for the development of in-stent stenosis and the clinical manifestations, evaluation, and treatment of in-stent stenosis and suggests a strategy for the management of patients after percutaneous renal artery stent placement.

### The impact of renal artery stenting on therapeutic aims [^112W7iyi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is an anatomical categorisation of several disease processes that result in reduced renal perfusion. The impact is two-fold: directly — through reduced renal perfusion resulting in reduced function and ultimately ischaemic atrophy; and indirectly — through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems leading to systemic hypertension, cardiovascular complications and ultimately, end-organ damage including glomerulosclerosis. The most common causes of RAS are atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Atherosclerotic RAS is not uncommon and may be present on imaging in up to 50% of patients with coronary artery disease. In contrast, the incidence of pathologically impaired renal perfusion leading to clinical conditions is much less clear with the clinical presentation influenced by speed of onset and the type/severity of organ dysfunction.

Given the variable presentation of symptomatic RAS, there may be several therapeutic aims of treating RAS either acutely (reducing blood pressure, improving renal function, treating acute cardio-renal syndromes) or in the longer term (preventing hypertensive end-organ damage and ischaemic renal atrophy). The current treatment of clinically relevant RAS consists primarily of medical optimisation with anti-hypertensive agents. Endovascular treatment may be undertaken with angioplasty alone (usually only in patients with FMD) or with stenting (RASt) in atherosclerotic disease, where ostial calcification makes recoil and restenosis more likely if angioplasty is performed in isolation. It is possible that amongst populations with a heavy atherosclerotic burden, a significant number of people could merit intervention, but the role of RASt is uncertain as two large randomised clinical trials (RCTs) failed to show a significant benefit to either renal or cardiovascular outcomes.

### Current issues in the diagnosis and management of patients with renal artery stenosis: a cardiologic perspective [^115ui1qB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis most often is caused by atherosclerosis. Although patients with renal artery stenosis can be managed conservatively, renal revascularization may be indicated, particularly in patients with refractory hypertension on a multidrug regimen and patients with declining renal function. Duplex ultrasonography of the renal arteries and magnetic resonance angiography are currently the most efficient noninvasive methods for the evaluation of renal artery stenosis. Selective digital subtraction renal arteriography remains the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis. In selected patients undergoing coronary studies and angiography immediately after the coronary procedure can be efficient. Atherosclerotic renal artery lesions, which commonly affect the renal artery ostium, can be treated safely and effectively with balloon-expandable stents. Successful angioplasty commonly results in improved control of hypertension, but an overall benefit on renal function and/or patient survival has not been shown. Generally the risk/benefit ratio of renal artery stenting seems favorable, but further randomized studies are needed for evidence-based decision making. All patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis should receive rigorous secondary prevention measures including platelet inhibitors, statins, and beta-blockers.

### Stent revascularization for the prevention of cardiovascular and renal events among patients with renal artery stenosis and systolic hypertension: rationale and design of the CORAL trial [^113RKnfy]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a problem with no consensus on diagnosis or therapy. The consequences of renal ischemia are neuroendocrine activation, hypertension, and renal insufficiency that can potentially result in acceleration of atherosclerosis, further renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and death. Whether revascularization improves clinical outcomes when compared with optimum medical therapy is unknown.

Methods

CORAL is a randomized clinical trial contrasting optimum medical therapy alone to stenting with optimum medical therapy on a composite cardiovascular and renal end point: cardiovascular or renal death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, stroke, doubling of serum creatinine, and need for renal replacement therapy. The secondary end points evaluate the effectiveness of revascularization in important subgroups of patients and with respect to all-cause mortality, kidney function, renal artery patency, microvascular renal function, and blood pressure control. We will also correlate stenosis severity with longitudinal renal function and determine the value of stenting from the perspectives of quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The primary entry criteria are (1) an atherosclerotic renal stenosis of ≥ 60% with a 20 mm Hg systolic pressure gradient or ≥ 80% with no gradient necessary and (2) systolic hypertension of ≥ 155 mm Hg on ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications. Randomization will occur in 1080 subjects. The study has 90% power to detect a 28% reduction in primary end point hazard rate.

Conclusions

CORAL represents a unique opportunity to determine the incremental value of stent revascularization, in addition to optimal medical therapy, for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

### Where now in the management of renal artery stenosis? Implications of the ASTRAL and CORAL trials [^111X9YJ4]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The neutral findings of Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Artery Lesions trials have shown that unselected revascularization does not improve outcomes in atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD). This review highlights recent translational, clinical and epidemiological studies and suggests directions for future research.

Recent Findings

Imaging studies show that the degree of renal artery stenosis is not the most important determinant of outcome and response to therapies in ARVD. Porcine models have established a better understanding of the microvascular and inflammatory changes that occur in ARVD. Biomarkers of inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction may be informative but do not yet help assess prognosis or response to treatment. Stem cell therapies show promise in animal models but have yet to translate into clinical practice. Analysis of patient subgroups with high-risk presentations of ARVD has provided new insights into treatment response and may guide future studies.

Summary

It is time to reframe thinking and research in ARVD. We need better ways to identify patients likely to benefit from revascularization and to improve response to treatment in these individuals. Many preclinical studies show promise, but these are often small scale and difficult to replicate. Future work should focus on establishing an international disease registry as a foundation for collaborative research.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: is a revascularization necessary or redundant? [^1156h7qu]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Revascularization consists of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with only balloon or with stent implantation; recently, an attractive option has been the use of a drug-coated balloon (DCB). Surgery is undertaken only in exceptional or refractory cases. The discussion on the effectiveness and benefits from invasive procedures has been going on for years. Currently, the authors of the guidelines do not recommend routine revascularization since there are no benefits of such management over conservative treatment have been demonstrated, apart from a slight reduction in the number of antihypertensive drugs used (2.96 vs. 3.18 drugs). Studies, including the randomized CORAL and ASTRAL trials, have not confirmed the benefit of revascularization in terms of renal function. However, it should be remembered that only patients with atherosclerotic cause of stenosis were included in these studies. Thus, European guidelines do not recommend routine revascularization for RAS (recommendation class III) and allow endovascular treatment in specific causes or clinical situations, such as stenosis due to FMD, renal artery disease with sudden pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure and in renal artery disease with acute renal failure with oliguria or anuria. In the case of FMD, it should be undertaken only in symptomatic patients with organ ischemia, and balloon angioplasty is the treatment of choice, with stent implantation only in case of arterial dissection or balloon angioplasty failure (class of recommendations IIa).

### Renal fibromuscular dysplasia in elderly persons [^115poDRj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a significant cause of secondary hypertension, the progression of which can lead to renal insufficiency, uncontrolled hypertension, and even end-stage renal disease. The 2 most common forms of RAS are atherosclerotic renovascular disease and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Atherosclerosis accounts for 90% of all cases of RAS and generally affects an elderly population. Conversely, FMD accounts for approximately 10% of all RAS cases and is described as affecting a younger population. Four cases of FMD in individuals older than 70 years are presented, in a period of 1 year at 1 facility. This case series calls into question the previously reported low prevalence of FMD in elderly persons. It is conceivable that renal artery investigation might be denied an elderly patient thought to have atherosclerotic disease. Because conventional angioplasty is considered the treatment of choice for patients with FMD because of the high response rate for uncontrolled hypertension, the prevalence of FMD in the elderly population should be reevaluated to detect and treat this population accordingly.

Renal artery stenosis — recommendations and classification: In adults with hypertension and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, medical therapy is recommended to reduce kidney and CVD morbidity and mortality (Class 1, Level A). In adults with hypertension and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis for whom medical management has failed (eg, resistant hypertension, worsening kidney function, and/or acute HF), it is reasonable to refer patients for revascularization by percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and/or stent placement (Class 2a, Level C-EO). In adults with hypertension and nonatherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, including fibromuscular dysplasia, it may be reasonable to refer patients for revascularization by percutaneous renal artery angioplasty (Class 2b, Level C-LD).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renal artery stenosis — pathophysiology and epidemiology are summarized as a narrowing of the renal artery that can result in a hemodynamically significant restriction of blood flow, usually by ≥ 75%. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease, of which fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common, is much less prevalent and tends to occur in younger, otherwise healthier patients with a predilection for women. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease may be present in 1% to 40% of adults with hypertension; however, only a small fraction (0.1%–5%) is considered to be hemodynamically significant to result in renovascular hypertension. Although randomized trials suggested no benefit of revascularization over aggressive medical therapy in unselected adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, there may be benefit in certain subgroups, including those with progressively worsening kidney function or sudden onset of pulmonary edema, and the absence of severe albuminuria is associated with better outcomes after endovascular renal artery stenosis interventions.

### Timing and selection for renal revascularization in an era of negative trials: what to do? [^1158bw8n]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Management of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has become more complex with advances in both medical therapy and endovascular procedures. Results from recent trials fail to demonstrate major benefits of endovascular stenting in addition to optimal medical therapy. The general applicability of these results to many patients is limited by short-term follow-up and selection biases in recruitment. Many patients at highest risk were excluded from these studies and some were included with trivial lesions. Identification of patients with hemodynamically significant lesions remains a challenge and has led to more stringent criteria for Doppler ultrasound, measurement of translesional gradients and quantitative angiography. Although many patients can now be managed with medical therapy, it should be recognized that long-term reduction in antihypertensive drug requirements and recovery of kidney function are limited to those undergoing renal revascularization. As with any major vascular lesion, follow-up for disease stability and/or progression is essential. The ambiguity of present trial data may lead some to overlook selected subgroups that would benefit from restoring renal blood supply through revascularization. Further studies to more precisely identify kidneys that can recover function and/or are beyond meaningful recovery are essential. Considering the comorbid risks for the atherosclerotic population, it will remain imperative for clinicians to consider the hazards, costs and benefits carefully for each patient to determine the role and timing for both medical therapy and revascularization.

The conventional non-invasive tests to diagnose renal artery stenosis in a general hypertensive population are not accurate enough for screening purposes. Magnetic resonance angiography might become the new gold standard, with the advantages of the absence of contrast toxicity, good accuracy, and information on flow characteristics. With regard to the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis, intervention is advised only when blood pressure cannot be controlled by at least three antihypertensive drugs. Patency after stenting is superior to angioplasty, although its clinical benefit has not been proved. As for renal function, evidence - although from uncontrolled studies - for the preservation of renal function by intervention is accumulating, especially in those patients with bilateral stenosis or stenosis in a single functioning kidney.

Renovascular hypertension — screening test goal and reference standard — The goal of a screening test for renovascular hypertension in adults is to detect those patients who have renal artery stenosis as the cause of hypertension and to predict curability or amelioration of hypertension after intervention, and clinical features should indicate which patients have moderate or high risk of renovascular hypertension. ACEI renography is designed to be a test for renovascular hypertension, not for renal artery stenosis, and the optimal reference test or "gold standard" in future studies should be the outcome — the response to successful revascularization — not angiographic evidence of renal artery stenosis.

Background

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is increasingly common in an aging population. Therapeutic options include medical treatment only or revascularization procedures.

Purpose

To compare the effects of medical treatment and revascularization on clinically important outcomes in adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE database (inception to 6 September 2005) and selected reference lists were searched for English-language articles.

Study Selection

The authors selected prospective studies of renal artery revascularization or medical treatment of patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis that reported mortality rates, kidney function, blood pressure, cardiovascular events, or adverse events at 6 months or later after study entry.

Data Extraction

A standardized protocol with predefined criteria was used to extract details on study design, interventions, outcomes, study quality, and applicability. The overall body of evidence was then graded as robust, acceptable, or weak.

Data Synthesis

No study directly compared aggressive medical therapy with angioplasty and stent placement. Two randomized trials compared angioplasty without stent and medical treatments. Eight other comparative studies and 46 cohort studies met criteria for analysis. Studies generally had poor methodologic quality and limited applicability to current practice. Overall, there was no robust evidence. Weak evidence suggested no large differences in mortality rates or cardiovascular events between medical and revascularization treatments. Acceptable evidence suggested similar kidney-related outcomes but better blood pressure outcomes with angioplasty, particularly in patients with bilateral disease. Improvements in kidney function and cure of hypertension were reported among some patients only in cohort studies of angioplasty. Available evidence did not adequately assess adverse events or baseline characteristics that could predict which intervention would result in better outcomes.

Limitations

The evidence from direct comparisons of interventions is sparse and inadequate to draw robust conclusions.

Conclusions

Available evidence does not clearly support one treatment approach over another for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.
