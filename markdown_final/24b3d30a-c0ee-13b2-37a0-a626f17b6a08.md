## Question

How long how many weeks or days does naltrexone need to be used for a patient? Who's trying drinking alcohol?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long naltrexone should be used for a patient who is trying to stop drinking alcohol, including what the evidence-based duration is, how to apply it to oral versus injectable formulations, and what to do if the patient is still drinking at initiation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled duration for oral naltrexone. Then, I should verify whether guidelines extend beyond labeling. Next, I will examine data for extended-release naltrexone and how long those trials ran. After that, I need to consider whether patients must be abstinent before starting and how that affects duration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized recommendation and note special situations like hospital initiation and liver disease considerations.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled duration for oral naltrexone. The FDA prescribing information indicates that the recommended dose is 50 mg once daily for 12 weeks, and the pivotal trials that demonstrated efficacy used this 12-week regimen, so the labeled course is 12 weeks for oral naltrexone [^fb3a8486] [^5f370461] [^31ca2f9e].

> Wait, let me verify whether 12 weeks is sufficient or if longer treatment improves outcomes. High-quality meta-analyses and contemporary guidelines support naltrexone as first-line for AUD and note clinically meaningful benefits, but many trials are 12 to 16 weeks, and some extended-release studies run 24 weeks, suggesting that while 12 weeks is the minimum evidence-based duration, longer treatment may yield additional benefit in some patients, particularly for maintaining gains and reducing heavy drinking days [^afb7f19d] [^9b492f97] [^8be5f48a].

> I will now examine extended-release naltrexone data to see how long those studies lasted. The pivotal randomized trial of injectable naltrexone was 24 weeks, with benefits emerging within the first month and persisting through 6 months, and a meta-analysis of extended-release trials similarly evaluated 2 to 6 month courses, reinforcing that 24 weeks is a reasonable evidence-based duration for the injectable formulation when used [^8be5f48a] [^91411630] [^6d187a5f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about requiring abstinence before starting. I initially thought most trials mandated a week of abstinence, but I should double-check. Some trials and labeling language discuss initiating after detoxification or with a lead-in abstinence period, yet others enrolled actively drinking participants and still showed benefit, particularly for reducing heavy drinking rather than enforcing abstinence, so abstinence is not universally required and should be individualized based on goals and safety [^8be5f48a] [^6d187a5f] [^e9daa9d1].

> Next, I should review how this translates into practice. For most patients starting oral naltrexone, a 12-week course at 50 mg daily is the evidence-based minimum, with reassessment at 12 weeks to decide on continuation. For patients using extended-release naltrexone, a 24-week course is reasonable, and many clinicians extend treatment beyond these minima if the patient is benefiting, given the chronic relapsing nature of AUD and the absence of withdrawal risk with naltrexone discontinuation [^fb3a8486] [^8be5f48a] [^fb3a8486].

> But wait, what if the patient is still drinking at initiation. I need to ensure we address safety and expectations. Naltrexone can be started without enforced abstinence, though patients should be counseled that effects may be more modest if actively drinking, and clinicians should confirm the patient is not opioid-dependent to avoid precipitated withdrawal. In such cases, a 12-week trial is still reasonable, with earlier reassessment of response and adherence [^6d187a5f] [^fb3a8486] [^7e8f1424].

> I should also consider special settings. Hospital-initiated naltrexone is feasible and can be continued outpatient, with emerging data showing acceptability and signals for reduced craving even when engagement is modest. In these cases, starting oral naltrexone at discharge with a 12-week plan and close follow-up is pragmatic, and extended-release naltrexone can be considered when adherence is a concern or access allows [^f3c3d934] [^6be12659] [^ec82f4af].

> Let me reconsider liver disease, because I need to ensure safety. Earlier caution was excessive. Current guidance indicates naltrexone is acceptable in compensated liver disease, including cirrhosis, with monitoring, so liver disease does not automatically preclude a 12-week or longer course if clinically indicated, though decompensated disease remains a contraindication [^2edf5dd4] [^a4a6b463].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is as follows: for a patient trying to stop or reduce drinking, start oral naltrexone 50 mg daily for 12 weeks as the minimum evidence-based course, reassess at 12 weeks, and if effective and tolerated, continue treatment for an additional 12 to 24 weeks or longer based on clinical judgment and patient preference. For extended-release naltrexone, plan for 24 weeks, with the option to continue if beneficial. Individualize initiation to whether the patient is abstinent or actively drinking, ensure opioid freedom to avoid precipitated withdrawal, and integrate psychosocial support to optimize outcomes [^fb3a8486] [^8be5f48a] [^afb7f19d] [^a24b9215].

The standard duration of naltrexone for alcohol use disorder is **12 weeks at 50 mg/day** [^fb3a8486] [^5f370461], based on FDA labeling and pivotal trials [^8b65dcce]. Many clinicians extend therapy to **3–6 months or longer** [^notfound] if effective and tolerated, as benefits persist with continued use [^91411630]. For patients with adherence issues, **extended-release injectable naltrexone** (380 mg every 4 weeks) for 24 weeks is supported [^8be5f48a] [^6d187a5f]. Treatment should be individualized, with reassessment at 12 weeks to decide on continuation [^a24b9215].

---

## Standard duration of naltrexone treatment

- **FDA-approved duration**: 12 weeks (84 days) at 50 mg/day for alcohol use disorder [^fb3a8486] [^5f370461].
- **Evidence base**: The 12-week duration is supported by randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses showing reduced heavy drinking and relapse [^afb7f19d] [^524b110e].
- **Clinical practice**: Many clinicians extend treatment to 3–6 months or longer if effective and tolerated, as benefits persist with continued use [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting treatment duration

| **Study** | **Duration** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| FDA pivotal trials | 12 weeks | Reduced heavy drinking and relapse vs placebo [^8b65dcce] |
| COMBINE study | 16 weeks | Naltrexone + medical management reduced heavy drinking and increased abstinent days [^9c05ebee] |
| Extended-release naltrexone trials | 24 weeks | Reduced heavy drinking days and sustained benefit over 6 months [^8be5f48a] [^91411630] |

---

## Factors influencing treatment duration

- **Patient response**: Continue if reducing heavy drinking and craving; reassess at 12 weeks [^notfound].
- **Adherence**: Poor adherence may warrant switching to extended-release naltrexone [^c35652f7].
- **Comorbidities**: Adjust duration for liver disease, psychiatric comorbidity, or concurrent medications [^1c149a88] [^2edf5dd4].
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making guides duration and formulation [^26c16b88].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **APA guidelines**: Consider naltrexone for moderate-to-severe AUD; individualize duration based on response and goals [^e796660b].
- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Offer naltrexone (oral or injectable) with psychosocial treatment; no fixed duration, tailor to patient needs [^26c16b88].
- **ASAM guidelines**: No recommended length; continue if effective and tolerated, stop if ineffective or adverse effects occur [^a24b9215].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 12 weeks (50 mg/day) [^fb3a8486].
- **Extended duration**: 3–6 months or longer if effective and tolerated [^notfound].
- **Injectable formulation**: 380 mg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks if adherence is a concern [^8be5f48a] [^6d187a5f].
- **Individualization**: Base duration on response, adherence, comorbidities, and patient preference [^26c16b88].

---

The typical naltrexone course for alcohol use disorder is **12 weeks at 50 mg/day** [^fb3a8486], with many patients benefiting from 3–6 months or longer [^notfound] if effective. Extended-release naltrexone is an option for adherence challenges [^c35652f7], and treatment should be individualized with reassessment at 12 weeks [^notfound].

Background

Although naltrexone, an opiate-receptor antagonist, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of alcohol dependence, its efficacy is uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of naltrexone as an adjunct to standardized psychosocial treatment. We randomly assigned 627 veterans (almost all men) with chronic, severe alcohol dependence to 12 months of naltrexone (50 mg once daily), 3 months of naltrexone followed by 9 months of placebo, or 12 months of placebo. All patients were offered individual counseling and programs to improve their compliance with study medication and were encouraged to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

Results

There were 209 patients in each group; all had been sober for at least five days before randomization. At 13 weeks, we found no significant difference in the number of days to relapse between patients in the two naltrexone groups (mean, 72.3 days) and the placebo group (mean, 62.4 days; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between groups, -3.0 to 22.8). At 52 weeks, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the percentage of days on which drinking occurred and the number of drinks per drinking day.

Conclusions

Our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic, severe alcohol dependence.

Importance

Alcohol use disorder affects more than 28.3 million people in the United States and is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To compare efficacy and comparative efficacy of therapies for alcohol use disorder.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from November 2012 to September 9, 2022 Literature was subsequently systematically monitored to identify relevant articles up to August 14, 2023, and the PubMed search was updated on August 14, 2023.

Study Selection

For efficacy outcomes, randomized clinical trials of at least 12 weeks' duration were included. For adverse effects, randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that compared drug therapies and reported health outcomes or harms were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers evaluated each study, assessed risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Numbers needed to treat were calculated for medications with at least moderate strength of evidence for benefit.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes were motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

Results

Data from 118 clinical trials and 20 976 participants were included. The numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 person from returning to any drinking were 11 (95% CI, 1–32) for acamprosate and 18 (95% CI, 4–32) for oral naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/d. Compared with placebo, oral naltrexone (50 mg/d) was associated with lower rates of return to heavy drinking, with a number needed to treat of 11 (95% CI, 5–41). Injectable naltrexone was associated with fewer drinking days over the 30-day treatment period (weighted mean difference, -4.99 days; 95% CI, -9.49 to -0.49 days) Adverse effects included higher gastrointestinal distress for acamprosate (diarrhea: risk ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.27–1.97) and naltrexone (nausea: risk ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.51–1.98; vomiting: risk ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.91) compared with placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In conjunction with psychosocial interventions, these findings support the use of oral naltrexone at 50 mg/d and acamprosate as first-line pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder.

### Evaluation of drinking risk levels as outcomes in alcohol pharmacotherapy trials: a secondary analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials [^b115ec58]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The US Food and Drug Administration recognizes total abstinence and no heavy drinking days as outcomes for pivotal pharmacotherapy trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Many patients have difficulty achieving these outcomes, which can discourage seeking treatment and has slowed the development of medications that affect alcohol use.

Objective

To compare 2 drinking-reduction outcomes with total abstinence and no heavy drinking outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Data were obtained from 3 multisite, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of medications for treating alcohol dependence (naltrexone, varenicline, and topiramate) in adults with DSM-IV-categorized alcohol dependence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Within each trial, the percentage of participants in active and placebo conditions who met responder definitions of abstinence, no heavy drinking days, a WHO 1-level reduction, and a WHO 2-level reduction was computed by month with corresponding effect sizes (Cohen h).

Results

Across the 3 trials (N = 1169; mean [SD] age, 45 [10] years; 824 [70.5%] men), the percentage of participants classified as responders during the last 4 weeks of treatment was lowest for abstinence (naltrexone, 34.7% [100 of 288]; varenicline, 7.3% [7 of 96]; topiramate, 11.7% [21 of 179]) followed by no heavy drinking days (naltrexone, 51.0% [147 of 288]; varenicline, 24.0% [23 of 96]; topiramate, 20.7% [37 of 179]), WHO 2-level reduction (naltrexone, 75.0% [216 of 288]; varenicline, 55.2% [53 of 96]; topiramate, 44.7% [80 of 179]), and WHO 1-level reduction (naltrexone, 83.3% [240 of 288]; varenicline, 69.8 [67 of 96]; topiramate, 54.7% [98 of 179]) outcomes. Standardized treatment effects observed for the WHO 2-level reduction outcomes (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.214 [95% CI, 0.053–0.375]; varenicline, 0.273 [95% CI, -0.006 to 0.553]; topiramate, 0.230 [95% CI, 0.024–0.435]) and WHO 1-level reduction (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.116 [95% CI, -0.046 to 0.277]; varenicline, 0.338 [95% CI, 0.058–0.617]; topiramate, 0.014 [95% CI, -0.192 to 0.219]) were comparable with those obtained using abstinence (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.142 [95% CI, -0.020 to 0.303]; varenicline, 0.146 [95% CI, -0.133 to 0.426]; topiramate, 0.369 [95% CI, 0.163–0.574]) and no heavy drinking days (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.140 [95% CI, -0.021 to 0.302]; varenicline, 0.232 [95% CI, -0.048 to 0.511]; topiramate, 0.207 [95% CI, 0.002–0.413]).

Conclusions and Relevance

WHO drinking risk level reductions appear to be worthwhile indicators of treatment outcome in AUD pharmacotherapy trials. These outcomes may align with drinking reduction goals of many patients and capture clinically meaningful improvements experienced by more patients than either abstinence or no heavy drinking days.

### Reduction of alcohol drinking in young adults by naltrexone: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of efficacy and safety [^f961e4ac]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, may facilitate reduction in drinking among young adults. We compared the efficacy and safety of naltrexone administered daily plus targeted dosing with placebo to reduce drinking in young adults who engage in heavy drinking.

Method

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in an outpatient research center in March 2008-January 2012. Participants were aged 18–25 years and reported ≥ 4 heavy drinking days in the prior 4 weeks. Interventions included naltrexone 25 mg daily plus 25 mg targeted (at most daily) in anticipation of drinking (n = 61) or daily/targeted placebo (n = 67). All participants received a personalized feedback session and brief counseling every other week. Primary outcomes were percent heavy drinking days and percent days abstinent over the 8-week treatment period. Secondary outcomes included number of drinks per drinking day and percentage of days with estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels ≥ 0.08 g/dL.

Results

Of 140 randomized patients, 128 began treatment, comprising the evaluable sample. During treatment, percent heavy drinking days (naltrexone: mean = 21.60, SD = 16.05; placebo: mean = 22.90, SD = 13.20) (P = 0.58) and percent days abstinent (naltrexone: mean = 56.60, SD = 22.52; placebo: mean = 62.50, SD = 15.75) (P = 0.39) did not differ by group. Naltrexone significantly reduced the number of drinks per drinking day (naltrexone: mean = 4.90, SD = 2.28; placebo: mean = 5.90, SD = 2.51) (P = 0.009) and percentage of drinking days with estimated BAC ≥ 0.08 g/dL (naltrexone: mean = 35.4, SD = 28.40; placebo: mean = 45.7, SD = 26.80) (P = 0.042). There were no serious adverse events. Sleepiness was more common with naltrexone.

Conclusions

Naltrexone did not reduce frequency of drinking or heavy drinking days, but reduced secondary measures of drinking intensity. While effects were modest, the risk-benefit ratio favors offering naltrexone to help young adult heavy drinkers reduce the amount of alcohol they drink.

### Effect of extended-release naltrexone on alcohol consumption: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^91411630]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aims of this study were to (1) estimate the effect of extended-release naltrexone compared with placebo on alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and (2) conduct pre-planned subgroup analyses to test whether being abstinent when initiating treatment (lead-in abstinence) or the duration of treatment improves treatment efficacy.

Design

Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials reporting the effect extended-release naltrexone on alcohol consumption.

Setting

Outpatient clinics.

Participants

Seven trials evaluating a total of 1500 adults with AUD receiving monthly injections of either placebo or extended-release naltrexone at doses of 150–400 mg for 2–6 months and some form of behavioral therapy.

Measurements

Pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) in drinking days per month and heavy drinking days per month.

Findings

The WMD was -2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.4, -0.6; P = 0.03] in favor of extended-release naltrexone for drinking days per month and -1.2 (95% CI = -0.2, -2.1; P = 0.02) for heavy drinking days per month, indicating that treatment resulted in two fewer drinking days per month and 1.2 fewer heavy drinking days per month compared with placebo. Trials not requiring lead-in abstinence and those lasting longer than 3 months reported larger reductions in heavy drinking days per month; WMD -2.0 (95% CI = -3.52, -0.48; P = 0.01) and -1.9 (95% CI = -3.2, -0.5; P = 0.01), respectively. In all cases, the I² statistics (0–7.2%) did not suggest substantial heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Extended-release naltrexone reduces drinking days and heavy drinking days per month compared with placebo. Reductions are larger with a longer duration of treatment.

### The American psychiatric association practice guideline for the pharmacological treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder [^e796660b]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, APA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering naltrexone in patients with moderate-to-severe AUD with a goal of reducing alcohol consumption or achieving abstinence, preferring pharmacotherapy or not responding to nonpharmacological treatments alone, and not having contraindications to naltrexone.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^6ea90e65]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Alternative Dosing Schedules

A flexible approach to a dosing regimen may need to be employed in cases of supervised administration. Thus, patients may receive 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride every weekday with a 100 mg dose on Saturday, 100 mg every other day, or 150 mg every third day. The degree of blockade produced by naltrexone hydrochloride may be reduced by these extended dosing intervals.

There may be a higher risk of hepatocellular injury with single doses above 50 mg, and use of higher doses and extended dosing intervals should balance the possible risks against the probable benefits (see WARNINGS).

Patient Compliance

Naltrexone hydrochloride tablets should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment. To achieve the best possible treatment outcome, appropriate compliance-enhancing techniques should be implemented for all components of the treatment program, including medication compliance.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding naltrexone for alcohol use disorder in liver disease [^f72a4ff0]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hospitalizations related to alcohol use disorder (AUD) are common. Yet, few patients receive pharmacotherapy consistent with guideline recommendations. Previous concerns over the potential hepatotoxicity of naltrexone have been disproven and recent studies have shown its safety and efficacy in patients with cirrhosis. Naltrexone is an effective therapy to reduce heavy alcohol consumption, however, lack of knowledge among prescribers inhibits greater uptake. Hospitalization is an opportune time for change-naltrexone can promote the reduction or cessation of unhealthy alcohol consumption, as well as subsequent readmissions or progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Hospitalists should stop avoiding naltrexone in the treatment of AUD.

### Do acamprosate or naltrexone have an effect on daily drinking by reducing craving for alcohol? [^05a98d9b]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To explore the effect of acamprosate and naltrexone on craving and alcohol consumption in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, single-dummy, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Three treatment centres in Sydney, Australia.

Participants

A total of 169 alcohol-dependent subjects were given naltrexone (50 mg/day), acamprosate (1998 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks, in conjunction with manualized medication compliance therapy.

Intervention

During the course of the trial, participants kept a daily diary which included the number of standard drinks they consumed and their peak craving for alcohol that day rated on a 0–10 scale.

Measurements

Subjective ratings of daily craving and daily drinking for the first 6 weeks of treatment.

Findings

Mixed/hierarchical linear models were employed on an intention-to-treat basis. Analyses revealed that craving was a significant predictor of daily drinking and baseline levels of depression were the best predictor of daily craving. There was no significant improvement in model fit when treatment group was added both in models of daily craving and daily drinking. Daily alcohol consumption was best predicted by a model incorporating baseline dependence and depression scores, and daily craving, entered as a time-varying covariate. However, there was a significant craving × time × treatment interaction (t = -3.365, df = 4413.712, P < 0.001), suggesting that at higher levels of craving drinking was reduced at a significantly greater rate with naltrexone compared to acamprosate.

Conclusions

Naltrexone had a greater effect on drinking when craving was high. These results support the role of naltrexone in reducing craving when that craving is highly salient. The role of acamprosate in reducing craving was not supported by these findings.

### Naltrexone [^01833cb6]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Studies

Multiple studies have demonstrated an increase of adherence to drug and alcohol detox programs with extended release formulations.

The efficacy of naltrexone implants in the treatment of alcohol and various drug addiction was evaluated in a 12 week, placebo-controlled, multi-center, randomized trial in Mexico. Twenty-five subjects were treated with an implantation of 1200mg (6 × 200mg) Naltrexone. Oral naltrexone was not administered prior to the initial implantation. Psychological support was provided to all subjects on a weekly basis in addition to medication.

Subjects treated with naltrexone 1200mg implants demonstrated a greater reduction in days of heavy drinking and other substance abuse than those treated with placebo.

In another study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, 56 patients at an addiction research center in Norway were given a naltrexone implant for treatment of heroin dependence. Researchers found that study participants who used the naltrexone implant for 180 days had an average of 45 fewer days of heroin use than members of the control group – and 60 fewer days of opioid use than members of the control group.

Similarly, a 2014 systematic review published in the Drug and Alcohol Review examined a variety of research results from 9 studies comparing naltrexone implant treatment to either oral naltrexone or to no treatment at all (a placebo).

Across the 9 studies, naltrexone implants were found to be:

Significantly more effective than oral naltrexone.
Significantly more effective than having no treatment at all.

Since the quality of these studies was evaluated as being "moderate to very low", more research is still needed to better determine the effectiveness of naltrexone implants. However, the data so far suggests that naltrexone implants appear to improve addiction recovery success compared to taking naltrexone pills and compared to attempting to quit an addiction without any medication help.

Information for Patients

It is recommended that the prescribing physician relate the following information to patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride:

You have been prescribed naltrexone hydrochloride as part of the comprehensive treatment for your alcoholism or drug dependence. You should carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are taking naltrexone hydrochloride. A naltrexone hydrochloride medication card may be obtained from your physician and can be used for this purpose. Carrying the identification card should help to ensure that you can obtain adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, be sure to tell the treating physician that you are receiving naltrexone hydrochloride therapy. You should take naltrexone hydrochloride as directed by your physician.

Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to lower doses of opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued or temporarily interrupted. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose.
Advise patients that because naltrexone hydrochloride can block the effects of opioids, patients will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opioid drug in small doses while on naltrexone hydrochloride. Further, emphasize that administration of large doses of heroin or any other opioid to try to bypass the blockade and get high while on naltrexone hydrochloride may lead to serious injury, coma or death.
Patients on naltrexone hydrochloride may not experience the expected effects from opioid-containing analgesic, antidiarrheal, or antitussive medications.
Patients should be off all opioids, including opioid-containing medicines, for a minimum or 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone hydrochloride in order to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks. Ensure that patients understand that withdrawal precipitated by administration of an opioid antagonist may be severe enough to require hospitalization if they have not been opioid-free for an adequate period of time, and is different from the experience of spontaneous withdrawal that occurs with discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual. Advise patients that they should not take naltrexone hydrochloride if they have symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Advise all patients, including those with alcohol dependence, that it is imperative to notify healthcare providers of any recent use of opioids or any history of opioid dependence before starting naltrexone hydrochloride to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal.
Advise patients that naltrexone hydrochloride may cause liver injury. Patients should immediately notify their physician if they develop symptoms and/or signs of liver disease.
Advise patients that they may experience depression while taking naltrexone hydrochloride. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient that they are taking naltrexone hydrochloride and that they should call a doctor right way should they become depressed or experience symptoms of depression.
Advise patients that naltrexone hydrochloride has been shown to be effective only when used as part of a treatment program that includes counseling and support.
Advise patients that dizziness may occur with naltrexone hydrochloride treatment, and they should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they have determined how naltrexone hydrochloride affects them.
Advise patients to notify their physician if they:
become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride.
are breastfeeding.
experience other unusual or significant side effects while on naltrexone hydrochloride therapy.

### Gabapentin combined with naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence [^709fdb05]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Naltrexone, an efficacious medication for alcohol dependence, does not work for everyone. Symptoms such as insomnia and mood instability that are most evident during early abstinence might respond better to a different pharmacotherapy. Gabapentin may reduce these symptoms and help prevent early relapse. This clinical trial evaluated whether the combination of naltrexone and gabapentin was better than naltrexone alone and/or placebo during the early drinking cessation phase (first 6 weeks), and if so, whether this effect persisted.

Method

A total of 150 alcohol-dependent individuals were randomly assigned to a 16-week course of naltrexone alone (50 mg/day [N = 50]), naltrexone (50 mg/day) with gabapentin (up to 1,200 mg/day [N = 50]) added for the first 6 weeks, or double placebo (N = 50). All participants received medical management.

Results

During the first 6 weeks, the naltrexone-gabapentin group had a longer interval to heavy drinking than the naltrexone-alone group, which had an interval similar to that of the placebo group; had fewer heavy drinking days than the naltrexone-alone group, which in turn had more than the placebo group; and had fewer drinks per drinking day than the naltrexone-alone group and the placebo group. These differences faded over the remaining weeks of the study. Poor sleep was associated with more drinking in the naltrexone-alone group but not in the naltrexone-gabapentin group, while a history of alcohol withdrawal was associated with better response in the naltrexone-gabapentin group.

Conclusions

The addition of gabapentin to naltrexone improved drinking outcomes over naltrexone alone during the first 6 weeks after cessation of drinking. This effect did not endure after gabapentin was discontinued.

### Emergency department-initiated oral naltrexone for patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder: a pilot feasibility study [^295bf7a0]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this prospective non‐randomized clinical trial, we found that ED‐initiated oral naltrexone for alcohol use disorder is acceptable to patients and feasible. Engagement in comprehensive addiction care among this cohort at 14 and 30 days was moderate compared to similar studies. While there was no significant reduction in the average number of daily drinks consumed, there was a significant decrease in alcohol cravings and improvement in quality‐of‐life measures. Further study of ED‐initiated naltrexone is warranted.

### Pharmacotherapy for adults with alcohol use disorders in outpatient settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^524b110e]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorders cause substantial morbidity and early mortality yet remain greatly undertreated. Medications are considerably underused.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and harms of medications (US FDA-approved and others) for adults with alcohol use disorders.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, FDA website, and clinical trials registries (January 1, 1970, to March 1, 2014).

Study Selection

Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with at least 12 weeks' duration that reported eligible outcomes and head-to-head prospective cohort studies reporting health outcomes or harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models and calculated numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNTs) or harm (NNHs).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Alcohol consumption, motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

Results

We included 122 RCTs and 1 cohort study (total 22,803 participants). Most assessed acamprosate (27 studies, n = 7519), naltrexone (53 studies, n = 9140), or both. The NNT to prevent return to any drinking for acamprosate was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; risk difference [RD], -0.09; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.04) and was 20 (95% CI, 11 to 500; RD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.002) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). The NNT to prevent return to heavy drinking was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; RD -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). Meta-analyses of trials comparing acamprosate to naltrexone found no statistically significant difference between them for return to any drinking (RD, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.08) or heavy drinking (RD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.06). For injectable naltrexone, meta-analyses found no association with return to any drinking (RD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.03) or heavy drinking (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.13) but found an association with reduction in heavy drinking days (weighted mean difference [WMD], -4.6%; 95% CI, -8.5% to -0.56%). Among medications used off-label, moderate evidence supports an association with improvement in some consumption outcomes for nalmefene (heavy drinking days per month: WMD, -2.0; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.0; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.02; 95% CI, -1.77 to -0.28) and topiramate (% heavy drinking days: WMD, -9.0%; 95% CI, -15.3% to -2.7%; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.6 to -0.48). For naltrexone and nalmefene, NNHs for withdrawal from trials due to adverse events were 48 (95% CI, 30 to 112) and 12 (95% CI, 7 to 50), respectively; risk was not significantly increased for acamprosate or topiramate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Both acamprosate and oral naltrexone were associated with reduction in return to drinking. When directly compared with one another, no significant differences were found between acamprosate and naltrexone for controlling alcohol consumption. Factors such as dosing frequency, potential adverse events, and availability of treatments may guide medication choice.

### Efficacy of combining varenicline and naltrexone for smoking cessation and drinking reduction: a randomized clinical trial [^e0b5c06f]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pharmacological treatments that can concomitantly address cigarette smoking and heavy drinking stand to improve health care delivery for these highly prevalent co-occurring conditions. This superiority trial compared the combination of varenicline and naltrexone against varenicline alone for smoking cessation and drinking reduction among heavy-drinking smokers.

Methods

This was a phase 2 randomized double-blind clinical trial. Participants (N = 165) who were daily smokers and drank heavily received either 2 mg/day of varenicline plus 50 mg/day of naltrexone or 2 mg/day of varenicline plus matched placebo pills for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were 7-day point prevalence of nicotine abstinence (bioverified by a breath CO reading ≤ 5 ppm) at the 26-week follow-up and number of drinks per drinking day during the 12-week treatment phase.

Results

Smoking abstinence at week 26 was significantly higher in the varenicline plus placebo condition than in the varenicline plus naltrexone condition (N = 37 [45.1%] compared with N = 22 [26.5%]). For drinks per drinking day, there was a medication effect favoring the combination of varenicline and naltrexone over varenicline alone across the 12-week treatment phase, although it did not meet the significance threshold.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that smoking cessation and drinking reduction can be concomitantly targeted with pharmacotherapy and that while varenicline alone may be sufficient as a smoking cessation aid in heavy-drinking smokers, the combination of varenicline and naltrexone may confer benefits with regard to drinking outcomes, particularly during the 12-week period of active medication treatment.

### Naltrexone [^ed110fde]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Naltrexone implants must be administered by a physician.

To prevent occurrence of an acute abstinence syndrome (withdrawal) in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical abstinence syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, must be opioid-free for a minimum of 7–10 days before starting Naltrexone Implant treatment. Since the absence of an opioid drug in the urine is often not sufficient proof that a patient is opioid-free, a naloxone challenge test should be employed if the prescribing physician feels there is a risk of precipitating a withdrawal reaction following administration of Naltrexone Implants. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with Naltrexone Implants should be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with Naltrexone Implants. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or dependence on opioids.

The aluminum (back) part of the blister packs should be wiped with sterile 70% isopropyl alcohol pads prior to opening. Implants should be handled via aseptic technique and should be used immediately.

The recommended dose of Naltrexone implants is 1200mg delivered subcutaneously every 10–12 weeks.

Reemergence of cravings should be screened and may be used as a gauge for the need for re-implantation schedule.

Healthcare providers should tailor the length of treatment to individual patients. Naltrexone has been administered to patients who are alcohol dependent for 6 months to 1 year with no additional safety concerns. Many scientists claim that treatment duration should last at least 1 year since this is the amount of time it can take to change the brain's addiction pathways.

Treatment with Naltrexone should be part of a psychological and psychosocial program.

### Combined pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions for alcohol dependence: the COMBINE study: a randomized controlled trial [^9c05ebee]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Alcohol dependence treatment may include medications, behavioral therapies, or both. It is unknown how combining these treatments may impact their effectiveness, especially in the context of primary care and other nonspecialty settings.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of medication, behavioral therapies, and their combinations for treatment of alcohol dependence and to evaluate placebo effect on overall outcome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized controlled trial conducted January 2001-January 2004 among 1383 recently alcohol-abstinent volunteers (median age, 44 years) from 11 US academic sites with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnoses of primary alcohol dependence.

Interventions

Eight groups of patients received medical management with 16 weeks of naltrexone (100 mg/d) or acamprosate (3 g/d), both, and/or both placebos, with or without a combined behavioral intervention (CBI). A ninth group received CBI only (no pills). Patients were also evaluated for up to 1 year after treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Percent days abstinent from alcohol and time to first heavy drinking day.

Results

All groups showed substantial reduction in drinking. During treatment, patients receiving naltrexone plus medical management (n = 302), CBI plus medical management and placebos (n = 305), or both naltrexone and CBI plus medical management (n = 309) had higher percent days abstinent (80.6, 79.2, and 77.1, respectively) than the 75.1 in those receiving placebos and medical management only (n = 305), a significant naltrexone × behavioral intervention interaction (P = 0.009). Naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% CI, 0.53–0.98; P = 0.02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not CBI. Acamprosate showed no significant effect on drinking vs placebo, either by itself or with any combination of naltrexone, CBI, or both. During treatment, those receiving CBI without pills or medical management (n = 157) had lower percent days abstinent (66.6) than those receiving placebo plus medical management alone (n = 153) or placebo plus medical management and CBI (n = 156) (73.8 and 79.8, respectively; P < .001). One year after treatment, these between-group effects were similar but no longer significant.

Conclusions

Patients receiving medical management with naltrexone, CBI, or both fared better on drinking outcomes, whereas acamprosate showed no evidence of efficacy, with or without CBI. No combination produced better efficacy than naltrexone or CBI alone in the presence of medical management. Placebo pills and meeting with a health care professional had a positive effect above that of CBI during treatment. Naltrexone with medical management could be delivered in health care settings, thus serving alcohol-dependent patients who might otherwise not receive treatment.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride and bupropion hydrochloride (contrave) [^6ace55ba]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Patients Receiving Opioid Analgesics

Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose: CONTRAVE should not be administered to patients receiving chronic opioids, due to the naltrexone component, which is an opioid receptor antagonist [see Contraindications (4)]. If chronic opiate therapy is required, CONTRAVE treatment should be stopped. In patients requiring intermittent opiate treatment, CONTRAVE therapy should be temporarily discontinued and lower doses of opioids may be needed. Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after CONTRAVE treatment is discontinued.

An attempt by a patient to overcome any naltrexone opioid blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids is especially dangerous and may lead to a fatal overdose or life-threatening opioid intoxication (e.g., respiratory arrest, circulatory collapse). Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade.

Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal: The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal, which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual, are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. To prevent occurrence of either precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal symptoms, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting CONTRAVE treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids, and those patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may need as long as two weeks. Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use.

### Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence [^794674db]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid antagonists can decrease alcohol consumption in animals. Their harms and benefits have been examined in many clinical trials.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of opioid antagonists in attenuating or preventing the recommencement of alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence in comparison to placebo, other medications and psychosocial treatments. In addition, discontinuation rate, death, patient satisfaction, functioning, health-related quality of life and economic outcomes were also evaluated.

Search Strategy

The specialised register of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol was searched until September 2003. The search was integrated with previous searches of Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library 2001, issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001), EMBASE (1980 - December 2001) and CINHAL (1982 - December 2001). Du Pont Pharmaceutical and Ivax Corporation were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials. The reference lists of the obtained papers were also examined.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Participants were people with alcohol dependence. Naltrexone (NTX), nalmefene (NMF) and other opioid antagonists with/without other biological or psychosocial treatments were examined. Two primary outcomes were number of participants with relapses (including those who return to heavy drinking) and number of participants who return to drinking. Other outcomes of interest were time to first drink, percentage or number of drinking days, number of standard drinks, craving, percentage or number of days or episodes of heavy drinking, amount of alcohol consumed, discontinuation rate, patient satisfaction, impaired function, health-related quality of life, economic and death.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers evaluated and extracted the data independently. The dichotomous data were extracted on an intention-to-treat basis. The Relative Risk with the 95% confidence interval was used to assess the dichotomous data. A weighted (or standardised) mean difference (WMD or SMD) with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the continuous data.

Main Results

The review included 29 RCTs presented in 36 articles. Except two RCTs of nalmefene, all others investigated NTX. In comparison to placebo, a short-term treatment of NTX significantly decreased the relapse [RR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.51 to 0.82)] and was likely to decrease the return to drinking [RR (95% CI) = 0.87 (0.76 to 1.00). In the respect of acceptability, NTX treatment significantly diminished treatment withdrawal [RR (95% CI) = 0.82 (0.70 to 0.97). While a medium-term treatment of NTX gave no benefit in the respect of relapse prevention, it was found to be beneficial on two of four secondary outcomes by increasing time to first drink and diminishing craving. A medium-term treatment of NTX was superior to acamprosate in reducing relapses, standard drinks and craving. NTX plus an intensive psychosocial treatment (PST) was not superior to NTX plus a simple PST on any primary and secondary short-term outcomes. For a medium-term treatment, NTX plus an intensive PST was superior to NTX plus a simple PST in increasing time to first drink and decreasing craving.

Authors' Conclusions

The review findings support that short-term treatment of NTX decreases the chance of alcohol relapses for 36% (number-needed-to-treat or NNT = 7) and likely to reduce the chance of returning to drinking for 13% (NNT = 12). In comparison to placebo group, NTX treatment can lower the risk of treatment withdrawal in alcohol-dependent patients for 28% (NNT = 13). Some major limitations of the available evidence include short study duration in many trials, small sample sizes in most trials and lack of data on psychosocial benefits. In conclusion, NTX should be accepted as a short-term treatment for alcoholism. Strategies to improve adherence to NTX treatment, eg, PSTs and management of adverse effects, should be concomitantly given. We have not yet known so far how long alcohol-dependent patients who respond to NTX treatment should continue their treatment. Due to too little evidence, NMF should have no role for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

### Naltrexone: not just for opioids anymore [^84809625]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a semi-synthetic opioid with competitive antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence, but adherence to daily dosing has been recognized as a factor limiting long-term effectiveness. Recently, a long-acting injectable formulation of naltrexone has received FDA-approval for treating alcohol and opioid dependence. This article reviews the pharmacology of naltrexone, the current evidence supporting the use of extended-release naltrexone, and the clinical challenges in the induction of patients to this medication.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, more specifically with respect to management in the emergency department, SAEM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering naltrexone to prevent return to heavy drinking and/or reduce heavy drinking in patients not taking opioids. Consider offering acamprosate if naltrexone is contraindicated.

### Early treatment response in alcohol dependence with extended-release naltrexone [^e9daa9d1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the time course for onset of effect of intramuscular injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), which has demonstrated efficacy for alcohol dependence.

Method

A post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study was conducted. In the study, actively drinking men and women who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for alcohol dependence were randomly assigned to receive injections of XR-NTX 380 mg (N = 205) or 190 mg (N = 210) or placebo (N = 209) every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Patients also received 12 sessions of standardized, low-intensity psychosocial intervention. Drinking data were analyzed by month and, during the first month, by day to explore the time course for onset of effect on heavy drinking days in patients receiving XR-NTX versus placebo. The study data were collected between February 2002 and September 2003.

Results

During the first month following injection, patients receiving XR-NTX 380 mg had 37% fewer heavy drinking days versus placebo (p < .01). By day 2, a significant reduction in the median number of drinks consumed per day was observed in patients given XR-NTX 380 mg compared with placebo (p < .05). By day 3, XR-NTX 380 mg resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of patients reporting heavy drinking compared with placebo (p < .05); this reduction was maintained throughout the study. A dose-response effect was observed, with intermediate results for XR-NTX 190 mg.

Conclusion

XR-NTX 380 mg provided a rapid onset of therapeutic effect in the first 2 days after the first injection that was sustained throughout the 24-week trial. Potential clinical implications of the rapid, early onset of effect of this medication's delivery system for patients who are dependent on alcohol include facilitation of early engagement in treatment, motivation to continue treatment, and focus on the goals established in counseling.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^fb3a8486]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride tablets treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids.

Switching from Buprenorphine, Buprenorphine/Naloxone, or Methadone

There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone hydrochloride tablets; however, review of postmarketing case reports have indicated that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy (see WARNINGS). Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

Treatment of Alcoholism

A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients. The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials.

Naltrexone hydrochloride tablets should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment of alcoholism. Factors associated with a good outcome in the clinical trials with naltrexone hydrochloride tablets were the type, intensity, and duration of treatment; appropriate management of comorbid conditions; use of community-based support groups; and good medication compliance. To achieve the best possible treatment outcome, appropriate compliance-enhancing techniques should be implemented for all components of the treatment program, especially medication compliance.

Treatment of Opioid Dependence

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride tablets. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter.

A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride tablets are of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes some measure to ensure the patient takes the medication.

### Diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of alcohol use disorder: a review [^878ad871]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol consumption is associated with 88 000 US deaths annually. Although routine screening for heavy alcohol use can identify patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and has been recommended, only 1 in 6 US adults report ever having been asked by a health professional about their drinking behavior. Alcohol use disorder, a problematic pattern of alcohol use accompanied by clinically significant impairment or distress, is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period, although only about 8% of affected individuals are treated in an alcohol treatment facility.

Observations

Four medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD: disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate. However, patients with AUD most commonly receive counseling. Medications are prescribed to less than 9% of patients who are likely to benefit from them, given evidence that they exert clinically meaningful effects and their inclusion in clinical practice guidelines as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone, which can be given once daily, reduces the likelihood of a return to any drinking by 5% and binge-drinking risk by 10%. Randomized clinical trials also show that some medications approved for other indications, including seizure disorder (eg, topiramate), are efficacious in treating AUD. Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacogenetics to personalize AUD treatments.

Conclusions and Relevance

Alcohol consumption is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and heavy alcohol use is the major risk factor for AUD. Simple, valid screening methods can be used to identify patients with heavy alcohol use, who can then be evaluated for the presence of an AUD. Patients receiving a diagnosis of the disorder should be given brief counseling and prescribed a first-line medication (eg, naltrexone) or referred for a more intensive psychosocial intervention.

### Association of the sweet-liking phenotype and craving for alcohol with the response to naltrexone treatment in alcohol dependence: a randomized clinical trial [^59fa4c13]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Identification of moderators of the response to naltrexone hydrochloride treatment for alcohol dependence could improve clinical care for patients with alcohol use disorders.

Objective

To investigate the preliminary finding that the sweet-liking (SL) phenotype interacts with a high level of craving for alcohol and is associated with an improved response to naltrexone in alcohol dependence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 12-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted from February 1, 2010, to April 30, 2012, in an academic outpatient medical center. Eighty actively drinking patients were randomized by the SL (n = 22) or the sweet-disliking (SDL) (n = 58) phenotype and by pretreatment high (n = 40) or low (n = 40) craving for alcohol, with high craving defined as greater than the median. Patients and staff were blinded to categorization. Patients were excluded for unstable medical or psychiatric illness, including dependence on drugs other than nicotine. Four patients (2 in the placebo arm and 2 in the naltrexone arm) stopped medication therapy because of adverse effects. Data were analyzed from January 15, 2013, to May 15, 2016, based on intention to treat.

Interventions

Oral naltrexone hydrochloride, 50 mg/d, or daily placebo with weekly to biweekly brief counseling.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The a priori hypothesis tested SL/SDL phenotype, pretreatment craving, and their interaction as moderators of frequency of abstinent and heavy drinking days during treatment, assessed with the timeline follow-back method.

Results

Eighty patients were randomized (57 men [71%]; 23 women [29%]; mean [SD] age, 47.0 [8.6] years). A nonsignificant effect of naltrexone on heavy drinking was noted (4.8 fewer heavy drinking days; Cohen d = 0.45; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.90; F1,67 = 3.52; P = 0.07). The SL phenotype moderated the effect of naltrexone on heavy drinking (6.1 fewer heavy drinking days; Cohen d = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.12–1.03; F1,67 = 5.65; P = 0.02) and abstinence (10.0 more abstinent days; Cohen d = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.11–1.02; F1,67 = 5.36; P = 0.02), and high craving moderated heavy drinking (7.1 fewer heavy drinking days; Cohen d = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.20–1.11; F1,67 = 7.37; P = 0.008). The combination of the SL phenotype and high craving was associated with a strong response to naltrexone, with 17.1 fewer heavy drinking days (Cohen d = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.58–1.54; F1,67 = 19.33; P < .001) and 28.8 more abstinent days (Cohen d = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.25–1.17; F1,67 = 8.73; P = 0.004) compared with placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

The SL phenotype and a high craving for alcohol independently and particularly in combination are associated with a positive response to naltrexone. The SL/SDL phenotype and a high craving for alcohol merit further investigation as factors to identify patients with alcohol dependence who are responsive to naltrexone.

### Relapse rates in patients… [^2971b85c]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the first-line pharmacologic treatment options for alcohol use disorder. Evidence-Based Answer Acamprosate and naltrexone should be used as first-line agents for treatment of alcohol use disorder and are effective for reducing relapse rates. Agent selection should be based on comorbid conditions and adherence to the dosing regimen. Combining the two agents may provide additional benefit early in treatment. 1 The primary outcome was a return to alcohol consumption, classified as any or heavy consumption. Rates of return to any consumption improved with either agent. The number needed to treat for return to any consumption was 12 for acamprosate and 20 for naltrexone.

2 Table 1 shows relapse rates at 12 and 24 weeks among the four treatment groups. 2 Acamprosate, naltrexone, and combination therapy were significantly more effective than placebo at 12 and 24 weeks. At 12 weeks, the relapse rate among patients receiving combination therapy was significantly lower than in the acamprosate group, but this significance was not observed at 24 weeks. There was an increase in nausea and diarrhea in the combination therapy group. Recommendations from Others The American Psychiatric Association and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend naltrexone and acamprosate as the preferred pharmacologic options for patients with alcohol use disorder, in combination with cognitive behavioral interventions. 3, 4 The APA recommends against acamprosate therapy in patients with severe renal impairment, and against naltrexone in those with hepatic failure or acute hepatitis.

### Emergency department-initiated oral naltrexone for patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder: a pilot feasibility study [^b71bc19e]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol intake and craving

At baseline, the total number of drinks consumed during each of the timeline follow‐back days 1–7 for each participant divided by 7 days was operationalized as the average number of drinks consumed in a 24‐h period (i.e. per day) at baseline for each participant. Likewise, throughout the 30‐day follow‐up period, participants reported totals for beer, wine, and liquor consumed daily. The total number of drinks consumed per day by each participant during the entire follow‐up period divided by the respective number of days for which the participant provided a response was operationalized as the average number of drinks consumed per day during the follow‐up period. The comparison of the baseline to follow‐up average number of drinks consumed per day was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test for related groups (each individual paired with their own data). Participants who did not complete any follow‐up assessments were excluded from the paired analysis. The number of heavy drinking days, defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on the same occasion in a 24‐h period was also calculated. We also calculated the number of days of self‐reported zero alcohol intake and zero alcohol craving. For both the baseline and the follow‐up periods, zero drinks per day was only indicated if the participant explicitly indicated that they did not drink within the 24‐h period for which they were reporting.

Participants also completed the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) during the baseline and follow‐up periods. At enrollment, participants were asked the PACS survey questions with respect to the last week that they drank any alcohol. An overall craving score was then calculated for each participant for the baseline period by summing their scores for each survey question. Participants then completed daily PACS via Qualtrics. To calculate the average craving score for each participant, daily craving scores completed over the course of the 30‐day follow‐up period were totaled for each participant and divided by the respective number of days for which the participant provided a response. For both the baseline and the follow‐up periods, incomplete survey responses on PACS were not given a score. The comparison of the baseline to follow‐up average daily craving was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test for related groups (each individual paired with their own data). Participants who did not complete any follow‐up assessments were excluded from the paired analysis.

### Naltrexone vs placebo for the treatment of alcohol dependence: a randomized clinical trial [^69368a98]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorder is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. While effective pharmacological treatments exist, they are efficacious only in certain individuals, contributing to their limited use. Secondary analysis of clinical trial data suggests that a functional polymorphism (rs1799971, Asn40Asp) of the µ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) is associated with the risk of relapse to heavy drinking following treatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone.

Objective

To prospectively examine whether rs1799971 is predictive of naltrexone treatment response.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of naltrexone vs placebo in individuals with alcohol dependence (intent-to-treat analysis). Participants were randomly assigned to study treatment based on the presence of 1 or 2 copies of the Asp40 allele compared with those homozygous for the Asn40 allele (2 × 2 cell design). Recruitment occurred between January 2009 and September 2013. All participants were seen in an outpatient clinical setting. A convenience sample of participants (n = 221) was recruited from 5 sites. All participants met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, with no concurrent psychotic or manic symptoms, no use of concurrent psychotropic medications, and no current dependence on illicit substances.

Interventions

The study drug was naltrexone (50 mg) given once daily or corresponding placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary study outcome measure was relapse to heavy drinking measured using the timeline follow-back method.

Results

There was no evidence of a genotype × treatment interaction on the primary outcome of heavy drinking (P = 0.32). In the Asn40 group, the observed effect of naltrexone was similar to that in previous trials (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.41–1.18; P = 0.17), with a very small naltrexone effect in the Asp40 group (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.52–2.31; P = 0.80), contrary to the pattern expected a priori. A significant reduction in heavy drinking occurred across all groups (P = 0.001). Other drinking outcomes, and all secondary outcomes, demonstrated similar time effects, with no genotype × treatment interaction.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the Asp40 allele moderates the response to naltrexone treatment. It is premature to use the Asn40Asp polymorphism as a biomarker to predict the response to naltrexone treatment of alcohol dependence.

### Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence [^344c8aba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The results from animal studies suggest that opioid antagonists may prevent the reinforcing effects of alcohol consumption. Based on the results of those animal studies, some opioid antagonists, such as, naltrexone, nalmefene, have been studied for their benefits in treating alcohol dependence.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of opioid antagonists in attenuating or preventing the recommencement of alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence in comparison to placebo, other medications and psychosocial treatments. In addition, discontinuation rate, death, patient satisfaction, functioning, health-related quality of life and economic outcomes were also evaluated.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library 2001, issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001), EMBASE (1980 - December 2001), and CINHAL (1982 - December 2001) were undertaken. Du Pont Pharmaceutical and Ivax Corporation were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials. The reference lists of the obtained papers were also examined.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were included. Participants were people with alcohol dependence. Naltrexone (NTX), nalmefene (NMF) and other opioid antagonists with/without other biological or psychosocial treatments were examined. Four primary outcomes of interest were number of patients who return to drinking, percentage or number of drinking days, number of standard drinks of alcohol and amount of alcohol consumed. A number of secondary outcomes were also considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers evaluated and extracted the data independently. The dichotomous data were extracted on an intention-to-treat basis. The Relative Risk with the 95% confidence interval was used to assess the dichotomous data. Weighted (or Standardised) Mean Difference with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the continuous data.

Main Results

The review included 19 RCTs or CCTs presented in 26 articles. In comparison to placebo, two of four short-term primary outcomes were significantly in favour of NTX. Those were number of patients who return to drinking (61% in NTX group vs 69% in placebo group) [RR (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.80 to 0.98), NNT = 14] and percentage or number of drinking days [WMD (95% CI) = -4.52 (-5.29 to -3.75)]. However, the short-term discontinuation rates were high and not different between NTX and placebo groups [RR (95% CI) = 0.96 (0.81 to 1.13)]. No medium-term outcomes of NTX and placebo groups showed any significant difference after the completion of NTX treatment for three to six months. However, those who were regularly treated with NTX treatment in both short and medium terms consumed smaller amounts of alcohol than placebo-treated patients. Because of the small sample sizes, there were few significant differences for other comparisons.

Reviewer's Conclusions

NTX at the dose of 50 mg/day is effective for alcohol dependence in short-term treatment. The optimal duration of NTX treatment may be longer than 3 months. The evidence so far may be too little to support the superiority of NTX to acamprosate and the inferiority of NTX to disulfiram. NTX treatment should be concurrently given with a psychosocial intervention. Other patterns of NTX administration should not be used at present, e.g., a dose of three times a week, combined NTX with other biological treatments. NMF has no role for the treatment of alcohol dependence in clinical practice. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of NTX treatment in patients with alcohol dependence are still needed. Some issues should be concerned in further studies. Firstly, further trials should be conducted in larger sample sizes and over longer periods of time. Secondly, other than the outcomes relevant to alcohol use, some important outcomes should also be measured, e.g., functioning, health-related quality of life, economic cost. Thirdly, the comparisons between NTX and other treatments for alcohol dependence, both biological and psychosocial, should be investigated. Fourthly, combined treatments of NTX and other biological treatments for alcohol dependence may be in issue of interest. Lastly, high discontinuation rate in both treatment and control groups should be concerned.

### Meta-analysis of naltrexone and acamprosate for treating alcohol use disorders: when are these medications most helpful? [^008e943a]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Although debates over the efficacy of oral naltrexone and acamprosate in treating alcohol use disorders tend to focus on their global efficacy relative to placebo or their efficacy relative to each other, the underlying reality may be more nuanced. This meta-analysis examined when naltrexone and acamprosate are most helpful by testing: (i) the relative efficacy of each medication given its presumed mechanism of action (reducing heavy drinking versus fostering abstinence) and (ii) whether different ways of implementing each medication (required abstinence before treatment, detoxification before treatment, goal of treatment, length of treatment, dosage) moderate its effects.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified 64 randomized, placebo-controlled, English-language clinical trials completed between 1970 and 2009 focused on acamprosate or naltrexone.

Results

Acamprosate had a significantly larger effect size than naltrexone on the maintenance of abstinence, and naltrexone had a larger effect size than acamprosate on the reduction of heavy drinking and craving. For naltrexone, requiring abstinence before the trial was associated with larger effect sizes for abstinence maintenance and reduced heavy drinking compared with placebo. For acamprosate, detoxification before medication administration was associated with better abstinence outcomes compared with placebo.

Conclusions

In treatment for alcohol use disorders, acamprosate has been found to be slightly more efficacious in promoting abstinence and naltrexone slightly more efficacious in reducing heavy drinking and craving. Detoxification before treatment or a longer period of required abstinence before treatment is associated with larger medication effects for acamprosate and naltrexone respectively.

### Naltrexone for alcohol dependence: a randomized controlled trial [^8392a37f]. Addiction (2001). Low credibility.

Aim

We examined the efficacy of naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) for alcohol dependence in a sample of alcohol-dependent men.

Design

A 12-week randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

The outpatient clinic of a combined war veteran and general teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

Male alcohol-dependent subjects recruited from the community and from veteran groups.

Intervention

Alcohol-dependent subjects were treated with 50 mg of naltrexone or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Both treatment groups attended a weekly education support group. Subjects were assessed weekly.

Measurements

Primary study outcomes were the maintenance of abstinence and relapse to drinking.

Findings

Fifty-five subjects were randomized to naltrexone and 56 to placebo. Forty subjects did not complete 12 weeks of therapy (17 naltrexone, 23 placebo). In the intention-to-treat sample (N = 111) fewer naltrexone treated subjects relapsed (p = 0.001). Among patients who completed the 12-week trial, naltrexone reduced the consumption of alcohol. Naltrexone was well tolerated and there were few adverse experiences.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that naltrexone is effective in preventing relapse to drinking in the setting of limited psychosocial treatment. Further studies should examine the duration of treatment needed to maintain the effect long term.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^87515aa5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

During two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week trials to evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcohol dependence, most patients tolerated naltrexone hydrochloride well. In these studies, a total of 93 patients received naltrexone hydrochloride at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Five of these patients discontinued naltrexone hydrochloride because of nausea. No serious adverse events were reported during these two trials.

While extensive clinical studies evaluating the use of naltrexone hydrochloride in detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals failed to identify any single, serious untoward risk of naltrexone hydrochloride use, placebo-controlled studies employing up to five fold higher doses of naltrexone hydrochloride (up to 300 mg per day) than that recommended for use in opiate receptor blockade have shown that naltrexone hydrochloride causes hepatocellular injury in a substantial proportion of patients exposed at higher doses (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

Aside from this finding, and the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal, available evidence does not incriminate naltrexone hydrochloride, used at any dose, as a cause of any other serious adverse reaction for the patient who is "opioid-free". It is critical to recognize that naltrexone hydrochloride can precipitate or exacerbate abstinence signs and symptoms in any individual who is not completely free of exogenous opioids.

Patients with addictive disorders, especially opioid addiction, are at risk for multiple numerous adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings, including liver function abnormalities. Data from both controlled and observational studies suggest that these abnormalities, other than the dose-related hepatotoxicity described above, are not related to the use of naltrexone hydrochloride.

Among opioid-free individuals, naltrexone hydrochloride administration at the recommended dose has not been associated with a predictable profile of serious adverse or untoward events. However, as mentioned above, among individuals using opioids, naltrexone hydrochloride may cause serious withdrawal reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Reported Adverse Events

Naltrexone hydrochloride has not been shown to cause significant increases in complaints in placebo-controlled trials in patients known to be free of opioids for more than 7 to 10 days. Studies in alcoholic populations and in volunteers in clinical pharmacology studies have suggested that a small fraction of patients may experience an opioid withdrawal-like symptom complex consisting of tearfulness, mild nausea, abdominal cramps, restlessness, bone or joint pain, myalgia, and nasal symptoms. This may represent the unmasking of occult opioid use, or it may represent symptoms attributable to naltrexone. A number of alternative dosing patterns have been recommended to try to reduce the frequency of these complaints.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a duration of naltrexone treatment. Decide on the duration depending on the clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. Recognize that naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^f6750737]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Current options

Medications with three mechanisms are currently approved for the treatment of alcohol addiction by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The oldest, the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram, remains most widely used. Its mechanism of action is peripheral, and cannot alleviate craving or other subjective states associated with alcoholism. Its use is associated with low compliance, and does not have support for significant efficacy unless administered under supervision. Disulfiram continues to have a place in clinical practice when sobriety needs to be ensured for some time, for instance to diagnose psychiatric co-morbidity. It is otherwise of limited interest for the present discussion.

Proof-of-principle for a neuropharmacological intervention in alcohol addiction was first provided by the mu-preferring opioid antagonist naltrexone –. Opioid peptides with activity at mu-receptors are released by alcohol intake, and contribute to alcohol reward –. Naltrexone is thought to interfere with this cascade. The overall effect size of naltrexone is modest, but this represents an average of a heterogeneous response, that varies strongly as a function of individual patient characteristics. Among these characteristics, predictors of clinical response include a family history of alcohol problems, early onset of problem drinking, being male, experiencing strong alcohol reward-related memories or cravings, and complying with treatment. The role of compliance can be viewed in light of extensive empirical data in support of the notion that opioid transmission plays a key role for the "liking" of natural rewards. Based on these findings, it can be hypothesized that naltrexone has a potential to attenuate healthy rewards, and that this limits the incentive to seek and comply with this treatment. A depot formulation of naltrexone was developed to improve compliance, but high cost limits its use. Another opioid antagonist approved for alcoholism treatment in Europe, nalmefene, shares its main mechanism of action with naltrexone, making major differences in clinical profile unlikely.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^2edf5dd4]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Alcohol — management of unhealthy alcohol use in people with HIV: Ongoing alcohol use is not a contraindication for a person to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), but treatment for unhealthy alcohol use may improve HIV treatment outcomes. Behavioral treatments for unhealthy alcohol use among people with HIV demonstrate a small but significant reduction in alcohol use. Pharmacotherapy also can reduce alcohol use among people with HIV, and the FDA has approved three pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD): naltrexone, disulfiram, and acamprosate. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone in reducing the number of heavy drinking days among those with HIV, naltrexone appears to be safe to use in people with HIV and is not associated with significant drug–drug interactions or irreversible hepatotoxicity, but it is not recommended for individuals with decompensated liver disease and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated transaminase levels. Use of naltrexone in people with HIV and AUD can improve HIV treatment outcomes.

Indications and Usage

Treatment with naltrexone implants should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychological and psychosocial support.

Naltrexone tablets were initially approved by the FDA in 1985 for the treatment of abuse and addiction of opioids.

Naltrexone in oral and extended release injection forms have been approved by the FDA for the treatment and abuse of alcohol.

Naltrexone implants may be useful for the treatment of alcohol or opioid dependence in patients who are able to abstain from opioid or alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment.

Patients should not be actively drinking or be on any opioids at the time of initial naltrexone implant administration.

### Efficacy and tolerability of long-acting injectable naltrexone for alcohol dependence: a randomized controlled trial [^8be5f48a]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Alcohol dependence is a common disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has been shown to be effective for treatment of alcohol dependence. However, adherence to daily oral pharmacotherapy can be problematic, and clinical acceptance and utility of oral naltrexone have been limited.

Objective

To determine efficacy and tolerability of a long-acting intramuscular formulation of naltrexone for treatment of alcohol-dependent patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between February 2002 and September 2003 at 24 US public hospitals, private and Veterans Administration clinics, and tertiary care medical centers. Of the 899 individuals screened, 627 who were diagnosed as being actively drinking alcohol-dependent adults were randomized to receive treatment and 624 received at least 1 injection.

Intervention

An intramuscular injection of 380 mg of long-acting naltrexone (n = 205) or 190 mg of long-acting naltrexone (n = 210) or a matching volume of placebo (n = 209) each administered monthly and combined with 12 sessions of low-intensity psychosocial intervention.

Main Outcome Measure

The event rate of heavy drinking days in the intent-to-treat population.

Results

Compared with placebo, 380 mg of long-acting naltrexone resulted in a 25% decrease in the event rate of heavy drinking days (P = 0.02) and 190 mg of naltrexone resulted in a 17% decrease (P = 0.07). Sex and pretreatment abstinence each showed significant interaction with the medication group on treatment outcome, with men and those with lead-in abstinence both exhibiting greater treatment effects. Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 14.1% in the 380-mg and 6.7% in the 190-mg group and 6.7% in the placebo group. Overall, rate and time to treatment discontinuation were similar among treatment groups.

Conclusions

Long-acting naltrexone was well tolerated and resulted in reductions in heavy drinking among treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent patients during 6 months of therapy. These data indicate that long-acting naltrexone can be of benefit in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^8b65dcce]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatic and Renal Impairment

Naltrexone appears to have extra-hepatic sites of drug metabolism and its major metabolite undergoes active tubular secretion (see Metabolism above). Adequate studies of naltrexone in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment have not been conducted (see PRECAUTIONS, Special Risk Patients).

Alcoholism

The efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an aid to the treatment of alcoholism was tested in placebo-controlled, outpatient, double blind trials. These studies used a dose of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for 12 weeks as an adjunct to social and psychotherapeutic methods when given under conditions that enhanced patient compliance. Patients with psychosis, dementia, and secondary psychiatric diagnoses were excluded from these studies.

In one of these studies, 104 alcohol-dependent patients were randomized to receive either naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily or placebo. In this study, naltrexone hydrochloride proved superior to placebo in measures of drinking including abstention rates (51% vs. 23%), number of drinking days, and relapse (31% vs. 60%). In a second study with 82 alcohol-dependent patients, the group of patients receiving naltrexone hydrochloride were shown to have lower relapse rates (21% vs. 41%), less alcohol craving, and fewer drinking days compared with patients who received placebo, but these results depended on the specific analysis used.

The clinical use of naltrexone hydrochloride as adjunctive pharmacotherapy for the treatment of alcoholism was also evaluated in a multicenter safety study. This study of 865 individuals with alcoholism included patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions, concomitant medications, polysubstance abuse and HIV disease. Results of this study demonstrated that the side effect profile of naltrexone hydrochloride appears to be similar in both alcoholic and opioid dependent populations, and that serious side effects are uncommon.

In the clinical studies, treatment with naltrexone supported abstinence, prevented relapse and decreased alcohol consumption. In the uncontrolled study, the patterns of abstinence and relapse were similar to those observed in the controlled studies. Naltrexone hydrochloride was not uniformly helpful to all patients, and the expected effect of the drug is a modest improvement in the outcome of conventional treatment.

### Antagonist models for treating persons with substance use disorders [^5ed78ae9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This paper provides an overview on the status of antagonist models for treating patients with substance use disorders. It begins with an overview describing the ambivalence about stopping or not stopping substance use and how antagonist approaches, combined with psychosocial treatment, are aimed to address it. It then goes on to review data on disulfiram and acamprosate treatment of alcohol dependence and naltrexone treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence. The superior results achieved by extended release formulations are emphasized. The mixed findings on naltrexone treatment for amphetamine dependence are presented and the chapter ends with a brief review of vaccine development for treatment of substance use disorders. Overall conclusions are that the strongest treatment effects are with extended release naltrexone with opioid dependence. Disulfiram treatment of alcohol dependence also has strong effects but is not widely used due to low levels of patient acceptance and concerns about its potential for serious adverse events. Less robust but clinically meaningful effects are seen with naltrexone or acamprosate treatment of alcohol dependence. Vaccines are a very interesting and promising new development but many challenges and hurdles must be overcome before they are ready for clinical use.

### Efficacy and safety of naltrexone and acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a systematic review [^b97f0b53]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To ascertain the efficacy and safety of naltrexone and acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Methods

Systematic review of the literature (1990–2002) and meta-analysis of full published randomized and controlled clinical trials assessing acamprosate or naltrexone therapy in alcohol dependence. Estimates of effect were calculated according to the fixed-effects model.

Measurements

Relapse and abstinence rates, cumulative abstinence duration and treatment compliance were considered as primary outcomes. Findings Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Acamprosate was associated with a significant improvement in abstinence rate [odds ratio (OR): 1.88 (1.57, 2.25), P < 0.001] and days of cumulative abstinence [WMD: 26.55 (17.56, 36.54]. Short-term administration of naltrexone reduced the relapse rate significantly [OR: 0.62 (0.52, 0.75), P < 0.001], but was not associated with a significant modification in the abstinence rate [OR: 1.26 (0.97,1.64), P = 0.08]. There were insufficient data to ascertain naltrexone's efficacy over more prolonged periods. Acamprosate had a good safety pattern and was associated with a significant improvement in treatment compliance [OR: 1.29 (1.13,1.47), P < 0.001]. Naltrexone's side effects were more numerous, yet the drug was nevertheless tolerated acceptably without being associated with a lower adherence to treatment (OR: 0.94 (0.80, 1.1), P = 0.5). However, overall compliance was relatively low with both medications.

Conclusions

Both acamprosate and naltrexone are effective as adjuvant therapies for alcohol dependence in adults. Acamprosate appears to be especially useful in a therapeutic approach targeted at achieving abstinence, whereas naltrexone seems more indicated in programmes geared to controlled consumption. Both drugs are safe and acceptably tolerated but issues of compliance need to be addressed adequately to assure their usefulness in clinical practice.

### Topiramate versus naltrexone for alcohol use disorder: a genotype-stratified double-blind randomized controlled trial [^84c9bcf4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

There have been no well-controlled and well-powered comparative trials of topiramate with other pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD), such as naltrexone. Moreover, the literature is mixed on the effects of two polymorphisms-rs2832407 (in GRIK1) and rs1799971 (in OPRM1)-on response to topiramate and naltrexone, respectively. The authors sought to examine the comparative effectiveness of topiramate and naltrexone in improving outcomes in AUD and to examine the role of the rs2832407 and rs1799971 polymorphisms, respectively, on response to these medications.

Methods

In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multisite, genotype-stratified (rs2832407 and rs1799971) clinical trial comparing topiramate and naltrexone in treating AUD, 147 patients with AUD were randomly assigned to treatment with topiramate or naltrexone, stratified by genotype (rs2832407*CC and *AC/AA genotypes and rs1799971*AA and *AG/GG genotypes). The predefined primary outcome was number of heavy drinking days per week. Predefined secondary outcomes included standard drinks per drinking day per week, body mass index (BMI), craving, markers of liver injury, mood, and adverse events.

Results

For the number of heavy drinking days per week, there was a near-significant time-by-treatment interaction. For the number of standard drinks per drinking day per week, there was a significant time-by-treatment interaction, which favored topiramate. There were significant time-by-treatment effects, with greater reductions observed with topiramate than naltrexone for BMI, craving, and gamma-glutamyltransferase level. Withdrawal due to side effects occurred in 8% and 5% of the topiramate and naltrexone groups, respectively. Neither polymorphism showed an effect on treatment response.

Conclusions

Topiramate is at least as effective and safe as the first-line medication, naltrexone, in reducing heavy alcohol consumption, and superior in reducing some clinical outcomes. Neither rs2832407 nor rs1799971 had effects on topiramate and naltrexone treatments, respectively.

### Naltrexone (Vivitrol) [^6d187a5f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol Dependence

The efficacy of VIVITROL in the treatment of alcohol dependence was evaluated in a 24-week, placebo-controlled, multi-center, double-blind, randomized trial of alcohol-dependent (DSM-IV criteria) outpatients. Subjects were treated with an injection every 4 weeks of VIVITROL 190 mg, VIVITROL 380 mg or placebo. Oral naltrexone was not administered prior to the initial or subsequent injections of study medication. Psychosocial support was provided to all subjects in addition to medication.

Subjects treated with VIVITROL 380 mg demonstrated a greater reduction in days of heavy drinking than those treated with placebo. Heavy drinking was defined as self-report of 5 or more standard drinks consumed on a given day for male patients and 4 or more drinks for female patients. Among the subset of patients (n = 53, 8% of the total study population) who abstained completely from drinking during the week prior to the first dose of medication, compared with placebo-treated patients, those treated with VIVITROL 380 mg had greater reductions in the number of drinking days and the number of heavy drinking days. In this subset, patients treated with VIVITROL were also more likely than placebo-treated patients to maintain complete abstinence throughout treatment. The same treatment effects were not evident among the subset of patients (n = 571, 92% of the total study population) who were actively drinking at the time of treatment initiation.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^c250da1b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations – treatment options (5–10) — Patients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting, and persons who are regularly using alcohol or other sedatives but do not meet criteria for a specific substance use disorder should be carefully monitored. The prescribing of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with caution in patients who are prescribed methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder, and while combined use increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. Methadone is recommended for patients who may benefit from daily dosing and supervision in an OTP or for those for whom buprenorphine has been used unsuccessfully in an OTP or OBOT setting. Opioid dosing guidelines developed for chronic pain, expressed in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), are not applicable to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders. Regarding naltrexone, oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence; clinicians should reserve its use for patients who have been unable to comply with special adherence techniques (e.g., observed dosing), and extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, adherence issues. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) should be checked regularly to confirm medication adherence and to monitor the prescribing of other controlled substances.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^54fc3a5f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations — naltrexone for opioid use disorder: Extended-release injectable naltrexone is a recommended treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder in patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids, able to give informed consent, and have no contraindications for this treatment. Extended-release injectable naltrexone should generally be administered every 4 weeks by deep IM injection in the gluteal muscle at the dose of 380 mg per injection, and some patients, including those who metabolize naltrexone more rapidly, may benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is not recommended except under limited circumstances. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed, and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs, in conjunction with extended-release naltrexone; a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay naltrexone treatment, and motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. There is no recommended length of treatment with naltrexone, duration depends on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances, and because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms.

### Naltrexone versus acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^862138d2]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy of acamprosate and naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Design

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Three treatment centres in Australia.

Participants

A total of 169 alcohol dependent subjects were given naltrexone (50 mg/day), acamprosate (1998 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks.

Intervention

All subjects were offered manualized compliance therapy, a brief intervention that targets problems that may affect treatment compliance such as ambivalence and misperceptions about medication.

Measurements

Time to the first drink, time to first relapse, drinks per drinking day and cumulative abstinence.

Findings

In intention-to-treat analyses, there were no differences between groups on outcome measures of drinking, craving or biochemical markers. Similarly, analyses of the 94 subjects that completed the study in full and demonstrated 80% compliance, revealed no significant treatment effects. Differential treatment effects were identified after stratification according to scores on the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). A significant beneficial treatment effect on time to first relapse was revealed for subjects with 'no depression' allocated to naltrexone (n = 56; P < 0.01). In addition, a significant beneficial treatment effect was revealed in subjects with 'low dependence' allocated to naltrexone (n = 34; P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The results of this study support the efficacy of naltrexone in the relapse prevention of alcoholism amongst those with low levels of clinical depression and alcohol dependence severity. No effect of acamprosate was found in our sample.

### Combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder [^86db7a72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a mental disorder characterised by a strong desire to consume alcohol and impaired control of alcohol use, with devastating consequences. Many people with AUD do not respond to psychosocial or pharmacological interventions when these are provided alone. Combining these interventions may improve the response to treatment, though evidence remains limited.

Objectives

To assess the effects of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for the treatment of AUD in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in November 2023, without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions versus pharmacological or psychosocial interventions alone, or no intervention/treatment as usual (TAU), in adults with AUD. Our primary outcomes were continuous abstinent participants, frequency of use (measured as heavy drinkers, percentages of abstinent days, heavy-drinking days), amount of use (number of drinks per drinking day), adverse events, serious adverse events, dropouts from treatment, and dropouts due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool, performed random-effects meta-analyses, and evaluated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 21 RCTs (4746 participants). The most studied pharmacological and psychosocial interventions were naltrexone (81.0%) and cognitive behavioural therapy (66.7%), respectively. Most participants were men (74%), aged about 44 years, with AUD, without comorbid mental disorders or other substance use disorders; 15 RCTs detoxified participants before treatment. We judged 28.5% of the studies as at low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, performance bias for objective and subjective outcomes, and detection bias for subjective outcomes; all studies were at low risk of detection bias for objective outcomes; 85.7% of studies were at low risk of attrition bias; 14.2% of studies were at low risk of reporting bias. 1) Compared to psychosocial intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions probably reduce the number of heavy drinkers (above the clinically meaningful threshold (MID) of 2%; absolute difference (AD) -10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18% to -2%; risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97; 8 studies, 1609 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may increase continuous abstinent participants (MID 5%; AD 5%, 95% CI 1% to 11%; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34; 6 studies, 1184 participants; low-certainty evidence). They probably have little to no effect on:

- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; mean difference (MD) 4.16, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.08; 10 studies, 2227 participants);
- serious adverse events (MID 1%; AD -2%, 95% CI -3% to 0%; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.12; 4 studies; 524 participants);
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD -3%, 95% CI -5% to 0%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01; 15 studies, 3021 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD 2%, 95% CI 0% to 5%; RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.52; 8 studies, 1572 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence). They may have little to no effect on:

- heavy-drinking days (MID 5%; MD -3.49, 95% CI -8.68 to 1.70; 4 studies, 470 participants);
- number of drinks per drinking day (MID 1 drink; MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.01; 7 studies, 805 participants); and
- adverse events (MID 30%; AD 17%, 95% CI -5% to 46%; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.68; 4 studies, 508 participants) (all low-certainty evidence). 2) Compared to pharmacological intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on:

- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; MD -1.18, 95% CI -4.42 to 2.07; 2 studies, 1158 participants); and
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD 1%, 95% CI -10 to 14%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.47; 3 studies, 1246 participants) (all low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about their effect on:

- continuous abstinent participants (MID 5%; AD 3%, 95% CI -5% to 18%; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.40; 1 study, 241 participants);
- the number of heavy drinkers (MID 2%; AD 2%, 95% CI -4% to 8%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 1 study, 917 participants);
- the number of drinks per drinking day (MID 1 drink; MD -2.40, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.82; 1 study, 241 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD -1%, 95% CI -3% to 6%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.72; 2 studies, 1165 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). 3) We are uncertain about the effect of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, when compared to TAU, on:

- the number of heavy drinkers (MID 2%; AD -5%, 95% CI -13% to 2%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03; 1 study, 616 participants);
- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; MD 3.43, 95% CI -1.32 to 8.18; 1 study, 616 participants);
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD 0%, 95% CI -10% to 15%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.65; 2 studies, 696 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD 3%, 95% CI 0% to 15%; RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 12.67; 1 study, 616 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, downgraded mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

As implications for practice, our findings indicate that adding pharmacological to psychosocial interventions is safe and helps people with AUD recover. These conclusions are based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence. Given the few studies and very low-certainty evidence, any benefits of adding psychosocial to pharmacological interventions or comparing the combined intervention to TAU are less clear. As implications for research, further studies should investigate the effects of the combined intervention compared to pharmacotherapy or TAU.

Naltrexone use and modality preferences: Benefits and harms are described as balanced with "few side effects and adverse outcomes with naltrexone". Patients "should be abstinent from opioid use within the prior 7–10 days", potentially longer with long-acting opioids. Injectable naltrexone "may be preferred when adherence to oral naltrexone is a concern", but some patients may not want a monthly injection and limited clinic access or financial resources may favor oral naltrexone. The Work Group "decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation".

Naltrexone — indications, dosing, and formulation considerations: "Extended-release injectable naltrexone, administered every 3–4 weeks, is recommended for patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids for preventing relapse in opioid use disorder". Naltrexone "is an opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids" and "causes immediate withdrawal symptoms (precipitated withdrawal) in a person with active physical dependence on opioids". The text notes oral naltrexone often lacks effectiveness and "was not found to be superior to placebo or to no pharmacological treatments" for retention or illicit opioid use; "Oral naltrexone should only be used under limited circumstances", and "studies suggest that adherence to extended-release naltrexone is lower than that of buprenorphine".

### A step forward in the treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence… [^4f7eb687]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dr. Sara Roach: Welcome to "Q&A with FDA, " from the FDA's Division of Drug Information where we aim to answer some of the most frequently asked questions that we've received from the public. I'm Dr. Sara Roach, and today's topic is the recent first generic approval to Vivitrol, a one-month extended-release injectable naltrexone that is used to help people recovering from opioid or alcohol dependence. Over 140, 000 Americans die from the effects of alcohol in an average year. Ten percent of Americans over the age of 12 have Alcohol Use Disorder. And according to the 2023 Alcohol Abuse Statistics, 60% of Americans increased their alcohol consumption during COVID-19 lockdowns. Dr. Roach: These numbers are quite significant, so I'm glad we're discussing this important public health issue. Could you tell me more about the FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Dr.

Sokolowska: For most patients treated with medication for alcohol use disorder, the decision to begin oral versus injectable naltrexone is based on patient's preference, but injectable naltrexone may be more effective in ensuring adherence. Pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder has been focused on altering the reinforcing effects of alcohol use. Naltrexone is available as an oral medication but also as the extended-release injectable product, Vivitrol, which has been approved since 2006. Dr. Roach: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients who are able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment with the long-acting naltrexone injectable product. In addition, this medication is approved for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification, and should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support. Dr.

Sokolowska: Yes, it's important because naltrexone is a treatment option for either disorder and is long acting. And by virtue of increasing the availability of generic drugs, it helps to create competition in the marketplace, which then helps to make treatment more affordable, increasing access to healthcare for more patients. Once-a-month extended-release injection reduces the dose frequency and therefore may be advantageous in helping ensure patients' compliance, which is crucial to reduce potential relapse.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c6a9f3de]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This review was limited to studies of oral naltrexone, excluding studies involving current or prior opioid addiction or use. Our assessment of SAEs by disease group should only be considered as exploratory because classifying the populations into specific disease groups was not clear-cut owing to the predominance of AUDs even in studies of other disorders.

While the primary aim of this study was to examine SAE data from RCTs, we did examine AEs in a secondary analysis, but this analysis was based on limited data identified in the journal publication and the registry report. Previous evidence has also shown that the assessment and reporting of AEs is often inconsistent and incomplete across the studies. For example, a large safety review of 44 studies of naltrexone for AUDs found that AEs were often not collected using standardised measures, that the methods for systematically capturing AEs were often not reported, and the reporting of AEs was highly selective.

Recording of AEs can be hampered by the presence of nocebo (harmful) effects (i.e. worsening symptoms during placebo treatment), which can vary disease by disease. Particularly in alcohol and drug addiction, placebo and nocebo mechanisms could impact on the therapeutic outcomes and side effects of treatments. Although less likely in the recording of SAEs owing to their seriousness, this may have also impacted our results.

Finally, a few refinements to the protocol were necessary, but these occurred as recommended before any data collection occurred. The main change was the exclusion of laboratory-based studies, studies of less than 4 weeks duration and cross-over studies from the review. The initial scoping exercise had not revealed the large numbers of such studies and attempting an analysis of all these would have exceeded available resources.

Comparison with the existing literature

To our knowledge, this is the first large systematic review of SAEs in people taking naltrexone, excluding only those people taking opioids. Two large previous systematic reviews of naltrexone in AUDs were conducted by Rösner et al. for the Cochrane Collaboration and Jonas et al. for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Both examined AEs, but in fewer studies. Rösner et al. analysed nine studies including two using injectable naltrexone, and calculated the RD of experiencing SAEs as −0.02 (95% CI −0.05–0.00). By using a wider range of studies and inclusion criteria and limiting the publication dates after the 1 st of January 2001, this review was able to provide a more accurate assessment of the risk of SAEs than any previous review.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^7e8f1424]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal

The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Symptoms of withdrawal have usually appeared within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone hydrochloride and have lasted for up to 48 hours. Mental status changes including confusion, somnolence and visual hallucinations have occurred. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea have required intravenous fluid administration. Review of postmarketing cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, management in the intensive care unit.

To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

### Baclofen for alcohol use disorder [^ca513a33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most widespread psychiatric disorders leading to detrimental consequences to people with this disorder and others. Worldwide, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (30-day prevalence of at least one occasion of 60 g of pure alcohol intake among current drinkers) is estimated at 20% and the prevalence of AUD at 5% of the adult general population, with highest prevalence in Europe and North America. Therapeutic approaches, including pharmacotherapy, play an important role in treating people with AUD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of baclofen on achieving and maintaining abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption in people with AUD compared to placebo, no treatment or any other pharmacological relapse prevention treatment.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 22 November 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' treatment duration and 12 weeks' overall study duration comparing baclofen for AUD treatment with placebo, no treatment or other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. relapse, 2. frequency of use, 3. amount of use, 4. adverse events, 5. dropouts from treatment and 6. dropouts from treatment due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 7. craving, 8. anxiety, 9. depression and 10. frequency of most relevant adverse events.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs (1818 participants) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition or International Classification of Diseases 10th edition criteria. Mean age was 46.5 years and 70% were men. Ten studies compared baclofen to placebo or another medication; seven compared two baclofen doses to placebo or another medication. Globally, 15 studies compared baclofen to placebo, two baclofen to acamprosate and two baclofen to naltrexone. In 16 studies, participants received psychosocial treatments. We judged most studies at low risk of selection, performance, detection (subjective outcome), attrition and reporting bias. Ten studies detoxified participants before treatment; in seven studies, participants were still drinking at the beginning of treatment. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for 15 RCTs and longer in two studies. Baclofen daily dose was 30 mg to 300 mg: 10 RCTs used low doses (30 mg or less); eight RCTs medium doses (above 30 and 100 mg or less) and four RCTs high doses (above 100 mg). Compared to placebo, moderate-certainty evidence found that baclofen probably decreases the risk to relapse (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.99; 12 studies, 1057 participants). This result was confirmed among detoxified participants but not among other subgroups of participants. High-certainty evidence found that baclofen increases the percentage of days abstinent (mean difference (MD) 9.07, 95% CI 3.30 to 14.85; 16 studies, 1273 participants). This result was confirmed among all subgroups of participants except non-detoxified or those who received medium doses. There was no difference between baclofen and placebo in the other primary outcomes: heavy drinking days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.18, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.11; 13 studies, 840 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); number of drinks per drinking days (MD -0.45, 95% CI -1.20 to 0.30; 9 studies, 392 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.11; 10 studies, 738 participants; high-certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; 17 studies, 1563 participants; high-certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 16 studies, 1499 participants; high-certainty evidence). These results were confirmed by subgroup analyses except than for the dropouts that resulted lower among participants who received high doses of baclofen and studies longer than 12 weeks. Compared to placebo, there was no difference in craving (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.04; 17 studies, 1275 participants), anxiety (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.11; 15 studies, 1123 participants) and depression (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.27; 11 studies, 1029 participants). Concerning the specific adverse events, baclofen increases fatigue, dizziness, somnolence/sedation, dry mouth, paraesthesia and muscle spasms/rigidity. There was no difference in the other adverse events. Compared to acamprosate, one study (60 participants) found no differences in any outcomes but the evidence was very uncertain: relapse (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; very low-certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.69; very low-certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.46; very low-certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low-certainty evidence) and craving (MD 5.80, 95% CI -11.84 to 23.44); and all the adverse events evaluated. Compared to naltrexone, baclofen may increase the risk of relapse (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.56; 1 study, 60 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and decrease the number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (60 participants) found no difference between baclofen and naltrexone in the dropouts at the end of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; very low-certainty evidence), craving (MD 2.08, 95% CI -3.71 to 7.87), and all the adverse events evaluated.

Authors' Conclusions

Baclofen likely reduces the risk of relapse to any drinking and increases the percentage of abstinent days, mainly among detoxified participants. It does not increase the number of participants with at least one adverse event, those who dropout for any reason or due to adverse events. It probably does not reduce number of heavy drinking days and the number of drinks per drinking days. Current evidence suggests that baclofen may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence. The results of comparisons of baclofen with acamprosate and naltrexone were mainly based on only one study.

### Follow-up and reasons for extended-release naltrexone discontinuation for alcohol use disorder after hospital initiation [^ec82f4af]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Only 1.9% of the individuals in the USA with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive medication for AUD. Hospitalisation presents an opportunity to identify patients with AUD and offer treatment. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for AUD that reduces drinking days and heavy drinking days. XR-NTX can reduce healthcare costs, decrease acute care utilisation and increase retention in treatment. We offered and initiated XR-NTX during hospitalisation to patients with moderate-to-severe AUD. We describe the follow-up rates for XR-NTX after hospital initiation and the reasons for XR-NTX discontinuation in the outpatient setting after hospital initiation. We performed a retrospective chart review of 62 hospitalised patients with moderate-to-severe AUD who received XR-NTX between 1 November 2019 and 31 December 2020. Twenty-two patients (35.5%) received ≥ 1dose of XR-NTX within the first 3 months of discharge, 22 (35.5%) stopped XR-NTX and 18 (29.0%) did not follow-up. Overall, 44 (71.0%) patients followed up after discharge. Among those that discontinued XR-NTX, the most common reasons were: (1) a preference for oral NTX; (2) clinicians switching patients to oral NTX after patients missed an XR-NTX dose; (3) clinician challenges in prescribing XR-NTX; and (4) patient obstacles to accessing outpatient care. Our study highlights several opportunities to address modifiable reasons to improve access to and retention in XR-NTX treatment.

### Follow-up and reasons for extended-release naltrexone discontinuation for alcohol use disorder after hospital initiation [^e92b1e40]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Only 1.9% of the 28.9 million individuals in the USA with alcohol use disorder (AUD) received AUD pharmacotherapy in the past year. This is a large treatment gap given the 178 307 individuals who die yearly of complications from unhealthy alcohol use. With the increasing prevalence and morbidity related to AUD, hospitalisations for AUD have also increased. Thus, hospitalisation presents an opportunity to identify patients with AUD and offer treatment.

Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for AUD that reduces drinking days and heavy drinking days.XR-NTX decreases healthcare costs and acute care utilisation, and increases retention in treatment. Compared with oral naltrexone (NTX), XR-NTX adherence may be higher. It may not face some of the challenges of oral NTX including: a high attrition rate within the first few months of starting treatment, polypharmacy making it difficult to adhere to daily medications and patients preferring a non-daily AUD medication. We offered XR-NTX to hospitalised patients with moderate-to-severe AUD and describe the follow-up rates for XR-NTX after hospital initiation and reasons for XR-NTX discontinuation in the outpatient setting after hospital discharge.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^2a64334b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal management — key definitions and thresholds are outlined to support clinical use. Supportive care is treatment to "prevent, control, or relieve complications and side effects and to improve the patient's comfort, quality of life and safety" and can include "reassurance, orientation, general nursing care, and adherence to safety measures and protocols". The therapeutic window is the "range of drug dose amount needed to maintain therapeutic effect yet avoid adverse events" and is considered when adjusting doses due to patient variability and exposure to other substances. A treatment plan is a therapeutic strategy that may incorporate patient education, drug therapy, and participation of health professionals. Unhealthy alcohol use includes binge drinking defined as "consuming 4 or more alcoholic beverages per occasion for women or 5 or more drinks per occasion for men" and heavy drinking defined as "consuming 8 or more alcoholic beverages per week for women or 15 or more alcoholic beverages per week for men". Withdrawal management refers to the medical and psychological care of patients experiencing withdrawal after ceasing or reducing alcohol use and includes attenuation of withdrawal features and interrupting habitual compulsive use in persons with substance use disorder (SUD).

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^a0afa03a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone (Part 6) — extended-release injectable naltrexone is a recommended treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder in patients who are no longer physically dependent on opioids, able to give informed consent, and have no contraindications. It should generally be administered every 4 weeks by deep IM injection in the gluteal muscle at the set dosage of 380 mg per injection, and some patients may benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is not recommended except under limited circumstances. There is no recommended length of treatment with naltrexone; because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. Transitioning from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine should be planned, considered, and monitored; initial methadone or buprenorphine doses should be low, and transition should not occur until a significant amount of naltrexone is no longer in the system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment in conjunction with extended-release naltrexone, and a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay naltrexone treatment; motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage engagement. Patients who discontinue naltrexone should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of overdose death, if they return to illicit opioid use; treatment alternatives including methadone, buprenorphine, and overdose prevention with naloxone should be discussed.

### Concurrent naltrexone and prolonged exposure therapy for patients with comorbid alcohol dependence and PTSD: a randomized clinical trial [^94d4cb43]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol dependence comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been found to be resistant to treatment. In addition, there is a concern that prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD may exacerbate alcohol use.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of an evidence-based treatment for alcohol dependence (naltrexone) plus an evidence-based treatment for PTSD (prolonged exposure therapy), their combination, and supportive counseling.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A single-blind, randomized clinical trial of 165 participants with PTSD and alcohol dependence conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veterans Administration. Participant enrollment began on February 8, 2001, and ended on June 25, 2009. Data collection was completed on August 12, 2010.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to (1) prolonged exposure therapy plus naltrexone (100 mg/d), (2) prolonged exposure therapy plus pill placebo, (3) supportive counseling plus naltrexone (100 mg/d), or (4) supportive counseling plus pill placebo. Prolonged exposure therapy was composed of 12 weekly 90-minute sessions followed by 6 biweekly sessions. All participants received supportive counseling.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The Timeline Follow-Back Interview and the PTSD Symptom Severity Interview were used to assess the percentage of days drinking alcohol and PTSD severity, respectively, and the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale was used to assess alcohol craving. Independent evaluations occurred prior to treatment (week 0), at posttreatment (week 24), and at 6 months after treatment discontinuation (week 52).

Results

Participants in all 4 treatment groups had large reductions in the percentage of days drinking (mean change, -63.9% [95% CI, -73.6% to -54.2%] for prolonged exposure therapy plus naltrexone; -63.9% [95% CI, -73.9% to -53.8%] for prolonged exposure therapy plus placebo; -69.9% [95% CI, -78.7% to -61.2%] for supportive counseling plus naltrexone; and -61.0% [95% CI, -68.9% to -53.0%] for supportive counseling plus placebo). However, those who received naltrexone had lower percentages of days drinking than those who received placebo (mean difference, 7.93%; P = 0.008). There was also a reduction in PTSD symptoms in all 4 groups, but the main effect of prolonged exposure therapy was not statistically significant. Six months after the end of treatment, participants in all 4 groups had increases in percentage of days drinking. However, those in the prolonged exposure therapy plus naltrexone group had the smallest increases.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study of patients with alcohol dependence and PTSD, naltrexone treatment resulted in a decrease in the percentage of days drinking. Prolonged exposure therapy was not associated with an exacerbation of alcohol use disorder.

Trial Registration

### Emergency department-initiated oral naltrexone for patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder: a pilot feasibility study [^82f8574b]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We also provide data on several important secondary outcomes including alcohol craving and daily alcohol intake. In this study, we found a statistically significant difference in daily cravings but no change in overall alcohol use. This is in sharp contrast to patients receiving injectable naltrexone in the study by Murphy et al.where they observed a decrease of 7.5 drinks per day. Some of this difference may be due to the assessment of alcohol use and the use of an injectable versus oral form of naltrexone. While both studies use self‐reported outcomes and timeline follow‐back methodology, we collected data on alcohol intake daily, using a web‐based survey, which may have led to increased accuracy of reported drinking behavior. Furthermore, while adherence to oral naltrexone was reported as good to excellent in 71% and 80% of patients at 14 and 30 days, respectively, we did not perform formal pill counts to confirm compliance.

While we did not observe a decrease in average daily alcohol consumption, participants did report a significant decrease in average daily alcohol craving. To our knowledge, this is the only ED‐based clinical trial to measure alcohol craving after discharge in a systematic way. While one could argue that a reduction in alcohol craving without a reduction in alcohol intake would not have an impact on alcohol‐related morbidity it is possible that reduced cravings could improve overall quality of life and potentially lead to reductions in alcohol intake over a longer period. While it is not possible to attribute reduced craving to improved patient‐centered outcomes, we did find that study participants had improved quality‐of‐life ratings, reduced anxiety, and reduced depressive symptoms over the study period. There is a strong consensus on the bidirectional effect of alcohol on depression and anxiety, suggesting that improvement of mood disorders could positively influence alcohol use and vice versa. Given the challenges faced by patients with AUD, even modest shifts in mental health could augment success in management of their alcohol use.

Bupropion and naltrexone — implementation and dosing used in studies: The committee noted implementation considerations, including that the available research used relatively high doses of bupropion, specifically 450 mg of an extended-release formulation. For naltrexone, the standard injectable dosing is every four weeks for treatment of AUD and prevention of OUD recurrence; in the open-label trial naltrexone was administered every four weeks, whereas in the RCT it was administered every three weeks to reduce potential blood level.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: a 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^ef86f818]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this 2‐year prolonged follow‐up to a previous 1‐year study of XR‐NTX, the participating opioid‐dependent individuals chose to continue XR‐NTX treatment for median 44 weeks. Opioid use was low during the study. Only 15 participants were identified as a relapse group, while 35 were identified as a no‐relapse group. Use of other illicit substances and alcohol was also low during the study. Throughout the study, participants reported low craving scores and high treatment satisfaction and they would, to a high degree, recommend XR‐NTX to others. When asked why they wanted to discontinue XR‐NTX, the majority of participants stated that they felt strong enough to stay abstinent without XR‐NTX. Only a few non‐serious adverse events were reported during the study.

To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting outcomes from long‐term treatment with XR‐NTX up to 3 years, and the first study focusing on the participants' preferences regarding treatment length.

The average treatment length in our study, 44 weeks in addition to the previous 36 or 48 weeks in the parent study, corresponds well to previous findings on treatment trajectories across various treatment modalities, indicating that opioid‐dependent individuals are more likely to succeed with their treatment goal when the treatment duration is at least 2 years.

Time in treatment did not differ between the identified two subgroups of participants. This finding indicates that preferred treatment time is not necessarily related to whether or not a patient used opioids but may rather be related to other aspects, such as the participants' treatment goal. We would emphasize that relapse to opioid use should not be an exclusion criterion for long‐term XR‐NTX treatment in clinical practice.

### Clinical relevance of nalmefene versus placebo in alcohol treatment: reduction in mortality risk [^5170f61b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

One nalmefene tablet (18 mg) was to be taken on each day when risk of drinking was perceived, preferably 1–2 hours before the anticipated time of drinking. Drinking (daily number of standard drinks) and medication intake throughout the trials were recorded with Timeline Follow-back. Country-specific conversion factors were used to transform drinking into g/day, and patients were provided with a conversion card. In addition to nalmefene or placebo, all participants participated in a motivational and adherence-enhancing intervention (BRENDA,) starting at randomization and at each subsequent site visit. No treatment goal was specified, i.e. abstinence and a reduction in drinking were accepted. Pre-defined primary outcome measures were change from baseline in total alcohol consumption and number of heavy drinking days. A total of 1711 patients were screened, and 1322 patients were randomized to as-needed nalmefene or placebo in the two 6-month RCTs, and 841 patients screened and 675 patients randomized in the 1-year RCT. The majority of these patients had not undergone previous treatment for alcohol dependence or withdrawal symptoms.

Naltrexone — Further research is needed on optimal withdrawal management and initiation protocols to initiate treatment with naltrexone and minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Further research is needed on outcomes related to administering extended-release injectable naltrexone every 3 weeks for individuals who metabolize naltrexone at higher rates. Further research is needed on how to determine the optimal length of treatment with naltrexone for individual patients. Further research is needed on the safety and efficacy of naltrexone for pregnant women. Further research is needed to develop more effective strategies for improving adherence to extended-release injectable naltrexone.

### Efficacy and tolerability of long-acting injectable naltrexone for alcohol dependence… [^6d73041c]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Overall, rate and time to treatment discontinuation were similar among treatment groups. Conclusions Long-acting naltrexone was well tolerated and resulted in reductions in heavy drinking among treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent patients during 6 months of therapy. These data indicate that long-acting naltrexone can be of benefit in the treatment of alcohol dependence. that releases naltrexone for 1 month following a single injection was developed. 30 We conducted a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of 2 dosing levels of this long-acting injectable formulation of naltrexone in combination with a low-intensity psychosocial intervention for treatment of alcohol dependence. effects of naltrexone 190 mg vs placebo and naltrexone 380 mg vs placebo. The analysis was performed on all heavy drinking events between the first treatment and 30 days following the last dose.

In the case of dropouts, last-day drinking data were collected. Analyses of the primary end point were. the large majority of these episodes occurred only during the first month of treatment. Nausea and decreased appetite occurred more frequently in patients treated with long-acting naltrexone 380 mg. The most common injection site reaction was tenderness, occurring after 15. 9% of 380-mg and
13. 6% of 190-mg naltrexone doses and after 17. 6% of 4-mL. naltrexone and 15 for placebo. The most common SAE was hospitalization for alcohol detoxification. Two SAEs in the 380-mg naltrexone group, 13 in the 190-mg naltrexone group, and 11 in the. patients with alcohol dependence.

Treatment effects were influenced by sex and prerandomization abstinence from alcohol. The efficacy of the 380-mg dose was evident within the first month after the initial injection and was maintained over the 24-week treatment period. Naltrexone injections were well tolerated, few serious adverse events were reported, and there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity.

Length of treatment with naltrexone and discontinuation counseling: There is no recommended length of treatment with naltrexone, and available research suggests that longer duration of addiction treatment results in better outcomes; generally, treatment participation for less than 90 days is of limited effectiveness, and treatment lasting significantly longer is associated with more positive long-term outcomes. Patients who discontinue naltrexone treatment should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially overdose death, if they return to illicit opioid use, and alternatives such as methadone, buprenorphine, and overdose prevention with naloxone should be discussed.

### Follow-up and reasons for extended-release naltrexone discontinuation for alcohol use disorder after hospital initiation [^04a9dc90]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Only 1.9% of the individuals in the USA with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive medication for AUD. Hospitalisation presents an opportunity to identify patients with AUD and offer treatment. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for AUD that reduces drinking days and heavy drinking days. XR-NTX can reduce healthcare costs, decrease acute care utilisation and increase retention in treatment. We offered and initiated XR-NTX during hospitalisation to patients with moderate-to-severe AUD. We describe the follow-up rates for XR-NTX after hospital initiation and the reasons for XR-NTX discontinuation in the outpatient setting after hospital initiation. We performed a retrospective chart review of 62 hospitalised patients with moderate-to-severe AUD who received XR-NTX between 1 November 2019 and 31 December 2020. Twenty-two patients (35.5%) received ≥ 1 dose of XR-NTX within the first 3 months of discharge, 22 (35.5%) stopped XR-NTX and 18 (29.0%) did not follow-up. Overall, 44 (71.0%) patients followed up after discharge. Among those that discontinued XR-NTX, the most common reasons were: (1) a preference for oral NTX; (2) clinicians switching patients to oral NTX after patients missed an XR-NTX dose; (3) clinician challenges in prescribing XR-NTX; and (4) patient obstacles to accessing outpatient care. Our study highlights several opportunities to address modifiable reasons to improve access to and retention in XR-NTX treatment.

### Naltrexone and counseling reduce alcohol dependence… [^13c747f8]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Synopsis: Behavioral interventions and at least two medications — naltrexone and acamprosate — are effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Whether combining pharmacotherapy with behavior therapy will improve outcomes is unknown. These investigators randomized 1, 383 adults meeting. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. criteria for alcohol dependence to one of nine groups for 16 weeks of outpatient treatment. Eight of the groups received medical management, a nine-session intervention lasting 20 to 45 minutes that focused on medication compliance and abstinence. Four of these groups also received combined behavioral intervention consisting of up to 20 counseling sessions lasting 50 minutes given by alcohol treatment subspecialists. Patients in all eight groups received naltrexone, acamprosate, placebo, or acamprosate plus naltrexone.

Naltrexone was given once per day, beginning with 25 mg and titrated to 100 mg, as tolerated. Acamprosate 1, 000 mg was administered three times per day. The ninth group received combined behavioral intervention without medications or medical management. All participants underwent assessment regularly for up to one year after enrollment. Those assessing outcomes remained blinded to medication group assignment. Follow-up occurred for 94 percent of patients at 16 weeks and for 82 percent at one year. Serum transferrin protein levels served as a check for self-reported drinking. All analyses were by intention to treat.

During treatment, patients receiving naltrexone plus medical management, combined behavioral intervention plus medical management, or both naltrexone and combined behavioral intervention plus medical management had a significantly higher percentage of abstinent days than those receiving placebos and medical management only. Naltrexone also significantly reduced the risk of heavy drinking days. Bottom Line: Naltrexone and subspecialist delivered combined behavioral intervention are equally effective in the short-term treatment of alcohol dependence. This study found no evidence of effectiveness for acamprosate alone or evidence of incremental effectiveness for combinations of naltrexone, acamprosate, and combined behavioral intervention.

### Comparing topiramate with naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence [^9a8cb497]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy of topiramate with naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Design

The investigation was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study carried out at the University of São Paulo, Brazil.

Sample

A total of 155 patients, 18–60 years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis of alcohol dependence.

Methods

After a 1-week detoxification period, patients were assigned randomly to receive topiramate (induction to 300 mg/day), naltrexone (50 mg/day) or placebo.

Measurements

Time to first relapse (consumption of > 60 g ethyl alcohol), cumulative abstinence duration and weeks of heavy drinking.

Findings

In intention-to-treat analyses, topiramate was statistically superior to placebo on a number of measures including time to first relapse (7.8 versus 5.0 weeks), cumulative abstinence duration (8.2 versus 5.6 weeks), weeks of heavy drinking (3.4 versus 5.9) and percentage of subjects abstinent at 4 weeks (67.3 versus 42.6) and 8 weeks (61.5 versus 31.5), but not 12 weeks (46.2 versus 27.8).

Results

remained significant after controlling for Alcoholics Anonymous attendance, which was higher in topiramate than in other groups. There were no significant differences between naltrexone versus placebo or naltrexone versus topiramate groups, but naltrexone showed trends toward inferior outcomes when compared to topiramate.

Conclusions

The results of this study support the efficacy of topiramate in the relapse prevention of alcoholism. Suggestive evidence was also obtained for superiority of topiramate versus naltrexone, but this needs to be verified in future research with larger sample sizes.

### Vibration of effects from diverse inclusion / exclusion criteria and analytical choices: 9216 different ways to perform an indirect comparison meta-analysis [^5408e685]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes to the initial protocol

As stated a priori in the protocol, we expected that several scenarios would not be feasible, depending on data availability, and some were therefore modified. Although we initially planned to collect only the consumption outcomes to assess VoE (i.e. quantity of alcohol consumed and frequency of drinking), we finally decided to extract abstinence outcomes as well, as many RCTs that assessed the efficacy of naltrexone for post-withdrawal maintenance of abstinence only reported extractable data on abstinence, and not consumption outcomes. Introduction of this new choice made it difficult to impute missing data at the patient level using imputation methods, and we suppressed the analytical scenario for which the meta-analyses were performed with imputed data. We also planned to conduct meta-analyses with all RCTs versus RCTs with treatment durations of 5 months or more. We changed the cut-off to 3 months as there were few RCTs with treatment durations of 5 months or more (especially for naltrexone trials). Furthermore, the impact of the risk of bias on the treatment effect was only assessed for the risk of selective outcome reporting and not the risk of incomplete outcome data, as almost all included RCTs were at high risk of incomplete outcome data. Finally, the VoE was not assessed according to patient age, language of publication, or subgroup analysis on patients with a high risk of drinking, because no RCT including minor patients was included in the study; all studies were published in English, except one (published in Portuguese but still included in the analyses even if only studies in English, French, and Spanish were to be retrieved initially); and no extractable data from the subgroup analyses on patients with a high risk of drinking were identified for the naltrexone studies. As part of the peer review process, we decided to perform a sensitivity analysis excluding meta-analyses with I² > 25% and based on a fixed effect model, because these combinations could be considered inappropriate to do.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^7a79a1e4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy: For patients with moderate-severe alcohol use disorder for whom first-line pharmacotherapy is contraindicated or ineffective, we suggest offering gabapentin (Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed). Evidence cited includes an RCT (n = 150) in which gabapentin with counseling significantly improved abstinence and heavy drinking in DSM-IV alcohol dependence, and another RCT showing that adding gabapentin to oral naltrexone improved drinking outcomes relative to naltrexone alone in the first six weeks after drinking cessation. A multisite RCT of extended-release gabapentin did not demonstrate significant differences in alcohol use or cravings versus placebo, whereas a single-site RCT found reduced alcohol consumption among participants with higher pre-study withdrawal symptom severity, suggesting gabapentin may be more effective in individuals with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The effects of gabapentin likely occur through modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the need for more frequent dosing than once daily may make adherence difficult. The guideline notes increased concerns for misuse with reports of doses higher than prescribed for euphoric effects, but also describes a high margin of safety and potential utility for patients with co-occurring neuropathic pain, some with sleep disorders, and those with clinically significant hepatic disease because it is eliminated renally; overall, the Work Group judged that relative benefits for alcohol outcomes and pain treatment slightly outweighed harms including potential for misuse and central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: a 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^4537189d]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies focusing on the patients' motivation for treatment showed that 50–80% of the participants stated their main treatment goal to be long‐term abstinence from all opioids (including prescribed opioid agonists) and other illicit substances. XR‐NTX could be an adequate alternative for this group of abstinence‐motivated patients.

It has been postulated that longer duration of treatment, in particular treatment lasting more than 2 years, increases the likelihood of attaining patients' treatment goals. An important key for an intervention to be effective is the users' engagement and that treatment is facilitated according to the patients' preferences, needs and goals. However, previous studies of XR‐NTX have not taken into account participants' need or preference for treatment duration. According to the chronic nature of opioid dependence, relapses are frequent and a longer‐term treatment period or subsequent treatment episodes are often necessary before patients manage to achieve their treatment goals. Another aspect is that abstinence achieved during a relatively short period of treatment with XR‐NTX seemed to wane after treatment discontinuation, according to some cohort studies. Thus, there is a need to explore patients' preferences on XR‐NTX treatment duration.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the participants' perceived need and preference to remain in XR‐NTX treatment over time and to assess the efficacy of long‐term treatment. We aimed to explore (1) for how long the participants chose to receive XR‐NTX treatment, (2) the use of opioids, other illicit substances and alcohol, (3) opioid craving, (4) treatment satisfaction and participants' willingness to recommend XR‐NTX treatment to others and (5) reported adverse events during the time in treatment.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^30ac60e9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part 2: Treatment Options

The choice of available treatment options for addiction involving opioid use should be a shared decision between clinician and patient.

Clinicians should consider the patient's preferences, past treatment history, and treatment setting when deciding between the use of methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use. The treatment setting described as level 1 treatment in the ASAM Criteria may be a general outpatient location such as a clinician's practice site. The setting as described as level 2 in the ASAM Criteria may be an intensive outpatient treatment or partial hospitalization program housed in a specialty addiction treatment facility, a community mental health center, or another setting. The ASAM Criteria describes level 3 or level 4 treatment, respectively, as a residential addiction treatment facility or hospital.

The venue in which treatment is provided is as important as the specific medication selected. Opioid Treatment Programs offer daily supervised dosing of methadone, and increasingly of buprenorphine. In accordance with Federal law (21 CFR §1306.07), office-based opioid treatment (OBOT), which provides medication on a prescribed weekly or monthly basis, is limited to buprenorphine. Naltrexone can be prescribed in any setting by any clinician with the authority to prescribe any medication. Clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and risk of diversion when determining whether opioid treatment program (OTP) or OBOT is most appropriate.

The OBOT may not be suitable for patients with active alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. It may also be unsuitable for persons who are regularly using alcohol or other sedatives, but do not have addiction or a specific substance use disorder related to that class of drugs. The prescribing of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with extreme caution in patients who are prescribed methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder.

Methadone is recommended for patients who may benefit from daily dosing and supervision in an OTP, or for patients for whom buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder has been used unsuccessfully in an OTP or OBOT setting.

Oral naltrexone for the treatment of opioid use disorder is often adversely affected by poor medication adherence. Clinicians should reserve its use for patients who would be able to comply with special techniques to enhance their adherence, for example, observed dosing. Extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, issues with medication adherence.

### Evaluation in alcohol use disorders-insights from the nalmefene experience [^d0e6a721]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

An attrition bias cannot not be ruled out

Attrition is common in alcohol clinical trials and missing data are an important methodological problem. The nalmefene trials were no exception. All three pivotal studies had missing data for more than 35% of the patients. Missing data prevent good-quality intention-to-treat analyses, and can cause biased estimates of the treatment effect. Additionally, there were more withdrawals, including more withdrawals for safety reasons, in the nalmefene group than in the placebo group in the 6-month and 1-year studies. In addition to a possible unblinding of treatment allocation, this exposes these studies to an attrition bias. Additionally, the EMA noted that the differences in treatment effect between nalmefene and placebo, and the reduction in alcohol consumption in terms of reduction in heavy drinking days and total alcohol consumption, were inconsistent across the various sensitivity analyses.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial combining sertraline and naltrexone for treating co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence [^0911a0da]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Empirical evidence has only weakly supported antidepressant treatment for patients with co-occurring depression and alcohol dependence. While some studies have demonstrated that antidepressants reduce depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and alcohol dependence, most studies have not found antidepressant treatment helpful in reducing excessive drinking in these patients. The authors provide results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of combining approved medications for depression (sertraline) and alcohol dependence (naltrexone) in treating patients with both disorders.

Method

A total of 170 depressed alcohol-dependent patients were randomly assigned to receive 14 weeks of treatment with sertraline (200 mg/day [N = 40]), naltrexone (100 mg/day [N = 49]), the combination of sertraline plus naltrexone (N = 42), or double placebo (N = 39) while receiving weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Results

The sertraline plus naltrexone combination produced a higher alcohol abstinence rate (53.7%) and demonstrated a longer delay before relapse to heavy drinking (median delay = 98 days) than the naltrexone (abstinence rate: 21.3%; delay = 29 days), sertraline (abstinence rate: 27.5%; delay = 23 days), and placebo (abstinence rate: 23.1%; delay = 26 days) groups. The number of patients in the medication combination group not depressed by the end of treatment (83.3%) approached significance when compared with patients in the other treatment groups. The serious adverse event rate was 25.9%, with fewer reported with the medication combination (11.9%) than the other treatments.

Conclusions

More depressed alcohol-dependent patients receiving the sertraline plus naltrexone combination achieved abstinence from alcohol, had delayed relapse to heavy drinking, reported fewer serious adverse events, and tended to not be depressed by the end of treatment.

Alcoholism and alcohol abuse rank among the top 3 psychiatric disorders in the United States. These disorders are associated with significant medical and economic consequences. Furthermore, studies consistently show that an investment in addiction treatment leads to overall cost savings for society. Recent work has identified specific effects of alcohol on several neurotransmitter systems, including gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, dopamine, and the opioid receptors. These findings suggest that multiple pharmacologic interventions may be useful for the treatment of alcohol addiction.

Risk of relapse and subsequent opioid overdose is emphasized: patients maintained on naltrexone may have diminished tolerance and may be unaware of increased sensitivity if they stop taking naltrexone; patients who discontinue antagonist therapy should be made aware, because if they stop naltrexone and resume use at doses not reflecting lost tolerance there is risk of opioid overdose, with a similar dynamic after withdrawal management without meaningful follow-up or after dropping out of methadone or buprenorphine treatment.

### Oral vs extended-release injectable naltrexone for hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^552ade81]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study ADOPT was published by Kara M Magane and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Alcohol use disorder. In the ADOPT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of oral naltrexone compared to extended-release injectable naltrexone in hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder? In the ADOPT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ADOPT study, the population was: 248 patients (49 female, 199 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder with recent heavy drinking. The key exclusion criteria were use of long-acting opioids in the past week or short-acting opioids in the past 24 hours; positive urine results for any opioid; planned discharge prescription for opioids; need for opioids for anticipated painful event or surgery in the next 3 months; current suicidality or psychosis; cognitive dysfunction precluding informed consent; acute hepatitis or liver failure; pregnancy or lactation. In the ADOPT study, the interventions were: n = 125 oral naltrexone (at a dose of 25 mg/day for 3 days, then 50 mg/day with titration to potential maximum of 100 mg/day) n = 123 extended-release injectable naltrexone (at a dose of 380 mg IM on day of hospital discharge with second and third doses 1 and 2 months later). In the ADOPT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in reduction in heavy drinking days in the past 30 days at 3-month follow-up (38.4% vs. 46.4%; MD -8.17, 95% CI -18.97 to 2.62). In the ADOPT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean Short Inventory of Problems Revision 2 alcohol-related problem score (13.6 points vs. 15 points; MD -1.48, 95% CI -4.9 to 1.93). In the ADOPT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the ADOPT study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder with recent heavy drinking, oral naltrexone was equivalent to extended-release injectable naltrexone with respect to reduction in heavy drinking days in the past 30 days at 3-month follow-up.

Part 6: Naltrexone

Naltrexone is a recommended treatment in preventing relapse in opioid use disorder. Oral formula naltrexone may be considered for patients in whom adherence can be supervised. Extended-release injectable naltrexone may be more suitable for patients who have issues with adherence.

Oral naltrexone should be taken daily in 50-mg doses, or three times weekly in two 100-mg doses followed by one 150-mg dose.

Extended-release injectable naltrexone should be administered every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection in the gluteal muscle at a set dosage of 380 mg per injection.

Psychosocial treatment is recommended in conjunction with treatment with oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone.

There is no recommended length of treatment with oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone. Duration depends on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. Because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms.

Switching from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine should be planned, considered, and monitored. Switching from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than switching from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Patients being switched from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids, and thus the initial doses of methadone or buprenorphine used may be less than one would use in a patient currently physically dependent on opioids. Patients should not be switched until a significant amount of the naltrexone is no longer in their system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 30 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone.

Patients who discontinue antagonist therapy and resume opioid use should be made aware of the increased risks associated with an opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Methods and materials

In this report we used participants with a high or very high drinking risk level (DRL, as defined by WHO;) at both the screening visit (covering drinking in the prior 4 weeks) and the randomization visit, which corresponds to the population indicated for the use of nalmefene (resulting in n = 641 from 6-months RCTs and n = 183 from the 1-year RCT with at least one valid post-randomization assessment of drinking). In addition to abstinence, the following DRLs were used for patient assessment throughout the RCTs: 1–20 g pure alcohol per day, > 20–40 g, > 40–60 g, > 60 g (women); 1–40 g, > 40–60 g, > 60–100 g, > 100 g (men) for low, medium, high, and very high risk, respectively (from). Abstinence or low DRL were defined as a reduced drinking at the end of each trial. Missing values were handled using the last observation carried forward for the main analyses (Scenarios I and II). In sensitivity analyses, a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) was used. Data from the RCTs are displayed in Tables 1 and 2.

Naltrexone initiation requires adequate opioid withdrawal to avoid precipitated withdrawal: before administering, the patient should be adequately withdrawn and no longer physically dependent; as a general rule, patients should be free from short-acting opioids for about 6 days and from long-acting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine for 7–10 days; if uncertain, a naloxone challenge can be used in which naloxone hydrochloride 0.4 mg is administered and the patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of withdrawal, with a low-dose oral naltrexone challenge noted as an alternative.

### Improving the utilisation of medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder at discharge [^f09831e9]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder, a constellation of behaviours and symptoms related to dependence and abuse, was present in 11.0% of US adults in 2020. Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of death and healthcare expenditures in the USA, accounting for 1 in 10 deathsand an average of 29 years of life lost per death. Economically, alcohol use is estimated to cost around US$249 billion annually in lost productivity, healthcare expenditures and social costs.

MAT is an approach to substance use disorders that combines medication with behavioural interventions. Currently, there are three United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the treatment of alcohol use disorder: naltrexone (available oral and as long-acting injectable), acamprosate and disulfiram. Naltrexone is an opiate antagonist that is well tolerated, with reported effects of reduced cravings, reduced relapse rates and an overall decrease in alcohol use. It is estimated to reduce the risk of return to heavy drinking by 17% and trended towards abstinence. Acamprosate's mechanism is still unknown but it has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of any drinking by 14% and maintain abstinence drinking.

MAT remains underused nationally as only 1.1% of adults with alcohol use disorder reported receiving MAT in 2020. While many patients may refuse medication, a survey of outpatient providers noted lack of comfort and knowledge as the most common reasons for avoiding pharmacotherapy. An educational intervention combined with a new discharge protocol at a tertiary medical centre showed a significant increase in naltrexone prescriptions and reduced all-cause emergency department visits and inpatient readmissions.

### Emergency department-initiated oral naltrexone for patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder: a pilot feasibility study [^f3c3d934]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most common substance use disorder in the United States. Despite availability of four FDA-approved medications, fewer than 10% of patients are prescribed medication. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and feasibility of emergency department (ED)-initiated oral naltrexone in patients with moderate to severe AUD.

Methods

This was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, nonrandomized clinical trial conducted a single ED. Consenting participants were adults with moderate to severe AUD who were provided a single 50-mg dose of oral naltrexone, a 14-day starter pack of naltrexone, and referral for treatment. Follow-up was conducted at 14 and 30days post-ED visit. The primary outcome was engagement in formal addiction treatment. Secondary outcomes included alcohol consumption, craving, quality-of-life measures, satisfaction, and safety.

Results

Of 761 patients screened, 21 enrolled and received at least one dose of naltrexone. At 14days, 29% were engaged in treatment, increasing to 33% at 30days. There was a decrease in the mean (± SD) number of drinks per day from 5.20 (± 4.67) at baseline to 2.23 (± 4.35) during the follow-up period (p = 0.078). There was a decrease in alcohol craving scores, with median scores dropping from 19 at baseline to 8.27 during the follow-up period (p < 0.001). Quality-of-life measures improved, with a statistically significant increase in the reported number of healthy days (p = 0.006) and decrease in depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). Reported side effects were mild and satisfaction with the screening process was high.

Conclusions

ED-initiated oral naltrexone is feasible and acceptable for patients with moderate to severe AUD. While engagement in treatment was moderate, significant reductions in alcohol craving and improvements in quality of life suggest potential benefits. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings.

Abstract

Objectives

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most common substance use disorder in the United States. Despite availability of four FDA‐approved medications, fewer than 10% of patients are prescribed medication. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and feasibility of emergency department (ED)‐initiated oral naltrexone in patients with moderate to severe AUD.

Methods

This was a prospective, single‐arm, open‐label, nonrandomized clinical trial conducted a single ED. Consenting participants were adults with moderate to severe AUD who were provided a single 50‐mg dose of oral naltrexone, a 14‐day starter pack of naltrexone, and referral for treatment. Follow‐up was conducted at 14 and 30 days post–ED visit. The primary outcome was engagement in formal addiction treatment. Secondary outcomes included alcohol consumption, craving, quality‐of‐life measures, satisfaction, and safety.

Results

Of 761 patients screened, 21 enrolled and received at least one dose of naltrexone. At 14 days, 29% were engaged in treatment, increasing to 33% at 30 days. There was a decrease in the mean (± SD) number of drinks per day from 5.20 (± 4.67) at baseline to 2.23 (± 4.35) during the follow‐up period (p = 0.078). There was a decrease in alcohol craving scores, with median scores dropping from 19 at baseline to 8.27 during the follow‐up period (p < 0.001). Quality‐of‐life measures improved, with a statistically significant increase in the reported number of healthy days (p = 0.006) and decrease in depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). Reported side effects were mild and satisfaction with the screening process was high.

Conclusions

ED‐initiated oral naltrexone is feasible and acceptable for patients with moderate to severe AUD. While engagement in treatment was moderate, significant reductions in alcohol craving and improvements in quality of life suggest potential benefits. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^c35652f7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder — naltrexone formulations and selection are described as follows: "Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist available for once-daily oral administration and in an extended-release suspension for once-monthly intramuscular injection". Evidence indicates benefit since "A multi-center RCT by Anton et al. (2006) (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions [COMBINE]) and an SR and meta-analysis by Jonas et al. (2014) found naltrexone improves alcohol consumption outcomes… in patients with AUD". Regarding formulation comparisons, "The two formulations have not been directly compared to evaluate whether the long-acting injectable formulation improves clinical outcomes". Use considerations specify that "injectable naltrexone should be considered when medication adherence is a significant concern and the patient is agreeable to receive monthly injections by a provider", and that "Naltrexone injection must be stored under refrigeration, so distribution to Service Members deployed to remote locations may be problematic". Trial data further state, "In a 9-arm trial, Anton et al. (2006) compared oral naltrexone and/or acamprosate to double placebo on a platform of addiction-focused medical management with or without a combined behavioral intervention (CBI)", and "They found that patients receiving addiction-focused medical management with naltrexone, CBI, or both fared better on drinking outcomes than those receiving acamprosate or double placebo".

Topiramate and naltrexone — alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy — are supported for reducing alcohol consumption outcomes with distinct tolerability and implementation considerations. While topiramate is not approved for AUD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is recommended because of the moderate quality evidence for a significant reduction in heavy drinking and promotion of abstinence, and a pilot RCT in Veterans with AUD and co-occurring PTSD showed benefit associated with topiramate in reducing alcohol consumption, craving, and PTSD symptom severity. Side effects associated with naltrexone tend to be minimal with options for monthly injection or once-daily dosing, whereas topiramate may cause dizziness, negative cognitive effects, or weight loss. Oral naltrexone and topiramate are available as low cost generics, but injectable naltrexone has higher cost and feasibility concerns; topiramate may require multiple visits for adequate titration and tolerability assessment, and naltrexone's opioid blockade effect may preclude use in patients who require opioid pain medications. Despite these minor concerns and given the positive efficacy evidence for these medications, the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation.

c Models analyzing other outcomes use the evaluable population (participants randomized with evaluable outcome data [n = 217]). No other outcomes were imputed if missing.

d The SIP-2R theoretical range is between 0 and 45, with a higher score indicating more alcohol-related consequences.

e High adherence to ER injectable naltrexone was defined as administration of injectable naltrexone by the study nurse 3 times (this adherence measure did not require research follow-up assessment). Medium or low adherence was defined as 1 or 2 injections. For oral naltrexone, high adherence was defined as participant self-report of taking oral naltrexone for 90 of the past 90 days at the 3-month follow-up assessment, and medium or low adherence was defined as participant self-report of taking oral naltrexone for 0 to 89 of the past 90 days at the 3-month follow-up assessment. A total of 232 patients were evaluable for medication adherence.

Alcohol Biomarkers

Phosphatidylethanol of 20 ng/mL or greater was found in 123 of 162 participants (75.9%) who had phosphatidylethanol results at 3-month follow-up, with phosphatidylethanol of 20 ng/mL or greater in 63 of 80 in the oral naltrexone group (78.8%) and 60 of 82 in the extended-release injectable naltrexone group (73.2%) (Table 2). More than three-quarters of those with phosphatidylethanol results (125 of 162 [77.2%]) had phosphatidylethanol values consistent with their self-report of heavy drinking (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). A minority of the sample (35 of 162 [21.6%]) had phosphatidylethanol of 20 ng/mL or greater (a value consistent with averaging 2 to 4 drinks per day for several days per week) while reporting no HDDs at follow-up, suggesting possible underreporting of heavy drinking. In adjusted regression models with treatment arm predicting each alcohol biomarker (phosphatidylethanol, dCDT, and GGT) separately (instead of self-reported percentage of HDDs in the past 30 days), results remained consistent with primary outcome analysis (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).

### Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of acamprosate for the treatment of alcohol dependence: impact of the combined pharmacotherapies and behavior interventions study [^d4417a04]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavior Interventions Study (COMBINE) reported no significant difference between acamprosate and placebo in the treatment of alcohol dependence. To evaluate the impact of COMBINE, we performed a meta-analysis of acamprosate placebo-controlled trials with the inclusion of data from COMBINE. As a secondary analysis, we added the COMBINE data to a recently published meta-analysis of naltrexone placebo-controlled trials.

Methods

A structured literature search of major databases was performed from January 1990 to August 2007 for acamprosate placebo-controlled randomized trials. Mean differences in cumulative abstinent days (CAD) and abstinence rates (AR) from eligible studies were statistically combined to calculate point estimates and 95% CI for differences in CAD and AR.

Results

Ten and 16 studies evaluating CAD and AR, respectively were suitable for statistical pooling. The findings revealed that acamprosate was superior to placebo in the mean number of CAD (P < 0.001) and AR (pooled AR = 1.58; P < 0.001). The pooled AR for naltrexone was also significant indicating a relative benefit over placebo (AR = 1.27; P < 0.001). The COMBINE trial results contributed a weight of less than 15% to the final pooled statistical outcomes for both agents.

Conclusions

The current study confirmed that acamprosate and naltrexone are both effective agents for the treatment of patients with alcohol dependence. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and randomized controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are in the same (highest) level of evidence. Therefore, clinicians should use both these sources of information as their foundation for selecting optimal therapy for patients with alcohol dependence.

### Cravings as a mediator and moderator of drinking outcomes in the COMBINE study [^3dc04ba4]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Investigators of the COMBINE (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions for Alcoholism) study examined whether combining medications with a behavioral intervention would improve outcomes over monotherapies. Unexpectedly, the combination did not offer any advantage over either treatment alone. This study aimed to explain the lack of incremental benefit offered by the combination over either monotherapy by assessing the role of cravings as a treatment mediator and moderator.

Design

Secondary mediation and moderation analyses of COMBINE study data.

Setting

Eleven United States academic sites.

Participants

A total of 863 patients randomized to one of four treatment groups: naltrexone (100 mg/day; n = 209), the combined behavioral intervention (CBI, n = 236), naltrexone and CBI combined (n = 213) and placebo naltrexone (n = 205).

Measurements

Percentage of days abstinent (PDA) measured between 13 and 16 weeks post-baseline. Cravings, the potential mediator/moderator, were measured at baseline, weeks 4 and 12 using the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale.

Findings

Compared with placebo, naltrexone, CBI and the combination all increased PDA by an additional 6–10 percentage points for those with high cravings (P < 0.05 for all three treatment groups). None had significant effects on PDA for those with low cravings. The effects of all three treatments were mediated at least partially by cravings; craving reduction explained 48–53% of treatment effects (P < 0.05 for all three treatment groups). Furthermore, naltrexone appeared to reduce cravings at 4 weeks, while CBI did not reduce cravings until 12 weeks.

Conclusions

The Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions for Alcoholism (COMBINE) naltrexone + CBI combination may not be more beneficial than either monotherapy because craving reduction is a common mechanism of both.
