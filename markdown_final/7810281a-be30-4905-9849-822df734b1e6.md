## Question

Is vitamin K recommended for treating osteopenia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin K supplementation should be recommended for treating osteopenia and how the evidence and guidelines support or refute this practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about current guideline recommendations for fracture prevention that would encompass osteopenia. Then, I should review randomized controlled trial data on vitamin K and bone outcomes. Next, I will contrast this with observational evidence and consider causality. After that, I need to check whether there is any osteopenia-specific evidence distinct from osteoporosis. I should also verify potential harms or interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management approach for osteopenia without relying on vitamin K supplementation, consistent with guidelines.

> Let me first confirm guideline positions, because these typically anchor clinical decisions. The 2023 Canadian Clinical Practice Guideline for osteoporosis and fracture prevention explicitly recommends avoiding supplementation with vitamin K for fracture prevention, both in postmenopausal women and in men, which directly argues against using vitamin K as a therapeutic strategy in low bone mass states such as osteopenia where the clinical goal is fracture risk reduction, not surrogate marker modulation [^111aLwcS] [^1124UKFY].

> Next, I should review randomized trial evidence, and I need to ensure I am weighing clinically relevant endpoints like fractures and site-specific BMD. The RenaKvit RCT in dialysis patients randomized to MK-7 360 µg/day for 2 years found mixed skeletal effects, including accelerated cortical bone loss at the distal radius, preservation at the lumbar spine, and no differences in fractures, underscoring heterogeneity and lack of clinical benefit on hard outcomes in a high-risk subgroup, not to mention potential harm at cortical sites [^113JDaT6] [^111ZwuWQ]. In community-dwelling older adults replete with calcium and vitamin D, 500 µg/day phylloquinone for 3 years did not improve BMD at hip or spine, despite biochemical changes, and the addition of vitamin K1 to D3 plus calcium yielded only a modest ultradistal radius benefit with no hip or spine advantage, which is not a persuasive efficacy signal for fracture prevention strategies in osteopenia [^111CAeMT] [^1174Myto]. Hold on, I should also consider synthesis data: reviews citing 36 RCTs report no effect of vitamin K on vertebral fracture incidence in postmenopausal or osteoporotic populations, further weakening a therapeutic rationale for supplementation [^1177k3C7].

> But wait, what if observational associations suggest benefit that trials failed to capture due to design limitations. Observational studies do link lower vitamin K status to lower BMD and higher fracture risk, including Framingham analyses and dialysis cohorts, yet I need to remind myself that association does not prove benefit from supplementation and may reflect confounding by overall health behaviors or comorbidity burden [^114choqq] [^114eDggS] [^112Ynw4B]. Hmm, wait a minute, even physiologic plausibility about osteocalcin carboxylation is countered by trial nulls, and expert reviews highlight that discrepancies between observational and trial data likely stem from confounding and heterogeneous vitamin K forms and dosing, so I should not over-interpret observational links as therapeutic evidence [^112Q87uV] [^115ttxhJ].

> I need to check whether there is any evidence specific to osteopenia versus overt osteoporosis. Hold on, I should verify that most interventional data target osteoporosis or special populations and not isolated osteopenia. Indeed, the trials and guidelines largely focus on osteoporosis and fracture prevention, with no convincing osteopenia-specific RCTs of vitamin K demonstrating clinically meaningful outcomes, and standard approaches emphasize risk-based treatment thresholds for low bone mass rather than adding unproven supplements [^1124UKFY] [^111CAeMT].

> I should also consider potential harms or unintended effects, even if overt toxicity is uncommon. Let me verify the cortical loss signal: the RenaKvit trial's accelerated distal radius loss raises concern about adverse skeletal effects at cortical sites with MK-7 in certain settings, which cautions against routine use without demonstrated benefit [^113JDaT6]. I need to ensure I flag drug interactions: vitamin K intake can antagonize warfarin's effect, and even modest MK-7 doses can affect anticoagulation control, so indiscriminate supplementation risks destabilizing therapeutic anticoagulation, necessitating careful coordination if a patient is on vitamin K antagonists [^113UYqoE] [^115cx4zc].

> Wait, let me verify the broader supportive care context so I don't leave a therapeutic vacuum. Initially, I was going to say "follow USPSTF to supplement calcium and vitamin D", but hold on, I should double-check: USPSTF actually finds insufficient evidence for routine vitamin D and calcium supplementation for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling postmenopausal women and does not recommend low-dose regimens, so I should correct that and emphasize individualized repletion rather than blanket supplementation [^112noAMp] [^112UMBRj] [^1139wP6g] [^notfound]. Let me reconsider: authoritative endocrine guidance supports ensuring vitamin D sufficiency in patients with osteoporosis or at risk, often targeting 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≥ 30 ng/mL, and ensuring dietary calcium adequacy, with supplementation if intake is insufficient, especially in older adults or those on therapy, which aligns with a "giveth to those who needeth" principle rather than universal dosing [^1113qXWH] [^111V79yZ] [^112TQfAW] [^113UqxEs]. I will now examine nonpharmacologic priorities: weight-bearing and resistance exercise, fall risk mitigation, alcohol and tobacco moderation, and correcting secondary causes are foundational, while pharmacologic therapy is reserved for osteopenia when fracture risk is high by validated tools and guideline thresholds, not for adding vitamin K supplements without proven benefit [^1124UKFY].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly and clinically. Based on high-quality guideline recommendations and the totality of trial evidence, vitamin K supplementation should not be recommended to treat osteopenia, given a lack of consistent BMD or fracture benefit and potential site-specific harm and drug interaction concerns, whereas standard management should focus on risk-based lifestyle and pharmacologic measures with targeted vitamin D and calcium repletion when indicated and evidence-based anti-osteoporotic therapies when fracture risk is high [^111aLwcS] [^1124UKFY] [^113JDaT6] [^1113qXWH].

No, vitamin K is **not indicated** for osteopenia treatment. Current evidence shows **no consistent benefit** of vitamin K supplementation on bone mineral density or fracture risk in osteopenia, and major guidelines do not recommend it for this purpose [^111aLwcS] [^1124UKFY]. Vitamin K may be considered only in confirmed deficiency or malabsorption, not as routine therapy for osteopenia.

---

## Clinical evidence on vitamin K and bone health

### Observational studies

Observational studies link low vitamin K status to lower BMD and higher fracture risk, but these associations **do not establish causality** [^114choqq] [^112Ynw4B].

---

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- RCTs in older adults show vitamin K1 supplementation improves carboxylation of osteocalcin but **does not significantly affect BMD or fracture risk** [^111CAeMT] [^1177k3C7].

- The renaKvit trial in dialysis patients found MK-7 prevented lumbar spine BMD loss but accelerated distal radius BMD loss, with **no overall fracture benefit** [^114vh4BF].

- A meta-analysis of 36 RCTs found **no significant effect** of vitamin K on vertebral fracture incidence in postmenopausal or osteoporotic patients [^1177k3C7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- The 2023 Canadian osteoporosis guideline explicitly **recommends against vitamin K supplementation** for fracture prevention [^111aLwcS].

- The 2023 Osteoporosis Canada guideline similarly **advises against vitamin K** for fracture prevention in men [^1124UKFY].

- **No major guideline endorses** vitamin K supplementation for osteopenia treatment.

---

## Safety considerations and interactions

Vitamin K is generally safe, but high-dose K2 (MK-7) may **interfere with warfarin** and other vitamin K antagonists, requiring careful monitoring [^115cx4zc]. It can also interact with anticoagulants, potentially **altering INR and bleeding risk**.

---

## Comparison with established osteopenia treatments

Compared with established therapies (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide), which have robust evidence for improving BMD and reducing fractures [^114CjqSN] [^111yHpAZ], vitamin K **lacks consistent evidence** for meaningful BMD or fracture benefits in osteopenia.

---

## Specific patient populations

Vitamin K may be considered in confirmed deficiency or malabsorption (e.g. cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease), but **not as routine osteopenia therapy** [^111VwRkW] [^116sfp8G].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

More large, **well-designed RCTs are needed** to clarify vitamin K's role in osteopenia — including optimal forms, doses, and durations — and to identify subgroups (e.g. vitamin K deficiency) that might benefit from supplementation.

---

Vitamin K is **not indicated** for osteopenia treatment due to **insufficient evidence** of benefit. It may be considered only in confirmed deficiency or malabsorption, not as routine therapy.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^113JDaT6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency is highly prevalent in patients on dialysis and may contribute to their low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of fracture. This study investigated the effect of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) supplementation on BMD in patients on chronic dialysis.

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial, 123 patients on chronic dialysis were randomized to receive a daily oral supplement of either MK-7 360 µg or placebo for 2 years. BMD of the distal radius (1/3, mid, ultradistal, and total), femoral neck, lumbar spine (L1–L4), and whole body was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Serum levels of vitamin K1 and MK-7 and plasma levels of total osteocalcin, dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein, and protein induced by vitamin K absence II were measured to assess vitamin K status.

After 2 years, an accelerated BMD loss of the 1/3 distal radius was found with MK-7 supplementation [mean difference of changes relative to placebo −0.023 g/cm² (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.039 to −0.008)], whereas the decrease in lumbar spine BMD seen in the placebo group was prevented [mean difference of changes between groups 0.050 g/cm² (95% CI 0.015–0.085)]. No significant effects were observed at the remaining skeletal sites. Vitamin K status strongly improved in MK-7-supplemented participants.

Compared with placebo, an accelerated BMD loss of the 1/3 distal radius was found after 2 years of MK-7 supplementation, whereas a decline in lumbar spine BMD was prevented.

### Vitamin K, bone turnover, and bone mass in girls [^117CQy6e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamin K has been suggested to have a role in bone metabolism, and low vitamin K intake has been related to low bone density and increased risk of osteoporotic fracture.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to determine whether phylloquinone (vitamin K(1)) intake and biochemical indicators of vitamin K status are related to bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone formation and bone resorption in girls.

- **Design**: Vitamin K status [plasma phylloquinone concentration and percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC)] was measured at baseline in a study of 245 healthy girls aged 3–16 years. Cross-linked N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) breakdown, osteocalcin, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were measured to reflect bone resorption and formation. BMC of the total body, lumbar spine, and hip and dietary phylloquinone intake were measured annually for four years.

- **Results**: Phylloquinone intake (median: 45 micrograms/day) was not consistently associated with bone turnover markers or BMC. Better vitamin K status (high plasma phylloquinone and low %ucOC) was associated with lower bone resorption and formation. Plasma phylloquinone was inversely associated with NTx and osteocalcin concentrations (P < 0.05), and %ucOC was positively associated with NTx and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations (P < 0.05). Indicators of vitamin K status were not consistently associated with BMC or gain in BMC over the four-year study period.

- **Conclusions**: Better vitamin K status was associated with decreased bone turnover in healthy girls consuming a typical U.S. diet.

### Welchol [^111tVWvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Welchol may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients with a susceptibility to vitamin K deficiencies, such as those on warfarin or with malabsorption syndromes, or deficiencies of other fat-soluble vitamins, may be at increased risk when taking Welchol. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Drug interactions**: Welchol reduces the gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with a known interaction at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs not tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering them at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU)**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with PKU. Welchol for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 3.75-gram packet contains 27 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Welchol for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Welchol for oral suspension.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to calcium supplementation, the USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily calcium supplementation at doses of > 1,000 mg for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal females.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^112GY89r]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

As kidney function declines, disturbances in mineral metabolism cause abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, and bone loss, as well as increased vascular and other soft-tissue calcification, the so-called chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis, the risk of fractures is increased up to four times compared with the general population. Fractures are associated with increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is more frequent and predicts future fractures in patients on dialysis treatment when compared with the general population.

BMD may be affected by vitamin K status. In observational studies, vitamin K levels have been positively associated with BMD in the elderly general population and in patients on dialysis. Furthermore, reduced levels of vitamin K are associated with an increased risk of fracture in both the elderly general population and patients on dialysis. In addition, treatment with vitamin K antagonists increases fracture risk.

Patients treated with dialysis are often vitamin K deficient, with highly elevated levels of vitamin K–dependent proteins. Vitamin K supplementation has been demonstrated to improve vitamin K status, as systemic levels of osteocalcin [OC; as undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC)], matrix Gla protein [MGP; as dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP)], and protein induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA-II) significantly decreased during supplementation.

### Effect of vitamin K supplementation on bone loss in elderly men and women [^111CAeMT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin K has been implicated in bone health, primarily in observational studies. However, little is known about the role of phylloquinone supplementation in the prevention of bone loss in men and women.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of three-year phylloquinone supplementation on changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck bone in older men and women who were replete with calcium and vitamin D.

In this three-year, double-blind, controlled trial, 452 men and women aged 60–80 years were randomized equally to receive a multivitamin containing either 500 µg/day of phylloquinone or no phylloquinone, in addition to a daily calcium (600 mg elemental calcium) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplement.

- **Main outcome measures**: Measurements of the femoral neck, spine (L2-L4), and total-body BMD, bone turnover, and vitamins K and D status were obtained every 6–12 months. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare changes in these measures in 401 participants who completed the trial.

Results indicated that there were no differences in changes in BMD measurements at any of the anatomical sites measured between the two groups. The group that received the phylloquinone supplement had significantly higher phylloquinone and significantly lower percent undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentrations compared with the group that did not receive phylloquinone. No other biochemical measures differed between the two groups.

In conclusion, phylloquinone supplementation at a dietary achievable dose does not confer any additional benefit for bone health at the spine or hip.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113UqxEs]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. However, most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs. The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, since older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays.

RCTs and meta-analyses published at the time of writing do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups. These subgroups include individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline, in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation.

Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academies of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (i.e. rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio differs significantly.

### Osteoporosis: The role of micronutrients [^116b7jSy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis and low bone mass are currently estimated to be major public health threats. Adequate nutrition plays a significant role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, with calcium and vitamin D being the micronutrients of greatest importance. Calcium has shown beneficial effects on bone mass at all ages, although results can be inconsistent. For the elderly (age ≥ 65 years), higher doses than the US recommendation of 600 IU of vitamin D may be required for optimal bone health, suggesting doses of 800–1000 IU/day. The elderly can clearly benefit from increased vitamin D intakes. However, the potential importance of vitamin D in peak bone mass is still under investigation.

Vitamin D has also been associated with reduced falls, as supplementation has shown to decrease the number of falls. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated clear fracture benefits with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Other micronutrient needs for optimizing bone health can be met by a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, ensuring adequate intakes of magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, and other potentially essential nutrients.

Healthcare professionals need to recognize the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes for optimal bone health and the prevention of falls and fractures. Monitoring can be done through serum 25(OH)D levels. Additionally, a healthy diet including five servings a day of fruits and vegetables should optimize the intake of micronutrients required for bone health.

### Vitamin K status of healthy Japanese women: Age-related vitamin K requirement for gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin [^116xkYpg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency is associated with low bone mineral density and an increased risk of bone fractures. Phylloquinone (K1) and menaquinone 4 (MK-4) and 7 (MK-7) are generally observed in human plasma; however, data are limited on their circulating concentrations and their associations with bone metabolism or with gamma-carboxylation of the osteocalcin molecule.

- **Objectives**: The objectives were to measure the circulating concentrations of K1, MK-4, and MK-7 in women and to ascertain whether each form of vitamin K is significantly associated with bone metabolism.

- **Design**: Plasma concentrations of K1, MK-4, MK-7, undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC; measured by using the new electrochemiluminescence immunoassay), intact osteocalcin (iOC), calcium, and phosphorus; bone-derived alkaline phosphatase activity; and concentrations of urinary creatinine, N-terminal telopeptide, and deoxypyridinoline were measured in healthy women (n = 396).

- **Results**: On average, MK-7 and MK-4 were the highest and lowest, respectively, of the three vitamers in all age groups. K1 and MK-7 correlated inversely with ucOC, but associations between the nutritional basal concentration of MK-4 and ucOC were not observed. Multiple regression analysis indicated that not only K1 and MK-7 concentrations but also age were independently correlated with ucOC concentration and the ratio of ucOC to iOC. The plasma K1 or MK-7 concentration required to minimize the ucOC concentration was highest in the group aged ≥ 70 years, and it decreased progressively for each of the younger age groups.

- **Conclusions**: The definite [The text is cut off and appears incomplete in the original source].

### Oral calcitriol use, vertebral fractures, and vitamin K in hemodialysis patients: A cross-sectional study [^113Ybv4S]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Low credibility.

Fractures and vascular calcifications (VCs) are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), related to abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism, calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)/Klotho associated with CKD. Impaired vitamin D metabolism and abnormal levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and FGF23/Klotho drive changes in bone and vascular systems in CKD. It is unclear if oral calcitriol safely mitigates fracture risk without increasing the burden of calcifications. Therefore, we investigated whether treatment with calcitriol affected the prevalence of fractures and VC progression in hemodialysis (HD) patients.

This report is a secondary analysis of the Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) study, a cross-sectional study involving 387 HD patients. We assessed vitamin 25(OH)D, alkaline phosphatase, PTH, calcium, phosphate, osteocalcin or bone Gla protein, matrix Gla protein, and vitamin K levels. Vertebral fractures (VFs) and VCs were determined by spine radiograph. A reduction of more than 20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF. VCs were quantified by the length of calcific lesions along the arteries.

The patients treated with oral calcitriol were 177 of 387 patients (45.7%). The prevalence of VF was lower in patients receiving oral calcitriol than in those untreated (48.6% versus 61.0%, p = 0.015), whereas the presence of aortic and iliac calcifications was similar (aortic: 81.9% versus 79.5%, respectively, p = 0.552; iliac: 52.0% and 59.5%, respectively, p = 0.167).

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112UMBRj]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements — more specifically concerning vitamin D and calcium for the prevention of fractures — the 2018 USPSTF guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D (> 400 IU/day) and calcium (> 1,000 mg/day) supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal females.

### A rational approach to evidence gaps in the management of osteoporosis [^111jx3WD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Major advancements in the treatment of osteoporosis have occurred over the last decade. Therapies, including the anti-resorptive drugs such as alendronate and risedronate, have been shown in randomized placebo-controlled trials to increase bone mineral density and reduce fracture risk. Anabolic therapy, in the form of parathyroid hormone, has been introduced as the first treatment to build bone mass. However, gaps in our knowledge about specific management issues that arise frequently among primary care providers persist.

In this paper, three common clinical scenarios are discussed:

- **A postmenopausal woman with only slightly reduced bone mineral density**: Evidence gaps and rational management approaches are considered.

- **An osteoporotic woman on anti-resorptive therapy for more than 5 years**: Evidence gaps and potential management solutions are outlined.

- **A woman who continues to fracture despite treatment**: The paper presents evidence gaps and attempts to provide rational management strategies.

Evidence gaps in each treatment scenario are presented, and rational approaches to management are suggested.

### Protective effect of vitamins K2 and D3 on prednisolone-induced loss of bone mineral density in the lumbar spine [^116NefZ3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Although vitamin K2 has been shown to prevent prednisolone-induced loss of bone mineral density in the lumbar spine of patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, the magnitude of this effect remains to be clarified. The aim of this prospective study is to compare the protective effect of vitamin K2 with that of vitamin D3 on prednisolone-induced loss of bone mineral density in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients (28 men, 32 women) were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15 each): control (group C), vitamin D3 alone (alfacalcidol, 0.5 µg/day; group D), vitamin K2 alone (menatetrenone, 45 mg/day; group K), and vitamins D3 plus K2 (group D + K). Alfacalcidol and menatetrenone therapy were started simultaneously with prednisolone. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2 to L4) was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and various biochemical parameters of calcium and bone homeostasis were assessed before and after eight weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: Treatment with prednisolone alone resulted in a loss of bone mineral density, which could be fully prevented in groups D, K, and D + K. However, marked reductions in levels of several biochemical markers of both bone formation and resorption were observed in all groups. The preventive effect in groups K and D + K on prednisolone-induced loss of bone mineral density was similar to that in group D. The elevation in serum calcium levels observed in group D was attenuated in group D + K.

- **Conclusion**: Protective effects of vitamin K2, or the combination of vitamins D3 and K2, were observed on prednisolone-induced loss of bone mineral density in the lumbar spine.

### Phytonadione [^113UYqoE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:

	- **Mechanism of action**: Phytonadione injectable emulsion, an aqueous colloidal solution of vitamin K1 for parenteral injection, possesses the same type and degree of activity as naturally occurring vitamin K. Vitamin K is essential for the liver's production of active prothrombin (factor II), proconvertin (factor VII), plasma thromboplastin component (factor IX), and Stuart factor (factor X). It acts as a cofactor for a microsomal enzyme catalyzing the post-translational carboxylation of specific peptide-bound glutamic acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of these factors. The resulting gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues convert these precursors into active coagulation factors secreted into the blood by liver cells.

		In normal animals and humans, phytonadione is virtually devoid of activity. However, in vitamin K-deficient animals and humans, the pharmacological action of vitamin K is related to its normal physiological function, promoting the hepatic biosynthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The action of the aqueous dispersion, when administered intravenously, is generally detectable within an hour or two, with hemorrhage usually controlled within 3 to 6 hours. A normal INR may often be obtained in 12 to 14 hours.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Absorption**: Phytonadione is readily absorbed following intramuscular administration.

	- **Distribution**: After absorption, phytonadione is initially concentrated in the liver.

### Efficacy of vitamin K on bone fragility: Puzzling findings from which we should learn how to design a rigorous study [^115ttxhJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Clinical cohort studies show an association between vitamin K deficiency and fractures in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) across stages of disease. In incident renal transplant recipients, above-mean dp-ucMGP levels were associated with a higher risk of incident fractures, even after adjusting for classic factors such as gender, age, previous fractures, and femoral neck T-score. In the VIKI observational study, vitamin K deficiency was associated with prevalent vertebral fractures. Importantly, this association was found only for phylloquinone (PK), thus corroborating data from the Hordaland Health Study. Taken together, observational data suggest that vitamin K deficiency may be associated with bone fragility, but the association may not hold true for all types of vitamin K.

While biological plausibility and consistency of observational data suggest a causal relationship between vitamin K deficiency and bone fragility, the proof of the pudding remains in the eating. Yet, intervention studies with vitamin K are limited and unfortunately have yielded heterogeneous findings, probably reflecting case-mix and variability in type, dose, and duration of the intervention, and end-point of interest. Vitamin K is currently commercially available in PK, menaquinone-4 (MK4), and menaquinone-7 (MK7) formulations. Intervention studies have demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of bone fractures with both PK and MK4, while an improvement in bone mineral density (BMD) has only been seen with MK4. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 440 postmenopausal women, Cheung et al. demonstrated that a daily intake of 5 mg of PK resulted…

### Vitamin k status in spaceflight and ground-based models of spaceflight [^111fBuZc]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Bone loss is a seemingly inevitable outcome of spaceflight. Of the many types of bone loss countermeasures evaluated at the time of writing, none have been proven effective during flight. Vitamin K is a nutrient linked to bone health and has been suggested as a potential countermeasure. Regardless of its efficacy in preventing bone loss, if the vitamin K status of astronauts were established as suboptimal during spaceflight, vitamin K supplementation might be warranted.

Vitamin K is an enzyme cofactor for the production of γ-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA) residues in specific proteins (GLA proteins). GLA proteins are involved in a number of regulatory functions, including bone mineralization. When vitamin K status is suboptimal, the assumption is that GLA proteins are not fully carboxylated and will thus be less effective. Osteocalcin is a GLA protein that is synthesized by osteoblasts and is thought to have a role in the regulation of bone mineralization. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) provides a good measure of vitamin K functional status with specific regard to bone.

Vitamin K has been included as a concern for the nutritional status of astronauts due to uncertainty about the efficiency of vitamin K synthesis by the gastrointestinal flora in microgravity and potentially altered absorption in this unique environment. A known and consistent occurrence in the spaceflight environment is the loss of bone mineral. Data showing a role for vitamin K status and/or vitamin K supplementation in bone health on Earth has led some to suggest that vitamin K treatment could be beneficial.

### Vitamin K: Key vitamin in controlling vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease [^111XtzNx]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Vascular calcification has emerged as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially in chronic kidney disease. Deficiencies in calcium-regulatory proteins directly relate to the development of calcifications. McCabe and colleagues report that vitamin K is a key regulator of vascular calcification via carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins such as matrix Gla protein. Knowledge about vitamin K status may propel therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat vascular calcification with high vitamin K supplementation.

### Effect on bone anabolic markers of daily cheese intake with and without vitamin K: a randomised clinical trial [^116WrB82]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin K is important for bone health, and low intake of vitamin K has been associated with an increased risk of fractures. Supplementation with vitamin K2, vitamin D, and calcium is a recommended first-line treatment for osteoporosis. Vitamin K2 is essential for the carboxylation or activation of Gla proteins. Osteocalcin is one of the 17 Gla proteins in humans, and carboxylated osteocalcin plays a key role in bone formation and maintenance. The ratio between circulating carboxylated and undercarboxylated osteocalcin reflects the extrahepatic vitamin K status.

Vitamin K2, or menaquinone (MK), has many variants. The short-chained MK-4 can be formed from vitamin K1 in humans and is found in animal products such as liver. The long-chained vitamin K2 vitamers like MK-7, MK-8, MK-9, and MK-9(4H) are of bacterial origin and occur in certain fermented foods such as cheese.

These variants have greater extrahepatic activity than MK-4 and vitamin K1, possibly due to more efficient uptake and a much longer serum half-life. Prospective cohort studies have demonstrated health benefits that can be attributed to the intake of vitamin K2, but not K1. In the Western diet, cheese is the major source of long-chained vitamin K2.

MK-9 is the most important K2 vitamer in cheese, but the amount varies considerably. Some cheeses also contain MK-9(4H), and Jarlsberg cheese is particularly rich in both MK-9 and MK-9(4H). This cheese is made with lactic acid bacteria producing MK-8 and MK-9, and Propionibacterium freudenreichii producing MK-9(4H).

### Vitamin K deficiency and osteopenia in vitamin D-deficient elderly women with Parkinson's disease [^115iHfp5]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the influence of vitamin K on bone mineral density (BMD) in vitamin-D-deficient women with Parkinson's disease (PD), a cross-sectional study was conducted. The study took place in the neurology department at a university medical center in Japan and included 62 women with PD (mean age, 70.7 years) alongside 62 age-matched controls. The patients were categorized based on their functional capabilities: group A (independent: stages I-II of Hoehn and Yahr stages of Parkinson's disease, n = 26) and group B (dependent: Hoehn and Yahr stages 3–5, n = 36).

- **Interventions**: Not applicable.
- **Main outcome measures**: Sera were analyzed to relate vitamin K concentrations to bone-related biochemical indices. BMD was measured by computed radiograph densitometry.

Results indicated that group B had significantly lower metacarpal BMD (P < 0.0001), lower serum concentrations of vitamin K1 (P < 0.01), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD; P < 0.0001) compared to group A. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were higher in group B than in group A (P < 0.0001). The serum concentration of vitamin K1 showed a positive correlation with 25-OHD (r = .735, P < 0.0001) and a negative correlation with undercarboxylated osteocalcin (r = -.751, P < 0.0001) and Hoehn and Yahr stages (r = .787, P < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis identified Hoehn and Yahr stages, vitamin K1, 25-OHD, and undercarboxylated osteocalcin as independent determinants of BMD (P < 0.0003).

In conclusion, in functionally dependent women with PD, nutritional vitamin K1 deficiency is believed to reduce the production of fully carboxylated osteocalcin, leading to reduced BMD.

### Vitamin K deficiency from long-term warfarin anticoagulation does not alter skeletal status in male rhesus monkeys [^117UWVLw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin K inadequacy may cause bone loss. Thus, K deficiency induced by anticoagulants, such as warfarin, may be an osteoporosis risk factor. The skeletal impact of long-term warfarin anticoagulation was evaluated in male monkeys, and no effect on bone mineral density (BMD) or bone markers of skeletal turnover was observed. This study suggests that warfarin-induced K deficiency does not have skeletal effects.

The skeletal role of vitamin K remains unclear. It is reasonable that a potential role of vitamin K in bone health could be elucidated by studying patients receiving oral anticoagulants that produce vitamin K deficiency. However, some reports find K deficiency induced by warfarin anticoagulation to be associated with low bone mass, while others do not. Additionally, epidemiologic studies have found warfarin use to be associated with either increased or no change in fracture risk. Such divergent results may imply that human studies are compromised by the physical illnesses for which warfarin was prescribed.

To remove this potential confounder, we prospectively assessed skeletal status during long-term warfarin anticoagulation of healthy nonhuman primates. Twenty adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), aged 7.4–17.9 years (mean, 11.7 years), were randomized to daily warfarin treatment or control groups. Bone mass of the total body, lumbar spine, and distal and central radius was determined by DXA at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months of warfarin treatment. Serum chemistries, urinary calcium excretion, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and total and percent urinalysis data were collected as part of the assessment.

### Early vascular ageing in chronic kidney disease: Impact of inflammation, vitamin K, senescence and genomic damage [^111wAcz1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) serves as a clinical model of premature ageing, marked by cardiovascular disease, persistent uraemic inflammation, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, and frailty. Accelerated early vascular ageing (EVA), mediated by medial vascular calcification (VC), is a hallmark of senescence and a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the CKD population. To date, clinical therapeutic strategies and novel treatments for VC have not been proven to prevent or reverse VC progression in CKD patients. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying EVA is essential to identify and develop novel and efficient therapeutic targets for VC and EVA.

An accumulating body of evidence suggests that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage–induced cellular senescence and 'inflammaging' may significantly contribute to such pathological conditions characterized by accelerated EVA. Furthermore, growing evidence indicates that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signalling and vitamin K play crucial roles in counteracting oxidative stress, DNA damage, senescence, and inflammaging. Therefore, NRF2 activation and vitamin K supplementation may provide novel treatment targets for EVA. This review discusses the link between senescence and EVA in the context of CKD, with a particular focus on the role of NRF2 and vitamin K in DNA damage signalling, senescence, and inflammaging.

### Is supplementation of vitamin D beneficial for fracture healing? A short review of the literature [^112GNaJJ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a surge of interest regarding the benefits of vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures. But can it also make them heal more quickly once they have occurred; that is, is supplementation of vitamin D beneficial for fracture healing? We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria; 11 of these were performed in animals. Two animal studies showed negative results, two showed neutral results, and seven showed positive results. One clinical case series in humans was inconclusive in our opinion, and one randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed that supplementation of vitamin D3 and calcium in elderly women with reduced bone mass and a proximal humerus fracture had a positive influence on bone healing. The major weakness of the latter study is the low number of participants. A clear statement on the benefits of vitamin D for fracture healing awaits further trials, but all types of fractures in elderly individuals indicate the need for secondary prevention and the implementation of appropriate guidelines concerning falls, vitamin D, and osteoporosis.

### Assessment of vitamin K levels in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy [^115Hz2Er]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

There is not enough evidence in the literature to characterize the effects of vitamin K during pregnancy. Vitamin K's effects on chronic renal disease, coronary heart disease, osteodystrophy, osteoporosis, and other disorders have been well researched in the general population. Furthermore, there is evidence of a probable involvement for hypovitaminosis K in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, although further research is required.

At the same time, because vitamin K is required for bone metabolism, it has been used as a safe treatment for pregnancy-related osteoporosis. Vitamin K2 has been demonstrated to suppress some cancer cells without causing side effects, making it a promising compound for cancer prevention and treatment. Vitamin K2 has been shown in clinical tests to have the potential to improve the prognosis of cancer patients.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^111ZwuWQ]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

There were no significant differences between the study groups in the markers of mineral metabolism or bone turnover at any time (all P-values > .05).

After 1 and 2 years, AAC scores increased in both study groups, but the changes from baseline (P = 0.51 and .41) and the absolute scores (P = 0.19 and .68) did not differ between groups. The number and extent of lumbar vertebral compression fractures did not differ between the study groups at baseline (P = 0.16) and remained unchanged after 2 years.

The number of participants who experienced bone fracture, parathyroidectomy, a thromboembolic event, or death during the study did not differ between study groups (ITT analyses; all P-values > .05). Due to more events in one placebo-supplemented participant, the number of thromboembolic events differed between the study groups (P = 0.02).

The mean adherence to study tablets was > 90% after year 1 and 2 in both study groups. A total of 110 participants experienced 968 AEs during the trial and 481 SAEs occurred in 90 participants. The number of participants who experienced an AE or SAE did not differ between groups (all P-values > .05).

### Vitamin K status in spaceflight and ground-based models of spaceflight [^112Q87uV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

Aside from any association with spaceflight, a low vitamin K status is often associated with lower bone mass in observational studies. However, the preponderance of randomized clinical trials in men and women suggests that phylloquinone supplementation has no impact on age-related bone loss under conditions of normal gravity (that is, on the ground). One suggestion for the discrepancy between the findings of observational studies and the clinical trials is that vitamin K intake tracks a healthy lifestyle, and hence there is a lower risk for bone loss. This inconclusiveness of the ground-based data on phylloquinone supplementation for bone protection further supports the idea that supplementation during spaceflight for mitigation of bone loss is not warranted at this time. The vitamin K supplementation case study was conducted on the Russian space station Mir in 1995, and the food system was composed entirely of Russian foods. On the ISS, and on Mir flights when US crew members were aboard, the food system was about half American space food and half Russian space food. Whether this difference affected vitamin K intakes is impossible to know, but the supplement administered in the Russian space study contained 10 mg/day, which, given its high dose, would have superseded any dietary effects on measures of vitamin K status.

Although the initial goals and hypotheses of the bed rest studies presented here did not include the study of vitamin K status in particular, we presented the data here as evidence supporting the spaceflight data. Bed rest is a well-accepted model for certain conditions that are representative of spaceflight-related physiological changes.

### Vitamin K, vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality: Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) dialysis study [^114eDggS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin K (vitamin K1 or phylloquinone and vitamin K2, a series of menaquinones [MKs]) is involved in the production of bone and matrix amino acid γ-carboxy-glutamic acid (Gla) proteins, regulating bone and vascular calcification. Low vitamin K concentrations are associated with increased risks of fractures and vascular calcification, and frequent complications in hemodialysis patients.

We carried out an observational study to establish the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency and to assess the relationship between vitamin K status, vertebral fractures, vascular calcification, and survival in 387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥ 1 year. We determined plasma levels of vitamin K compound, bone-Gla-protein, matrix-Gla-protein, and routine biochemistry. Vertebral fractures (reduction in vertebral body height by ≥ 20%) and aortic and iliac calcifications were also investigated in a spine (D5-L4) radiograph. Three-year patient survival was analyzed.

Important proportions of patients had deficiency of MK7 (35.4%), vitamin K1 (23.5%), and MK4 (14.5%). A total of 55.3% of patients had vertebral fractures, 80.6% had abdominal aorta calcification, and 56.1% had iliac calcification. Vitamin K1 deficiency was the strongest predictor of vertebral fractures (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–6.26). MK4 deficiency was a predictor of aortic calcification (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.14–7.01), whereas MK5 deficiency actually protected against it (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15–0.95). MK7 deficiency was a predictor of iliac calcification (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.03–2.60).

### Early vascular ageing in chronic kidney disease: Impact of inflammation, vitamin K, senescence and genomic damage [^1177k3C7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Accelerated ageing processes often manifest with cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and frailty, concomitant with chronic, low-grade inflammation. A large body of epidemiological studies has shown the possible involvement of vitamin K in ageing-related disease phenotypes. Data from the Health ABC study indicate that a lower vitamin K status, measured by vitamin K1 and desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein (dp-ucMGP), was associated with reduced lower extremity function during 4–5 years of follow-up.

The prospective data analysis from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a cohort study with a 13-year follow-up, found that poor vitamin K status, indicated by high dp-ucMGP levels at baseline, was associated with a higher frailty index score in ageing subjects.

With regard to the effect of vitamin K in osteoporosis, the results from different clinical studies remain equivocal. While some studies conducted in the Japanese population have shown that high doses of vitamin K2 are effective in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, data from a systematic review and meta-analysis, including 36 randomized controlled trials, concluded that vitamin K had no effect on vertebral fracture incidences among postmenopausal and osteoporotic patients. Given the variability and heterogeneity of vitamin K supplementation involved in different studies, it can be speculated that different forms and dosages of vitamin K may have different efficacy, and that a higher dose of vitamin K supplement is most likely to ensure better carboxylation of osteocalcin, which is crucial for bone health.

### An analysis of vitamin K status in Chinese healthy children aged 0–18 years [^116nk1qc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin K (VK), a group of fat-soluble vitamins, plays a pivotal role in blood coagulation, bone health, and cardiovascular health. The phylloquinone (vitamin K1, VK1) and menaquinones (vitamin K2, VK2) are the only natural forms of VK. Different forms of VK originate from distinct dietary sources. VK1 is mainly found in green vegetables. VK2 occurs in multiple forms. Among them, MK-4 is unique in that it is not synthesized by bacteria. Dietary sources of MK-4 include meat, eggs, and dairy products. In addition, MK-4 can be formed through tissue-specific conversion of dietary VK1. Geographically, VK1 is the predominant dietary form in the United States and Europe due to the consumption of green vegetables.

VK2 is essential for both bone calcification and vascular health, acting as a cofactor for glutamate γ-carboxylase to activate vitamin K-dependent proteins including osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, which bind calcium to improve bone mineralization and regulate calcium deposition in blood vessels. Studies highlight VK2's role in preventing coronary artery calcification and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, VK2 has been shown to positively affect metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cognitive function, and potentially delay Alzheimer's disease progression. Furthermore, VK2 has been linked to an important role in cancer prevention.

In conjunction with VK2, vitamin D (VD) plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis and bone health by promoting calcium absorption and regulating the transcription and translation of the osteocalcin gene.

### Osteoporosis in men: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111V79yZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for osteoporosis in men, specifically concerning calcium and vitamin D supplementation, the ES 2012 guidelines recommend consuming 1,000–1,200 mg/day of calcium, ideally from dietary sources, in patients with or at risk for osteoporosis. Offer calcium supplements if dietary calcium is insufficient.

### The effect of menaquinone-7 supplementation on vascular calcification in patients with diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116meRgR]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Vitamin K is fat-soluble and occurs in two different forms, phylloquinone (vitamin K-1) and menaquinones (vitamin K-2). Phylloquinone is mainly derived from green leafy vegetables, whereas menaquinones mainly occur in fermented animal products such as cheese and meat. Although phylloquinone and menaquinones have the same chemical structure, they differ in the length and saturation degree of the side chain. Menaquinones have a longer half-life and higher bioavailability.

Multiple observational studies have shown a reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with high vitamin K intake, although the evidence is not conclusive. At the time of writing, two studies have investigated the effect of phylloquinone supplementation on vascular calcification, showing reduced progression in older men and women and in chronic kidney disease patients. The effect of menaquinones on vascular calcification has not yet been investigated, although two intervention studies have shown reduced vascular stiffness after menaquinone supplementation. Another study did not find an effect of menaquinone supplementation on vascular stiffness or other markers of vascular health. None of the trials investigated the effect of vitamin K and vascular calcifications in people with type 2 diabetes, even though vascular calcification is prevalent in approximately 70% of people with type 2 diabetes.

Finally, vascular calcification is an active process, but none of the studies measured the active vascular calcification. Sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (18 F-NaF PET) is a promising technique to detect early changes in active vascular calcification before calcification.

### Health effects of vitamin and mineral supplements [^116FLEB6]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Recent evidence regarding the effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation is inconsistent. A meta-analysis of trials in community-living older adults found that vitamin D or calcium supplementation did not reduce the risk of hip fracture or total fracture, whereas another meta-analysis reported that while vitamin D alone did not reduce fracture risk, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation decreased the relative risk of hip fracture by 16% and all fractures by 6% among older adults. Ongoing research is assessing the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplements on several health outcomes, including fractures, but a recent three-year trial of 400, 4000, or 10,000 IU/day reported that the higher doses reduced volumetric bone density, suggesting potential for harm. In the absence of clear evidence on supplementation, it is prudent to ensure that dietary recommendations on calcium and vitamin D intakes are met through food and supplementation.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114tvLJq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The disease vitamin D deficiency can be associated with various conditions, such as malabsorption, increased serum PTH, and bariatric surgery. It is also linked to corticosteroid use, bone pain, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rickets, and osteopenia. Additional associations include myalgia, history of fracture, bowed legs, muscle weakness, decreased serum calcium, hip pain, pectus carinatum, kyphosis, and osteoporosis. Patients with decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or those using anticonvulsants may also be affected. Limited sun exposure and dark skin color are noted risk factors.

### Welchol [^116PdaRT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies**: Welchol may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients susceptible to deficiencies of vitamin K, such as those on warfarin or with malabsorption syndromes, may be at increased risk when taking Welchol. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to taking Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Drug interactions**: Welchol reduces the gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. It is advised to administer drugs with a known interaction at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering at least 4 hours prior to Welchol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU)**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with PKU. Welchol for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 3.75 gram packet contains 27 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Welchol for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Welchol for oral suspension.

### Efficacy of vitamin K on bone fragility: Puzzling findings from which we should learn how to design a rigorous study [^113mhYJY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

MK7 was chosen to replenish vitamin K stores. While its widespread availability and long half-life are truly assets, it should be acknowledged that epidemiological evidence linking MK7 to favorable bone outcomes is very limited, if not nonexistent, especially for the synthetic form of MK7. More importantly, recent experimental and clinical data indicate that both the metabolism and transport of MK7 are profoundly disturbed in CKD. MK7 supplements thus seem not to be the best choice in CKD, or they should be given at higher doses. Of note, while MK7 levels significantly increased in the active treatment arm, levels of dp-ucMGP, a marker of functional vitamin K deficiency, did not normalize. However, none of the trials that studied vitamin K supplementation in dialysis achieved a "normal" dp-ucMGP. These insights call for caution in extrapolating present results to other vitamin K treatment regimes, testing different vitamins, doses, and/or follow-up times.

Designing the ideal study to assess (skeletal) efficacy of vitamin K supplementation is a real challenge. Knowledge of the many pitfalls is evolving and will help in the pursuit of this challenge in the future. An RCT with a well-defined treatment regimen assessing hard endpoints would overall be considered the "nec plus ultra". Such trials, however, are not always feasible, often deal with relatively short follow-up durations, and the participants in many cases are homogeneous and highly selected for safety considerations. Adherence to intervention is well-controlled. For several reasons, RCTs may both over- and underestimate treatment effects.

### Vitamin D and bone health in postmenopausal women [^111z9NC4]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, a disease characterized by increased skeletal fragility, is becoming increasingly prevalent as the U.S. population ages. Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is essential for osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Age-related changes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism heighten the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Although longitudinal data have suggested a role for vitamin D intake in modulating bone loss in perimenopausal women, studies have not supported a significant effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation during early menopause. Conversely, there is a clearer benefit of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in older postmenopausal women. For women with a mean age of approximately 63 years, vitamin D intake between 500 and 800 IU daily, with or without calcium supplementation, has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD).

In women older than 65, there is even more benefit with vitamin D intakes between 800 and 900 IU daily and 1200–1300 mg of calcium daily, resulting in increased bone density, decreased bone turnover, and fewer nonvertebral fractures. The reduction in nonvertebral fractures may also be influenced by vitamin D-mediated decreases in body sway and fall risk. However, there are insufficient data supporting the benefit of vitamin D supplementation alone, without calcium, to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

### Vitamin K antagonists' use and fracture risk: results from a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112v8GFJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) lower serum values of bone deposition markers, the link with osteoporosis and fractures remains controversial.

- **Objective**: To assess whether the use of VKAs is associated with an increased prevalence and/or incidence of osteoporosis, fractures, or lower bone mineral density (BMD) values.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic PubMed and EMBASE literature search until August 31, 2014, and a meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating fractures and BMD. This included comparing patients treated with VKAs and healthy controls (HCs) or patients with medical illnesses (medical controls, MCs). Standardized mean differences ± 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for BMD, and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for prevalent and incident fractures.

- **Results**: Of 4,597 initial hits, 21 studies were eligible, including 79,663 individuals treated with VKAs versus 597,348 controls. Compared with HCs, VKA-treated individuals showed significantly higher fracture risk in cross-sectional (three studies; RR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12–1.39, P < 0.0001) and longitudinal studies (seven studies; RR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01–1.18, P = 0.03), as well as more incident hip fractures (four studies; RR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05–1.31, P = 0.003). Analyzing studies that matched VKA participants with HCs (four studies), these findings in longitudinal studies became non-significant. Notably, the VKA and MC group had similar BMD values at all investigated sites. Compared with HCs, a single study showed significantly lower spine T-scores in the VKA-treated group.

### Risk of osteoporosis in patients with atrial fibrillation using non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants or warfarin [^112e6VmK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In our study, we used a large-scale cohort study design with a long-term follow-up duration and comprehensive analyses. Our study not only performed comparisons of osteoporosis risk between all NOACs and warfarin but also compared specific NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) with warfarin and with each other. Our findings provide stronger and more comprehensive evidence for the association between osteoporosis and the different OACs.

Of note, a significant lower osteoporosis risk was observed only in the rivaroxaban and apixaban subgroups but not in the dabigatran subgroup when compared with warfarin users. This finding appears to be incompatible with that of a previous study which found dabigatran, compared with warfarin, to be associated with lower fracture risks. Because of the undetermined fracture mechanism in that study, and the retrospective cohort study design used in both that study and ours, we suggest that further prospective studies, including randomized controlled trials with detailed bone mineral density data and fracture mechanisms, should be conducted in the future.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the association between a lower osteoporosis risk and NOAC use compared with warfarin are not well understood, there are some possible explanations. Previous studies have indicated that warfarin may interfere with processes that contribute to bone formation due to its antagonistic actions against vitamin K.

### Who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation [^112Bc37V]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Until recently, it was perceived as harmless and without adverse effects. However, recent meta-analyses have provided evidence suggesting that calcium supplements, with or without vitamin D, may be associated with cardiovascular risks. Although this finding is a safety signal that must be taken seriously, the data should be interpreted with caution. They do not allow for definitive conclusions and require further independent confirmation, since in numerous large studies, combined supplementation did not increase cardiovascular events, even among the most frail and elderly populations.

It seems appropriate to correct calcium deficiency by enhancing dietary intake and to target supplementation for individuals at high risk of fracture or where calcium and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Other trials have shown an increased risk of falls and fractures with annual high-dose vitamin D. Therefore, supplementation with more frequent, lower doses is preferred. Nevertheless, the optimal dosing schedule remains unknown and requires further study. To correct age-associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and prevent osteoporotic fractures, a daily dose of 1,000–1,200 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D is recommended for elderly or institutionalized individuals, patients with established osteoporosis, and those on glucocorticoids.

### Short-term and long-term effects of osteoporosis therapies [^114CjqSN]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Progress continues to be made in the development of therapeutics for fracture prevention. Bisphosphonates are now available orally and intravenously, often as inexpensive generics, and remain the most widely used interventions for osteoporosis. The major safety concern associated with the use of bisphosphonates is the development of femoral shaft stress fractures, and although rare, this adverse event affords the principal rationale for restricting bisphosphonate therapy to those individuals with femoral T-scores for more than 5 years.

Newer antiresorptive therapies, in the form of denosumab and cathepsin K inhibitors, might increase efficacy and possibly circumvent some of the safety concerns associated with bisphosphonate use, such as gastrointestinal and renal complications. The combination of teriparatide with antiresorptives markedly increases effects on bone mineral density (BMD); new anabolic agents are also very promising in this regard. However, whether these changes in BMD translate into improved efficacy of fracture prevention remains to be determined.

Vitamin D is important for the prevention of osteomalacia, but it does not influence BMD or fracture risk in patients who are not deficient in vitamin D. The balance of risks and benefits of calcium supplementation is contentious, but patients should be encouraged to adhere to a balanced diet aimed at maintaining a healthy body weight. Consideration of a patient's risk of falling, and its mitigation, are also important.

### Associations between vitamin K biochemical measures and bone mineral density in men and women [^114choqq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Few data exist on the association between vitamin K status and bone mineral density (BMD) in men and women of varying ages. We examined cross-sectional associations between biochemical measures of vitamin K status and BMD at the hip and spine in 741 men and 863 women (mean age: 59 years, range: 32–86 years) who participated in the Framingham Heart Study (1996–2000). Vitamin K status was assessed by plasma phylloquinone and percentage undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC).

Among the men, low plasma phylloquinone concentrations adjusted for triglycerides and elevated serum %ucOC levels were associated with low BMD at the femoral neck (P = 0.03 and 0.009, respectively). Among postmenopausal women not using estrogen replacements, low plasma phylloquinone concentrations were associated with low spine BMD (P = 0.007), with a nonsignificant trend of an elevated serum %ucOC with low spine BMD (P = 0.08). In contrast, there were no significant associations between biochemical measures of vitamin K and BMD in either premenopausal women or postmenopausal women using estrogen replacements.

Clinical trials are required to isolate any putative effects of vitamin K on rates of bone loss. The target population in these trials, particularly in regard to estrogen use, may be critical, as suggested by the findings of this study.

### Two-year randomized controlled trial of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin D3 plus calcium on the bone health of older women [^1174Myto]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). High credibility.

Dietary supplementation with vitamin K1, in combination with vitamin D3 and calcium, was examined in healthy older women during a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The combination of vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in bone mineral content (BMC) at the ultradistal radius, though not at other sites in the hip or radius.

The putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) on bone mineral density (BMD) and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving healthy Scottish women aged 60 years and older.

Healthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 micrograms/day of vitamin K1, (3) 10 micrograms (400 IU) of vitamin D3 plus 1000 mg of calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K1 and D3 plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were assessed using multivariate general linear modeling, fully adjusted for baseline and potential confounding variables.

Significant bone mineral loss was observed only at the mid-distal radius; however, there was no significant difference between the groups. Women who took the combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium demonstrated a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D over the course of the study.

### The use of vitamins and minerals in skeletal health: American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology position statement [^117Jh7By]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Use of vitamins and minerals in skeletal health is essential, as outlined by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology's position statement. For clarity, the following abbreviations are used throughout the text: 25(OH)D refers to 25-hydroxyvitamin D; BMD refers to bone mineral density; CV denotes cardiovascular; GI indicates gastrointestinal; IOM is the Institute of Medicine; PTH stands for parathyroid hormone; RCT signifies randomized controlled trial; αTF is α-tocopherol; ucOC refers to undercarboxylated osteocalcin; VKA denotes vitamin K antagonist; WHI is the Women's Health Initiative.

This statement examines the role of vitamins and minerals in maintaining and improving skeletal health. The document highlights critical findings from recent studies, including data on vitamin D and its impact on BMD. Additionally, it discusses the importance of maintaining an optimal balance of other nutrients to prevent skeletal deterioration and associated risks.

These insights are grounded in evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), although the document indicates that further research is required to fully understand the long-term effects and optimal dosages needed for prevention and treatment.

### Efficacy of vitamin K on bone fragility: Puzzling findings from which we should learn how to design a rigorous study [^117X1ofx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

In conclusion, while RCTs in the general population indicate that PK or MK4 confer bone protection, findings in CKD patients seem to be more puzzling. This discrepancy may be related to the complex pathophysiology of bone disease in CKD, where altering one risk factor does not necessarily lead to improved skeletal outcomes. Alternatively, heterogeneous findings may be due to shortcomings in study design, partly related to incomplete knowledge of vitamin K metabolism in CKD. Importantly, not all types of vitamin K are equal. The present study, despite its negative findings, should not temper enthusiasm. Instead, it should aid in designing the ideal trial to answer the clinically relevant question of whether vitamin K supplementation prevents bone fractures and/or attenuates the progression of vascular calcification.

### Vitamin k-containing dietary supplements: Comparison of synthetic vitamin K1 and natto-derived menaquinone-7 [^115cx4zc]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin K is a cofactor in the production of blood coagulation factors in the liver, osteocalcin in bone, and matrix Gla protein in cartilage and vessel walls. Accumulating evidence suggests that for optimal bone and vascular health, relatively high intakes of vitamin K are required. The synthetic short-chain vitamin K1 is commonly used in food supplements. However, recently, the natural long-chain menaquinone-7 (MK-7) has also become available as an over-the-counter (OTC) supplement. The purpose of this paper was to compare the absorption and efficacy of K1 and MK-7 in healthy volunteers. Serum vitamin K species were used as a marker for absorption, and osteocalcin carboxylation served as a marker for activity.

Both K1 and MK-7 were absorbed well, with peak serum concentrations occurring 4 hours after intake. A major difference between the two vitamin K species is the very long half-life of MK-7, resulting in much more stable serum levels and accumulation of MK-7 to higher levels (7- to 8-fold) during prolonged intake. MK-7 induced more complete carboxylation of osteocalcin, and hematologists should be aware that preparations supplying 50 μg/d or more of MK-7 may interfere with oral anticoagulant treatment in a clinically relevant way.

### Impaired vitamin K recycling in uremia is rescued by vitamin K supplementation [^113fnpkV]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, vitamin K-dependent proteins, including the calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein, are largely uncarboxylated, indicating that functional vitamin K deficiency may contribute to uremic vascular calcification. Since the effects of uremia on the vitamin K cycle are unknown, we investigated the influence of uremia and vitamin K supplementation on the activity of the vitamin K cycle and extraosseous calcification.

Uremia was induced in rats by an adenine-supplemented diet, and vitamin K1 or K2 was administered over 4 and 7 weeks. After 4 weeks of the adenine diet, the activity of the vitamin K cycle enzyme γ-carboxylase, but not the activities of DT-diaphorase or vitamin K epoxide reductase, was reduced. Serum levels of undercarboxylated matrix Gla protein increased, indicating functional vitamin K deficiency. There was no light microscopy-detectable calcification at this stage, but chemically determined aortic and renal calcium content was increased. Vitamin K treatment reduced aortic and renal calcium content after 4 weeks.

Seven weeks of uremia induced overt calcification in the aorta, heart, and kidneys; however, the addition of vitamin K restored intrarenal γ-carboxylase activity and overstimulated it in the liver, along with reducing heart and kidney calcification. Thus, uremic vitamin K deficiency may partially result from a reduction of the γ-carboxylase activity, which possibly contributes to calcification. Pharmacological vitamin K supplementation restored the vitamin K cycle and slowed the development of soft tissue calcification in experimental uremia.

### Efficacy of vitamin K on bone fragility: Puzzling findings from which we should learn how to design a rigorous study [^114vh4BF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Results from a recent vitamin K intervention study in dialysis patients by Levy-Schousboe et al, published in this issue of NDT, should be interpreted against this background. The investigators conducted a randomized placebo-controlled (RCT), double-blind study to evaluate the impact of vitamin K supplementation on BMD in dialysis patients. Patients in the active study arm were treated with 360 μg of MK7 for 2 years.

BMD results were mixed. Somewhat surprisingly, patients in the active study arm showed an accentuated BMD loss at the distal 1/3 radius site. No BMD differences were observed at other sites of the radius. MK supplementation reduced BMD loss at the lumbar spine but not at the femoral neck. The incidence of vertebral fractures (VFs) and progression of vascular calcification, evaluated according to Kauppila's method, did not differ between groups.

This study, being among the few RCTs on vitamin K, should be applauded and welcomed. However, power issues and peculiarities of the study design, with regard to the choice of (primary) endpoint and intervention, call for a cautious interpretation of the results.

Like many RCTs, the study by Levy-Schousboe et al. suffered from recruitment difficulties and a higher than anticipated drop-out rate. As already highlighted, the outcome of MK7 supplementation differed according to the skeletal site under investigation: BMD loss at the distal 1/3 radius (primary endpoint) and BMD gain at the lumbar spine. While these different outcomes may have a biological explanation, as these sites refer to predominantly cortical and trabecular bone, respectively, one should remain cautious in interpreting these findings.

### Vitamin K supplementation and bone mineral density in dialysis: Results of the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled RenaKvit trial [^112U4AYy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

According to our power calculation, we aimed at including 2 × 70 participants. Due to challenged recruitment, unfortunately, we ended up with only 61 + 62 participants. Furthermore, the dropout rate in year 2 was higher than anticipated. For these reasons, only 30 + 32 patients contributed with 2-year primary outcome data, a number somewhat lower than required according to the power calculations (2 × 49). Nonetheless, we managed to detect significant changes in the primary outcome variable. It is possible that a larger sample size and a longer trial duration would have demonstrated more convincing differences in the response between treatment groups and even other significant differences in outcomes as well.

Previous studies have reported worsening of BMD on the arteriovenous fistula arm. The number of functioning fistulas was similar in the two study groups; unfortunately, neither the placement nor the number of closed fistulas was registered.

- **Lumbar spine BMD may be influenced by**: Osteoarthritis, compression fractures, severe aortic calcification (which is common in the dialysis population), and intestinal deposition of phosphate binders. In the present study, we cannot exclude that lumbar spine osteoarthritis may have been unevenly distributed in the two study groups. However, neither AAC scores nor vertebral fractures differed between the study groups. Although DXAs were performed with abdomens empty for dialysis fluids, the intake of phosphate binders and leftover peritoneal dialysis fluids may have affected measurements of lumbar spine BMD.

The objective of these guidelines is to develop and sponsor them under the auspices of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees. The process adheres to established AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Methods: Recommendations are based on thorough reviews of clinical evidence, with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, following AACE/ACE guidelines protocols.

Results: The Executive Summary of this 2020 updated guideline includes 52 recommendations: 21 Grade A (40%), 24 Grade B (46%), 7 Grade C (14%), and no Grade D (0%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations facilitate nuanced clinical decision-making addressing multiple aspects of real-world patient care. The evidence base, presented in the subsequent Appendix, provides supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations.

This update contains 368 citations: 123 (33.5%) at evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 132 (36%) EL 2 (intermediate), 20 (5.5%) EL 3 (weak), and 93 (25%) EL 4 (lowest). New or updated topics in this CPG include the clarification of the diagnosis of osteoporosis, stratification of patients according to high-risk and very-high-risk features, a new dual-action therapy option, and transitions from therapeutic options.

This guideline serves as a practical tool for endocrinologists, general physicians, regulatory bodies, health-related organizations, and interested laypersons regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^113h4Daw]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Many meta-analyses have evaluated the effect of vitamin D on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture incidence. The outcomes of these analyses vary greatly. In general, they show that the effect of vitamin D is greater when:

- **Age factor**: Given to older individuals (70 to 80 years or ≥ 80 years) compared to younger subjects (60 to 70 years).
- **Living conditions**: Administered in a residential care setting as opposed to independently living elderly.
- **Dosage**: The daily dose is at least 800 IU, or when baseline serum 25OHD is low.

The Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis stated that vitamin D alone is unlikely to be effective in preventing hip fractures or any new fractures. However, it also showed that combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation leads to a 16% decrease in hip fracture risk, a 14% decrease in new nonvertebral fracture risk, and a 5% decrease in risk for any fracture. To prevent one hip fracture, 1,000 older persons must be treated for one year. Treatment is more efficacious in high-risk individuals, such as the institutionalized, where approximately 110 persons must be treated for one year to prevent one hip fracture. This number decreases further when considering other nonvertebral fractures.

Side effects of calcium and vitamin D include hypercalcemia (which is rare) and renal stones. Mortality decreases by 6%, but this was not statistically significant. One meta-analysis concluded that the effect was trivial since the decrease in fracture incidence was not greater than 15%. However, it may be argued that a 10% to 15% decrease in fracture incidence is considerable, as this therapy can be implemented in a very large number of at-risk individuals at a very low cost.

### Vitamin K supplementation for cystic fibrosis [^111VwRkW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Malabsorption and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin K, may occur in cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs. Vitamin K is known to play an important role in both blood coagulation and bone formation. Therefore, the role of supplementation of vitamin K in this condition needs to be reviewed. The following is an updated version of the review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis and to investigate the hypotheses that vitamin K will decrease deficiency-related coagulopathy, increase bone mineral density, decrease the risk of fractures, and improve the quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis. The aim is also to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of vitamin K for people with cystic fibrosis for both routine and therapeutic use.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The most recent search was conducted on 12 August 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of all preparations of vitamin K used as a supplement were compared to either no supplementation (or placebo) at any dose or route and for any duration, in patients with cystic fibrosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details, and assessed their risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

- **Main results**: Three trials were included, with a total of 70 participants ranging in age from 8 to 46 years.

### Forteo [^111yHpAZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: FORTEO is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as having a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fractures, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, FORTEO reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. It is also indicated to increase bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. Furthermore, FORTEO is indicated for the treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (daily dosage equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone) at high risk for fracture, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.

FORTEO is a parathyroid hormone analog (PTH 1–34) indicated for these purposes:

- **Treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis**: It addresses high risk for fractures or failure or intolerance to other available osteoporosis therapy.
- **Increase of bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis**: It targets high risk for fracture or failure or intolerance to other available osteoporosis therapy.
- **Treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with glucocorticoid therapy**: Specifically, it is for those at high risk for fracture or who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.

### Poor vitamin K status is associated with low bone mineral density and increased fracture risk in end-stage renal disease [^112Ynw4B]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis are major public health problems associated with an aging population. Vitamin K insufficiency is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Preliminary data indicate that poor vitamin K status may compromise bone health and that increased inflammation may be in the causal pathway. We performed an ancillary analysis of data collected in the frame of prospective observational cohort studies exploring various aspects of bone health in de novo renal transplant recipients to investigate the association between vitamin K status, inflammation, bone mineral density, and incident clinical fractures.

- **Parameters of mineral metabolism**: These include biointact PTH and FGF23, sclerostin, calcidiol, and calcitriol, as well as inflammation markers like CRP and IL-6, osteoprotegerin, bone turnover markers (P1NP, BsAP, and TRAP5B), and dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP). These were assessed on blood samples collected immediately prior to kidney transplantation in 468 patients.

- **Bone mineral density measurement**: Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry within 14 days post-transplant.

Poor vitamin K status, defined by dp-ucMGP > 500 nmol/L, was highly prevalent (90%). High dp-ucMGP levels independently associated with elevated inflammatory markers and low aBMD. No associations were observed between vitamin K status and bone turnover markers. During a median follow-up of 5.1 years, 33 patients sustained a fragility fracture. In Cox-proportional hazards analysis, a dp-ucMGP above median was associated with…

### Vitamin K status in patients with Crohn's disease and relationship to bone turnover [^116sfp8G]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

There is a high prevalence of osteopenia among patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Evidence suggests that a deficiency of certain bone-active nutrients, including vitamins K and D, may partially contribute to this bone loss.

- **Aims**: To compare the intake and status of vitamin K in CD patients currently in remission with age- and sex-matched controls, and to investigate the relationship between vitamin K status and bone turnover in these patients.

- **Subjects**: CD patients (n = 44; mean age: 36.9 years) and matched controls (n = 44) were recruited from the Cork University Hospital and Cork City area, respectively.

- **Methods**: Blood samples were analyzed for total and undercarboxylated (Glu)-osteocalcin, and urine was analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx). Vitamin K1 intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire.

- **Results**: Vitamin K1 intake in CD patients tended to be lower than controls (mean [SD], 117 [82] vs. 148 [80] µg/day, respectively; p = 0.059). Glu and NTx concentrations in CD patients were higher than in controls (mean [SD], 5.1 [3.1] vs. 3.9 [2.1] ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.03 for Glu; and 49 [41] vs. 25.8 [19.5] nM BCE/mM creatinine, respectively; p = 0.001 for NTx). In CD patients, Glu was significantly correlated with NTx (r = 0.488; p < 0.001), even after controlling for age, gender, vitamin D status, calcium intake, and corticosteroid use.

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin K status of CD patients was lower than the healthy controls. Furthermore, the rate of bone resorption in CD was inversely correlated with vitamin K status.
