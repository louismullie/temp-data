## Question

is montelukast used for hotflashes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether montelukast (Singulair) is used for hot flashes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what montelukast is actually approved to treat. Then, I should verify whether any evidence exists for its use in vasomotor symptoms. Next, I will check if any guidelines or expert recommendations endorse it for hot flashes. After that, I should review the pathophysiology of hot flashes to assess biological plausibility. Finally, I will consider safety issues that might influence risk–benefit even if someone contemplated off-label use and conclude with a clear clinical recommendation supported by references.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications and pharmacology of montelukast, because if there were a legitimate indication for hot flashes, it would likely be reflected in labeling or authoritative compendia. Montelukast is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) indicated for asthma maintenance, allergic rhinitis, prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and certain off-label uses such as adjunctive therapy in chronic urticaria; none of these relate to vasomotor symptoms or menopausal hot flashes, which immediately makes me cautious about any claim that it treats hot flashes [^1125StHs] [^116kyPDG].

> Wait, let me verify whether any randomized trials, reviews, or guidelines list montelukast as a therapy for hot flashes before I jump to conclusions. I should double-check major evidence summaries and guideline statements on nonhormonal hot flash therapies. Systematic reviews and guidelines emphasize SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, clonidine, and more recently NK3 receptor antagonists as nonhormonal options; montelukast is not mentioned as a therapy for vasomotor symptoms in these documents, which strongly suggests a lack of evidence for efficacy in this domain [^116iKTNu] [^112qFGKd] [^116KAfTm] [^112ywRdJ].

> Hold on, I should verify biological plausibility, because mechanism matters here. Hot flashes arise from central dysregulation of thermoregulatory circuits in the hypothalamus involving kisspeptin–neurokinin B–dynorphin (KNDy) neurons and NK3 receptor signaling; therapies that modulate this pathway, such as NK3 antagonists, have shown robust reductions in hot flash frequency and severity, which is mechanistically coherent. Montelukast blocks leukotriene CysLT1 receptors in the leukotriene pathway, a peripheral inflammatory axis not established as a mediator of central thermoregulatory dysregulation, making a benefit on hot flashes biologically implausible [^112J2Bjv] [^116iKTNu] [^111uSqBV] [^116HuZ4H] [^116kyPDG].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could there be indirect effects or off-target central actions that help hot flashes? I need to check whether any clinical signal exists in trials or observational studies. I should confirm if any of the hot flash trials or meta-analyses even list leukotriene antagonists. They do not, reinforcing that there is no clinical evidence base for montelukast in vasomotor symptoms, whereas agents like fezolinetant and elinzanetant, which target NK3 or NK1/NK3 pathways, have phase 2/3 data showing meaningful reductions in frequency and severity of hot flashes, underscoring that the NK3 axis — not leukotriene blockade — is the relevant therapeutic target [^1122A7Xn] [^112ywRdJ] [^116iKTNu].

> Next, I should review safety considerations because even if someone considered off-label use, risk–benefit matters. Montelukast carries a boxed warning for serious neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including suicidal ideation, depression, agitation, and sleep disturbances; respiratory guidelines and the FDA also advise reserving its use, particularly for allergic rhinitis, given these risks and the availability of safer alternatives. Given the absence of efficacy data for hot flashes, exposing patients to these neuropsychiatric risks is not justified [^116PcPVk] [^116DvfPo] [^113QfMAA] [^115LUo1V].

> But wait, what if the patient is considering montelukast for a different underlying reason, like flushing from mast cell activation rather than classic menopausal vasomotor symptoms? I should confirm that distinction. Mast cell–related flushing and hypotensive spells are mechanistically different from menopausal hot flashes; in MCAS, modulation of leukotrienes or prostaglandin D2 may be reasonable in select cases, but that is not a rationale to treat menopausal vasomotor symptoms with montelukast. This distinction is important to avoid conflating diagnoses and treatments [^114QMdv9].

> I will now examine what to recommend instead, to ensure the advice is clinically actionable. For bothersome vasomotor symptoms, evidence-based nonhormonal options include SSRIs/SNRIs such as paroxetine or venlafaxine, gabapentin, clonidine, and NK3 antagonists like fezolinetant or dual NK1/NK3 antagonists like elinzanetant, with selection tailored to comorbidities, contraindications, and patient preference. These therapies have randomized data and guideline support, unlike montelukast, which lacks any supportive evidence for hot flashes [^116iKTNu] [^112qFGKd] [^116KAfTm] [^1122A7Xn] [^112ywRdJ].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Montelukast is not used for hot flashes. There is no evidence of efficacy, the mechanism is not aligned with the pathophysiology of vasomotor symptoms, and there are meaningful neuropsychiatric safety concerns that would outweigh any hypothetical benefit. Clinicians should use guideline-supported nonhormonal therapies for hot flashes and avoid montelukast for this indication [^1125StHs] [^116iKTNu] [^113HS6nh] [^116DvfPo].

---

Montelukast is **not recommended** for hot flashes because there is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use for vasomotor symptoms [^116iKTNu]. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist approved for asthma and allergic rhinitis [^1125StHs], with **no known effect on hot flashes** [^116iKTNu]. Standard nonhormonal options such as SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, or NK3 receptor antagonists (e.g. fezolinetant) are preferred [^116iKTNu] [^112ywRdJ]. Montelukast should not be used for hot flashes due to lack of efficacy and potential neuropsychiatric risks [^116DvfPo].

---

## Mechanism of action and clinical indications

Montelukast is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist that blocks cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction in asthma and allergic rhinitis [^116kyPDG]. It is **FDA-approved** for:

- Asthma (maintenance therapy) [^1125StHs]
- Allergic rhinitis (seasonal and perennial) [^112Ug5CU]
- Prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^112uDJj3]

Montelukast has **no known effect on hot flashes**, which are driven by hypothalamic thermoregulatory pathways unrelated to leukotriene signaling [^111uSqBV].

---

## Evidence regarding montelukast for hot flashes

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting montelukast for hot flashes; no randomized controlled trials or observational studies have evaluated its efficacy or safety for vasomotor symptoms [^notfound]. The absence of evidence and lack of a plausible mechanism make it an inappropriate choice for hot flashes [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with established treatments

Established nonhormonal treatments for hot flashes include:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Evidence level** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SSRIs/SNRIs | Serotonin modulation | High | Moderate |
| Gabapentin | Calcium channel modulation | High | Moderate |
| NK3 receptor antagonists (e.g. fezolinetant) | Neurokinin B blockade | High | High |
| Montelukast | Leukotriene receptor antagonist | None | No evidence |

---

Montelukast **lacks evidence** and is **inferior to these options** [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations

Montelukast has a **boxed warning** for serious neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including agitation, depression, and suicidal ideation [^116DvfPo]. Given the absence of benefit for hot flashes, these risks further argue against its use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

No guideline or expert recommendation supports montelukast for hot flashes; it is not mentioned in menopause or oncology guidelines, and its approved indications are limited to asthma and allergic rhinitis [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Montelukast is **not recommended** for hot flashes due to lack of evidence and potential neuropsychiatric risks [^116DvfPo]. Clinicians should use **established nonhormonal therapies** (SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, NK3 receptor antagonists) for vasomotor symptoms [^116iKTNu] [^112ywRdJ].

### Factors associated with high placebo response in clinical studies of hot flashes: a meta-analysis [^115verRF]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Importance

High placebo response can often mask the evaluation of active treatment in clinical studies for women with hot flashes and potentially undermine the evaluation of new treatments.

Objective

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the factors associated with high placebo response (defined as the reduction in the mean number of hot flash frequency from baseline) in randomized, controlled, double-blind studies enrolling women with hot flashes.

Evidence Review

To identify eligible studies, Embase, MEDLINE, and BIOSIS Previews were searched for English-language articles published between April 1975 and August 2020. Placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized studies that assessed changes in hot flash frequency were included if they satisfied the defined criteria. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses using categorical and numerical data. Categorical data included the following variables and levels in brackets: active treatment type (hormone therapy /non- hormone therapy /complementary and alternative medicine), administration route (oral/non-oral), study region (in/excluded the US), breast cancer population (in/excluded), entry criteria of hot flash severity (moderate to severe only/all included), parallel or crossover study, placebo run-in period before treatment (yes/no), and menopausal status (postmenopausal only/include perimenopausal/include premenopausal). Numerical data included published year, pretreatment period duration, treatment period duration, number of sites, number of total participants, number of placebo participants, number of treatment arms, mean age, BMI, and hot flash frequency at baseline.

Findings

Forty-three of the 802 identified publications were included in the review. Multivariate analysis identified three individual factors associated with high placebo response: treatment period duration, number of treatment arms, and BMI.

Conclusions and Relevance

We identified several factors associated with high placebo response in clinical studies of women with hot flashes. Knowing these factors may enable proactive implementation of operational and analytic strategies that further aid in determining the true treatment effect of an intervention.

Other Step 3 treatment options for adults and adolescents — For adult patients sensitized to house dust mite with suboptimally controlled asthma despite low- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), consider adding sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) provided FEV1 is > 70% predicted. Increasing ICS to medium dose is less effective at a population level than adding a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), and other less efficacious options are low-dose ICS-containing therapy plus either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or low-dose, sustained-release theophylline; note the concerns about neuropsychiatric adverse effects with montelukast.

### Does the placebo effect on hot flashes depend on the placebo dose? [^113s6TrJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the presence of a placebo dose-response effect in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose hot flash clinical trials conducted at Mayo Clinic.

Methods

Hot flash score, frequency, and hot flash-related distress for each placebo dose level were summarized at each time point by mean and standard deviation and changes from baseline were plotted to visualize a possible placebo dose-effect response. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted for each endpoint in the highest and lowest dosage arms across the four trials.

Results

Longitudinal plots of mean hot flash scores, frequencies, and hot flash-related distress scores in patients taking placebo in each study showed a decline in hot flash scores over time without any clinically meaningful differences between the lowest and highest dosage arms in each study. The meta-analysis for each endpoint in the highest and lowest dosage arms across the four trials revealed no clinically important differences either.

Conclusion

While the current study cannot rule out the existence of a placebo dose-response effect in multi-dose placebo-controlled trials in patients with hot flashes or other conditions, it suggests, along with the available data in the placebo literature, that, at least in well-conducted multi-dose clinical trials in which the placebo was used as control, such an effect, if it exists at all, should be very small. Therefore, pooling data from different placebo subgroups is unlikely to compromise the validity of comparisons between the combined placebo arms and each treatment arm.

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism as a novel treatment for menopausal hot flushes: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115qca4B]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

For the first 2 weeks of the protocol (baseline period) data were collected to establish participants' steady state, to ensure familiarity with recording symptoms and completing the questionnaires appropriately, and to enable review of the inclusion criteria regarding number and severity of flushes at the end of week 2. Participants were then randomly assigned to either 4 weeks of MLE4901 (40 mg, orally, twice daily; group 1) or exact-match placebo (group 2) followed by a 2 week washout period (half-life of MLE4901 is 8.5 h). The dose of MLE4901 was chosen following a recent study in polycystic ovarian syndrome that showed 40 mg twice daily was biologically active and safe. The participants then received 4 weeks of whichever intervention they did not receive first followed by 2 weeks of monitoring to ensure they were monitored for the same length of time after dosing irrespective of treatment assignment order (figure 1).

Figure 1
Summary of protocol

Baseline period: participants underwent a 2 week period to gather baseline data on hot flush frequency, severity, bother, and interference (Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale). If the inclusion criteria regarding hot flush frequency and severity were met at the end of this period then they were assigned to the active phase of the study. Intervention 1 (double-blind): all participants randomly assigned to either 4 weeks of treatment with oral, twice daily 40 mg MLE4901 or exact-match placebo. Washout period: all participants underwent a 2 week washout period after intervention 1 (half-life of MLE4901 is 8.5 h). Intervention 2 (double-blind): all participants then switched to receive either 4 weeks of treatment with oral, twice daily exact-match placebo or oral, twice daily 40 mg MLE4901 depending on which intervention they received first. Monitoring period: a subsequent 2 week period to complete safety monitoring.

### Hot flushes [^112J2Bjv]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Almost every woman and some men will encounter hot flushes during their lifetime. Despite the prevalence of the symptoms, the pathophysiology of hot flushes remains unknown. A decline in hormone concentrations might lead to alterations in brain neurotransmitters and to instability in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory setpoint. The most effective treatments for hot flushes include oestrogens and progestagens. However, many women and their physicians are reluctant to accept hormonal treatments. Women want non-pharmacological treatments but unfortunately such treatments are not very effective, and non-hormonal drugs are often associated with adverse effects. Results from recent studies showed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other similar compounds can safely reduce hot flushes. Moreover, the efficacy of these drugs provides new insight into the pathophysiology of hot flushes. In this critical review, we assess knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of hot flushes.

### Estradiol (evamist) [^113oMiXF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms in Postmenopausal Women

In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a total of 454 postmenopausal women (average 53 years of age, 70 percent Caucasian and 24 percent African-American) were randomized and received at least one dose of Evamist (one, two or three 90 mcL sprays) or placebo. Generally healthy postmenopausal women were enrolled with a mean total frequency of ≥ 56 moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per week (≥ 8 per day).

Efficacy was determined as a statistically significant and clinically significant (at least two per day or 14 per week difference) reduction in hot flush frequency and a statistically significant reduction in severity for Evamist versus placebo. One, two or three daily sprays of Evamist were shown to be better than placebo for relief of frequency (Table 3) and severity (Table 4) of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 4 and Week 12.

### Alternatives to hormone therapy for hot flashes: many choices but science is lacking [^113dHJyC]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario

A 51-year-old postmenopausal third-grade teacher requests help for her hot flashes. She finds them especially troubling as she stands in front of her class and starts sweating. Although one student offers her tissues, others make fun of her — disrupting the class. Her sleep is interrupted several times a night. She refuses to use any form of estrogen because her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 60 years. Perhaps alternative therapies can help her.

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism as a novel treatment for menopausal hot flushes: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1151cYmR]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

From each model, adjusted (least squares) means and differences between treatment means were estimated, together with associated 95% CIs, and a p value from a comparison of the mean values of the two treatments. For each endpoint, the percentage change from baseline was also estimated using a generalised linear mixed model (with gamma error structure) with fold-change from baseline as the analysed response, with percentage change (and 95% CI) derived by calculation from the fold-change results. This ensures that the percentage change results take into account the crossover design.

All of these analyses were prespecified as per the study protocol. The primary and all secondary endpoints were analysed using both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis sets, and all p values and adjusted means for all endpoints were very similar. Accordingly, results have been presented for the intention-to-treat and per-protocol sets for the primary endpoint and for the per-protocol set only for the secondary endpoints as originally planned (though intention-to-treat analyses for the secondary outcomes as well as the per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome are reported in the appendix). To facilitate the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary endpoint, weekly total flush counts were imputed where missing by setting the count totals to be equal on both active and placebo treatment groups. However, we also did a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint intention-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation techniques, and this gave similar results to those reported below, with a slightly larger estimate of treatment effect. The multiple imputation method was used for all intention-to-treat analyses of secondary endpoints. All significant p values reported remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (using the false discovery rate) procedure. The study was registered at, number.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^116pFC83]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Second-generation oral antihistamine combinations and montelukast-specific cautions — OAH 2G + INCS have not been shown to have any additive benefit over using just the INCS. For OAH 2G + LTRA, there is lack of adequate evidence of added efficacy to make a specific recommendation for or against this combination versus monotherapy; with the serious neuropsychiatric events reported with montelukast, this combination should rarely be used, and montelukast should generally be reserved for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies.

### Newer antidepressants for hot flashes – should their efficacy still be up for debate? [^116EZUNS]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Newer antidepressants have been shown in clinical trials to reduce hot flashes, although not as well as do hormones. Nonetheless, a recently published meta-analysis and subsequent editorial raised doubts with regard to the utility of newer antidepressants for treating hot flashes. Concerns about the lack of efficacy of newer antidepressants on hot flashes were based in large part on results of two placebo-controlled, double-blind trials, one evaluating venlafaxine and the other individually evaluating both fluoxetine and citalopram. These two studies have repeatedly been put forward as evidence that newer antidepressants are not definitively proven to reduce hot flashes.

Design

Raw data from these two randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating second-generation antidepressants for hot flashes were obtained. These data and subsequent study conclusions are evaluated and discussed in the context of other published trial data regarding the use of newer antidepressants for treating hot flashes.

Results

Examination of the raw data from these two trials revealed that neither employed a baseline period of hot flash determination against which to calculate changes over time from baseline.

Conclusions

Recognition that these two trials cannot be used to look at hot flash frequency or score changes from baseline limits their ability to inform the efficacy literature about the use of newer antidepressants for hot flash reduction.

These problems range from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, acid reflux, IBS, H pylori and newly diagnosed celiac, to name only a few. Could montelukast use substantially impact the microbiome balance to cause a chronic GI illness. Could this explain the chemical sensitivities that are experienced during and after use. A recent study in Nature. lists Montelukast as a drug that alters
- and is altered by
- the bacteria in the microbiome. Montelukast was one of several drugs that were both bioaccumulated by some gut bacteria and degraded by others. 9 INCREASED SENSITIVITIES Our members continue to report extreme reactions to other medications, additives, heat. artificial sweeteners, sugar, alcohol, and chemicals as well as a very heightened response to viruses and infections after discontinuing montelukast. Some patients also report the sudden onset of mast cell activation symptoms after stopping.

Could heightened sensitivities experienced after suffering an adverse reaction to montelukast be caused by montelukast-induced microglia dysfunction. prompted many questions for us. We know that the neuroimmune system is an adaptive system that "learns how to behave. " Perhaps when montelukast is present, the body/brain "learns" to reduce proinflammatory microglial activity. If montelukast programs microglia to relax, and stay relaxed in the brain, what. happens when montelukast is withdrawn abruptly. Is it possible that microglia are suddenly activated and enter an overt protective phase to defend against everything, and perhaps no longer be sensitized to a true threat. If that is the case, it is possible montelukast robs the microglia's ability to distinguish between a true threat in the central. being on montelukast dysregulate the immune system. Montelukast side effects include tonsillitis, which can lead to PANDAS.

Those who suffer from PANS or PANDAS often carry an infection that has crossed over into the brain11. Mice using montelukast showed increased Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial counts from nasal lavage.

### Montelukast treatment of urticaria [^116CTAf9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical trial data to determine the benefits of using montelukast alone or as combination therapy in the treatment of urticaria.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-March 2006) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-October 2005) were searched to find clinical trial publications that addressed the use of montelukast in urticaria.

Data Synthesis

Six clinical trials were identified. Montelukast was compared alone and as combination therapy with nonsedating histamine1-receptor antagonists to determine efficacy and safety. Patients had chronic or physical urticaria. The results were mixed. Some studies demonstrated that montelukast can decrease urticarial symptoms with minimal adverse effects, while others found no differences.

Conclusion

Large-scale, controlled trials are needed to determine which patients would likely benefit from treatment with montelukast.

### Commonly used types of postmenopausal estrogen for treatment of hot flashes: scientific review [^111ZrdZs]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Recommendations for postmenopausal hormone therapy have changed since the Women's Health Initiative indicated that estrogen was harmful for use in disease prevention; however, treatment of menopausal symptoms with low-dose estrogen remains an approved indication for use.

Objective

To compare the short-term efficacy and adverse effects of 2 commonly used estrogens, conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and 17beta-estradiol, for reducing menopausal hot flashes by systematically reviewing randomized controlled trials.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry were searched from the database start dates to July 2003 using database-specific key words. Reference lists of published articles, experts, and pharmaceutical manufacturers were also consulted.

Study Selection

English-language abstracts of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials and systematic evidence reviews of oral CEE and oral and transdermal 17beta-estradiol, and treatment of menopausal hot flashes and their adverse effects.

Data Extraction

Study design, population characteristics, eligibility criteria, interventions, withdrawals, adverse effects, and results for each outcome. Study quality was assessed using predefined criteria based on parameters developed with the US Preventive Services Task Force and the UK National Health Services Centre.

Data Synthesis

A total of 32 trials including 4 head-to-head comparisons met inclusion criteria; 14 trials met criteria for meta-analysis. All estrogen agents significantly reduced the weekly number of hot flashes compared with placebo (CEE, 1 trial: mean change, -19.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] -33.0 to -5.1; oral 17beta-estradiol, 5 trials: pooled weighted mean difference, -16.8; 95% CI, -23.4 to -10.2; transdermal 17beta-estradiol, 6 trials: pooled weighted mean difference, -22.4; 95% CI, -35.9 to -10.4); differences between agents were not significant. Breast tenderness and atypical vaginal bleeding were the most frequently reported adverse effects among estrogen users. The influence of progestin or progesterone use, cyclic and continuous regimens, and differences in adverse effects could not be determined.

Conclusion

Conjugated equine estrogen and 17beta-estradiol have consistent and comparable effects on treatment of menopausal hot flashes and may have similar short-term adverse effects.

### Clinical investigation of RAD1901, a novel estrogen receptor ligand, for the treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms: a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging, proof-of-concept trial [^11649Ru5]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of RAD1901, an oral estrogen receptor ligand, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms of menopause.

Methods

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging, proof-of-concept trial. Postmenopausal women with a minimum of 7 moderate-to-severe, diary-reported hot flashes per day, or 50 per week, were randomized to one of five blinded dose groups (0 [placebo], 10, 25, 50, or 100mg RAD1901 daily for 28 d). Efficacy endpoints included frequency and severity of hot flashes over 4 weeks of treatment.

Results

One hundred participants were randomized across the five treatment regimens. The frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flashes decreased in all groups over the treatment period (mean percent change from baseline at 4 wk, -54.1%, -77.2%, -51.8%, -53.8%, and -67.0% for placebo, 10, 25, 50, and 100mg groups). The response in the 10mg group was significantly different from placebo at 4 weeks (P = 0.024). No other dose group was significantly different from placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in severity of hot flashes between placebo and any dose group. Treatment was well tolerated; most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Daily treatment with 10mg RAD1901 over 4 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flashes compared with placebo, with an acceptable safety profile. Further clinical trials are warranted to investigate RAD1901's utility as a potential treatment for vasomotor symptoms.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^114QMdv9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — leukotriene pathway modulation, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)–targeting with aspirin, cromolyn, and glucocorticosteroids are described: Other therapies include cysteinyl leukotriene receptor blocking agents, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, or the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton, and these medications might work best in conjunction with H1R antihistamines, being most efficacious for dermatologic symptoms. Aspirin has been used to attenuate refractory flushing and hypotensive spells associated with PGD2 secretion by inhibiting its synthesis and should be introduced in a controlled clinical setting because of the risk of triggering MC degranulation. Oral cromolyn is used predominantly for gastrointestinal symptoms, and cromolyn taken orally or applied topically also might reduce pruritus; patients should be counseled that the onset of action can be delayed and should be taken for at least 1 month before deciding whether it is helping, and dosing can be gradually increased to 200 mg 4 times a day, given before each meal and at bedtime. Systemic steroids might help some patients, as indicated in case reports, but should be tapered as quickly as possible to limit their numerous adverse effects.

### Therapeutic hotline: cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^116BbjQQ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Experimental data suggest a role for cysteinyl leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of atopy giving a rationale for its use in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic urticaria management. A few clinical observations and small trials suggest that montelukast may be used in an adjunctive manner as an effective therapeutic option for all age categories affected by moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Our own observations proved that montelukast as a prospective corticosteroid-sparing option in the complex therapeutic strategy of corticosteroid-dependent atopic dermatitis patients, even in the severe erythrodermic cases.

### Management of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors and men with prostate cancer [^116akCQW]. Current Oncology Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Hot flashes are a significant complaint among many breast cancer survivors and many men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Several therapeutic approaches are available to the suffering man or woman. Many of these individuals have tried nonpharmacologic and nonconventional approaches. However, most nonpharmacologic treatments have not been compared with placebo or were not more effective than placebo in prospective, randomized clinical trials. The most effective nonhormonal treatments for hot flashes include agents from the selective serotonin or noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI) family. Paroxetine, 10 mg/d, or venlafaxine, 37.5 mg/d, are reasonable initial dosages, and if symptoms do not improve within a week or two, the dosage can be doubled. Gabapentin appears to provide similar benefits, but direct comparisons have not been reported. Because of the strong association between gonadal hormones and breast and prostate cancer, the use of hormonal agents to treat hot flashes in these patients has been limited. However, such hormonal therapies as depomedroxyprogesterone acetate can be prescribed for an informed individual who experiences bothersome symptoms despite nonhormonal treatments.

### Oxybutynin for refractory hot flashes in cancer patients [^1124tMJi]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

There is little information available on the treatment of hot flashes in patients refractory to pharmaceutical interventions. Anecdotal evidence led to the use of oxybutynin for the management of hot flashes in refractory cancer patients; therefore, we performed a retrospective chart review of such patients to determine the effect of oxybutynin in treating hot flashes and to observe the side effects of the drug in these patients.

Design

A prospective database of all patients treated for hot flashes was started in July 2004 and was retrospectively analyzed as of March 2006. Also included were individual charts preceding July 2004. Fifty-two patient charts were examined. Demographic information was obtained along with baseline severity and frequency of hot flashes, dose and duration of treatment with oxybutynin, patient response to oxybutynin, and side effects.

Results

More than 90% of patients analyzed were refractory to hot flash treatments before starting oxybutynin. Seventy percent of patients showed a partial or excellent response to oxybutynin. The duration of oxybutynin use ranged from 2 weeks to 5 years with more than half of patients currently on oxybutynin or taking oxybutynin for longer than 6 months. Of those patients who experienced an excellent or partial response to treatment, 12% stopped because of documented oxybutynin-related side effects within 4 weeks.

Conclusion

Oxybutynin seems promising in the management of hot flashes with tolerable side effects in the majority of refractory patients. A placebo-controlled, randomized study is being developed to look more closely at the effectiveness of oxybutynin in reducing hot flashes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111ogogi]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Leukotriene modifiers (leukotriene receptor antagonists, LTRA) target one part of the inflammatory pathway in asthma and are sometimes used as an option for maintenance therapy, mainly only in children. When used alone they are less effective than low-dose ICS, and when added to ICS they are less effective than ICS-LABA; medications include montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton. Adverse effects include elevated liver function tests with zileuton and zafirlukast, and there are concerns in adults and children about risk of serious behavioral and mood changes, including suicidal ideation, associated with montelukast that should be discussed with patients/parents/caregivers.

### TX-001HR is associated with a clinically meaningful effect on severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in the REPLENISH trial [^112giJPS]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical meaningfulness

The four coprimary efficacy endpoints of the REPLENISH trial were mean changes from baseline to weeks 4 and 12 in the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS with E2/P4 compared with placebo. Participants in the VMS substudy completed a daily VMS diary and recorded the number and severity of hot flushes up to week 12. Severity of VMS was defined as mild (sensation of heat without sweating), moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity), or severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Baseline weekly severity score was calculated by: [(number of moderate hot flushes for 7 days) × 2 + (number of severe hot flushes for 7 days) × 3]/(total number of moderate to severe hot flushes over 7 days), and on treatment weekly severity score was calculated by: [(number of mild hot flushes for 7 days) × 1 + (number of moderate hot flushes for 7 days) × 2 + (number of severe hot flushes for 7 days) × 3] / (total number of mild, moderate, and severe hot flushes over 7 days).

The clinical meaningfulness of treatment to patients was assessed using the CGI scale, which was a secondary endpoint of the trial. Participants answered the following question at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, and 12: " Rate the total improvement, whether or not in your judgment it is due entirely to drug treatment. Compared to your condition at admission to the study, how much has it changed?" using a 7-point Likert scale corresponding to very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse. The proportion of participants for each CGI category was summarized at weeks 4 and 12, and each E2/P4 dose was compared with placebo using the Fisher's exact test. Note that when a subset of participants from the VMS substudy were queried about what the term "condition" meant, all confirmed it referred to their VMS.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^115wKAXM]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes collected for participants were unmet needs with current available VMS treatments, willingness to use new VMS treatments, and expectations for new VMS treatments.

Unmet needs with available VMS treatments

Unmet needs with current available VMS treatments were assessed to elucidate the perceived impact of current treatments on symptom improvement, benefits of current treatments, risks of current treatments, and women's and physicians' involvement in treatment decision-making.

Survey participants rated symptom improvement based on the extent to which current VMS treatments improved hot flashes, night sweats, sleep, mood, sexual desire, work, concentration, disruption in daily activities, and quality of life on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all, a little, somewhat, quite a bit, very much).

Perceived benefits of current treatments were rated based on treatment features that met women's and physicians' expectations based on their self-report, including improvement of hot flashes and night sweats, improvement in quality of life, no short-term side effects, minor side effects that required minimal treatment, limited or no long-term safety concerns, convenience of mode of administration, treatment frequency, insurance coverage, low out-of-pocket costs, and an "other" category.

Expectations of new treatments

Expectations of new VMS treatments were assessed based on "women's and physicians" expectations for whether a new treatment was better at reducing frequency of hot flashes and night sweats, was better at reducing severity of hot flashes and night sweats, would improve sleep quality, would reduce the impact of hot flashes and night sweats on work, would improve mood disruptions, would improve sex drive, and would improve general quality of life. Expectations also included how the treatment would be delivered (ie, pill, patch, ring, or topical formulation), how often it would be administered (ie, once daily or less than once daily), if it would have no/fewer interactions with other drugs, if it would lower risk of short-term side effects, if it would have limited/no long-term safety concerns, if it would be covered by insurance/lower cost, and an "other" category.

### TX-001HR is associated with a clinically meaningful effect on severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in the REPLENISH trial [^116zTP6s]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this post hoc analysis from the REPLENISH trial, reducing VMS severity was considered clinically meaningful by participants. This is the first report of an HT product demonstrating that reductions in VMS severity observed with treatment were clinically meaningful to women.

Careful assessment of patients' views on benefits and risks are an important part of the regulatory decision-making process when evaluating the efficacy of a product. The FDA considers patients to be the experts on what it is like to live with their condition; however, patients' main complaints may not be factored explicitly into drug development plans, including measures of a particular drug's benefit in planned clinical trials. Clinically meaningful effects of an intervention can be measured with PROs, which assess how a patient feels or functions in daily life. An MCID can be defined as the smallest change in a PRO endpoint score that is considered beneficial and important to patients, whereas a CID can be defined as a threshold at which the treatment outcome is experienced as relevant and clinically meaningful by the patient.

In VMS clinical trials, the efficacy assessment of products for menopausal VMS is often based on statistically significant reductions of VMS severity and frequency with treatment compared with placebo as well as comparing the proportion of clinically meaningful responders by treatment groups using PROs. - A reduction of at least 2 hot flushes per day or 14 hot flushes per week has been suggested, by some, to determine whether a treatment is clinically beneficial to patients; however, this does not consider a possible clinically meaningful reduction in VMS severity. An absolute reduction of 2 hot flushes per day or 14 hot flushes per week between treatment and placebo, - is dependent on placebo response rates and may not be sufficient to determine the lowest effective dose in patients who may have more severe, but less frequent hot flushes; treatment for these patients may be different.

(A) Whole group ITT analysis (n = 37) irrespective of treatment assignment order using adjusted means from crossover analysis with 95% CIs: percentage change in hot flush frequency (total number of hot flushes) during the final week of the 4 week treatment period with MLE4901 and placebo compared with hot flush frequency (total number of hot flushes) during the final week of the 2 week baseline period. Statistical analysis incorporated a total of seven daily counts for each of the study weeks analysed, and is based on a crossover model including treatment and period as fixed effects, subject as a random effect (within sequence), and baseline flush count as a covariate. All other possible demographic covariates were tested in the model but none were significant and therefore all were excluded from the final model. The model used is a generalised linear model with gamma error structure. Tests for sequence (order), and period, effect across all our models confirmed neither were significant.

### Minimal decrease in hot flashes desired by postmenopausal women in family practice [^113dV467]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the minimal important difference in the frequency and severity of hot flashes that postmenopausal women desire from a nonhormonal agent.

Design

Women recorded their number of hot flashes daily, along with their degree of severity, using a diary for 1 week and completed the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Women were asked to report the percentage reduction in hot flashes that they would find clinically important. Distribution-based estimates were used to estimate the minimal important difference.

Results

Approximately 69% of the postmenopausal women who reported their hot flashes as moderate to severe responded that they wanted a nonhormonal agent that provided at least a 50% mean reduction in the frequency of hot flashes (95% CI, 32% to 66%). Median hot flash reduction for all respondents was 50%.

Conclusions

The minimal clinically important difference in hot flashes is approximately 50%. This estimate can provide the basis to calculate sample size in clinical trials of anti-hot flash agents and in selecting possible candidates for investigation.

### Methodologic lessons learned from hot flash studies [^113BovGA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

In the course of conducting a series of prospective clinical trials devoted to defining new treatment opportunities for hot flashes in cancer survivors, considerable experience has been acquired with related methodologic issues. This article has been written in response to many queries regarding this methodology.

Patients and Methods

A series of seven different clinical trials that involved 968 patients was used for this work. Reliable and valid definitions of hot flash intensity were developed from patient-reported descriptions. Concomitant validity and reliability assessment of patient-completed diaries was undertaken to compare hot flash data with toxicity and quality-of-life (QOL) end points and to examine consistency across patient groups using variability analysis and correlation procedures. Parametric data from this meta-analysis was used to examine relative power considerations for the design of phase II and phase III clinical trials.

Results

Daily diaries used in these studies exhibited consistency and reliability and had few missing data. Hot flash frequency and hot flash score (frequency multiplied by average severity) variables produced almost identical end point results. For phase III placebo-controlled studies, 50 patients per treatment arm seem appropriate to provide sufficient power specifications to detect a clinically meaningful change in hot flash activity. For phase II trials, 25 patients per trial seem to provide reasonable estimates of eventual hot flash efficacy to screen potential agents for more definitive testing.

Conclusion

Given the data gained from these experiences, we can plan and carry out more efficient trials to identify efficacious agents for the reduction of hot flash activity.

3.13 Vasomotor symptoms

Recent studies suggest that up to 80% of men on ADT have vasomotor symptoms, principally involving hot flashes, and 27% cited this side effect as the most bothersome. 97 Hot flashes can be associated with sleep disturbance and are a major contributor to the discontinuation of ADT. Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat men with hot flashes and there have been very few placebo‐controlled trials. The panel recognizes that hot flashes are a significant side effect of ADT. Of all the agents that are currently being used to treat hot flashes in men receiving ADT, none have an FDA approved indication for this use and each is associated with side effects (Table 7). Clinicians should have an informed discussion of off‐label options for pharmacologic management of hot flashes in men who wish to use medical therapies to reduce their symptoms. The NCCN guideline notes that vasomotor symptoms are a known side effect of ADT, with side effects of continuous ADT increasing with duration of treatment. As such, the guideline recommends that patients be advised of these risks before initiating treatment. 9

### Centrally active nonhormonal hot flash therapies [^115cAJr9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Given the problems associated with hormonal therapy, and the prominent problem of hot flashes in menopausal women, there is a need for nonhormonal agents to alleviate hot flashes. Several compounds that appear to act on the central nervous system have been investigated. Potential mechanisms for their effects on hot flashes have been described. Bellergal (no longer available on the US market, where it was known as Bellergal-S), a combination preparation sedative that consists of low-dose phenobarbital, ergotamine tartrate, and levorotatory alkaloids of belladonna, is an old agent that was popular approximately 20 years ago; however, there is limited suggestion of efficacy for this agent. Clonidine, an older antihypertensive drug, is another centrally active agent that has been studied. Randomized trials have demonstrated that it clearly works for reducing hot flashes, but the magnitude of efficacy is somewhat limited. Toxicity from this agent limits its utility in the clinic. Methyldopa is another centrally active agent that has been studied but to a more limited degree. It appears to have minimal efficacy and too much toxicity to make it clinically useful. Anecdotal observations from a number of sources suggested that newer antidepressants can alleviate hot flashes. This led to pilot trials of venlafaxine and paroxetine, with results suggesting benefit from both drugs. Subsequently, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of venlafaxine, paroxetine, and fluoxetine were conducted. All 3 of these clinical trials demonstrated statistically significant reductions in hot flashes with these newer antidepressants compared with placebo. Pilot trials of citalopram and mirtazapine, 2 other newer antidepressants, have also suggested efficacy. Toxicity evaluations have suggested that these agents are, again, well tolerated by the majority of patients. A recent trial, however, was unable to demonstrate any benefit for fluoxetine or citalopram over a placebo. Anecdotal observations also suggested that gabapentin was helpful for alleviating hot flashes. This led to pilot trials that again suggested efficacy. Subsequently, 2 large placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trials were conducted. Both of these demonstrated statistically significant efficacy for gabapentin compared with a placebo. This drug is relatively well tolerated by most patients. Thus, centrally active nonhormonal agents clearly do decrease hot flashes in women. The most efficacious and clinically appropriate agents for use are newer antidepressants and gabapentin. Continued evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of these agents is ongoing.

Montelukast is FDA-approved for asthma and allergies. It is a prescription medicine approved to prevent asthma attacks and for long-term treatment of asthma in adults and children 1 year and older. It is also approved to prevent exercise-induced asthma in patients 6 years and older. In addition, it is approved to help control the nasal symptoms of seasonal outdoor allergies in patients 2 years and older and year-round indoor allergies in those 6 months and older. Montelukast works to help improve symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis by blocking substances in the body that may cause them. Montelukast was first approved by FDA in 1998. It is marketed under the brand name Singulair and as generics. Patients and parents/caregivers should stop montelukast and discuss with a health care professional right away if you or your child experience behavior or mood-related changes while taking the medicine. These may include:

- stuttering
- suicidal thoughts and actions
- tremor or shakiness
- trouble sleeping
- uncontrolled muscle movements.

### Efficacy of continuous transdermal nitroglycerin for treating hot flashes by inducing nitrate cross-tolerance in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a randomized clinical trial [^113b29Ek]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study FRAN was published by Alison J Huang and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Menopause. In the FRAN study, the trial question was: what is the effect of continuous transdermal nitroglycerin patches in patients with menopause-related hot flashes? In the FRAN study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the FRAN study, the population was: 134 female patients. The inclusion criteria were perimenopausal or postmenopausal females reporting ≥ 7 hot flashes per day. The key exclusion criteria were use of nitroglycerin or other nitrate-containing medications during the past 4 weeks; vaginal estrogen or progestins during the past 4 weeks or systemic estrogen during the past 12 weeks; other medications with potential efficacy for hot flashes during the past 4 weeks. In the FRAN study, the interventions were: n = 65 nitroglycerin (transdermal nitroglycerin patient-directed dose titration from 0.2–0.6 mg/hr) n = 69 placebo (matching placebo patches). In the FRAN study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in reduction in hot flash frequency per day at week 5 (4.5 vs. 3.6; AD 0.9, 95% CI -2.1 to 0.3). In the FRAN study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in reduction in moderate-to-severe hot flashes per day at week 5 (3.3 vs. 2.2; AD 1.1, 95% CI 0 to 2.2) No significant difference in reduction in total daily diary-based hot flash severity score at week 5 (8.3 points vs. 6.1 points; AD 2.2 points, 95% CI -0.4 to 4.7) No significant difference in reduction in hot flash frequency per day at week 12 (4.6 vs. 4.7; AD -0.1, 95% CI -1.2 to 1.4). In the FRAN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse event, headache. significant difference in headache at week 1 (65.7% vs. 5.6%). In the FRAN study, the conclusion was: in perimenopausal or postmenopausal females reporting ≥ 7 hot flashes per day, nitroglycerin was not superior to placebo with respect to reduction in hot flash frequency per day at week 5.

### Synthetic conjugated estrogens, a (cenestin) [^114CCFpg]. FDA (2004). Low credibility.

What is Cenestin?

Cenestin is a medicine that contains a mixture of synthetic estrogens made from a plant source.

What is Cenestin used for?

Cenestin is used after menopause to:

reduce moderate or severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

When estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Cenestin.
treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning in and around the vagina. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Cenestin to control these problems. If you use Cenestin only to treat your dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.

### The emerging therapeutic potential of kisspeptin and neurokinin B [^116HuZ4H]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Treating Menopausal Hot Flashes

Menopause is the complete cessation of menstruation due to ovarian insufficiency and occurs between ages 45 and 55 years. Hot flashes and sweats, collectively known as VMS, are the most debilitating symptom described by more than 80% of women during the menopausal transition. On average, symptoms last for 7 years, but they can persist, with 1 in 10 women experiencing symptoms for up to 12 years. Although hormone replacement therapy or menopausal hormone therapy is an effective treatment for VMS, it is contraindicated in women at high risk of breast and endometrial cancer as well as thromboembolic disease. Therefore, alternative treatments that can safely and effectively alleviate VMS are desired.

The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) of the hypothalamus is the control center for body temperature regulation and downstream thermoregulatory pathways. This thermoregulatory center is dysregulated during menopause and results in the activation of inappropriate heat dissipation responses including VMS. As ARC KNDy neurons project onto both NK3R expressing neurons in the MnPO and GnRH neurons in the median eminence, they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of menopausal VMS (see Fig. 5).

### Nonhormonal therapies for menopausal hot flashes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116iKTNu]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Concern regarding the adverse effects of estrogen and other hormones for treating menopausal symptoms has led to demand for other options; however, the efficacy and adverse effects of nonhormonal therapies are unclear.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of nonhormonal therapies for menopausal hot flashes by reviewing published randomized controlled trials.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-October 2005), PsycINFO (1974-October 2005), and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register Database (1966-October 2005) were searched for relevant trials that provided data on treatment of menopausal hot flashes using 1 or more nonhormonal therapies.

Study Selection

All English-language, published, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral nonhormonal therapies for treating hot flashes in menopausal women measuring and reporting hot flash frequency or severity outcomes.

Data Extraction

Trials were identified, subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and reviewed. Data on participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and trials were rated for quality based on established criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted for therapies with sufficient trials reporting hot flash frequency outcomes.

Data Synthesis

From 4249 abstracts, 43 trials met inclusion criteria, including 10 trials of antidepressants, 10 trials of clonidine, 6 trials of other prescribed medications, and 17 trials of isoflavone extracts. The number of daily hot flashes decreased compared with placebo in meta-analyses of 7 comparisons of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (mean difference, -1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.70 to -0.57), 4 trials of clonidine (-0.95; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.47), and 2 trials of gabapentin (-2.05; 95% CI, -2.80 to -1.30). Frequency was not reduced in meta-analysis of trials of red clover isoflavone extracts and results were mixed for soy isoflavone extracts. Evidence of the efficacy of other therapies is limited due to the small number of trials and their deficiencies. Trials do not compare different therapies head-to-head and relative efficacy cannot be determined.

Conclusion

The SSRIs or SNRIs, clonidine, and gabapentin trials provide evidence for efficacy; however, effects are less than for estrogen, few trials have been published and most have methodological deficiencies, generalizability is limited, and adverse effects and cost may restrict use for many women. These therapies may be most useful for highly symptomatic women who cannot take estrogen but are not optimal choices for most women.

### Estimation of placebo effect in randomized placebo-controlled trials for moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms: a meta-analysis [^1159sS9f]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Food and Drug Administration guidance recommended that for the indication of vasomotor symptoms (VMS), studies should enroll participants with minimum of seven to eight moderate to severe VMS per day at baseline, and coprimary endpoints should be the mean change in frequency/severity at weeks 4 and 12. This study aimed to estimate placebo effects in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) fulfilling this guidance.

Methods

PubMed was searched using the following terms: "vasomotor symptom or hot flash or hot flashes or hot flash or hot flashes [title/abstract]", "menopause or climacteric", "RCT or randomized controlled or randomized controlled", "placebo [title/abstract]", and "frequency or severity". Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) placebo controlled RCTs, (2) enrolling women with moderate or severe VMS with a minimal frequency more than seven to eight times per day or 50 times per week, and (3) efficacy measurements including mean change in VMS frequency from baseline at week 12. A random-effects model was used in the meta-analysis.

Results

Seventeen studies were included for the estimation of VMS frequency reduction and 13 studies for severity. Estimated change of VMS frequency in placebo arms was -5.44 times per day (95% CI, -5.81 to -5.07 times per day) at week 12. For VMS severity, the estimated change at week 12 was -0.36 (95% CI, -0.46 to -0.27).

Conclusion

Substantial and consistent placebo effects were observed in RCTs for VMS treatment. These data suggest a reduction of 5.44 times per day in frequency and 0.36 in severity might be observed as a placebo effect.

### An empirically validated responder definition for the reduction of moderate to severe hot flushes in postmenopausal women [^1156gdea]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to derive an empirically validated definition of treatment responders for the reduction of moderate to severe hot flushes in postmenopausal women.

Methods

This study used prospective blinded data analysis from a placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy of a treatment of moderate to severe hot flushes in postmenopausal women. Seven hundred ten postmenopausal women with at least 50 moderate to severe hot flushes per week participated in the study. The participants recorded the number of moderate to severe hot flushes each day in a diary. They also assessed their satisfaction with treatment on a Clinical Global Impression-improvement rating scale. Changes in the weekly number of moderate to severe hot flushes were compared with participants' self-assessments to derive an empirically validated minimal clinically important difference. This anchor-based value was compared with the conventional half-SD rule for minimal clinically important difference in participant-reported outcomes.

Results

Anchor- and distribution-based minimal clinically important differences between "no change/worse" and "minimally improved" were an absolute reduction of 19.1 and 18.6 in the weekly number of moderate to severe hot flushes, respectively. In addition, the threshold between "minimally improved" compared with "much improved or better" was determined, based on the anchor method, as an absolute reduction of 40.3 in the weekly number of moderate to severe hot flushes.

Conclusions

A responder was defined as having at least an improvement of 19.1 hot flushes per week at week 4 and an improvement of 40.3 hot flushes per week at week 12.

### Phase II evaluation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) for the treatment of hot flashes [^116JcYB2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hot flashes are a significant source of symptom burden that negatively impacts quality of life (QOL). For women who have contraindications to, or are unwilling to consider, estrogens or antidepressants for bothersome hot flashes, there are limited effective pharmacologic or complementary and alternative medicines.

Methods

This single-arm phase II trial studied the efficacy of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) for the treatment of hot flashes. Eligible women were required to have reported ≥ 14 hot flashes per week for ≥ 1 month. The patients were treated with SAMe at a dose of 400 mg twice daily to evaluate whether a reduction in hot flash score appeared to be better than the historical placebo response of approximately 25%. The women kept a daily hot flash diary during a baseline week and then daily during weeks 2–7. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 7 in hot flash score and hot flash frequency. Secondary endpoints included toxicity analyses and the effect of SAMe on QOL.

Results

From October 28, 2010 to January 30, 2012, 43 women were treated with SAMe. The decrease in mean percent of baseline hot flash score and frequency was 35.4 and 32.6%, respectively. When compared to the historical placebo response of 25%, the effect of SAMe on hot flash score was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Treatment was well tolerated with expected grade 1/2 gastrointestinal toxicity and no negative effect on QOL.

Conclusions

The use of SAMe does not appear to significantly reduce hot flashes more than would be expected with a placebo.

### Hot flashes: a review of pathophysiology and treatment modalities [^116QF2Mq]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Many therapies are being studied for the treatment of hot flashes for individuals with cancer, yet few studies have demonstrated safe and effective clinical benefit for those who suffer from this distressing symptom. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current options for the management of hot flashes, examining key endpoints from recent clinical trials and reviewing future directions. Hot flashes are a common stressful symptom for individuals with cancer, particularly women with a history of breast cancer and men with prostate cancer. Lifestyle modifications are proposed as the first step in the management of less severe hot flashes. Several publications have addressed nonhormonal agents as a treatment option for hot flashes. Newer antidepressant and anticonvulsant agents have been studied and show potential in treating vasomotor symptoms. Although many complementary and alternative therapies, including herbal medications and phytoestrogens, have been studied for the treatment of hot flashes, none are clinically recommended at this time. Additionally, further evidence is needed for supportive exercise such as yoga and relaxation techniques. Acupuncture may warrant further investigation in the reduction and severity of hot flashes in both men and women. Hormonal therapies, including estrogens and progestogens, are the most well-known and efficient agents in alleviating hot flashes; however, the safety of these agents is disputable.

### Efficacy of nonestrogenic hot flash therapies among women stratified by breast cancer history and tamoxifen use: a pooled analysis [^117PWwKo]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Various nonestrogenic therapies have been found to be effective in mitigating hot flashes, but it has been unclear whether the efficacy varies by whether women have had breast cancer and/or were taking tamoxifen.

Methods

This study used data from Mayo Clinic/North Central Cancer Treatment Group clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of any nonestrogenic agent for hot flashes and had information on breast cancer history or tamoxifen use. Statistically significant changes from the fourth treatment week versus the baseline week, using individual patient data, were assessed using Student's t test.

Results

A total of 1,396 women from 20 hot flash studies were eligible for analysis. Overall, women without breast cancer had a similar percentage of baseline hot flash score at week 4, as did those with breast cancer (53% vs 50%, P = 0.92). Women who were not taking tamoxifen had a significantly lower percentage of hot flash score at week 4 as compared with those who used tamoxifen (54% vs 61%, P = 0.01). However, this was due to a higher reduction in hot flash scores in the placebo arms among women not receiving tamoxifen; the percentage reduction in hot flash scores at week 4 from baseline in the active therapy arms of the randomized placebo-controlled trials (ie, excluding placebo arms) was similar among the tamoxifen users and nonusers (difference in mean percentage reduction, 5.7; 95% CI, -1.76 to 13.16).

Conclusions

Some nonestrogenic therapies seem to be useful for reducing hot flashes, irrespective of the etiology of hot flashes.

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism as a novel treatment for menopausal hot flushes: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113or5JB]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The menopause occurs when an insufficient number of ovarian follicles remain to sustain circulating oestrogen concentrations. Consequently, menstruation ceases, fertility is lost, and in most women a cluster of symptoms become prominent, which impact physical, psychosocial, sexual, and overall wellbeing. Symptoms can be long lasting (median 7.4 years), and most women report that vasomotor symptoms (termed hot flushes or flashes or night sweats) are the most bothersome of all, with at least 10% of women reporting them as intolerable. An effective treatment is hormone replacement therapy as this artificially restores circulating oestrogen. However, hormone replacement therapy and in particular combined hormone replacement therapy is not without risk, and is contraindicated in many women due to the long-term safety concerns, including an increased risk of breastand ovariancancers, thromboembolism, and stroke. Other treatments including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, tibolone, and cognitive behavioural therapyhave been shown to have some efficacy but can cause side-effects. Herbal remedies, such as black cohosh and red clover might provide some relief but efficacy is variable between trials. It is estimated that a novel treatment for menopausal flushes could currently benefit 10 million women in the UK alone, and therefore a better understanding of the aetiology of such flushes and an associated targeted therapeutic is required.

### Effects of NT-814, a dual neurokinin 1 and 3 receptor antagonist, on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women: a placebo-controlled, randomized trial [^111RzA12]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Up to 75% of women over 50 experience symptoms related to menopausal transition — particularly vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) and consequent sleep disturbances — that have a negative impact on daily activities and quality of life. - Hot flashes are the most common and distressing symptom and the leading cause for seeking medical attention during this period. They are commonly associated with nighttime awakenings, causing insomnia and fatigue. - Current treatment options are limited. Hormone therapy is effective in many women but associated with increased risk of hormone-dependent cancers and thrombosis and specifically contraindicated in women with history of hormone-sensitive cancers. Hormone therapy may also take several months to improve symptoms and may have limited effects on nighttime awakening. These limitations preclude its use in many women. Low-dose paroxetine is licensed for use in some countries but has modest efficacy and some tolerability concerns, as do other nonhormone therapies. A safe, effective alternative to hormonal treatments is urgently needed.

Evidence supports a functional role for neurokinin (NK) receptor systems in hot flash etiology through hypothalamic mechanisms. - Kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy) neurons in the hypothalamus are hypertrophied in postmenopausal women and have elevated gene expression levels of kisspeptin, NKB (endogenous ligand for NK 3 receptor), and substance P (SP) (endogenous ligand for NK 1 receptor). - The NK 3 receptor and its NKB ligand in particular have been implicated in hot flash etiology. Proof-of-concept studies and more recently a fully powered phase 2b study with NK 3 receptor antagonists have provided clinical evidence that NK 3 receptor blockade rapidly reduces both the number and the severity of hot flashes. NK 1 receptors and SP may also contribute to the control of vasomotor symptoms. SP immunoreactivity is frequently colocalized with kisspeptin and NKB in the infundibular region, of the hypothalamus. Additionally, in the periphery, NK 1 receptor desensitization attenuates cutaneous blood vessel dilatationand infusion of SP causes vasodilatation and flushing of the face and neck characteristic of postmenopausal hot flashes. We, therefore, hypothesized that NT-814, a selective antagonist of both NK 1 and NK 3 receptors, would reduce hot flashes and waking due to night sweats in postmenopausal women and conducted the RELENT-1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety (primary endpoints) and efficacy (exploratory endpoints) of NT-814.

During the past few years, many women and doctors have revised their opinions of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms, and a substantial number of individuals have discontinued its use because of concerns about side-effects. Numerous alternatives to HRT are promoted, and assessment of the quality of evidence about the safety and effectiveness of these compounds can be difficult. In this Review, we summarise the data from studies addressing the efficacy, risks, and benefits of frequently prescribed treatments, and offer evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of menopausal symptoms. Although few comparative studies exist, oestrogen alone or combinations of oestrogen and progestagen are likely to be the most effective treatments for menopausal hot flushes and vaginal dryness. Tibolone is as effective as HRT, however, and might also improve libido. For those who wish to avoid hormonal treatments, there are few effective options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might be effective in the very short term (less than 12 weeks) and are well tolerated. There is not enough evidence that any of the complementary therapies available are any better than placebo for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, and few safety data exist.

### Elinzanetant for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: OASIS 1 and 2 randomized clinical trials [^112ywRdJ]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Safe and effective nonhormonal treatments for menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are needed.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of elinzanetant, a selective neurokinin-1,3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of moderate to severe menopausal vasomotor symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two randomized double-blind phase 3 trials (OASIS 1 and 2) included postmenopausal participants aged 40 to 65 years experiencing moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (OASIS 1: 77 sites in the US, Europe, and Israel from August 27, 2021, to November 27, 2023, and OASIS 2: 77 sites in the US, Canada, and Europe from October 29, 2021, to October 10, 2023).

Intervention

Once daily oral elinzanetant, 120 mg, for 26 weeks or matching placebo for 12 weeks followed by elinzanetant, 120 mg, for 14 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points included mean change in frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms from baseline to weeks 4 and 12, measured by the electronic hot flash daily diary. Secondary end points included Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance Short Form 8b total T score and Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire total score from baseline to week 12.

Results

Eligible participants (mean [SD] age, OASIS 1: 54.6 [4.9] years; OASIS 2: 54.6 [4.8] years) were randomized to elinzanetant (OASIS 1: n = 199; OASIS 2: n = 200) or placebo (OASIS 1: n = 197; OASIS 2: n = 200). A total of 309 (78.0%) and 324 (81.0%) completed OASIS 1 and 2, respectively. For the elinzanetant and placebo groups, the baseline mean (SD) VMS per 24 hours were 13.4 (6.6) vs 14.3 (13.9) (OASIS 1) and 14.7 (11.1) v 16.2 (11.2) (OASIS 2). Baseline VMS severity was 2.6 (0.2) vs 2.5 (0.2) (OASIS 1) and 2.5 (0.2) vs 2.5 (0.2) (OASIS 2). Elinzanetant significantly reduced VMS frequency at week 4 (OASIS 1: -3.3 [95% CI, -4.5 to -2.1], P < .001; OASIS 2: -3.0 [95% CI, -4.4 to -1.7], P < .001) and at week 12 (OASIS 1: -3.2 [95% CI, -4.8 to -1.6], P < .001; OASIS 2: -3.2 [95% CI, -4.6 to -1.9], P < .001). Elinzanetant also improved VMS severity at week 4 (OASIS 1: -0.3 [95% CI, -0.4 to -0.2], P < .001; OASIS 2: -0.2 [95 CI, -0.3 to -0.1], P < .001) and week 12 (OASIS 1: -0.4 [95% CI, -0.5 to -0.3], P < .001; OASIS 2: -0.3 [95% CI, -0.4 to -0.1], P < .001). Elinzanetant improved sleep disturbances and menopause-related quality of life at week 12, and the safety profile was favorable.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elinzanetant was well tolerated and efficacious for moderate to severe menopausal VMS.

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism as a novel treatment for menopausal hot flushes: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113KneE9]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

We provide evidence from a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that treatment with an oral, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist taken twice daily significantly reduces the frequency of menopausal hot flushes. Residual flushes are also significantly less severe, less bothersome, and less interfering than when taking placebo. Treatment was well tolerated and safe. The only safety caution was a mild transient rise in transaminase concentrations in a small subgroup of participants.

Implications of all the available evidence

The finding that pharmacological blockade of NKB signalling with an oral NK3R antagonist can significantly improve hot flush symptoms independently of any hormonal effect fits entirely with the pre-existing data, and suggests great promise for such agents as a novel therapy. Larger scale studies of longer duration will determine whether such a therapeutic approach will change future clinical practice so that the lives of those women so deeply affected by hot flushes can be transformed without the need for increased oestrogen exposure.

Data extraction

One reviewer manually extracted data from the included full-text publications; a second reviewer validated the extracted data for accuracy. Any discrepancies were reconciled by both reviewers together and/or a third reviewer, if necessary. Various characteristics of each publication, trial, and study population were extracted. Efficacy outcomes extracted for use in the NMA included mean change from baseline to week 12 in frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS and the proportion of participants with ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in VMS frequency at 12 weeks. Key information related to each outcome was also extracted (eg, timing of assessment, mathematical definition, scale of outcome). Missing, unclear, or insufficient data were denoted as "NR" (not reported), and no assumptions were made around it.

Feasible networks for the NMA were those for which sufficient information was available for analysis of a commonly defined outcome measured at comparable time points across a connected network of trials. Publications reporting outcome definitions comparable to those used in the SKYLIGHT trials were deemed appropriate for inclusion. VMS frequency was defined as the sum of moderate and severe VMS events per day. VMS severity was calculated using a weighted average that captures all VMS, including those of mild severity: ([number of mild hot flashes per day × 1] + [number of moderate hot flashes per day × 2] + [number of severe hot flashes per day × 3])/total number of daily mild/moderate/severe hot flashes. The VMS ≥ 75% responder rate was defined as the proportion of participants with at least a ≥ 75% reduction from baseline in moderate to severe VMS frequency at 12 weeks.

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism as a novel treatment for menopausal hot flushes: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116JTmBJ]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Results

68 women were screened by JKP between Feb 3, 2016, and Oct 10, 2016. After discussion, eight did not meet the inclusion criteria, and 11 met an exclusion criterion, and so all 19 were withdrawn (see appendix pp 1–3). Four further participants withdrew before the study began due to time commitments. Therefore, 45 participants started the trial, of which seven were identified to have not met the inclusion criteria regarding frequency or severity of flushes at the end of week 2 (as per protocol) and so were not randomly assigned and withdrawn. One participant was randomly assigned but withdrew before receiving the allocated intervention due to new employment and so was not included in any analysis. Of the remaining 37 participants who were randomly assigned and received study medication (the intention-to-treat analysis set), 28 completed the protocol (the per-protocol analysis set; age range 49–62 years and had been experiencing hot flushes for 1–16 years). Extended demographic and baseline characteristics of the 28 participants who completed the trial are summarised in table 1, and participant flow is shown in figure 2. Baseline menopausal symptom scores were similar between treatment assignment groups (table 2). Baseline mean total number of hot flushes per 24 h was 13.09 (SD 6.47) in group 1 and 12.56 (3.93) in group 2 (table 2).

### Estradiol valerate (Delestrogen) [^116nYRF5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What is DELESTROGEN?

DELESTROGEN is a medicine that contains estrogen hormones.

What is DELESTROGEN used for?

DELESTROGEN is used after menopause to:

reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feeling of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with DELESTROGEN.
treat moderate to severe dryness, itching, and burning in and around the vagina. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with DELESTROGEN to control these problems. If you use DELESTROGEN only to treat your dryness, itching, and burning in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Hot flushes affect 70% of menopausal women and result in long-lasting symptoms, which severely impact physical, psychosocial, sexual, and overall wellbeing, in response to oestrogen withdrawal. Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment but is contraindicated in some women, and is not without risk in all due to long-term safety concerns, particularly an increased risk of breast cancer (though perhaps less so if it is oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy), thromboembolism, and stroke. Alternative treatments — eg, some antidepressants and herbal remedies, have been shown to have some efficacy but not always greater than the effect of a placebo depending on the study and treatment class, and are not without side-effects too. For the past 20 years a growing body of evidence has accumulated that implicates neurokinin B (NKB) signalling (a hypothalamic neuropeptide) together with its receptor (NK3R) in the aetiology of menopausal hot flushes. We searched PubMed on Jan 6, 2017, using the keywords "neurokinin 3 receptor", "hot flushes", and "hot flashes" with no date or language restrictions. Of the four publications identified, one was a comprehensive review summarising all previous evidence in rodents, primates, and human post-mortem studies that shows that NKB neurons adapt in response to sex steroid deficiency, that this can be reversed by sex steroid replacement, and that NKB signalling is propagated via the hypothalamic median pre-optic nucleus (MnPO), which expresses NK3R, and receives input from, and projects to, the autonomic thermoregulatory pathway. This review included one of the other original articles identified. Of the other two, one was an original article that further supports the role of NKB signalling in the MnPO, and the other was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that showed that peripheral infusion of NKB intravenously induces hot flushes in healthy premenopausal women that are typical of the location, duration, and observed physiological change of those described by postmenopausal women. An original article (not identified from the search) of a genome-wide association study found that genetic variation in TAC3R, which is the gene that encodes NK3R, might account for the variability in experience of hot flushes reported among women.

Efficacy

Coprimary endpoints were mean change in the frequency of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 4; mean change in the frequency of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 12; mean change in the severity of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 4; and mean change in the severity of moderate/severe VMS from baseline to week 12.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean changes and percent reductions in VMS frequency and severity from baseline to each study week and the proportion of participants achieving a 50% reduction in moderate/severe VMS over time. Additional secondary endpoints included analyzing VMS outcomes for mild, moderate, and severe VMS; patient-reported outcomes; hot flash scores; and alternative definitions of response, which will be reported separately.

Participants recorded their VMS at least twice daily (morning and evening). Mild VMS were defined as sensations of heat without sweating or noting damp sheets or clothing upon awakening. Moderate VMS were defined as sensations of heat with sweating but being able to continue activities or waking from sleep because of feeling hot. Severe VMS were defined as feelings of intense heat with sweating that disrupts activities or, for night sweats, feelings of being so hot as to require action (eg, remove layers of clothing, open a window).

Data from VMS recordings collected during the 35-day screening period were used to determine participant eligibility on the basis of VMS frequency and severity. Study baseline values were calculated based on mean VMS frequency and severity recorded over the last seven consecutive calendar days with nonmissing data before day 1 of the treatment period. As a consequence, the baseline could be less than the required 50 moderate/severe VMS per week study entry criterion, since eligibility could have been established anytime during the 35-day screening period.

VMS frequency was counted by the number of moderate or severe VMS in a 24-hour period. The moderate/severe VMS severity per day was determined by the following calculation: [(number of moderate VMS × 2) + (number of severe VMS × 3)]/(number of moderate + number of severe VMS). For participants with no moderate or severe VMS, the severity was calculated as 0; weekly average severity was calculated as the mean of daily severity scores over seven days.

### Phase III evaluation of fluoxetine for treatment of hot flashes [^112jmL6h]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hot flashes can be a prominent problem in women with a history of breast cancer. Given concerns regarding the use of hormonal therapies in such patients, other nonhormonal means for treating hot flashes are required. Based on anecdotal information regarding the efficacy of fluoxetine and other newer antidepressants for treating hot flashes, the present trial was developed.

Patients and Methods

This trial used a double-blinded, randomized, two-period (4 weeks per period), cross-over methodology to study the efficacy of fluoxetine (20 mg/d) for treating hot flashes in women with a history of breast cancer or a concern regarding the use of estrogen (because of breast cancer risk). Eligible patients had to have reported that they averaged at least 14 hot flashes per week; they could have received tamoxifen or raloxifene as long as they were on a stable dose. The major outcome measure was a bivariate construct representing hot flash frequency and hot flash score, analyzed by a classic sums and differences cross-over analysis.

Results

Eighty-one randomized women began protocol therapy. By the end of the first treatment period, hot flash scores (frequency x average severity) decreased 50% in the fluoxetine arm versus 36% in the placebo arm. Cross-over analysis demonstrated a significantly greater marked hot flash score improvement with fluoxetine than placebo (P = 0.02). The results were not adjusted for potential confounding influences, including age and tamoxifen use. The fluoxetine was well tolerated.

Conclusion

This dose of fluoxetine resulted in a modest improvement in hot flashes.
