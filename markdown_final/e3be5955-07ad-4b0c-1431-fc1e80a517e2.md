## Question

Is it normal to feel numbness and tingling after a stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is normal to feel numbness and tingling after a stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "normal" should be interpreted in this context. Then, I should verify how often numbness and tingling occur after stroke and whether they reflect expected neurological sequelae. Next, I will examine the underlying mechanisms, including focal sensory loss and central post-stroke pain. After that, I should review the time course and evolution of these symptoms. Finally, I will consider what this means for prognosis and management, and synthesize a clear answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead. By "normal", I should clarify that we mean "common" or "expected" neurological sequelae after stroke, rather than "benign" or "acceptable". Numbness reflects loss of touch or proprioceptive sensation, and tingling reflects paresthesia, both of which are recognized stroke symptoms and can persist as residual deficits or evolve into central post-stroke pain syndromes [^9cf560c5] [^ed115f75].

> I need to check how often these symptoms occur. Sudden numbness or tingling is a core stroke warning sign and is among the most recognized by the public, underscoring its frequency in acute presentations [^9cf560c5] [^b2c871fc]. Beyond the acute phase, somatosensory impairments are common after stroke, with tactile deficits being the most frequent, and recovery is variable, meaning persistent numbness or tingling is not rare in survivors [^620b87c3]. Central post-stroke pain, which often includes tingling, dysesthesia, or allodynia, has been reported in roughly 7–12% of stroke survivors in population-based studies, and up to 18% among those with somatosensory disturbances, indicating that chronic paresthesias are a recognized complication rather than an anomaly [^5e12c013] [^43856c79] [^fb8a565e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the mechanisms. Numbness and tingling after stroke typically reflect injury to central somatosensory pathways, including the thalamocortical relays, posterior limb of the internal capsule, brainstem lemniscal or spinothalamic tracts, or cortical somatosensory areas, with lesion network mapping showing that functional connectivity disruptions beyond the primary lesion site also correlate with sensory deficits [^84da4355]. In central post-stroke pain, deafferentation plus central sensitization and disinhibition produce spontaneous pain and abnormal sensations, including tingling, burning, or electric-like dysesthesias, often in the same body territory as the sensory loss [^ed115f75] [^1b0be2c4].

> Next, I should review the time course. Sensory symptoms can be present from onset and may improve, persist, or evolve. Central post-stroke pain typically emerges within 3–6 months but can be delayed up to a year or more, so new-onset tingling months after stroke is still consistent with a post-stroke process and warrants evaluation for CPSP rather than dismissal as unrelated [^ed115f75] [^fb8a565e]. Let me reconsider the implication: this means that both immediate and delayed numbness or tingling can be "normal" in the sense of being expected stroke sequelae, though the latter often reflects chronic central neuropathic pain rather than simple sensory loss [^ed115f75].

> I will now examine what this means for prognosis and care. Persistent numbness and tingling are clinically significant because they impair fine motor control, safety, and quality of life, and they are explicitly tracked as important sensory outcomes in stroke rehabilitation guidelines, which recommend structured assessment and targeted interventions when feasible [^1d811344] [^71c03748]. Wait, let me verify treatment options: evidence for sensory retraining is mixed and generally low quality, but guidelines still endorse evaluation and rehabilitation efforts, and for CPSP, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline remain first-line pharmacotherapy in many algorithms, with anticonvulsants as alternatives, acknowledging that response is often partial and individualized [^490cc473] [^fb8a565e] [^ed115f75].

> But wait, what if the tingling is not due to the stroke itself? I should double-check for mimics and contributors. Peripheral neuropathies, medication effects, and functional neurological symptoms can produce numbness or tingling and may coexist with stroke, so a careful history, examination, and medication review are essential to avoid attributing everything to the cerebrovascular event when another process is treatable [^e8585cbb] [^03414e51] [^19b24281]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "most cases of post-stroke tingling reflect CPSP", but that overstates it; CPSP accounts for a subset of chronic paresthesias after stroke, whereas many patients have straightforward hemisensory loss without pain, so I should correct that overgeneralization and emphasize the need to distinguish sensory loss from dysesthetic pain syndromes [^5e12c013] [^620b87c3].

> Synthesis and answer: Yes, it is "normal" in the sense of being common and expected after stroke to experience numbness and tingling, either as acute deficits or as chronic sensory sequelae, and in a subset of patients these evolve into central post-stroke pain with dysesthetic tingling or allodynia. Frequency estimates suggest somatosensory deficits are present in many survivors, and CPSP affects a meaningful minority, so these symptoms warrant routine assessment and consideration of rehabilitation and neuropathic pain strategies rather than dismissal as atypical [^620b87c3] [^5e12c013] [^ed115f75].

It is **common and expected** to experience numbness and tingling after a stroke, as these are typical sensory sequelae of brain injury affecting the somatosensory pathways [^620b87c3]. These symptoms often reflect damage to the thalamus, brainstem, or cortical sensory areas and may persist for months or years [^ed115f75]. Persistent or painful sensory symptoms may indicate **central post-stroke pain (CPSP)** [^7338de5d], which affects 7–12% of stroke survivors and can significantly impact quality of life [^5e12c013] [^43856c79]. Early rehabilitation and sensory retraining can improve function and reduce symptom burden, though evidence for specific interventions remains limited [^490cc473] [^d5d1d8b8].

## Neurological basis of numbness and tingling after stroke

Numbness and tingling after stroke arise from injury to the central somatosensory system, including the **thalamus**, brainstem, and **somatosensory cortex** [^ed115f75]. These regions process touch, pressure, temperature, vibration, and proprioception; damage disrupts normal sensory signaling, causing paresthesia (tingling) and hypoesthesia (numbness) [^620b87c3].

- **Thalamic involvement**: Thalamic strokes (Dejerine-Roussy syndrome) often cause severe, persistent sensory disturbances, including numbness, tingling, and CPSP [^7338de5d].
- **Brainstem lesions**: Brainstem strokes can cause pure sensory strokes with isolated numbness or tingling due to involvement of sensory tracts [^42793bf8].
- **Cortical lesions**: Damage to the somatosensory cortex can cause contralateral sensory loss and paresthesia [^notfound].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

Sensory deficits, including numbness and tingling, are **common after stroke**, with reported frequencies ranging from 11% to 85% depending on the population and assessment methods [^notfound]. These symptoms are clinically significant because they:

- **Impair daily functioning**: Sensory loss reduces fine motor control, balance, and safety, increasing dependence and disability [^44867bd4].
- **Predict poor recovery**: Severe sensory deficits are associated with slower motor recovery and poorer functional outcomes [^notfound].
- **Cause chronic pain**: Persistent tingling or dysesthesia may evolve into CPSP, a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome [^ed115f75].

---

## Central post-stroke pain (CPSP)

CPSP is a neuropathic pain syndrome characterized by persistent pain, dysesthesia, and sensory abnormalities in body regions corresponding to the stroke lesion [^ed115f75]. It affects **7–12% of stroke survivors** and typically develops within 3–6 months after stroke, though delays up to years are possible [^5e12c013] [^43856c79] [^fb8a565e]. CPSP is often refractory to treatment and significantly impairs quality of life [^1b0be2c4].

---

## Recovery and management strategies

Recovery of sensory function after stroke is **variable and often incomplete** [^620b87c3]. However, early and targeted rehabilitation can improve sensory outcomes and reduce symptom burden:

- **Sensory retraining**: Structured sensory retraining programs improve sensory discrimination and functional use of the affected limb [^d5d1d8b8].
- **Multidisciplinary rehabilitation**: Combining occupational and physical therapy with sensory-specific interventions yields the best results [^notfound].
- **Pharmacological management**: Antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline) and anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin) are first-line treatments for CPSP, though response is often limited [^fb8a565e] [^9b801f4a].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for sensory recovery after stroke **varies widely** [^620b87c3]. Mild sensory deficits may resolve spontaneously or with rehabilitation, whereas severe deficits — particularly those involving the thalamus or large cortical areas — often persist. CPSP may persist for years and require long-term management [^ed115f75].

---

Numbness and tingling are **common and expected after stroke** due to central somatosensory injury [^620b87c3]. They can significantly impair function and quality of life, and may signal CPSP if persistent or painful [^ed115f75]. Early rehabilitation and targeted therapies can improve outcomes, though recovery is often incomplete [^d5d1d8b8].

## References

### Is this patient having a stroke? [^ce6946a7]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients suspected of having a stroke or transient ischemic attack require accurate assessment for appropriate acute treatment and use of secondary preventive interventions.

Objective

To update a 1994 systematic review of the accuracy and reliability of symptoms and findings on neurological examination for the evaluation of patients with suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Data Sources

We identified potential articles dated between 1994 and 2005 by multiple search strategies of the MEDLINE database and review of article and textbook bibliographies along with private collections.

Study Selection

Selected articles provided primary data or appropriate summary statistics of the accuracy and/or reliability of the history or physical examination for diagnosis or short-term prognosis of patients with neurological signs prompting a consideration of stroke. Articles addressing accuracy also needed to provide a final diagnosis following neuroimaging and all relevant laboratory tests.

Data Extraction

The authors reviewed and abstracted data for estimating sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs). Reliability assessment was based on reported kappa (kappa) statistics or intraclass correlation coefficients as appropriate.

Data Synthesis

The prior probability of a stroke among patients with neurologically relevant symptoms is 10%. Based on studies using modern neuroimaging, the presence of acute facial paresis, arm drift, or abnormal speech increases the likelihood of stroke (LR of > or =1 finding = 5.5; 95% CI, 3.3-9.1), while the absence of all 3 decreases the odds (LR of 0 findings = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.25-0.61). The accurate determination of stroke subtype requires neuroimaging to distinguish ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. Early mortality increases among those with any combination of impaired consciousness, hemiplegia, and conjugate gaze palsy (LR of > or =1 finding = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.8 and LR of 0 findings = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13-1.0). Symptoms associated with high agreement for the diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack vs no vascular event are a sudden change in speech, visual loss, diplopia, numbness or tingling, paralysis or weakness, and non-orthostatic dizziness (kappa = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.52-0.68). The reliabilities of individual neurological findings vary from slight to almost perfect, but can be improved with standardized scoring systems such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Based on examination findings, stroke vascular distribution can be determined with moderate to good reliability (kappa = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39-0.68).

Conclusions

The history and clinical findings provide the basis for evaluating patients with possible stroke and choosing appropriate treatments. Focusing on 3 findings (acute facial paresis, arm drift, or abnormal speech) might improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability.

### Warning signs of a stroke (...) [^56fcc95d]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A stroke happens when part of the brain is damaged because of either the blockage of a blood vessel or the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain. What Causes a Stroke. A stroke can happen in one of 2 ways: a blood vessel in the brain can either get blocked or start bleeding. Strokes caused by blockage are much more common than strokes caused by bleeding. Things that increase the risk of having a stroke include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, and lack of physical activity. Therefore, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and taking medications for any of these other medical conditions will lower your risk of stroke. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Stroke.

When the brain does not get enough blood flow, many different signs and symptoms can occur. The amount and type of symptoms depend on what part of the brain is involved. Some of the common signs of stroke include Asymmetry in the face or a droop on one side of the face. Weakness on one side of the body Numbness or unusual sensations on one side of the body Trouble speaking What Should I Do If I Notice Warning Signs. Time is the most important factor if you think you are having a stroke. The faster you can get to a hospital, the better your chances of recovery. Therefore, you should call the paramedics right away if you have any of the above warning signs—do not “wait it out” to see if the symptoms get better on their own. The reason that time is very important is that for some strokes, a medication that dissolves blood clots can be given through the bloodstream as treatment.

This medication only works during the first few hours after a stroke. After that it is no longer effective and can even cause harmful side effects. Therefore, it is very important, when possible, to record the exact time that you or someone around you first noticed symptoms and the time that you were last well without symptoms.

### Pure sensory stroke due to brainstem lesion [^7e6bd9a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 40-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset right-sided upper and lower extremity numbness/tingling over the past day. Prior to the paraesthesia onset, the patient experienced transient mild ataxia and left ocular pain with complete resolution at the time of presentation. Neurological exam revealed isolated right-sided sensory changes from his hand-to-elbow as well as foot-to-knee. No other focal neurological deficits were noted. MRI brain revealed a small left posterior infarct at the junction between the pons and midbrain. Dual-antiplatelet therapy was initiated and the patient experienced minimal paraesthesia improvement proximally over his 5-day hospital course. This case report highlights an acute brainstem stroke presenting with predominant hemisensory symptoms. Presentations of brainstem lesions can range from subtle, non-specific features to profound deficits. This case serves to emphasise the importance of performing a thorough clinical exam while maintaining a high index of suspicion for brainstem lesions.

### Pure sensory stroke due to brainstem lesion [^c7b07860]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Case presentation

A fit-and-well 40-year-old male patient (construction worker) presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of acute onset right upper and lower extremity numbness/tingling. The patient reported associated transient symptoms of mild gait ataxia and left ocular burning pain sensation just prior to the paraesthesia onset. These associated symptoms were completely resolved at the time of presentation. The patient denied any trauma or previous episodes of similar symptoms. Although the patient denied any personal medical history or home medications, family history revealed that his father suffered from two strokes between the ages of 40 and 50 years old. The patient denied any alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use.

On general examination, the patient was a muscular Caucasian male with a body mass index of 34.6. He was afebrile but noted to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 165/111 mm Hg. Neurological exam revealed persistent light touch (brush) impairment localised to the right fingertips extending to the elbow and right toes extending to the knee. In addition, the patient displayed minimal transient proprioception and vibration impairments on the distal right fingertips and toes. Both pain (pin prick) and temperature sensations remained intact. Muscle strength and tone were grossly normal. No other focal neurological deficits were appreciated.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride [^37b918ea]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense and vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1, 6.2)].

5.4 Central Nervous System Effects

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis, psychotic reactions progressing to suicidal ideations/thoughts, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or self-injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These reactions may occur following the first dose. Advise patients receiving ciprofloxacin to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur, discontinue the drug, and institute appropriate care.

Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. As with all fluoroquinolones, use ciprofloxacin with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). If seizures occur, discontinue ciprofloxacin and institute appropriate care [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^1b796191]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation—contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES) uses the volitional opening of the non-paretic hand as an input signal, producing a proportional intensity of stimulation to the paretic hand. Evidence included one SR of 6 RCTs (n=267) with variable protocols, including therapist-guided functional task practice (20- to 90-minute sessions, two to six times per week, for 1–4 weeks) and self-administered home stimulation exercise (10–12 hours per week for 6–12 weeks). Across outcome measures, CCFES showed higher improvement than neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on FMA-UE (CCFES n=137 vs NMES n=130; SMD: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.07–0.76) and BBT (CCFES n=62 vs NMES n=56; SMD: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.10–0.86), with significant improvements for AROM (CCFES n=84 vs NMES n=82; SMD: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.23–0.86) and the mBI (CCFES n=45 vs NMES n=44; SMD: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.12–0.97), while AMAT showed no significant difference (three studies, n=118; SMD: 0.34; 95% CI: -0.03–0.72). Adverse events included a few instances of numbness, tingling, and skin irritation at electrode sites, as well as temporary discomfort from electrical stimulation. This topic is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. The Work Group stated, There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against.

### Population-based study of central post-stroke pain in rimini district, Italy [^bf7ddb10]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

CPSP has been underestimated for years, but nowadays is receiving wider interest. CPSP can develop immediately or up to 10 years after the stroke event, but usually develops 3–6 months after the stroke.Jönsson et al found that one third of patients complained of moderate to severe pain 4 months after stroke onset, and that 20% were still experiencing moderate to severe pain with increasing intensity one year later.

These findings suggest that a long follow-up period is necessary to evaluate CPSP,because pain may occur months or years after a stroke, and this may be due to the complex nature of post-stroke pain. Further, the clinical trial data underscore how difficult it is to treat this syndrome effectively.

The results of our study show a CPSP prevalence of 11%, with no “gender” effect. This prevalence is within the range reported in the literature (1%–12%).With regard to pain characteristics, consistent with the data in the literature, we found that tactile and thermal hyperesthesia were the most commonly described features, accompanied by sensations of “needle puncture”, tingling, swelling, and pressure. In our sample, pain intensity was mainly moderate to severe and again, in accordance with the literature, was mainly continuous. However, in contrast with the published data, we found that the pain had started in the first month after the lesion in the majority of patients.

### A bedside sensory phenomenon that can help explain functional sensory symptoms [^862c0273]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Explaining basic illness mechanisms is an important step in communicating functional neurological symptoms. Clinical signs for motor symptoms, such as the Hoover test, have proven an excellent basis for mechanistic explanations. Here, I recommend a simple technique for eliciting tingling sensations through directed bodily attention, as a helpful experiential starting point for explanations of sensory gating and somatosensory amplification in patients with functional hyperaesthesia, paraesthesia and chronic pain.

### Trigeminal trophic syndrome from stroke: an under-recognized central neuropathic itch syndrome [^f206a6c3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) is the historic name for neuropathic self-induced facial ulceration from abnormal sensory symptoms leading to uncontrolled scratching. Anatomic co-localization of sensory loss (numbness) plus neuropathic itch and pain permits painless scratching. If the itch is severe, some patients will scratch to the point of causing self-injury. Patients may be unaware or may conceal the fact that their lesions are self-induced and thus the diagnosis presents a clinical challenge. Many cases remain undiagnosed, leading to unnecessary and ineffective tests, procedures, and prescribing. We document a patient with a central cause of TTS - multiple cerebral vascular accidents - and summarize the presentation, pathogenesis, and treatment options.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^7338de5d]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Central poststroke pain—definition and diagnostic features are that it results from a lesion in the somatosensory system rather than from a peripheral nociceptive or psychogenic cause, diagnostic criteria include that pain occur after stroke, be in a body area corresponding to the central nervous system lesion, and not be accounted for by nociceptive or peripheral neuropathic pain, it is classically associated with thalamic stroke (Dejerine-Roussy syndrome) but can result from lesions anywhere along the spinothalamic and thalamocortical tracts within the central nervous system, and symptoms are usually described as burning or aching.

### 'Somebody stuck me in a bag of sand': lived experiences of the altered and uncomfortable body after stroke [^73dc6cb1]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

“the arm can feel very cold sometimes, I noticed between the two there’s a difference in temperature. the fingers. its constantly tingling. my little toe on the right side all the way. up to my ankle. can get hypersensitive and also, I feel as though my ankle’s broken. it just feels painful. I know it isn’t broken. and it’s not swollen, but it just gives me the wrong information” (Tim, 65, 8 months post-stroke)

These sensations were noticeably physically uncomfortable which drew attention to the body. This led to attempts to make sense of why the body felt strange and to alleviate uncomfortable sensations, for example by restricting movement, distracting from pain, trying to keep warm or taking pain medication.

“I try to avoid putting it places where it’s likely to be hurt. if I’m mowing the lawn, then I would use my right arm to lead when the mower is going away from me, rather than have this mower wrench my left arm away from me. I’ve learnt to accommodate it. I know how to avoid the pain” (Alistair, 72, 11 months post-stroke)

Most participants described effortful experiences of bodily heaviness, which could build up during the day or occur out of the blue. Limb weight felt equivalent to having a ‘young child grabbing hold of your knee’ (Alistair, 72, 11 months post-stroke) or like ‘dragging a 10lb dumbbell behind you’ (Tom, 56, 10 years post-stroke) and required so much ‘ perseverance. to make it go.It probably does use up more calories’ (Sarah, 56, 23 years post-stroke). For a few this led to the body feeling stuck or collapsing, which inevitably led to negative feelings and affected social opportunities.

Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptanorally disintegrating tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets.

### A review of nonsurgical neurolytic procedures for neuropathic pain [^e8585cbb]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Brief Overview of Peripheral Neuropathic Pain

Peripheral neuropathies associated with neuropathic pain include diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), HIV infection, trigeminal neuralgia/neuropathy, painful radiculopathy, amputation (eg, phantom limb pain), peripheral nerve injury (eg, following surgery or trauma), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, central post-stroke pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.It is important to note that not all patients with peripheral neuropathy develop neuropathic pain.Neuropathic pain is defined by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain as pain that occurs as a direct result of damage to or lesions of the somatosensory nervous system.Neuropathic pain distribution can be focal or generalized, which is typically symmetrical.In the distal extremities, “glove and stocking” distribution can occur due to pain in the feet, calves, hands, and forearms. Patients often describe their spontaneous or evoked pain as burning, shooting, pricking, pins and needles, squeezing, or freezing pain or an electrical-like sensation.There may also be abnormal sensations, including dysesthesias (abnormal unpleasant painful, itching, burning, or restrictive sensations) and paresthesias (abnormal sensations such as tingling, numbness, skin crawling, or itching sensations).In addition to sensory loss, there may be allodynia (pain due to a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain) and hyperalgesia (unusually severe or more intense pain from a stimulus that normally provokes pain).

In the largest epidemiologic study of neuropathic pain to date, conducted in the UK, the overall prevalence of neuropathic pain was 9.2%.Chronic neuropathic pain occurs more frequently in women (8% vs 5.7% in men) and in individuals over the age of 50 years (8.9% vs 5.6% in those <49 years of age) and most commonly affects the lower back and lower limbs, neck, and upper limbs.The prevalence of neuropathic pain is likely to increase due to the aging global population, increased incidence of diabetes mellitus, and increasing rates of cancer and the consequences of chemotherapy, all of which affect sensory nerve fibers.The health impact and quality of life burden of neuropathic pain is higher than for non-neuropathic pain, leading to increased drug prescriptions, healthcare visits, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression.

### Central post-stroke pain: advances in clinical and preclinical research [^0d4c4daf]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies

CPSP is a type of NP that frequently develops following cerebrovascular damage to the somatosensory pathways connecting the cortex to the medulla. Unfortunately, a retrospective study has revealed that around 80% of patients with CPSP are not receiving adequate treatment, which affects their quality of life. Clinicians must remain vigilant, use clinical assessments to identify the development of CPSP and promptly administer appropriate treatment to patients.

Clinical features and lesion site

CPSP is a condition that typically manifests within 3–6 months after a stroke. Its cardinal symptoms comprise pain and somatosensory abnormalities. Despite being overlooked as a stroke complication, CPSP affects 36.5% of patients and diminishes their quality of life.CPSP encompasses diverse types of pain, such as persistent pain, spontaneous intermittent pain and nociceptive hypersensitivity. The pain can be severe and persist for 3 months to several decades, although interspersed with remission periods.Spontaneous hyperalgesia can provoke touch-induced pain with normal temperature, although with abnormal sensitivity to pinpricks and heat. Moreover, the affected side of the trunk may experience tearing, burning, freezing or squeezing sensations or pain. Clinicians use two criteria to diagnose the condition: pain that manifests within 6 months after a stroke and imaging evidence of a vascular injury in the susceptible area. For more detailed information, please refer to table 1, which presents data from recent clinical studies.

### Population-based study of central post-stroke pain in rimini district, Italy [^43856c79]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is still an underestimated complication of stroke, resulting in impaired quality of life and, in addition to the functional and cognitive consequences of stroke, the presence of CPSP may be associated with mood disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. This type of pain may also impair activities of daily living and further worsen quality of life, negatively influencing the rehabilitation process. The prevalence of CSPS in the literature is highly variable (1%-12%) according to different studies, and this variability could be influenced by selection criteria and the different ethnic populations being investigated. With this scenario in mind, we performed a population-based study to assess the prevalence of CPSP and its main features in a homogeneous health district (Rimini, Italy), including five hospitals for a total population of 329,970 inhabitants. From 2008 to 2010, we selected 1,494 post-stroke patients and were able to interview 660 patients, 66 (11%) of whom reported pain with related tactile and thermal hyperesthesia, accompanied by needle puncture, tingling, swelling, and pressure sensations. Patients reported motor impairment and disability, which influenced their working ability, rehabilitation, and social life. Despite this severe pain state, there was a high percentage of patients who did not receive adequate treatment for pain.

### Interventions for sensory impairment in the upper limb after stroke [^490cc473]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Sensory impairments significantly limit the ability to use the upper limb after stroke. However, little is known about the effects of interventions used to address such impairments.

Objectives

To determine the effects of interventions that target upper limb sensory impairment after stroke.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 8 October 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2009), EMBASE (1980 to January 2009), and six further electronic databases to January 2009. We also handsearched relevant journals, contacted authors in the field, searched doctoral dissertation databases, checked reference lists, and completed citation tracking.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and controlled trials comparing interventions for sensory impairment after stroke with no treatment, conventional treatment, attention placebo or with other interventions for sensory impairment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We analyzed study data using mean differences and odds ratios as appropriate. The primary outcome we considered was sensory function and secondary outcomes examined included upper limb function, activities of daily living, impact of stroke and quality of life as well as adverse events.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, with a total 467 participants, testing a range of different interventions. Outcome measures included 36 measures of sensory impairment and 13 measures of upper limb function. All but two studies had unclear or high risk of bias. While there is insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effects of interventions included in this review, three studies provided preliminary evidence for the effects of some specific interventions, including mirror therapy for improving detection of light touch, pressure and temperature pain; a thermal stimulation intervention for improving rate of recovery of sensation; and intermittent pneumatic compression intervention for improving tactile and kinesthetic sensation. We could not perform meta-analysis due to a high degree of clinical heterogeneity in both interventions and outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Multiple interventions for upper limb sensory impairment after stroke are described but there is insufficient evidence to support or refute their effectiveness in improving sensory impairment, upper limb function, or participants' functional status and participation. There is a need for more well-designed, better reported studies of sensory rehabilitation.

### Passive accessory joint mobilization in the multimodal management of chronic dysesthesia following thalamic stroke [^07633811]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Study design: Case Report. Purpose: Stroke is the most common cause of long-term disability. Dysesthesia, an unpleasant sensory disturbance, is common following thalamic stroke and evidence-based interventions for this impairment are limited. The purpose of this case report was to describe a decrease in dysesthesia following manual therapy intervention in a patient with history of right lacunar thalamic stroke. Case description: A 66-year-old female presented with tingling and dysesthesia in left hemisensory distribution including left trunk and upper/lower extremities, limiting function. Decreased left shoulder active range of motion, positive sensory symptoms but no sensory loss in light touch was found. She denied pain and moderate shoulder muscular weakness was demonstrated. Laterality testing revealed right/left limb discrimination deficits and neglect-like symptoms were reported. Passive accessory joint motion assessment of glenohumeral and thoracic spine revealed hypomobility and provoked dysesthesia. Interventions included passive oscillatory joint mobilization of glenohumeral joint, thoracic spine, ribs and shoulder strengthening. Results: After six sessions, shoulder function, active range of motion, strength improved and dysesthesia decreased. Global Rating of Change Scale was+5 and QuickDASH score decreased from 45% to 22% disability. Laterality testing was unchanged. Conclusion: Manual therapy may be a beneficial intervention in management of thalamic stroke-related dysesthesia. Implications for Rehabilitation While pain is common following thalamic stroke, patients may present with chronic paresthesia or dysesthesia, often in a hemisensory distribution. Passive movement may promote inhibition of hyperexcitable cortical pathways, which may diminish aberrant sensations. Passive oscillatory manual therapy may be an effective way to treat sensory disturbances such as paresthesias or dysesthesia.

### Sociodemographic and geographic variation in awareness of stroke signs and symptoms among adults-United States, 2017 [^a4f4f378]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States (1). In 2017, on average, a stroke-related death occurred every 3 minutes and 35 seconds in the United States, and stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability (1). To prevent mortality or long-term disability, strokes require rapid recognition and early medical intervention (2,3). Common stroke signs and symptoms include sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side; sudden confusion or trouble speaking; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance; and a sudden severe headache with no known cause. Recommended action at the first sign of a suspected stroke is to quickly request emergency services (i.e., calling 9-1-1) (2). Public education campaigns have emphasized recognizing stroke signs and symptoms and the importance of calling 9-1-1, and stroke knowledge increased 14.7 percentage points from 2009 to 2014 (4). However, disparities in stroke awareness have been reported (4,5). Knowledge of the five signs and symptoms of stroke and the immediate need to call emergency medical services (9-1-1), collectively referred to as "recommended stroke knowledge," was assessed among 26,076 adults aged ≥20 years as part of the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The prevalence of recommended stroke knowledge among U.S. adults was 67.5%. Stroke knowledge differed significantly by race and Hispanic origin (p<0.001). The prevalence of recommended stroke knowledge was highest among non-Hispanic White adults (71.3%), followed by non-Hispanic Black adults (64.0%) and Hispanic adults (57.8%). Stroke knowledge also differed significantly by sex, age, education, and urbanicity. After multivariable adjustment, these differences remained significant. Increasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke continues to be a national priority. Estimates from this report can inform public health strategies for increasing awareness of stroke signs and symptoms.

### Interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke [^8fc2bddc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Perception is the ability to understand information from our senses. It allows us to experience and meaningfully interact with our environment. A stroke may impair perception in up to 70% of stroke survivors, leading to distress, increased dependence on others, and poorer quality of life. Interventions to address perceptual disorders may include assessment and screening, rehabilitation, non‐invasive brain stimulation, pharmacological and surgical approaches.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at perceptual disorders after stroke compared to no intervention or control (placebo, standard care, attention control), on measures of performance in activities of daily living.

Search methods

We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three other databases to August 2021. We also searched trials and research registers, reference lists of studies, handsearched journals, and contacted authors.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adult stroke survivors with perceptual disorders. We defined perception as the specific mental functions of recognising and interpreting sensory stimuli and included hearing, taste, touch, smell, somatosensation, and vision. Our definition of perception excluded visual field deficits, neglect/inattention, and pain.

Data collection and analysis

One review author assessed titles, with two review authors independently screening abstracts and full‐text articles for eligibility. One review author extracted, appraised, and entered data, which were checked by a second author. We assessed risk of bias (ROB) using the ROB‐1 tool, and quality of evidence using GRADE.

A stakeholder group, comprising stroke survivors, carers, and healthcare professionals, was involved in this review update.

Main results

We identified 18 eligible RCTs involving 541 participants. The trials addressed touch (three trials, 70 participants), somatosensory (seven trials, 196 participants) and visual perception disorders (seven trials, 225 participants), with one (50 participants) exploring mixed touch‐somatosensory disorders. None addressed stroke‐related hearing, taste, or smell perception disorders. All but one examined the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions; the exception evaluated non‐invasive brain stimulation. For our main comparison of active intervention versus no treatment or control, one trial reported our primary outcome of performance in activities of daily living (ADL):

Somatosensory disorders : one trial (24 participants) compared an intervention with a control intervention and reported an ADL measure.

Touch perception disorder: no trials measuring ADL compared an intervention with no treatment or with a control intervention.

Visual perception disorders : no trials measuring ADL compared an intervention with no treatment or control.

In addition, six trials reported ADL outcomes in a comparison of active intervention versus active intervention, relating to somatosensation (three trials), touch (one trial) and vision (two trials).

Authors' conclusions

Following a detailed, systematic search, we identified limited RCT evidence of the effectiveness of interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that perceptual interventions are effective. More high‐quality trials of interventions for perceptual disorders in stroke are needed. They should recruit sufficient participant numbers, include a 'usual care' comparison, and measure longer‐term functional outcomes, at time points beyond the initial intervention period. People with impaired perception following a stroke should continue to receive neurorehabilitation according to clinical guidelines.

Anxiety and depression

Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which contain seven items each on cognitive symptoms of anxiety disorder and depression (HADS). In a recent literature review, HADS showed good case-finding properties for anxiety and depression in primary care patient populations. A cut-off score of ≥8 on each subscale was found to give the optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity (both about 0.8) for depression and anxiety according to DSM-III and IV, or ICD-8 and -9, and was therefore was therefore used as cut-off.

Other somatic symptoms

The participants were also asked if they experienced each of the following 11 symptoms "almost never", "rarely", "sometimes", "often" or "almost always" (0-4): chest pain, breathlessness, dysuria, unpleasant sensations in or around the genitals, complaints of blotchiness or discolouration of the skin, unpleasant numbness or tingling sensations, joint or muscle pain (all derived from the ICD-10 research criteria for F45 - Somatoform disorders), sore or running eyes or nose, headache, dizziness, fatigue. In line with identifying those with high GI complaints levels we constructed another variable identifying a general high level of somatic symptoms by summing these scores and dichotomised at the 80 th percentile.

Physical conditions

Physical conditions were assessed through self-report in the form: "do you have or have you had any of the following", followed by a list of ten conditions: coronary infarction, angina, stroke, asthma, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, hay-fever, chronic bronchitis, osteoporosis or fibromyalgia. From previous studies it was clear that the prevalence of these conditions in this middle aged working population was low. We therefore dichotomised this into those with no conditions "0", and those with one or more conditions "1". Weight and height was measured by research nurses, and BMI categorised as normal (BMI < 24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obese (BMI 30+).

### Migraine headache: an under-appreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women [^7ab60e7b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Migraine headache is a common, chronic disorder, and women comprise two thirds of patients with this disorder, that has negative effects on health and is costly for patients and society. 1, 2 There is accumulating evidence linking migraine, particularly with aura, to increased risk for cardiovascular events. 3 Given the high prevalence of this condition and the fact it affects younger women, 1 it is important to educate cardiovascular disease (CVD) providers about the potential increased cardiovascular risk associated with migraine. In this review, an overview is provided of epidemiological studies linking migraine headache and cardiovascular events, with emphasis on women, and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms for this association. However, there are many important knowledge gaps on the sex‐related aspects of migraine that potentially impact advances in management. An additional purpose of this document is to summarize these areas and provide recommendations to address these gaps.

Briefly, migraine (ie, episodic migraine) is characterized by moderate to severe headache, with or without transient focal neurology symptoms (eg, aura) that persists ≈4 to 72 hours. 4 Approximately 1 in 3 patients with migraine experience aura, which may be visual (eg, lights), auditory (eg, noises), somatosensory (eg, tingling and numbness), or motor (eg, jerking movements). 5 Typically, aura precedes the onset of headache and persists for less than an hour. 6 There is variation in the number of attacks between patients: some experience multiple attacks weekly while others experience <1 per year. There is also wide variation in the frequency of episodes within the same individual, and often the condition improves with advancing age. Patients who experience several attacks monthly (ie, ≥15 headache days a month) are classified as having chronic migraine. 7, 8

Worldwide, migraine is the third most prevalent medical condition and second most disabling neurological disorder. 9 In the United States, its annual prevalence is ≈1 in 8 adults. 1, 2 Migraine usually affects young‐ to middle‐aged women (25–55 years old). 1 Although the prevalence of migraine is generally low before puberty (≈2.5%) and is similar in boys and girls, 10 the prevalence increases in girls at about 10 years of age versus boys. 2, 10 The prevalence continues to rise in women versus men (18% versus 6%), peaking at about 30 years old. 2 The prevalence decreases after age 42 years in both sexes, but remains 2 times higher in women. 2

### Sociodemographic and geographic variation in awareness of stroke signs and symptoms among adults-United States, 2017 [^b2c871fc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

NHIS is an annual survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. In 2017, NHIS included supplemental content in the sample adult interview that provided a list of five signs and symptoms and asked respondents to identify whether each was a symptom “that someone may be having a stroke.” Respondents also were asked to choose “the best thing to do right away” if “you thought someone was having a stroke.” One choice was to call 9-1-1. *

The prevalence of knowing each of the five signs and symptoms, to call 9-1-1 for a suspected stroke, and the combination of recommended stroke knowledge was estimated overall and by subgroup. Point estimates and corresponding variances were calculated using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI International), accounting for the complex sample design, and weighted to be nationally representative. Satterthwaite-adjusted chi-squared tests were used to assess significant (p<0.05) bivariate associations. Logistic regression models (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, county urbanicity [large metropolitan area, medium or small metropolitan area, and rural], and region [Northeast, Midwest, South, and West]) were used to generate adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

A majority of U.S. adults identified each of the individual signs and symptoms of stroke (Table 1). Prevalence was highest for “numbness of face, arm, leg, or side” (94.4%), “confusion or trouble speaking” (93.6%), and “trouble walking” (90.8%). “Sudden trouble seeing” was identified by 83.5%, and “sudden severe headache” by 76.5%. Awareness of calling 9-1-1 was high (96.3%). Prevalence of recommended stroke knowledge was 67.5%.

### Systematic review of central post stroke pain: what is happening in the central nervous system? [^fe05c659]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is one of the most common central neuropathic pain syndromes seen after stroke. It is mainly related with vascular damage at certain brain territory and pain related to corresponding body areas. In the past, it was described as one of the definitive symptoms of thalamic lesion. However, recent findings suggest that it is not only seen after thalamic lesions but also seen after vascular lesions in any part of the central nervous system. Although there are certain hypotheses to explain physiopathologic mechanisms of CPSP, further evidence is needed. The majority of the cases are intractable and unresponsive to analgesic treatment. Electrical stimulation such as deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation seems to be effective in certain cases. In this systematic review, recent advancements related to CPSP mechanisms have been evaluated. Further investigations are needed in order to reveal the mystery of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CPSP.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^6d58e84a]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4.1.1. A history of relevant neurological lesion or disease

There should be a clinical suspicion of a relevant lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system (eg, an episode of acute herpes zoster or a traumatic nerve injury). The temporal relationship between the lesion or disease and the pain may vary, but a close temporal relationship helps strengthen the clinical suspicion. The onset of pain is usually immediate or within a few weeks of the lesion or disease but may be delayed for up to several months after injury (eg, after stroke) or for many years in conditions with an insidious onset such as diabetic neuropathy. In some cases, the history of pain or sensory disturbances by themselves suggest a disease, eg, in polyneuropathy (peripheral neuropathy), where the insidious onset of distal pain or numbness may be the only history indicating the disease. Characteristic sudden short-lasting (usually a few seconds) paroxysmal pain in the face, which may recur several times and may be separated by a refractory period (usually some minutes), suggests trigeminal neuralgia, where the pain is the only symptom indicating a relevant neurological disease.

4.1.2. Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible

The pain distribution should be anatomically consistent with the suspected location of the lesion or disease in the peripheral or central somatosensory nervous system (as derived from the patient's history). This can be difficult to decipher in the single patient, as the distribution of pain can occupy a smaller area or extend somewhat outside the innervation territory of a peripheral nerve or root or the somatotopic representation of the body within the central nervous system, but it should be in a distribution that is typical for the underlying disorder (see examples in Table 1). In painful channelopathies, the pain distribution may be unusual but should be consistent with the disorder, eg, familial episodic pain syndrome, in which pain is mainly localized to the chest and upper arms, or inherited erythromelalgia, in which pain is localized to the extremities (feet and hands and in some cases ears).

Table 1. 
Common neuropathic pain conditions and neuroanatomically plausible distribution of pain symptoms and sensory signs.

When both requirements 1 and 2 of the pain history are fulfilled, the pain complaint may be termed possible neuropathic pain.

### Prediction of central post-stroke pain by quantitative sensory testing [^737485aa]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study is pioneering in prospectively applying QST to acute somatosensory stroke patients and identifying early sensory differences predictive of CPSP development. Notably, differences in cold perception between CPSP and NPSS patients shortly after stroke were found to be significant. Early classification of impending CPSP based on QST‐patterns seems possible. Both NPSS and CPSP patients showed bilateral sensory changes in the acute and chronic post‐stroke stages. The early post‐stroke phase is critical, highlighting the importance of timely interventions. Integrating clinical assessments with QST can enhance the identification of patients prone to central neuropathic pain, enabling early therapeutic measures to mitigate pain chronification.

### Role of sensory pathway injury in central post-stroke pain: a narrative review of its pathogenetic mechanism [^1b0be2c4]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central neuropathic pain commonly includes pain caused by central post-stroke pain (CPSP), spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis.Stroke is one of the most common causes of disability and the second most common cause of death worldwide. The global burden of stroke is increasing as the population ages.CPSP is a known complication during stroke rehabilitation.Stroke patients often suffer from different forms of chronic pain, commonly in the form of CPSP, shoulder pain, painful spasticity.In 1906, Dejerine and Roussy first described a case of severe and persistent lateralized pain after a thalamic stroke; this pain syndrome was later named as the Dejerine–Roussy syndrome.Because central pain also occurs due to vascular lesions in the central nervous system other than the thalamus, the term CPSP is not limited to only thalamic strokes but tends to describe neuropathic pain that occurs after cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes.At present, there is no stipulated definition for the diverse clinical manifestations of CPSP.The pain can be described as persistent pain such as “burning”, “pricking”, “freezing”, and “squeezing”, intermittent pain such as “tearing” or “shooting”. CPSP is not easily distinguished from post-stroke peripheral musculoskeletal pain and is easily overlooked in clinical practice, which may delay the recovery process and reduce the quality of life. Moreover, this kind of pain responds poorly to common anti-neuralgic drugs and lasts for a prolonged time; this not only drastically affects the quality of life in the recovery period after stroke, but also has an effect on individuals’ psychological health, resulting in anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders.Therefore, in order to develop more effective treatments for CPSP, it is important to review the possible mechanisms of CPSP occurrence.

### Epidemiology of functional stroke mimic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^19b24281]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Stroke mimics form a significant proportion of cases in acute stroke services and some present with functional neurological disorder. Little is known about the prevalence or clinical characteristics of functional stroke mimics (FSMs). A systematic literature search and meta-analysis were carried out on published studies reporting suspected stroke and stroke mimic rates; 114 papers met the inclusion criteria of which 70 provided an FSM rate. Random-effects models estimated prevalence rates across settings and moderators of FSM rate. Pooled proportions indicated that 25% [95% confidence intervals (CI), 22-27%] of suspected stroke cases were stroke mimics. Within the 67 studies providing positive FSM rates, FSMs represented 15% (95% CI, 13-18%) of stroke mimics and 2% (95% CI, 2-3%) of suspected strokes. FSMs were younger and more likely to be female, and presented more with weakness/numbness but less with reduced consciousness or language problems. Stratified analyses suggested higher stroke mimic rates in primary care versus acute settings (38% vs. 12%) but higher FSM rates in stroke units compared with primary care (24% vs. 12%). Functional rates were higher in studies that were descriptive, retrospective and in patients receiving thrombolysis. Several studies reported the proportion of functional stroke patients presenting to stroke services. FSMs have discernible demographic and clinical characteristics, but there is a conspicuous lack of evidence on their presentation or guidance for treatment. The social and psychological mechanisms underlying FSM presentations need more accurate quantification to help inform stroke pathways and improve care for these patients.

### Post-stroke pain case study: clinical characteristics, therapeutic options and long-term follow-up [^fb8a565e]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a syndrome characterized by sensory disturbances and neuropathic pain. In 40%-60% of CPSP patients, the onset of central pain following a stroke occurs more than 1 month after the stroke, creating a source of diagnostic uncertainty or significant delay in treatment since healthcare providers familiar with CPSP may no longer be caring for the patient when the symptoms occur. In addition to chronic pain, the presence of somatosensory abnormalities is the most important diagnostic corollary of CPSP. Neuropathic or central pain has been estimated to occur in up to 8% of patients after a stroke, and about 18% of stroke patients with a somatosensory disturbance will develop CPSP. Although largely a matter of conjecture, it is generally agreed that damage to spinothalamic sensory pathways plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of CPSP. A comprehensive examination of the patient for sensory deficits is essential before treatment can be initiated. Functional disturbances such as depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances are significant comorbid conditions associated with CPSP; the physician should incorporate an assessment of these potential comorbidities into the examination. Treatment options for CPSP are limited; at present, amitriptyline is the drug of first choice. Other drugs including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, opioids and N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists may provide relief for some patients who do not respond to amitriptyline. Included in this review is a case study outlining the challenges of managing the patient with CPSP.

### Neurologic manifestations of long COVID differ based on acute COVID-19 severity [^c3420c14]. Annals of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Frequency of Neurologic Symptoms and Signs Attributed to COVID 19.

Patients were evaluated in our clinic on average 6.8 months after symptom onset. The total average subjective impression of recovery compared to pre-COVID-19 baseline was 59.8% overall, with no statistically significant difference between the PNP and NNP groups (55.7% vs 60.6%, p = 0.07). The median number of neurologic symptoms attributed to COVID-19 was 7, and 91% reported more than 4 neurological symptoms with no differences between the 2 groups. Overall, the 10 most common neurological symptoms included non-specific cognitive complaints, which patients referred to as “brain fog” (81.2%), headache (70.3%), anosmia (55.7%), dysgeusia (54.5%), dizziness (49.5%), myalgia (47.5%), numbness/tingling (42.2%), pain other than chest (40.5%), tinnitus (28.7%), and blurred vision (26%). NNP patients more frequently reported anosmia (59% vs 39%; p = 0.0003), dysgeusia (57.6% vs 39%; p = 0.0009), and myalgias (50.4 vs 33%; p = 0.002) compared to the PNP group. Seizures, movement disorders, ischemic stroke, meningitis, or polyradiculitis were rare in both groups. None of our patients presented with Guillain-Barre syndrome/acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

### Low public recognition of major stroke symptoms [^a590bb18]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A Healthy People 2010 objective includes increasing public awareness of the warning signs of stroke, yet few data exist about the level of awareness. Recognition of stroke symptoms and awareness of the need to call 911 for acute stroke events were examined among the general population.

Methods

Data are from 61,019 adults participating in the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a state-based telephone survey. Respondents indicated whether the following were symptoms of stroke: confusion/trouble speaking; numbness/weakness of face, arm, or leg; trouble seeing; chest pain (false symptom); trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance; and severe headache with no known cause. Persons also reported the first action they would take if they thought someone was having a stroke.

Results

Only 17.2% of respondents overall (5.9% to 21.7% by state) correctly classified all stroke symptoms and indicated that they would call 911 if they thought someone was having a stroke. Recognition of all symptoms and knowledge of when to call 911 were comparable by gender but lower among ethnic minorities, younger and older people, those with less education, and current smokers compared to whites, middle-aged people, those with more education, and nonsmokers, respectively. There were no substantive differences by history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, or stroke.

Conclusions

Public recognition of major stroke symptoms is low. Educational campaigns to increase awareness among the general population and targeted messages to those at high-risk persons and their families may help to improve time to treatment for adults suffering acute strokes.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: treating hand pain and numbness [^8f799654]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain and a loss of feeling in your thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of your ring finger may be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. This syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand that result from it are caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Guidelines published in the May 2019 issue of JOSPT make recommendations, based on best practices from the published literature, for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. For you as a patient, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on the scientific research. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of the leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. These guidelines help inform the first step in that process. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2019;49(5):361. doi:10.2519/jospt.2019.0502 .

### Interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke [^44867bd4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Stroke is the second most frequent cause of mortality (Katan 2018), and the second leading cause of disability‐adjusted life‐years worldwide (Lanas 2021). In 2019, over 12 million people experienced a stroke (GBD 2019 Stroke Collaborators), with over 100,000 occurring in the United Kingdom (UK) each year (Royal College of Physicians 2021 ; Public Health Scotland 2021). Stroke can impact a person's ability to process sensory information (Mercier 2001). It is estimated that one in five stroke survivors experience a perceptual disorder (Rowe 2009).

Perception is the ability of the brain to interpret and integrate information received by the senses. It can involve multiple steps in the processing of sensory information, including understanding the information received, organising it, and assigning meaning (Lezak 2012). This includes hearing (auditory), smell (olfactory), somatosensation, touch (tactile), taste (gustatory), and visual systems. We present our definition of perception and details of the senses and disorders included in this review in the Types of participants section.

Perceptual disorders reduce an individual’s ability to understand their relationship to the environment and, in turn, to respond appropriately. Hearing perception disorders can affect listening and communication ability, impacting on participation in rehabilitation (Koohi 2017a). Inability to smell can result in safety concerns (e.g. detecting smoke, gas, or stale food (Wehling 2015)), whilst altered perception of touch can place affected limbs at risk of injury (such as burns) and negatively impact independence in everyday activities (Doyle 2010). Disordered perceptions of touch and somatosensation may: impair the control of posture and movement; lead to poorer performance of motor tasks; contribute to slower and/or poorer recovery of motor function; and negatively impact independence in everyday activities (Abe 2012 ; Carey 2011b ; Doyle 2010 ; Tyson 2008). Taste dysfunction can lead to impaired appetite due to unpleasantness of eating, potentially contributing to malnutrition, weight loss, and increased risk of depressive symptoms (Dutta 2013). Studies have shown that visual perceptual disorders are associated with reduced ability in activities of daily living (Prince 2017), greater disability, reduced quality of life (Ali 2013), and are a predictor of poor self‐care (Bernsprang 1987).

### Central poststroke pain: a population-based study [^5e12c013]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is a specific pain condition arising as a direct consequence of a cerebrovascular lesion. There is limited knowledge about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of this often neglected but important consequence of stroke. In this population-based study, a questionnaire was sent out to all (n=964) stroke patients identified through the Danish National Indicator Project Stroke Database in Aarhus County, Denmark, between March 2004 and February 2005. All surviving patients who fulfilled 4 questionnaire criteria for possible CPSP (n=51) were selected for further clinical examination, and their pain was classified by using stringent and well-defined criteria and a detailed, standardized clinical examination. The minimum prevalence of definite or probable CPSP in this population is 7.3% and the prevalence of CPSP-like dysesthesia or pain is 8.6%. Pinprick hyperalgesia was present in 57%, cold allodynia in 40%, and brush-evoked dysesthesia in 51% of patients with CPSP. Because of its negative impact on quality of life and rehabilitation, pain is an important symptom to assess in stroke survivors.

### Neuropathic pain: diagnosis, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment [^cd012087]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain develops as a result of lesions or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system either in the periphery or centrally. Examples of neuropathic pain include painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and post-stroke pain. Clinically, neuropathic pain is characterised by spontaneous ongoing or shooting pain and evoked amplified pain responses after noxious or non-noxious stimuli. Methods such as questionnaires for screening and assessment focus on the presence and quality of neuropathic pain. Basic research is enabling the identification of different pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical assessment of symptoms and signs can help to determine which mechanisms are involved in specific neuropathic pain disorders. Management of neuropathic pain requires an interdisciplinary approach, centred around pharmacological treatment. A better understanding of neuropathic pain and, in particular, of the translation of pathophysiological mechanisms into sensory signs will lead to a more effective and specific mechanism-based treatment approach.

### Perceptual disorders after stroke: a scoping review of interventions [^2effee55]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Perception is our ability to understand and organize information from our sensory systems: hearing, smell, somatosensation, taste, touch, and vision. Perceptual disorders are frequently undetected, but may affect up to 74% of stroke survivors – and persist for months or years post-onset. Perceptual disorders impact on stroke survivors’ ability to make sense of and interact with their environment, through recognition, differentiation, organization, and integration of sensory information,, impeding recovery and rehabilitation,self-care,and independence in everyday activities.

Assessment and management of perceptual problems poststroke is complex, due to the range of sensory systems and specialisms involved. Significant variability exists in care provision,pathways,, and stroke team training on perception and terminology. While stroke guidelines refer to perception, treatment recommendations focus on specific domains, and guidance on intervention selection or delivery is limited. – Intervention research is a priority for stroke survivors, carers, and health care professionals.

Previous intervention evidence reviews are fragmented, addressing single sensory domains,specific anatomic areas,individual perceptual disorders,or specific interventions,while others include mixed populations inclusive of nonperceptual disorders or nonstroke etiologies. An accessible, comprehensive, up-to-date evidence review relevant to stroke survivors, carers, and clinicians is required. We aimed to identify, map, and synthesize evidence relating to perceptual disorder interventions poststroke in a scoping review, providing a broad overview of the evidence and identifying research gaps.

### Pure sensory stroke due to brainstem lesion [^42793bf8]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The brainstem is the posterior portion of the brain that remains continuous with the spinal cord. It is composed of the midbrain, pons and medulla. These subdivisions are responsible for cranial nerve III–XII activity, nerve conduction via ascending and descending pathways and integrative functions including vasomotor control, breathing, swallowing, sleeping and maintaining consciousness. Strokes within the brainstem can impair any of these functions. Depending on the size and location of the lesion, patients can present with mild symptoms to profound, life-threatening deficits. This underscores the importance of having a basic understanding of the brainstem anatomical structures along with the ability to perform a thorough history and neurological examination. Clinical recognition and localisation of the lesion can help expedite an accurate diagnosis with early treatment initiation.

In general, brainstem strokes will have more sensory deficits if the lesion is localised posteriorly and more motor deficits if the lesion is localised anteriorly.On review of the literature, the main mechanism of brainstem infarcts presenting with predominant early-onset paraesthesia strongly suggests involvement of the medial lemniscus tract in the paramedian posterior pontine region.While thalamic lesions are the most common cause of PSS, pure lemniscal sensory deficits associated with the thalamus are uncommon.Thalamic lesions typically have additional involvement of the spinothalamic tract due to the wide projection of spinothalamic fibres to numerous thalamic nuclei.However, the medial lemniscus and spinothalamic tracts within the brainstem remain separate with their proximity varying from level to level. In the medulla, the medial lemniscus and the spinothalamic tracts are well separated from each other. As these tracts continue to ascend to the pons and inferior midbrain, they get much closer and more likely to become affected simultaneously.Small lacunar infarcts still have the ability to affect very localised regions within a single tract.

### Association between sociodemographic determinants and disparities in stroke symptom awareness among US young adults [^8d7c3438]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite declining stroke rates in the general population, stroke incidence and hospitalizations are rising among younger individuals. Awareness of and prompt response to stroke symptoms are crucial components of a timely diagnosis and disease management. We assessed awareness of stroke symptoms and response to a perceived stroke among young adults in the United States.

Methods

Using data from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey, we assessed awareness of 5 common stroke symptoms and the knowledge of planned response (ie, calling emergency medical services) among young adults (<45 years) across diverse sociodemographic groups. Common stroke symptoms included: (1) numbness of face/arm/leg, (2) confusion/trouble speaking, (3) difficulty walking/dizziness/loss of balance, (4) trouble seeing in one/both eyes, and (5) severe headache.

Results

Our study population included 24769 adults, of which 9844 (39.7%) were young adults who were included in our primary analysis, and represented 107.2 million US young adults (mean age 31.3 [±7.5] years, 50.6% women, and 62.2% non-Hispanic White). Overall, 2718 young adults (28.9%) were not aware of all 5 stroke symptoms, whereas 242 individuals (2.7%; representing 2.9 million young adults in the United States) were not aware of a single symptom. After adjusting for confounders, Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.17-3.28]), non-US born immigration status (odds ratio, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.31-3.11]), and lower education level (odds ratio, 2.77 [95% CI, 1.76-4.35]), were significantly associated with lack of symptom awareness. Individuals with 5 high-risk characteristics (non-White, non-US born, low income, uninsured, and high school educated or lower) had nearly a 4-fold higher odds of not being aware of all symptoms (odds ratio, 3.70 [95% CI, 2.43-5.62]).

Conclusions

Based on data from the National Health Interview Survey, a large proportion of young adults may not be aware of stroke symptoms. Certain sociodemographic subgroups with decreased awareness may benefit from focused public health interventions.

### Central post-stroke pain: clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management [^ed115f75]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain syndrome that can occur after a cerebrovascular accident. This syndrome is characterised by pain and sensory abnormalities in the body parts that correspond to the brain territory that has been injured by the cerebrovascular lesion. The presence of sensory loss and signs of hypersensitivity in the painful area in patients with CPSP might indicate the dual combination of deafferentation and the subsequent development of neuronal hyperexcitability. The exact prevalence of CPSP is not known, partly owing to the difficulty in distinguishing this syndrome from other pain types that can occur after stroke (such as shoulder pain, painful spasticity, persistent headache, and other musculoskeletal pain conditions). Future prospective studies with clear diagnostic criteria are essential for the proper collection and processing of epidemiological data. Although treatment of CPSP is difficult, the most effective approaches are those that target the increased neuronal hyperexcitability.

### Complaints of upper extremity numbness and tingling relieved with dry needling of the teres minor and infraspinatus: a case report [^569857a0]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design Case report. Background Abnormal sensation, such as numbness or tingling, is traditionally thought to originate from neural compression. There is limited evidence to support reports of abnormal sensation arising from a trigger point. Case Description The patient was a 60-year-old woman with a primary complaint of right shoulder pain and secondary complaints of neck pain and right upper extremity numbness. Cervical spine neurological examination was unremarkable, and manual examination did not reproduce the patient's arm numbness or tingling symptoms. Compression of a trigger point in the infraspinatus and teres minor reproduced the patient's primary complaint of shoulder pain. The initial intervention included dry needling, which reproduced her upper extremity numbness. Subsequent treatment included manual therapy and exercise. Outcomes The patient was seen for a total of 3 visits, including the evaluation. Dry needling was utilized in 2 of her 3 visits. At discharge, she reported complete resolution of pain and altered sensation. Additionally, her scores on the Neck Disability Index, numeric pain-rating scale, and global rating of change exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. These outcomes were maintained at 2- and 12-month follow-up phone calls. Discussion This case report described the examination and use of dry needling in a case where the diagnosis was unclear. Clinicians may consider trigger point referral when examining patients with reports of abnormal sensation, especially when a more common cause cannot be identified.

### Report of altered sensation in patients with cleft lip [^40af6143]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with cleft lip have normal perioral sensation.

Design

Each subject was carefully questioned about the following: sensation in the face at rest, light touch of different areas, and sensation in natural situations (e.g., exposure to cold weather) that reveal sensory abnormalities. A cotton-tip applicator stick was stroked lightly across the facial skin. The subject's descriptions of the evoked sensations were used to identify and outline areas with abnormal sensation.

Setting

Data were obtained from subjects participating in a longitudinal, university-based study of the functional outcomes of lip revision surgery.

Patients

Seventeen patients with cleft lip and 12 control subjects (aged 7 to 22 years, mean 12.9 years) participated.

Results

In contrast to control subjects, 9 of 16 patients (56%) reported loss in sensation, described as decreased touch, scratch, tickle, or tingle intensity. Six other patients (38%) reported additional sensation, described as increased scratch, tickle, or tingle intensity. In eight patients, the altered sensation was restricted to the skin area flanking and including the visible scar, encompassing no more than 25% of the total area bound by the inferior nose, nasolabial grooves and inferior vermilion. In seven patients (unilateral cleft), the altered area extended to the contralateral, noncleft side of the upper lip or onto the philtrum.

Conclusions

In contrast to the literature, sensation in the upper lip of many patients with cleft lip is not normal. Loss in sensation is exhibited most commonly and limited largely to the skin overlying tissues traumatized during reconstructive surgery.

### Pharmacologic management part 2: lesser-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^9b801f4a]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This second part of a review of the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain diseases describes the current treatment options for three lesser-studied neuropathic syndromes: Central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome II. Diagnosis can be difficult in patients with these syndromes, because the pain experienced is much greater and of a different type than would normally be expected following a stroke or injury to the spinal cord or a peripheral nerve. Even when an accurate and timely diagnosis is made, treatment options are limited and frequently suboptimal. However, the results of published trials do support the use of anticonvulsants and/or tricyclic antidepressants as first-line pharmacotherapy in these three neuropathic pain syndromes. To maximize treatment outcomes, future research must: Continue to more fully elucidate the relationship between the signs and symptoms of pain and the underlying pathophysiology; Delineate the natural history of central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome; Identify patient-related factors that may indicate an increased risk of developing neuropathic pain following stroke or nerve injury; Investigate emerging treatments that target underlying pain mechanisms.

### Prediction of central post-stroke pain by quantitative sensory testing [^126d3704]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, the QST findings in our CPSP patient cohort—both in the acute and chronic phase—indicate loss of function in most parameters, especially regarding protopathic sensation. However, there is heterogeneity among individuals, with some patients exhibiting gain of function. It seems more likely that combinations of symptoms could cluster patients together, as shown in peripheral neuropathy.Loss of function for pain parameters such as heat and pressure pain seems surprising as one might expect higher rates of evoked pain. Previous studies have reported gain of function, for example, up to 40% of patients experienced early evoked pain or dysesthesia.Consistently, among our CPSP patients, a subgroup shows signs of “gain of function”—15.8% of our CPSP patients show heat pain hyperalgesia and 35% have hyperalgesia to mechanical pain. Therefore, it seems that the currently popular and plausible explanation that because of central sensitization following damage to pathways carrying protopathic information, neuronal hyperexcitability gradually develops into spontaneous central pain, either cannot be easily translated into “gain of function” symptoms or might have to be modified. Although we cannot draw firm pathophysiological conclusions from our data, the interindividual heterogeneity of sensory symptoms observed may suggest that different sensory constellations may eventually converge on a common pathway leading to central neuropathic pain. Ongoing functional and structural neuroimaging studies may help to solve this puzzle. For example, it will be interesting to repeat the study of a small group of 8 CPSP patients in whom a peripheral lidocaine nerve block abolished both, perception of peripheral input as measured by QST and pain, using functional neuroimaging to potentially identify a common pathway.

### Interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke [^ebcf3ecc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We included any intervention that addressed a perceptual disorder. We grouped trials according to the sense affected (i.e. hearing (auditory), smell (olfactory), somatosensation (including proprioception, pressure, and temperature), touch (tactile), taste (gustatory), or vision (visual)). We planned to include and code interventions that addressed perceptual disorders across more than one sense as a 'mixed' group.

We categorised interventions by the perceptual disorder targeted, followed by the therapeutic approach adopted: rehabilitation, pharmacological, non‐invasive brain stimulation, surgical, or assessment and screening intervention. We further subcategorised rehabilitation interventions by the mode of action: restitution, compensation, substitution, or a combination of these (Table 5).

1 
Rehabilitation modes of action

Two review authors (CH/KMc/KT) independently classified included intervention approaches, with input from a third author (DG/SH) where differences could not be resolved through discussion. We included interventions delivered in any stroke care setting (hospital, community, and outpatient settings) and any geographical location.

We included trials in which a comparison was made between an active treatment group that received an intervention for a perceptual disorder, versus a group that received no treatment or control intervention (placebo, standard care, attention control – see Table 6) or an alternative perceptual intervention.

2 
Definitions of potential comparators

In addition, we aimed to examine whether one active intervention was more effective than any other active intervention for people with perceptual deficits after stroke in relation to the outcomes listed above. We also considered if some interventions were more effective for stroke survivors with specific demographic variables (including age, stroke severity, time since stroke), as measured by the primary outcome (ADL).

Types of outcome measures

Stakeholder Involvement

Our stakeholder group informed the selection of included outcome measures. This process involved identifying relevant outcome categories, then using a consensus process to rank them by importance in the context of this review.

### Interventions for perceptual disorders following stroke [^a9c92c34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Perceptual disorders following stroke can affect all senses (hearing, smell, somatosensation, taste, touch and vision). Currently, information on interventions available for perceptual disorders is limited. A range of healthcare professionals care for stroke survivors, yet some may not be fully aware of the range of perceptual impairments that can present following stroke (Dutta 2013). As a result, some impairments may go undiagnosed (Jones 2006), and therefore, untreated. Stroke survivors may be unaware of their own perceptual disorder(s) and lack understanding of the impact they have on everyday activities, which may in turn reduce their self‐confidence (Hazelton 2019a). Visual perceptual disorders are arguably the most well known, yet care provision for these disorders varies, with significant inequity in access even within the UK (Rowe 2015). Barriers to service provision include healthcare providers' limited knowledge, unclear treatment protocols, and a lack of evidence to inform effective rehabilitation (Pollock 2011a).

The first version of this review was published in 2011 (Bowen 2011). This updated and revised version reflects the recognition that an updated synthesis of new evidence in this field is needed.

Stakeholder involvement

In order to ensure that this review update was relevant and meaningful to key stakeholders, a group of five people with lived experience of stroke and four with expert clinical knowledge were involved throughout all stages of the review. This stakeholder group was formed as part of a wider project relating to evidence for perceptual problems after stroke (Hazelton 2019b). We adopted a 'top and tail' approach to the stakeholder group's input into the review (Pollock 2019a); that is, the stakeholder group contributed to decision making at the planning and methods stage of the review update, and during the interpretation of results during the final stages of the review update. We facilitated involvement through the use of structured methods, such as discussion and independent voting via a series of meetings and online communications. The stakeholder group informed and agreed on the definitions of perception and the senses used in this version of the review. The group also established priorities for outcome measures, which informed the primary and secondary outcomes of interest for this review update. The group members considered the results of the review and contributed ideas which have been incorporated into the organisation, interpretation of data analyses, discussion, and conclusions of this review.

Twenty patients were studied who developed central poststroke pain or paresthesia after lenticulocapsular hemorrhage. Pain or paresthesia occurred 0 to 24 months after the onset, more prominently in the leg than other body parts. The symptoms were described as numb, cold, burning, aching, swollen, and squeezing in various combinations. The mean score of the visual numerical scale was 5.6. The lesions involved the dorsal part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, probably damaging the thalamocortical sensory pathway.

Discussion

Summary of Findings

Our scoping review scoped the breadth and nature of perceptual disorder interventions poststroke, highlighting gaps in the evidence base. We identified 80 studies that explored predominantly visual or somatosensory perceptual problems, typically using a case report design. Interventions were frequently rehabilitative, with an approach that targeted improvements in the impaired function. Interventions most often involved direct training by an HCP, as well as those using technology-based devices and specialist equipment. Interventions reported were typically hospital based, lasting up to 4 weeks. Few captured outcomes beyond initial postintervention training effects. Perceptual and motor/sensorimotor skills were the most common outcomes reported. We noted an encouraging upward trajectory in the number of perceptual disorder (especially somatosensation) research reports, particularly RCT designs, since 2015.

Gaps in the Evidence

Our scoping review reveals the paucity of evidence informing perceptual disorder interventions poststroke. Key gaps include lack of research addressing perceptual disorders in pediatric populations; interventions for stroke-related hearing, taste, touch, and smell disorders; RCTs; and stakeholder-informed research. While a range of study designs are needed in early-stage intervention development, high-quality RCTs are important in building the evidence base related to treatment effectiveness. Of the 80 studies in this review, only 22 were RCTs; this is significantly lower than, for example, the 65 current trials in neglect found in a recent review.

Perception Terminology

The range and complexity of perceptual terminology continues to be a challenge.Despite achieving agreement on our definitions and included senses/disorders, we encountered challenges applying our a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Perception was inadequately reported, thus determining whether disorders affected perception, cognition, sensation, attention, or a mix of these was difficult. Inconsistent terms for similar conditions across pediatric and adult populations, and across senses, plus use of complex, Latinate terminology hindered transparency and clarity of interpretation. Clear statements of the nature of disorders, and how intervention rationale or mechanisms relate to perception, are needed. International, multidisciplinary consensus on the terminology used would serve to progress the field of research and improve awareness, multidisciplinary identification, and intervention for those affected.

### How central is central poststroke pain? The role of afferent input in poststroke neuropathic pain: a prospective, open-label pilot study [^cdb51c40]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain disorder, the underlying mechanisms of which are not well understood. It has been suggested that stroke-associated loss of inhibitory neurons in the spinothalamic tract causes disinhibition of thalamic neurons, which autonomously generate ectopic nociceptive action potentials responsible for the pain experience. We hypothesized that CPSP is a result of misinterpretation of afferent sensory input by the sensitized neurons within the brain, rather than generated spontaneously by the damaged central nervous system (CNS) neurons. To test this hypothesis, we prospectively recruited 8 patients with definite CPSP affecting at least 1 extremity. In an open-label intervention, an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block with lidocaine was performed to block afferent sensory input from a painful extremity. Spontaneous and evoked pain, neuropathic pain descriptors, and lidocaine plasma concentrations were measured. The blockade of peripheral sensory input resulted in complete abolition of pain in 7 of the 8 subjects within 30 minutes (the primary outcome measure of the study), and >50% pain relief in the remaining participant. Median (interquartile range) spontaneous pain intensity changed from 6.5 (4.3-7.0) at baseline to 0 (0-0) after the block (P = 0.008). All mechanical/thermal hypersensitivity was abolished by the nerve block. The results suggest that it is unlikely that CPSP is autonomously generated within the CNS. Rather, this pain is dependent on afferent input from the painful region in the periphery, and may be mediated by misinterpretation of peripheral sensory input by sensitized neurons in the CNS.

### Evidence for the retraining of sensation after stroke: a systematic review [^d5d1d8b8]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Retraining of sensory function following stroke is frequently overlooked in rehabilitation protocols despite more than 60% of patients presenting with sensory deficits. Methods to train sensory function include both passive and active training protocols. Here we examined the volume and quality of the evidence available for both passive and active sensory training following stroke. In addition, we aimed to quantify the effect of sensory training on impairment and function.

Data Sources

Databases searched included MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, Academic search elite, Scopus and the Cochrane library. Unpublished articles were identified using a search engine.

Review Methods

Studies utilizing passive or active sensory training paradigms post stroke were identified. Methodological quality was examined using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence and the McMaster University critical appraisal tool.

Results

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria; 8 examined passive and 6 active sensory training. Methodological quality scores ranged from 11 to 18.5 (maximum 20). Meta-analysis was performed using three studies examining hand function, demonstrating a moderate effect in favour of passive sensory training. Other studies were unable to be pooled due to heterogeneity of measures or insufficient data.

Conclusion

Meta-analyses and single studies offer some support for the effectiveness of passive sensory training in relation to sensory impairment and motor function. However, empirical evidence for active sensory training is limited. Further high-quality studies with greater statistical power and meaningful clinical measures are required in order to accurately determine the effectiveness of sensory retraining following stroke.

### Association of prediabetes and diabetes with stroke symptoms: the REasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke (REGARDS) study [^6a2ed537]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of stroke among individuals without diabetes, but data investigating the association between metabolic syndrome and stroke symptoms are limited. The current study observed an association between metabolic syndrome and any stroke symptom but not two or more stroke symptoms after multivariable adjustment. Additionally, metabolic syndrome was not associated with the individual stroke symptoms of vision loss and lost ability to understand, although these symptoms were associated with diabetes in this study.

It is unclear whether the stroke symptoms reported among people with diabetes in this study represent unrecognized cerebral infarcts specifically or some other pathophysiologic process, possibly related to diabetes complications (e.g. retinopathy, neuropathy). Brain imaging was not available in this study; thus, we could not confirm the prevalence of imaging-confirmed strokes. It is notable that previous studies have reported mostly null findings for the association between diabetes and silent cerebral infarctions (–), with the exception of the Rotterdam Scan Study, which reported an association between diabetes and incident silent cerebral infarctions over 3.5 years of follow-up. Additionally, inconsistent findings have been reported for the association between prediabetes and silent cerebral infarctions. The current study focused on clinically overt symptoms, which may or may not have been evaluated by a physician, and the relationship between these overt stroke symptoms and truly silent cerebral infarcts is not clear. The QVSS used in this study assessed the sudden onset of unilateral numbness and weakness, whereas diabetic neuropathy typically does not have a sudden onset and often presents bilaterally. Stroke symptom clusters, which may be less prone to misclassification, were also more common among individuals with diabetes in the current study. However, the prevalence of stroke symptom clusters was low overall, limiting the power of this analysis. While the QVSS has demonstrated good sensitivity and modest specificity compared with stroke status determined by a neurologist in a general medicine population, its performance in a population of people with diabetes has not been evaluated.

### Navigating self-doubt in modern medicine [^b3980fec]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

My patient, who I'll call Jay, confided in me, unease gripping him tightly. He recounted a dream from over a decade ago that had left an indelible mark. In that dream, he saw his early demise, and now, in his early 50s, he felt that ominous prediction slowly unfolding.

He appeared disheveled with loose sweatpants chosen for comfort, as any contact with his left hip and leg caused searing pain. I noted his thick glasses and impaired hearing, which necessitated my sitting to his left and almost shouting at him. He complained of a persistent headache in his right temple, with occasional throbbing behind his right eye. His left foot felt numb, and he described tingling around his lip and chin. He also mentioned a sensation of detachment from his own body.

He suffered a cerebellar stroke 2 years ago. Since then, he had an increasing serum creatinine and worsening proteinuria. We attributed those abnormalities to his diabetes. He had abandoned metformin due to its adverse effects but continued taking his long‐acting insulin daily.

I couldn't accept that all his symptoms could solely be attributed to diabetes; his A1c was a modest 7.4%. I next conducted a hurried internet search for his symptoms. And there it was: Fabry disease. His life had been troubled by fatigue, unrelenting nausea, and vomiting that kept him bedridden for hours. He consumed nearly 6 quarts of water daily and mentioned a recent visit for cataracts. When I asked about his perspiration, he smiled, noting that he hadn't sweated at all. My heart raced.

### Role of sensory pathway injury in central post-stroke pain: a narrative review of its pathogenetic mechanism [^cb45bc75]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a severe chronic neuropathic pain syndrome that is a direct result of cerebrovascular lesions affecting the central somatosensory system. The pathogenesis of this condition remains unclear owing to its extensive clinical manifestations. Nevertheless, clinical and animal experiments have allowed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying CPSP occurrence, based on which different theoretical hypotheses have been proposed. We reviewed and collected the literature and on the mechanisms of CPSP by searching the English literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases for the period 2002–2022. Recent studies have reported that CPSP occurrence is mainly due to post-stroke nerve injury and microglial activation, with an inflammatory response leading to central sensitization and de-inhibition. In addition to the primary injury at the stroke site, peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and brain regions outside the stroke site are involved in the occurrence and development of CPSP. In the present study, we reviewed the mechanism of action of CPSP from both clinical studies and basic research based on its sensory pathway. Through this review, we hope to increase the understanding of the mechanism of CPSP.

Cluster headache – triptan adverse effects and patient preferences—Reported adverse events (AEs) included local reaction paresthesia (the most common), sweating, feeling of heaviness, somnolence, nausea and vomiting, injection-site reaction (e.g., pain, swelling, burning, erythema, tingling), neurologic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, tiredness, numbness of hands, tingling, feeling of paralysis in the face, cold and hot sensations), bad taste, discomfort of nasal cavity, and pain or tightness in the throat, chest, or neck; AEs were more common with a triptan versus placebo but were generally mild or moderate in severity. Patient preferences vary little regarding the acute treatment of cluster headache, and despite intranasal and subcutaneous administration methods typically being less preferred than oral medications, patients with cluster headaches have less variability in acceptance of these alternative administration methods because the preference for rapid pain freedom is much stronger.

5.1 Neuraxial Anesthesia and Post-operative Indwelling Epidural Catheter Use

Spinal or epidural hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, can occur with the use of anticoagulants and neuraxial (spinal/epidural) anesthesia or spinal puncture. The risk of these events may be higher with post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or concomitant use of other drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs [see Boxed Warning] . In the postmarketing experience, epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of ARIXTRA by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Optimal timing between the administration of ARIXTRA and neuraxial procedures is not known. Monitor patients undergoing these procedures for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Consider the potential risks and benefits before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or who may be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.

5.2 Hemorrhage

ARIXTRA increases the risk of hemorrhage in patients at risk for bleeding, including conditions such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery. Cases of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of ARIXTRA (with or without concomitant administration of other anticoagulants) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] .

Conditions associated with increased bleeding in pediatric patients include systemic lupus erythematosus, Wilms tumor, antiphospholipid syndrome, antithrombin III deficiency, Factor V Leiden, malignancy, pancytopenia, indwelling chest tubes, thoracotomy, invasive infections, hypertensive encephalopathy, intestinal lymphangiectasia and von Willebrand disease.

Do not administer agents that enhance the risk of hemorrhage with ARIXTRA unless essential for the management of the underlying condition, such as vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE. If co-administration is essential, closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

Do not administer the initial dose of ARIXTRA earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery. Administration earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases risk of major bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

Materials and Methods

Subjects

Patients with an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke affecting the somatosensory system were enrolled at the Charité‐Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany between 2010 and 2016. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (EA4/003/10) and informed consent was obtained from all participants before inclusion.

Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 85 years and a transient or persistent somatosensory deficit with a corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐proven acute unilateral stroke within central parts of the somatosensory system (ie, medulla oblongata, pons, thalamus, internal capsule, or somatosensory cortices). A transient somatosensory deficit was defined as a sensory symptom that was present in the acute phase at presentation but recovered spontaneously or after treatment. A persistent somatosensory deficit was defined as a sensory symptom that did not recover during the period of the study. Exclusion criteria are detailed in the supplementary methods. The neurological examination comprised detailed sensory and motor testing to diagnose the underlying etiology. In patients who reported pain, pain intensity, pain quality, pain course, and pain duration were assessed with validated pain questionnaires (see below).

According to Klit et al. 1 CPSP was defined as pain that occurred as a direct result of a stroke to the central somatosensory system, confirmed by MRI, in the body area corresponding to the somatosensory deficit (eg, hypoesthesia, paresthesia). Other causes of pain, such as nociceptive or peripheral neuropathic pain (complex regional pain syndrome, joint abnormalities, spasticity, and pain types unrelated to the injury), were excluded or considered highly unlikely. Therefore, according to the criteria recently set out by Rosner et al. 22 all our CPSP patients fulfilled the criteria for “definite CPSP.” Hyperalgesia and allodynia, which emerged only during clinical examination, but were not perceived in daily life, were not classified as CPSP. It is conceivable that some NPSS patients share characteristics of hypersensitivity without developing manifest CPSP.

CPSP most commonly occurs within the first few months after a stroke,,,therefore, in‐person follow up for the diagnosis of CPSP was chosen to be at least 6 months after the stroke. Classification of a patient as CPSP (or NPSS) was done retrospectively in the following 12 months when either pain occurred, meeting the above‐mentioned criteria of CPSP, or no pain occurred (NPSS).

### Complex regional pain syndrome – diagnostic, mechanisms, CNS involvement and therapy [^c940d9b2]. Spinal Cord (2003). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS, formerly reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia) are neuropathic pain conditions of one extremity developing inadequately after a trauma. The initiating trauma affects primarily the extremity, but can also be a central lesion (e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke). CRPS is clinically characterized by sensory, autonomic and motor disturbances. Pathophysiologically there is evidence for functional changes within the central nervous system and for involvement of peripheral inflammatory processes. The sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in maintaining pain and autonomic dysfunction in the affected extremity. After a primary central lesion, secondary peripheral changes in the paretic extremity are suggested to be important in initiating a CRPS. Though there is no diagnostic gold standard, careful clinical evaluation and additional test procedures should lead to an adequate diagnosis. An early diagnosis and an interdisciplinary approach are important for optimal and successful treatment.

Post-acute neurological sequelae of COVID-19 affect millions of people worldwide, yet little data is available to guide treatment strategies for the most common symptoms. We conducted a scoping review of PubMed/Medline from 1/1/2020-4/1/2023 to identify studies addressing diagnosis and treatment of the most common post-acute neurological sequelae of COVID-19 including: cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue, weakness, numbness/pain, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Utilizing the available literature and international disease-specific society guidelines, we constructed symptom-based differential diagnoses, evaluation and management paradigms. This pragmatic, evidence-based consensus document may serve as a guide for a holistic approach to post-COVID neurological care and will complement future clinical trials by outlining best practices in the evaluation and treatment of post-acute neurological signs/symptoms.

Recent studies have reported that CPSP occurrence is mainly due to post-stroke nerve injury and microglial activation, with an inflammatory response leading to central sensitization and de-inhibition. In addition to the primary injury at the stroke site, peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and brain regions outside the stroke site are involved in the occurrence and development of CPSP. In the present study, we reviewed the mechanism of action of CPSP from both clinical studies and basic research based on its sensory pathway. Through this review, we hope to increase the understanding of the mechanism of CPSP.

### Bupivacaine hydrochloride (Sensorcaine) [^aa12f05e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Injection of repeated doses of local anesthetics may cause significant increases in plasma levels with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites, or to slow metabolic degradation. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients and acutely ill patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status. Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with hypotension or heartblock.

Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness should be performed after each local anesthetic injection. It should be kept in mind at such times that restlessness, anxiety, incoherent speech, lightheadedness, numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, twitching, depression, or drowsiness may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.

Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously and in carefully restricted quantities in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply such as digits, nose, external ear, or penis. Patients with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury or necrosis may result.

### Stroke in a young man: a late complication of radiation therapy [^ccdd93a4]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 37-year-old man presented with complaints of left sided facial numbness and sensation of warmth in left face associated with new right-sided hemiparesis. He was working at his computer when he developed sudden numbness of his left lip and simultaneous feelings of right sided weakness. He then began to feel a sensation of warmness of his left face, starting in the ear and travelling to the rest of the face. On neurological examination, he had right-sided and left-sided weakness, with no changes in speech or mentation. The patient also reported a rash on the abdomen and right elbow for 1 week; he had been in urgent care and started on a prednisone taper. He was also diagnosed with colitis after left abdominal pain and was taking ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.

The patient had a history of chronic essential hypertension, hypothyroidism and Hodgkin lymphoma of left side of neck without metastasis at the age of 10, which was treated with radiation of neck and chest as well as splenectomy; and sleeve gastrectomy complicated by bilateral ischaemic strokes 1 year ago with residual left arm and leg weakness. He had 180 lb weight loss after surgery. Patient was on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily since the stroke.

### What is "usual care" in the rehabilitation of upper limb sensory loss after stroke? Results from a national audit and knowledge translation study [^0eb7eb58]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To characterise the assessments and treatments that comprise "usual care" for stroke patients with somatosensory loss, and whether usual care has changed over time.

Materials and Methods

Comparison of cross-sectional, observational data from (1) Stroke Foundation National Audit of Acute (2007-2019) and Rehabilitation (2010-2018) Stroke Services and (2) the SENSe Implement multi-site knowledge translation study with occupational therapists and physiotherapists ( n =115). Descriptive statistics, random effects logistic regression, and content analysis were used.

Results

Acute hospitals ( n =172) contributed 24996 cases across audits from 2007 to 2019 (median patient age 76years, 54% male). Rehabilitation services ( n =134) contributed organisational survey data from 2010 to 2014, with 7165 cases (median 76years, 55% male) across 2016-2018 clinical audits ( n =127 services). Somatoensory assessment protocol use increased from 53% (2007) to 86% (2019) (odds ratio 11.4, 95% CI 5.0-25.6). Reported use of sensory-specific retraining remained stable over time (90-93%). Therapist practice reports for n =86 patients with somatosensory loss revealed 16% did not receive somatosensory rehabilitation. The most common treatment approaches were sensory rehabilitation using everyday activities (69%), sensory re-education (68%), and compensatory strategies (64%).

Conclusion

Sensory assessment protocol use has increased over time while sensory-specific training has remained stable. Sensory rehabilitation in the context of everyday activities is a common treatment approach. Clinical trial registration number: ACTRN12615000933550IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONOnly a small proportion of upper limb assessments conducted with stroke patients focus specifically on sensation; increased use of standardised upper limb assessments for sensory loss is needed.Stroke patients assessed as having upper limb sensory loss frequently do not receive treatment for their deficits.Therapists typically use everyday activities to treat upper limb sensory loss and may require upskilling in sensory-specific retraining to benefit patients.

### Functional lesion network mapping of sensory deficits after ischemic stroke [^84da4355]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sensory deficits are common after stroke, leading to disability and poor quality of life. Although lesion locations and patterns of structural brain network disruption have been associated with sensory disturbances, the relation with functional lesion connectivity has not yet been established.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Indirect functional lesion network mapping to identify brain regions remote from the primary lesion associated with deficits on the Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance test. Associations between Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance scores and functional connectivity of the lesion site with prespecified components of the somatosensory system.

Results

One hundred one patients (mean age, 62 years; 32% women) from the TOPOS study (Topological and Clinical Prospective Study About Somatosensation in Stroke). Lesion network mapping identified a bilateral fronto-parietal network associated with sensory deficits in the acute phase after stroke. There were graded associations between deficits and functional lesion connectivity to sensory cortices, but not the thalamus.

Conclusions

Infarcts in brain regions remote from, but functionally connected, to the somatosensory network are associated with somatosensory deficits measured by the Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance test, reflecting the hierarchical functional anatomy of sensory processing. Further research is needed to translate these findings into improved prognosis and personalized rehabilitation strategies.

### Atrial fibrillation and stroke symptoms in the REGARDS study [^95aed756]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Cross‐Sectional Analysis

The participant exclusion cascade for the REGARDS participants used in the cross‐sectional analysis is shown in Figure S1. The final analytic sample included 27 135 (89.7%) of the 30 239 REGARDS participants, after excluding participants with missing baseline forms (0.2%), stroke or TIA reported at baseline (10.1%), and missing AF or stroke symptoms data at baseline (0.01%).

Demographic characteristics of participants with AF (n=2124) and without AF (n=25 011) at baseline are compared in Table 1. Participants with AF were older, more likely to be men, less likely to be Black, and had lower income (<$34 000 annually), lower education level (high school diploma or less), and a higher prevalence of most vascular risk factors. They were also slightly more likely to live in the stroke belt or buckle regions. As expected, participants with AF had a higher prevalence of warfarin use (20.9% versus 1.3% among those without AF) and were slightly more likely to be taking antiplatelet agents (36.2% versus 32.8% among those without AF).

Table 1 
Baseline Characteristics of REGARDS Study Participants Stratified by History or Presence of AF (n=27 135)

The type and number of stroke symptoms reported by participants at baseline are depicted in Figure 1. Among those with AF, 28.6% reported ever having a stroke symptom, 9.0% reported 2 symptoms, and 6.2% reported ≥3 symptoms. Among those without AF, 16.6% reported ever having a stroke symptom, 4.3% reported 2 symptoms, and 2.1% reported ≥3 symptoms. Among those with AF, the most commonly reported type of symptom was sudden numbness (15.8%) followed by sudden painless weakness (11.6%). Similarly, among those without AF, the most commonly reported type of symptom sudden numbness (7.9%) followed by sudden painless weakness (5.3%). Complete data for baseline stroke symptoms are reported in Table S1.

### Acute and chronic animal models for the evaluation of anti-diabetic agents [^9dbbbb87]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Stroke

A stroke results when the blood supply to the brain is suddenly cut off, which can occur when a blood vessel in the brain or neck is blocked or the vessel bursts. Brain cells are then deprived of oxygen and die. A stroke can result in problems with speech or vision or can cause weakness or paralysis. Most strokes are caused by fatty deposits or blood clots jelly-like clumps of blood cells that narrow or block one of the blood vessels in the brain or neck. A blood clot may stay where it formed or can travel within the body. People with diabetes are at increased risk for strokes caused by blood clots. A stroke may also be caused by a bleeding blood vessel in the brain. Called an aneurysm, a break in a blood vessel can occur as a result of high blood pressure or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall.

Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs)

TIAs are caused by a temporary blockage of a blood vessel to the brain. This blockage leads to a brief, sudden change in brain function, such as temporary numbness or weakness on one side of the body. Sudden changes in brain function also can lead to loss of balance, confusion, blindness in one or both eyes, double vision, difficulty speaking, or a severe headache. However, most symptoms disappear quickly and permanent damage is unlikely. If symptoms do not resolve in a few minutes, rather than a TIA, the event could be a stroke. The occurrence of a TIA means that a person is at risk for a stroke sometime in the future.

Heart Failure

Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart cannot pump blood properly. Heart failure develops over a period of years, and symptoms can get worse over time. People with diabetes have at least twice the risk of heart failure as other people. Blockage of the blood vessels and high blood glucose levels also can damage heart muscle and cause irregular heartbeats. People damaged heart muscle (a condition called cardiomyopathy) may have no symptoms in the early stages, but later they may experience weakness, shortness of breath, a severe cough, fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet. Diabetes can also interfere with pain signals normally carried by the nerves, explaining why a person with diabetes may not experience the typical warning signs of a heart attack.

### Abnormal sweating patterns associated with itching, burning and tingling of the skin indicate possible underlying small-fibre neuropathy [^a3efb340]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Itching, burning, numbness and tingling of the skin are frequent reasons for dermatology consultation. We hypothesized that these sensations may be attributable to a small-fibre neuropathy. Sweating, which is mediated by small nerve fibres, may be a surrogate marker of small-fibre neuropathy.

Objectives

To investigate the results of thermoregulatory sweat testing (TST), which depicts and estimates whole-body sweating, in patients with itching, burning, numbness and tingling sensations.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 227 patients with itching, burning, numbness and tingling sensations involving the skin who were seen at our institution during 2008 and also underwent TST.

Results

The mean age of the cohort was 54 years (range 3-89), and 58% were female. In all, 149 patients (66%) had abnormal TST results; in 119 (80%) of these patients the areas of anhidrosis on TST corresponded to their symptomatic areas. For each symptom analysed separately, the area of anhidrosis correlated with the area of symptoms in most patients.

Conclusions

Patients with burning, itching, numbness and tingling have abnormal sweating patterns and often do not sweat in the symptomatic areas. These novel findings suggest that a small-fibre neuropathy may underlie many cutaneous symptoms and that the neuropathy can be estimated using TST.

### Association of prediabetes and diabetes with stroke symptoms: the REasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke (REGARDS) study [^6ee5a91f]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Stroke symptoms among individuals reporting no physician diagnosis of stroke are associated with an increased risk of future stroke. Few studies have assessed whether individuals with diabetes or prediabetes, but no physician diagnosis of stroke, have an increased prevalence of stroke symptoms.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This study included 25,696 individuals aged ≥45 years from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study who reported no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack at baseline (2003–2007). Glucose measurements, medication use, and self-reported physician diagnosis were used to categorize participants into diabetes, prediabetes, or normal glycemia groups. The presence of six stroke symptoms was assessed using a validated questionnaire.

RESULTS

The prevalence of any stroke symptom was higher among participants with diabetes (22.7%) compared with those with prediabetes (15.6%) or normal glycemia (14.9%). In multivariable models, diabetes was associated with any stroke symptom (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.28 [95% CI 1.18–1.39]) and two or more stroke symptoms (1.26 [1.12–1.43]) compared with normal glycemia. In analyses of individual stroke symptoms, diabetes was associated with numbness (1.15 [1.03–1.29]), vision loss (1.52 [1.31–1.76]), half-vision loss (1.54 [1.30–1.84]), and lost ability to understand people (1.34 [1.12–1.61]) after multivariable adjustment. No association was present between prediabetes and stroke symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS

In this population-based study, almost one in four individuals with diabetes reported stroke symptoms, which suggests that screening for stroke symptoms in diabetes may be warranted.

### Evaluation and management of the dysesthetic patient [^8d5d0664]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dysesthesia is symptomatology that includes but is not limited to sensations of pain, burning, crawling, biting, numbness, piercing, pulling, cold, shock-like, pulling, wetness, and heat. These sensations can cause significant emotional distress and functional impairment in affected individuals. Although some cases of dysesthesia are secondary to organic etiologies, most cases exist without an identifiable infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, or neoplastic process. Ongoing vigilance is required for concurrent or evolving processes, including paraneoplastic presentations. Elusive etiologies, unclear treatment regimens, and stigma leave patients and clinicians with a difficult path forward marked by "doctor shopping," lack of treatment, and significant psychosocial distress. We address this symptomatology and the psychosocial burden that often comes with it. Although notoriously labeled as "difficult to treat," dysesthesia patients can be effectively managed, making life-changing relief possible for patients.

### Association of prediabetes and diabetes with stroke symptoms: the REasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke (REGARDS) study [^60c836b2]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1 
Prevalence of any stroke symptom and each individual stroke symptom by diabetes status: the REGARDS study.

Table 2 
PORs (95% CI) for stroke symptoms associated with prediabetes and diabetes among REGARDS study participants

The prevalence of stroke symptom clusters is presented in Fig. 2. Participants with diabetes had a higher prevalence of any two or more stroke symptoms (9.6%) compared with participants with prediabetes (5.8%) or normal glycemia (5.7%). The prevalence of stroke symptom clusters was also higher among participants with diabetes compared with those with prediabetes or normal glycemia. After multivariable adjustment, participants with diabetes were more likely to have two or more stroke symptoms (Table 2) compared with those with normal glycemia. Diabetes was also associated with stroke symptom clusters after adjustment for age, race, and sex, but these associations were attenuated and no longer statistically significant after additional multivariable adjustment. Prediabetes was not associated with having two or more stroke symptoms or any of the stroke symptom clusters.

Metabolic syndrome and stroke symptoms

Among participants without diabetes, 29.2% had metabolic syndrome. Among those with metabolic syndrome, 87.9% had elevated blood pressure, 79.6% had abdominal obesity, 68.5% had low HDL cholesterol, 57.9% had elevated triglycerides, and 51.6% had elevated glucose. Metabolic syndrome was associated with any stroke symptom (POR 1.13 [95% CI 1.03–1.24]) and with sudden weakness and sudden numbness individually after multivariable adjustment. Additionally, metabolic syndrome was associated with having two or more stroke symptoms (1.26 [1.10–1.44]) and the cluster of unilateral weakness and numbness (1.41 [1.17–1.71]) after adjustment for age, race, and sex, but both of these associations were attenuated and not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment.

### Disparities in awareness of myocardial infarction and stroke symptoms and response among United States-and foreign-born adults in the national health interview survey [^20496118]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Study Design and Population

The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a cross‐sectional study of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States, administered by the National Center for Health Statistics, which provides information on health monitoring and is nationally representative.The 2014 and 2017 NHIS questionnaires included supplemental content in the sample adult interview with questions on MI and stroke symptoms as well as appropriate actions to take in the event of an MI or stroke; hence we included data from these 2 years. We included respondents from 9 regions of birth as categorized in the NHIS, namely Mexico/Central America/Caribbean, South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Asia, and Southeast Asia, who were 18 years of age or older. A list of countries included in these 9 regions is provided in the Table S1. All foreign‐born respondents were classified as immigrants. This study was exempt from review by the first author’s institutional review board committee because NHIS data are publicly available and deidentified. It is reported in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) reporting guideline.

Outcomes

Awareness of MI Symptoms and Stroke Symptoms

Knowledge of MI symptoms was assessed based on responses to the question, “Which of the following would you say are the symptoms that someone may be having a heart attack?” Responses were pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back; feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint; chest pain or discomfort; pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulder; and shortness of breath. Similarly, knowledge of stroke symptoms was assessed by an individual’s response to the question, “Which of the following would you say are the symptoms that someone may be having a stroke?” Responses were sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side; sudden confusion or trouble speaking; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance; and sudden severe headache with no known cause. Respondents who answered “yes” to the 5 queries on MI and stroke symptoms were classified as knowing the symptoms of MI and stroke. Those who answered “no,” “don’t know,” or refused to answer were classified as not knowing the symptoms.

### Accidental hydroxychloroquine overdose resulting in neurotoxic vestibulopathy [^fa8db29d]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine is an oral antimalarial medication commonly used off-label for a variety of rheumatological conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and dermatomyositis. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman who presented with acute onset headache, bilateral tinnitus, and left-sided facial numbness and tingling in the setting of accidentally overdosing on hydroxychloroquine. By the next morning, the patient began to experience worsening in the tingling sensation and it eventually spread to her left arm, thigh and distal extremities. The patient also complained of new onset blurring of her peripheral vision and feeling 'off balance.' Despite a complete neurological and ophthalmological work-up with unremarkable imaging and blood work, the patient has had no improvement in her tinnitus, left-sided paresthesias, visual disturbance or ataxia. This is a unique case of hydroxychloroquine overdose resulting in permanent neurotoxic vestibulopathy.
