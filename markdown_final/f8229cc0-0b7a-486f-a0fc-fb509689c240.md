## Question

What oral antibiotic is comparable to ceftriaxone?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which oral antibiotic is most comparable to ceftriaxone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "comparable" should mean clinically. Then, I should identify plausible oral candidates with overlapping spectra. Next, I will examine PK/PD alignment and laboratory surrogacy between ceftriaxone and oral agents. After that, I need to review guideline and practice recommendations for IV-to-oral switch. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation with caveats and patient-specific considerations.

> Let me first define "comparable" in a way that's clinically meaningful, not just pharmacologically catchy. I need to ensure similar activity against key pathogens where ceftriaxone is used empirically (notably Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae for CABP, and Enterobacterales for some systemic infections), reasonable PK/PD target attainment, and real-world or guideline support for IV-to-oral step-down when clinically stable, because that's the pivot point for equivalency in practice.

> Next, I should identify oral agents commonly used as step-down from ceftriaxone in respiratory and other common syndromes. The recurrent agents in practice and stewardship pathways include cefpodoxime, cefdinir, cefuroxime axetil, and amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, which are explicitly cited as the most common oral β-lactams used in the United States for patients improving on IV therapy, so these form the rational candidate pool I need to evaluate further [^117TySuz].

> Hold on, let me verify the pharmacologic comparability rather than assume all oral cephalosporins are similar. A careful PK/PD comparison shows ceftriaxone achieves substantially higher free drug concentrations and has a longer half-life than oral cefpodoxime, yet they share the same PD target of time above MIC > 40%, suggesting that adjusted interpretive criteria could still make an oral candidate clinically effective despite lower exposures, which is crucial for a fair "comparability" assessment [^112fP2xX].

> I will now examine laboratory surrogacy to see whether ceftriaxone MICs can predict oral cephalosporin susceptibility, because that is often the decisive bridge for step-down decisions. Wait, I should double-check the strength of evidence across agents. For cefpodoxime in S. pneumoniae, multiple analyses show that using lower ceftriaxone breakpoints (≤ 0.25 mg/L susceptible, 0.5 mg/L intermediate, ≥ 1 mg/L resistant) yields high categorical agreement, around 92.5%, with low error rates, supporting ceftriaxone as a surrogate for predicting cefpodoxime susceptibility, which is a strong indicator of clinical comparability when culture data are available [^112fP2xX] [^113WvA8F].

> But wait, what if cefdinir were equally supported. Let me reconsider that. There is some surrogacy signal for cefdinir using cefotaxime meningitis breakpoints as a proxy, but this appears to be limited to single-center findings and is less robust than the multifold cefpodoxime evidence, so I should not overstate cefdinir's comparability based solely on that weaker surrogate dataset [^112fP2xX].

> Next, I should review guideline and practice anchors for the IV-to-oral transition to ensure that what looks good in the lab is also supported in clinical pathways. Stewardship and IDSA-aligned practices emphasize early IV-to-oral switch when stable, and they repeatedly list cefpodoxime, cefdinir, cefuroxime axetil, and amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate as standard oral options for step-down of hospitalized CABP, with several adult CAP trials allowing an oral switch after 3–4 days, commonly to amoxicillin-clavulanate, reinforcing that an oral transition is both safe and effective when criteria are met [^117TySuz].

> I need to check that this step-down principle holds beyond pneumonia, at least as supportive context for oral conversion safety. Trials in complicated urinary tract infection also used early IV therapy followed by oral agents with equivalent outcomes between ertapenem and ceftriaxone arms once switched, which, while not naming specific orals uniformly, supports the safety and effectiveness of the IV-to-oral paradigm that underpins our "comparable" construct for ceftriaxone step-down candidates [^117S4F6P] [^112DpcPo].

> Now, synthesizing the evidence, I almost said cefdinir because it is a third-generation oral cephalosporin with convenient dosing, but hold on, I should verify which agent has the strongest totality of data. The most defensible "comparable" oral antibiotic to ceftriaxone is cefpodoxime, given its shared third-generation cephalosporin class, overlapping respiratory pathogen spectrum, explicit inclusion in step-down practice, and — most importantly — robust surrogacy data showing that ceftriaxone MICs, with adjusted breakpoints, predict cefpodoxime susceptibility with high categorical agreement, which directly operationalizes ceftriaxone-to-cefpodoxime step-down decisions [^117TySuz] [^112fP2xX] [^113WvA8F].

> Let me also consider reasonable alternatives while being clear about their evidentiary footing. Cefdinir is guideline-endorsed for oral step-down in CABP and is supported by FDA labeling, but its susceptibility surrogacy rests on a limited single-center proxy, making it a secondary option when cefpodoxime is unavailable or poorly tolerated; cefuroxime axetil is commonly used and FDA-labeled but lacks the same surrogacy strength; amoxicillin-clavulanate is frequently used as step-down, including in CAP trials after short IV courses, but it is not a cephalosporin and does not have a direct ceftriaxone surrogacy linkage, so its "comparability" is practical rather than PK/PD-correlated [^117TySuz] [^112nauKu] [^112fP2xX] [^11256UxD] [^notfound].

> Before finalizing, I should confirm patient-specific considerations that could sway the choice. I need to ensure the organism is susceptible or, if only ceftriaxone MIC is available, apply the validated adjusted ceftriaxone breakpoints to infer cefpodoxime susceptibility; I should check the infection site because deep-seated infections may not be ideal for oral step-down; and I should account for renal function and tolerability, for example dose adjustments with some orals like cefdinir in renal impairment and vigilance for adverse effects including C. difficile risk inherent to broad-spectrum β-lactams during and after the switch [^112fP2xX] [^112nauKu] [^117BAEyt] [^115wBEWu].

> In summary, after verifying PK/PD principles, laboratory surrogacy, and step-down practice patterns, cefpodoxime is the oral agent most comparable to ceftriaxone for patients clinically ready for IV-to-oral conversion, with the strongest evidence base coming from ceftriaxone-to-cefpodoxime susceptibility surrogacy and guideline-recognized use in CABP step-down, while cefdinir, cefuroxime axetil, and amoxicillin-clavulanate remain reasonable alternatives when chosen with culture data, clinical context, and patient factors in mind [^112fP2xX] [^113WvA8F] [^112fP2xX] [^117TySuz] [^112DpcPo].

No oral antibiotic matches ceftriaxone's **spectrum, PK, or once-daily dosing**. For step-down therapy, **cefpodoxime or cefdinir are the closest oral cephalosporins** but have narrower Gram-negative coverage and are not reliable for severe infections or ESBLs [^notfound]. For broader coverage, consider **amoxicillin-clavulanate or a fluoroquinolone** (e.g. levofloxacin) based on susceptibility and patient factors [^114ca8tc]. Always confirm susceptibility and monitor for clinical response and adverse effects [^112wTfPy].

## Oral cephalosporins most similar to ceftriaxone

Among oral agents, **cefpodoxime and cefdinir are the oral cephalosporins most similar to ceftriaxone** in spectrum and clinical use, but they have important limitations [^113WvA8F] [^117TySuz].

| **Antibiotic** | **Generation** | **Spectrum of activity** | **Clinical indications** | **Limitations compared to ceftriaxone** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Cefpodoxime | Third | - Gram-positive cocci <br/> - Gram-negative rods (including some Enterobacterales) [^112zpHkL] | - Respiratory tract infections <br/> - Skin and soft tissue infections <br/> - Uncomplicated UTIs | - Lower bioavailability <br/> - Shorter half-life <br/> - Less reliable against severe infections <br/> - Limited activity against ESBL-producing organisms |
| Cefdinir | Third | - Similar to cefpodoxime <br/> - Slightly narrower Gram-negative coverage | - Respiratory tract infections <br/> - Skin and soft tissue infections | - Lower bioavailability <br/> - Shorter half-life <br/> - Limited activity against severe infections <br/> - Not reliable against ESBL-producing organisms |

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations

Ceftriaxone's clinical utility is driven by its **long half-life (6–9 hours)** [^1179HQB6], high protein binding, and once-daily dosing [^11288wfP]. Oral cephalosporins have shorter half-lives, lower bioavailability, and require more frequent dosing, making them less suitable for severe infections or when high, sustained serum levels are needed [^112fP2xX].

---

## Clinical scenarios for oral step-down therapy

Oral cephalosporins such as cefpodoxime or cefdinir are **appropriate for step-down therapy** when the patient is clinically and hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and able to tolerate oral medications [^112DpcPo]. They are **not suitable for severe infections** such as meningitis, endocarditis, or infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms [^114iN8uE]. Common scenarios include:

- Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [^114ca8tc]
- Skin and soft tissue infections [^115Bo85M]
- Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs)
- Mild to moderate respiratory tract infections [^112DpcPo]

---

## Alternative oral antibiotics with broader coverage

When broader coverage is needed, consider **amoxicillin-clavulanate** for Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including beta-lactamase producers [^114ca8tc]. **Fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)** also cover atypicals and some resistant Gram-negative organisms; however, they should be used cautiously due to resistance and adverse effects.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize susceptibility testing and clinical judgment when selecting oral alternatives to ceftriaxone [^112wTfPy]. The **IDSA and CLSI recommend** careful consideration of local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors before switching to oral therapy.

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Oral cephalosporins generally have **favorable safety profiles**, but clinicians should monitor for:

- Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhea) [^112nauKu]
- Hypersensitivity reactions [^111Ef7qu]
- Clostridioides difficile infection [^115wBEWu]
- Hemolytic anemia (rare)

## Summary of key differences between ceftriaxone and oral cephalosporins

| **Parameter** | **Ceftriaxone** | **Oral cephalosporins (cefpodoxime, cefdinir)** |
|-|-|-|
| Administration | IV/IM | Oral |
| Half-life | 6–9 hours [^1179HQB6] | 1–3 hours |
| Dosing frequency | Once daily [^1121yfuE] | Twice daily |
| Spectrum | Broad, including severe infections | Narrower, less reliable for severe infections |
| Bioavailability | 100% (parenteral) [^111Q68iC] | 40–50% |
| Clinical use | Severe infections, hospitalized patients | Mild to moderate infections, outpatient therapy |

---

- **No oral antibiotic matches ceftriaxone's spectrum, PK, or once-daily dosing** [^1121yfuE]. Cefpodoxime and cefdinir are the closest oral options but have narrower coverage and are less reliable for severe infections [^112zpHkL]. Consider amoxicillin-clavulanate or fluoroquinolones when broader coverage is needed, guided by susceptibility and clinical judgment [^114ca8tc] [^112wTfPy].

According to the World Health Organization, lower respiratory infections were the sixth most common cause of death in high-income countries in 2019 and among the top five causes of death in low-, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income groups. More specifically, pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among adult patients in the United States. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Although there is a trend toward the reduction of mortality due to pneumonia over time, the attributable mortality of pneumococcal CABP has not changed in the last two decades. This is in conjunction with an increase in the rate of hospitalization and more severe forms of CABP.

CABP is often treated empirically, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends β-lactam, macrolide, doxycycline, or respiratory quinolone monotherapy for outpatients with non-severe infection. In contrast, combination therapy is recommended for patients with comorbidities. When intravenous therapies are utilized, various treatment guidelines and stewardship programs now recommend switching to oral antibiotics when patients demonstrate clinical improvement, have adequate oral intake and gastrointestinal absorption, and are hemodynamically stable. In the United States, the most common oral β-lactams used in this setting are amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, cefuroxime, and cefpodoxime. However, even when S. pneumoniae is recovered from clinical specimens and available for antimicrobial testing, determining the susceptibility and choosing the appropriate oral β-lactam can be challenging.

Ceftriaxone cutoffs (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) breakpoints showed acceptable results when used to predict cefpodoxime susceptibility in S. pneumoniae, with acceptable categorical agreement (92.5%) and low error rates (0.0%–7.5%). Similar findings were reported by Murphy et al. when using the meningitis breakpoints for cefotaxime (≤ 0.5 mg/L for susceptible; 1 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 2 mg/L for resistant) as a surrogate marker for cefdinir susceptibility in a single-center study.

The correlation of susceptibility categorization between oral and intravenous cephalosporins when applying lower breakpoints for the latter is likely explained by distinct pharmacokinetic properties. For example, the maximum free drug concentration of intravenous ceftriaxone is sixfold higher than oral cefpodoxime. Similarly, ceftriaxone has a half-life twofold longer than cefpodoxime. Since both ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime have the same pharmacodynamic target (> 40% time above MIC), ceftriaxone likely has a higher target attainment than cefpodoxime.

It is important to emphasize that the MIC comparison analysis presented here assumes that the breakpoints published by CLSI M100Ed34 (2024) remain appropriate and can accurately differentiate between susceptible and resistant isolates. However, breakpoints for older agents, including those evaluated here, were established mostly based on MIC distributions, pooled clinical data, and limited pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.

### Cefdinir [^112nauKu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria. As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged treatment may result in the emergence and overgrowth of resistant organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate alternative therapy should be administered.

Cefdinir should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of colitis. In patients with transient or persistent renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the total daily dose of cefdinir should be reduced because high and prolonged plasma concentrations of cefdinir can result following recommended doses (see dosage and administration).

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefdinir, should only be used to treat bacterial infections as they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When cefdinir is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable.

### Dosing of ceftriaxone and metronidazole for children with severe acute malnutrition [^11288wfP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, infants and young children with complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) requiring hospital admission face an inpatient case fatality rate of 12 to more than 30%, with bacterial infection being a common cause. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all children admitted to hospital with SAM receive broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, usually with a combination of a beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside antibiotics. Recent studies suggest increasing antimicrobial resistance, but there is no evidence for the efficacy of alternative first-line antimicrobial combinations in this context.

Ceftriaxone, a broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin, is a potentially useful first-line treatment for children with SAM. It is inexpensive and, due to its long half-life, only requires once-daily administration, which is important in overstretched healthcare settings where children with SAM are usually managed. When assessing its likely antimicrobial efficacy, the free concentration needs to be considered, since ceftriaxone protein binding is nonlinear, with higher total concentrations being associated with a larger fraction unbound. Its nonlinear concentration effect is further compounded by increased free fraction with decreasing plasma proteins, most notably albumin. Models describing nonlinear ceftriaxone protein binding have been developed in special populations such as those in intensive care. SAM is associated with potentially reduced available plasma proteins and often commonly presents with edema, both of which may affect the dosing strategy.

### Using antibiotics wisely [^112DpcPo]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

This review describes the role of shorter antibiotic therapies, early switching from intravenous to oral therapy, and artificial intelligence in infectious diseases.

- **Recent findings**: There is evidence that shorter courses of antibiotics are noninferior to standard durations of therapy. This has been demonstrated with Enterobacterales bacteremia, which can be treated with 7 days of therapy; community-acquired pneumonia with 3 days; and ventilator-associated pneumonia with just 7 days of antibiotic therapy. The conversion from intravenous to oral therapy in treating bacteremia, endocarditis, and bone and joint infections is safe and effective, reducing line complications and costs. Additionally, for clean surgical procedures, only one dose of antibiotic is needed, which should be the most effective antibiotic, cefazolin. This involves avoiding clindamycin and removing penicillin allergies where possible for improved outcomes. Finally, the role of artificial intelligence in antibiotic stewardship is rapidly emerging but remains in its early stages.

- **Summary**: In using antibiotics wisely, targeting therapy durations and converting intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral are low-hanging fruits. The future use of artificial intelligence could automate much of this work, offering exciting possibilities, but further proof is needed.

### A study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ertapenem versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^114ca8tc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In a double-blind, multicenter trial, 502 patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia were randomized to receive therapy with either ertapenem or ceftriaxone (for each, 1 g given intravenously once daily). After a minimum of 3 days, therapy could be switched to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. The median duration of intravenously administered therapy for the 383 clinically evaluable patients was 4 days for both treatment groups; 345 patients (90.1%) had their treatment switched to orally administered therapy.

Of the clinically evaluable patients, 168 (92.3%) in the ertapenem group and 183 (91.0%) in the ceftriaxone group had a favorable clinical response. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated pathogen, and high cure rates were observed both for penicillin-susceptible and -nonsusceptible infections in the ertapenem group (28 [87.5%] of 32 patients versus 17 [100%] of 17 patients, respectively). Both treatment regimens were generally well tolerated; the most common drug-related adverse events reported were diarrhea (2.9% versus 2.7%) and nausea (0.8% versus 2.0%) in the ertapenem and ceftriaxone groups, respectively. These results suggest that ertapenem and ceftriaxone therapy have similar efficacy and safety in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Determining the optimal ceftriaxone MIC for triggering extended-spectrum β-lactamase confirmatory testing [^114iN8uE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

As routine testing of clinical isolates for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production, including screening plus phenotypic confirmatory testing, is no longer required by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), several clinical microbiology laboratories utilize ceftriaxone MICs as a proxy to identify bacteria as potential ESBL producers. Data from 1,386 clinical isolates indicate that a ceftriaxone MIC cutoff of 8 μg/ml serves as an excellent predictor of ESBL production, boasting a positive predictive value and negative predictive value approaching 100% and 99.5%, respectively.

### A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comparing ertapenem and ceftriaxone followed by appropriate oral therapy for complicated urinary tract infections in adults [^117S4F6P]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of ertapenem, a new once-daily parenteral beta-lactam, with that of ceftriaxone for the initial empiric treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs).

- **Methods**: In a multicenter, prospective, double-blind study, patients with cUTIs were stratified as to whether they had acute pyelonephritis or other cUTIs (without pyelonephritis) and randomized to receive ertapenem, 1 g once a day, or ceftriaxone, 1 g once a day. After 3 days, patients with a satisfactory clinical response could be switched to an oral antimicrobial agent.

- **Results**: Of 258 randomized patients, 97 (55.4%) in the ertapenem group and 53 (63.9%) in the ceftriaxone group were evaluated microbiologically. Almost all patients in each treatment group were switched to oral therapy. The mean duration of therapy was similar in both treatment groups: parenteral, approximately 4 days; total, approximately 13 days. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli. At the primary efficacy endpoint, 5 to 9 days after treatment, 85.6% of patients who received ertapenem and 84.9% who received ceftriaxone had a favorable microbiologic response, indicating that the two treatment groups were equivalent. The frequency and severity of drug-related adverse events were generally similar in both treatment groups.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, ertapenem was as effective as ceftriaxone for the initial treatment of cUTI in adults, was generally well tolerated, and had a similar safety profile.

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, in clinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^113WvA8F]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100Ed24 (2024) states that Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptible to oral penicillin can be considered susceptible to various β-lactams, including oral cephalosporins. However, surrogacy guidance is not available for isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin. Instead, such isolates require specific MIC testing and interpretations for reporting susceptibility to oral cephalosporins, for which susceptibility testing is limited in most automated systems. This limitation consequently restricts information pertaining to oral cephalosporins at an individual institution.

This study evaluated the ability of the penicillin breakpoints to predict cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone susceptibilities against a recent collection of S. pneumoniae from United States hospitals according to CLSI guidelines. The susceptible breakpoint for oral penicillin (≤ 0.06 mg/L) predicted susceptibility to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone. However, when isolates were nonsusceptible to oral penicillin (MIC, > 0.06 mg/L), susceptibility to cefpodoxime could not be predicted due to a low categorical agreement (CA) of 78.4%.

Parenteral penicillin breakpoints also could not predict cefpodoxime susceptibility due to the elevated number of very major errors and a CA of 76.8%. However, these breakpoints could still be used as a surrogate marker to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility. Finally, ceftriaxone could be used for surrogate testing of cefpodoxime by applying breakpoints (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant), which are lower than the Clinical c.

### Cefdinir [^117BAEyt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Prescribing cefdinir for oral suspension in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection, or a prophylactic indication, is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria. As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged treatment may lead to the emergence and overgrowth of resistant organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential, and if a superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate alternative therapy should be administered.

Cefdinir should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of colitis, as with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (antibiotics). In patients with transient or persistent renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the total daily dose of cefdinir should be reduced because high and prolonged plasma concentrations of cefdinir can result following recommended doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Ceftriaxone and dextrose [^115wBEWu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea**: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ceftriaxone, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. A careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

- **Hemolytic anemia**: An immune-mediated hemolytic anemia has been observed in patients receiving cephalosporin class antibacterials, including ceftriaxone. Severe cases of hemolytic anemia, including fatalities, have been reported during treatment in both adults and children. If a patient develops anemia while on Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection, the diagnosis of a cephalosporin-associated anemia should be considered.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^1121yfuE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams. If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended. For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram, administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery, is recommended. Generally, ceftriaxone therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required. When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS). The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2 g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

- **Directions for use**:

- **Intramuscular administration**: Reconstitute ceftriaxone sodium powder with the appropriate diluent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Compatibility and Stability). Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form a solution. Withdraw the entire contents of the vial into the syringe to equal the total labeled dose.

### Ceftriaxone and dextrose [^1179HQB6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Average pharmacokinetic parameters of ceftriaxone in healthy subjects, elderly subjects, subjects with renal impairment, and subjects with liver disease are summarized in Table 5. Compared to healthy adult subjects, the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in elderly subjects and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary for these patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 g per day. Ceftriaxone was not removed to any significant extent from the plasma by hemodialysis. In 6 of 26 dialysis patients, the elimination rate of ceftriaxone was markedly reduced, suggesting that plasma concentrations of ceftriaxone should be monitored in these patients to determine if dosage adjustments are necessary.

- **Drug interactions**: Interaction with calcium: Two in vitro studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood, have been carried out to assess the interaction of ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved in vivo following administration of 2 grams ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/dL). Recovery of ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/dL) or higher in neonatal plasma.

### Re-evaluation of penicillin and ceftriaxone MIC results to predict susceptibility to the oral cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, in clinical isolates from the United States according to CLSI guidelines (2019–2021) [^112zpHkL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M100Ed24 (2024) states that *Streptococcus pneumoniae* susceptible to oral penicillin can be considered susceptible to various β-lactams, including oral cephalosporins. However, surrogacy guidance is not available for isolates nonsusceptible to oral penicillin. Instead, such isolates require specific MIC testing and interpretations for reporting susceptibility to oral cephalosporins. For which, susceptibility testing is limited in most automated systems, consequently restricting information pertaining to oral cephalosporins at an individual institution.

This study evaluated the ability of the penicillin breakpoints to predict cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone susceptibilities against a recent collection of *S. pneumoniae* from United States hospitals according to CLSI guidelines. The susceptible breakpoint for oral penicillin (≤ 0.06 mg/L) predicted susceptibility to cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone. However, when isolates were nonsusceptible to oral penicillin (MIC, > 0.06 mg/L), susceptibility to cefpodoxime could not be predicted due to a low categorical agreement (CA) (78.4%). Parenteral penicillin breakpoints also could not predict cefpodoxime susceptibility due to the elevated number of very major errors and a CA of 76.8%; however, these breakpoints could still be used as a surrogate marker to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility.

Finally, ceftriaxone could be used for surrogate testing of cefpodoxime by applying breakpoints (≤ 0.25 mg/L for susceptible; 0.5 mg/L for intermediate; ≥ 1 mg/L for resistant) lower than the current.

### Ceftriaxone compared with benzylpenicillin in the treatment of neurosyphilis in France: A retrospective multicentre study [^116hBR8T]. The Lancet. Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Intravenous benzylpenicillin is the gold-standard treatment for neurosyphilis, but it requires prolonged hospitalization. Ceftriaxone is a possible alternative treatment, the effectiveness of which remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ceftriaxone compared with benzylpenicillin in the treatment of neurosyphilis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective multicentre study including patients with neurosyphilis treated at one of eight tertiary care centres in France from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2017. Neurosyphilis was defined as positive treponemal and non-treponemal tests, and at least one of the following: otic syphilis, ocular syphilis, neurological symptoms with a positive result on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VDRL or CSF PCR tests, or more than five leukocytes in a CSF cell count. Patients with neurosyphilis were identified from the medical information department database of each centre and assigned to one of two groups based on the initial treatment received (benzylpenicillin group or ceftriaxone group). The primary outcome was the overall clinical response, i.e. the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, one month after treatment initiation. The secondary endpoints included the proportions of patients with a complete response at one month, serological response at six months, and length of hospital stay.

- **Findings**: Of the 365 patients with a coded diagnosis of neurosyphilis at the eight care centres during 1997–2017, 208 were included in this study (42 in the ceftriaxone group and 166 in the benzylpenicillin group). The mean age of patients was not specified.

### Cumulative antibiotic exposure is associated with ceftriaxone resistance among patients with urinary source Gram-negative bloodstream infection: A retrospective cohort study [^111Q4XXk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

We investigated the relationship between cumulative, historical antibiotic therapy and the presence of ceftriaxone-resistant (CRO-R) Enterobacterales bloodstream infections (BSI) from urinary sources.

- **Methods**: Adult patients established with primary care at Mayo Clinic, who experienced a first episode of monomicrobial Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis BSI from a urinary source between May 2019 and May 2023, were included. Antibiotic therapy over the year prior to BSI was quantified as days of therapy (DOT), cumulative modified Antibiotic Spectrum Index (mASI), and cumulative Days of Antibiotic Spectrum Coverage (DASC) using prescription data. Patients with CRO-R urinary pathogens prior to antibiotic therapy assessment were excluded.

- **Results**: A total of 721 adults had monomicrobial Gram-negative BSI, including 70 patients (9.7%) with a CRO-R pathogen and 651 patients (90.3%) with a ceftriaxone-susceptible (CRO-S) pathogen. In the 12 months prior to BSI, levels of antibiotic DOT, mASI, and DASC were significantly greater among patients with CRO-R BSI than those with CRO-S BSI (p < 0.001). The median time from blood culture collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy was significantly longer in the CRO-R group (24 hours, IQR 16–48) compared to the CRO-S group (1 hour, IQR 0–2) (p < 0.001). Increasing cumulative antibiotic therapy prior to BSI, as quantified by the mASI, was significantly associated with an increased risk of 1-year CDI after BSI (P = 0.027).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with a first episode of CRO-R Enterobacterales BSI had significantly greater prior antibiotic exposure compared to those with CRO-S BSI.

### Easy-ceft1g [^116t63xS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Ceftriaxone for Injection, 32% were aged 60 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects, and dosage adjustments are not required for geriatric patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 grams per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see clinical pharmacology).

- **Influence on diagnostic tests**: In patients treated with Ceftriaxone for Injection, the Coombs' test may become positive. Ceftriaxone for Injection, like other antibacterial drugs, may result in positive test results for galactosemia. Nonenzymatic methods for glucose determination in urine may yield false positive results. Therefore, during therapy with Ceftriaxone for Injection, urine-glucose determination should be performed enzymatically. The presence of ceftriaxone may falsely lower estimated blood glucose values obtained with some blood glucose monitoring systems. Please refer to instructions for use for each system. Alternative testing methods should be used if necessary.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^112CU9Vo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**: Reproductive studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 20 times the usual human dose and show no evidence of embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, or teratogenicity. In primates, no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was demonstrated at a dose approximately 3 times the human dose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

- **Nonteratogenic effects**: In rats, in the Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) and Segment III (perinatal and postnatal) studies with intravenously administered ceftriaxone, no adverse effects were noted on various reproductive parameters during gestation and lactation, including postnatal growth, functional behavior, and reproductive ability of the offspring at doses of 586 mg/kg/day or less.

- **Nursing mothers**: Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when ceftriaxone is administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness of ceftriaxone in neonates, infants, and pediatric patients have been established for the dosages described in the dosage and administration section. In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone, like some other cephalosporins, can displace bilirubin from serum albumin. Ceftriaxone should not be administered to hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures (see contraindications).

- **Geriatric use**: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies, the information was incomplete and ended abruptly.

### WHO guidelines on meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care [^117XZMVc]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute bacterial meningitis, specifically post-exposure prophylaxis, the WHO 2025 guidelines recommend administering a single dose of parenteral ceftriaxone or oral ciprofloxacin for antibiotic prophylaxis to close contacts of clinically suspected cases of meningococcal disease. This should be done during large-scale epidemics, in accordance with known antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^1176YnZH]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx includes ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscularly as a single dose for individuals weighing less than 150 kg (300 lb). For those weighing 150 kg (300 lb) or more, a dose of 1 g of intramuscular ceftriaxone should be administered. If a chlamydia coinfection is identified when testing for pharyngeal gonorrhea, healthcare providers should administer doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. During pregnancy, azithromycin 1 g as a single dose is recommended for treating chlamydia. There are no reliable alternative treatments for pharyngeal gonorrhea. For individuals with a history of beta-lactam allergy, a thorough assessment of the reaction is advised. For those with an anaphylactic or severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, to ceftriaxone, consultation with an infectious disease specialist for an alternative treatment is recommended.

Abbreviation: IM = intramuscular.

In cases where gonococcal expedited partner therapy is permissible by state law, and the partner is unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, the partner may be treated with a single 800 mg oral dose of cefixime, provided that chlamydial infection in the patient has been excluded. Otherwise, the partner may be treated with a single oral 800 mg cefixime dose plus oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days.

### Easy-ceft1g [^112gxnNf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Clinical studies of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients with acute bacterial otitis media have provided valuable insights. In two adequate and well-controlled U.S. clinical trials, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of ceftriaxone was compared with a 10-day course of oral antibiotics in pediatric patients aged between 3 months and 6 years. The clinical cure rates and statistical outcomes are summarized below.

- **Clinical efficacy in pediatric patients with acute bacterial otitis media**:
	- An open-label bacteriologic study of ceftriaxone, without a comparator, enrolled 108 pediatric patients — 79 of whom had positive baseline cultures for one or more common pathogens. The results of this study are detailed as follows.

- **Week 2 and 4 bacteriologic eradication rates**:
	- Rates were analyzed in the per-protocol analysis in the Roche bacteriologic study by pathogen.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone at home versus intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital for children with cellulitis (CHOICE): a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^113MYgPs]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in children is common despite no evidence of its efficacy or safety from clinical trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy at home with that of standard treatment in hospital for children with moderate to severe cellulitis.

- **Methods**: The Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial was a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in children aged 6 months to 18 years who presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) at home or intravenous flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg every 6 h) in hospital with web-based randomisation, stratified by age and periorbital cellulitis. The primary outcome was treatment failure, which was defined as no clinical improvement or occurrence of an adverse event, resulting in a change in empiric antibiotics within 48 h of the first dose. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Outcomes were assessed in all randomised participants with outcome data (intention-to-treat population) and in all individuals who received treatment as allocated and did not have any major protocol violations (per-protocol population). For home treatment to be non-inferior to hospital treatment, the difference between groups in the proportion of children with treatment failure was assessed within the predefined margin.

### Cross-reactivity of cefotetan and ceftriaxone antibodies, associated with hemolytic anemia, with other: cephalosporins and penicillin [^112xteTP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Most drug-induced immune hemolytic anemias since the late 1980s have been caused by the second- and third-generation cephalosporins, cefotetan and ceftriaxone, respectively. Cross-reactivity of cefotetan and ceftriaxone antibodies with other cephalosporins or penicillin has been studied only minimally. We tested seven serum samples previously identified to contain cefotetan antibodies and one serum sample previously identified to contain ceftriaxone antibodies against nine other cephalosporins, penicillin, and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid in the presence of RBCs and also used hapten inhibition to indicate cross-reactivity.

Serum samples containing cefotetan antibodies showed some cross-reactivity with cephalothin and cefoxitin, and to a much lesser extent with penicillin and ceftazidime. The ceftriaxone antibodies showed very weak cross-reactivity with cefotaxime, cefamandole, and cefoperazone. There was very little cross-reactivity between cefotetan antibodies and the drugs tested in the present study. We have no data to determine whether the in vitro data relate to in vivo reactivity.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin/sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^1165pHEr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The present study had several limitations. First, there was uncertainty about the effect size; the difference between groups could potentially be smaller or non-existent. Second, this was a single-center trial. Because the background characteristics of patients would differ between hospitals, the severity of pneumonia would also vary. Therefore, whether the clinical differences observed between the two antibiotics in the present study can be generalized needs to be investigated in a follow-up study.

Third, to judge whether the patient had aspiration pneumonia, risk factors for aspiration were evaluated, but not swallowing function or silent aspiration at night. Some cases of pneumonia in the present study might thus have been caused by silent aspiration of oral bacteria. Distinguishing pneumonia caused by oral anaerobic bacteria from that caused by other bacteria by evaluating only the risk factors for aspiration was difficult. However, because it is not routine in clinical practice to evaluate swallowing function to judge whether a patient has aspiration pneumonia, the results of the present study can be considered at least somewhat reflective of actual clinical practice.

### Solithromycin versus ceftriaxone plus azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated genital gonorrhoea (SOLITAIRE-U): A randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial [^112RZyZP]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea represents a global public health threat, necessitating the development of new therapies. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of solithromycin, a fourth-generation macrolide, with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin for the treatment of gonorrhoea.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority trial involving patients aged 15 years or older with uncomplicated untreated genital gonorrhoea at two sites in Australia and one site in the United States. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single oral dose of solithromycin 1000 mg or an intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg plus oral azithromycin 1000 mg. Neisseria gonorrhoeae cultures were obtained at baseline and at a test of cure (day 7 ± 2). The primary outcome measured was the proportion of patients showing eradication of genital N. gonorrhoeae based on culture at test of cure. This was assessed in the microbiological intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned patients who received any dose of the study drug and had a positive genital culture for N. gonorrhoeae at baseline. Non-inferiority of solithromycin was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the between-group differences was greater than -10%. Safety analysis included all patients who received any dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under number NCT02210325.

- **Findings**: Between Sept 3, 2014, and Aug 27, 2015, 262 patients were randomly assigned and 261 received treatment (130 in the solithromycin group and 131 in the ceftriaxone plus azithromycin group). In the mITT population, 99 (80%) of 123 patients in…

The primary outcome was the clinical response at the end of treatment (EOT) in the validated per-protocol (VPP) population. The secondary outcomes were clinical response during treatment (at days 4 and 7) and at the end of the study (EOS) in the VPP population, as well as the mortality rate at 30 days of admission in the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population. The VPP population was defined as patients who received treatment with the study drug for ≥ 4 days in cases of clinical cure or ≥ 3 days in cases of clinical failure without a protocol violation or missing data. The following patients were excluded: those lacking information or clinical data; those treated with other antibiotics in addition to the study drug; and those treated with systemic corticosteroids affecting the judgment of the effectiveness of treatment in the VPP population. All patients treated with one or more doses of the study drug were included in the MITT population.

The effectiveness of treatment was assessed by blinded investigators. The assessment was based on clinical signs and symptoms, white blood cell (WBC) count, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and chest radiography. Serum CRP and chest radiography were not used for the assessment on day 4, because the findings might appear to be worse than those on day 1 despite an improvement in patient condition. The clinical response was classified into three categories: improving, indeterminate, or worsening. The test drugs were discontinued and changed to other antibiotics when the clinical response was judged to fall in the latter two categories. "Effective" on days 4, 7, and EOT was defined as a case in which the patient's condition was deemed to be improving.

Broad-spectrum, single, or double-agent therapy is equally efficacious but more cost-effective than triple-agent therapy. It was reported that dual therapy consisting of ceftriaxone and metronidazole offers more efficient and cost-effective antibiotic management compared with triple therapy. However, prospective studies are required to determine whether this policy is associated with higher rates of wound infections and changes in antibiotic therapy.

Postoperative antibiotics can be administered orally if the patient is otherwise well enough to be discharged. Arnold et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 82 pediatric patients to compare the effect of home intravenous versus oral antibiotic therapy on complication rates and resource utilization following appendectomy for perforated acute appendicitis (AA). Forty-four patients (54%) were randomized to the IV group and 38 (46%) to the oral group. The study showed no difference in length of stay (4.4 ± 1.5 versus 4.4 ± 2.0 days), postoperative abscess rate (11.6% vs. 8.1%), or readmission rate (14.0% vs. 16.2%). However, hospital and outpatient charges were higher in the IV group.

Other retrospective cohort studies have confirmed that after appendectomy for perforated AA in children, oral antibiotics show equivalent outcomes compared with intravenous antibiotics, but with shorter lengths of hospitalizations and fewer medical encounters required. Compared to pediatric patients who receive intravenous antibiotics, those treated with oral antibiotics have statistically lower rates of repeated ultrasound imaging (49.6% vs. 35.1%) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement (98.3% vs. 9.1%).

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting — making the GRADE [^117YBaDG]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment of severe pneumonia compared benzyl penicillin/ampicillin versus amoxicillin. Three trials explored oral versus parenteral treatment for severe pneumonia: Addo-Yobo et al conducted a large multi-centre trial with 1702 children in Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa (two sites), Vietnam, and Zambia. Atkinson et al recruited 203 children with radiologically-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia in the UK, and Hazir et al studied 2100 Pakistani children.

The trials, supported by a meta-analysis of results from Hazir et al and Addo-Yobo et al, showed a pooled risk ratio of treatment failure for the two studies of 0.97, 95% CI 0.83–1.14, suggesting equivalence of the two treatments. As the studies were conducted predominantly among non-African populations, the quality of evidence was downgraded for indirectness. The evidence was graded as moderate quality, suggesting equivalence between benzyl penicillin and amoxicillin.

Clinical question: For HIV-unexposed Kenyan children aged 2–59 months without clinical signs of severe malnutrition who meet WHO criteria for severe pneumonia, should parenteral benzyl penicillin/ampicillin be replaced by inpatient oral amoxicillin?

- **Indirectness of population**: One study was conducted in Pakistan, and one multicentre, multi-country study.

### A retrospective comparison of ceftriaxone versus oxacillin for osteoarticular infections due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [^116L6hW7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Antistaphylococcal penicillins are the treatment of choice for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. Ceftriaxone can be dosed once daily and is less expensive for outpatient therapy than oxacillin. We compared patient outcomes of MSSA osteoarticular infections treated with ceftriaxone versus oxacillin.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with MSSA osteoarticular infections at a tertiary care hospital from January 2005 to April 2010. We collected demographic, clinical, and outcome data including treatment-related adverse events. Successful treatment, defined by clinical improvement, improved follow-up markers and imaging, and no readmission for treatment, was compared at 3–6 months and > 6 months after completion of intravenous antibiotics.

- **Results**: In total, 124 patients had an MSSA osteoarticular infection; 64 (52%) had orthopedic hardware involvement. Of those patients, 74 (60%) received ceftriaxone and 50 (40%) received oxacillin. Oxacillin was more often discontinued due to toxicity (9 of 50 [18%] oxacillin vs 3 of 74 [4%] ceftriaxone; p = 0.01). At 3–6 and > 6 months, data for 97 and 88 patients, respectively, were available for analysis. Treatment success was similar at 3–6 months (50 of 60 [83%] ceftriaxone vs 32 of 37 [86%] oxacillin; p = 0.7) and > 6 months (43 of 56 [77%] ceftriaxone vs 26 of 32 [81%] oxacillin; p = 0.6). After intravenous antibiotics, 56 (45%) patients received long-term suppression with oral antibiotics (31 of 74 [42%] ceftriaxone vs 25 of 50 [50%] oxacillin; p = 0.4).

- **Conclusions**: In this comparison, ceftriaxone appears to be a viable alternative to oxacillin for MSSA osteoarticular infections with similar treatment success rates and a lower discontinuation due to toxicity.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin/sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^11359s7W]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The normally distributed data were evaluated using Student's t-test and are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Non-normally distributed data were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test and are reported as median (interquartile range). Differences in population rates between the two or more groups were evaluated using the chi-squared test. The two-tailed significance level was set at < 0.05.

Sample size was calculated as follows: if the average clinical effectiveness rate at EOT was estimated to be ≥ 90%, and the difference in clinical effectiveness rate to be ≥ 12% based on previous reports, the sample size required to detect a difference with a β value < 0.20 was 192 cases. Assuming the rate of excluded cases to be < 30%, 274 CAP cases would need to be screened. All statistical tests were performed using JMP 14.0.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

### In-hospital observation after antibiotic switch in pneumonia: A national evaluation [^1122pHms]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of in-hospital observation after the switch from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics in a large Medicare population. Retrospective studies of relatively small size indicate that the practice of in-hospital observation after the switch from IV to oral antibiotics for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is unnecessary.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective examination of the US Medicare National Pneumonia Project database. Eligible patients were discharged with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis consistent with community-acquired pneumonia and divided into two groups: 1) a "not observed" cohort, where patients were discharged on the same day as the switch from IV to oral antibiotics, and 2) an "observed for 1 day" cohort, where patients remained hospitalized for one day after the switch from IV to oral antibiotics. We compared clinical outcomes between these two cohorts.

- **Results**: A total of 39,242 cases were sampled, representing 4,341 hospitals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. There were 5,248 elderly patients who fulfilled eligibility criteria, involving a length of stay of no more than seven hospital days (2,536 "not observed" and 2,712 "observed for 1 day" patients). The mean length of stay was 3.8 days for the "not observed" cohort and 4.5 days for the "observed for 1 day" cohort (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the 14-day hospital readmission rate (7.8% in the "not observed" cohort vs. 7.2% in the "observed for 1 day" cohort, odds ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–1.12; p = 0.367) and 30-day mortality.

### Once-daily intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid is equivalent to once-daily intravenous ceftriaxone plus oral placebo for the treatment of moderate-to-severe cellulitis in adults [^111PYxkM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A once-daily regimen of cefazolin (2 g intravenously [iv]) plus probenecid (1 g by mouth) was compared with a once-daily regimen of ceftriaxone (1 g iv) plus oral placebo in a randomized, double-blind equivalence trial of home-based therapy for moderate-to-severe cellulitis in adults. For the assessable recipients of cefazolin-probenecid (n = 59) and ceftriaxone-placebo (n = 57), clinical cure occurred at the end of treatment in 86% and 96% (P = 0.11), respectively, and was maintained at 1 month of follow-up in 96% and 91% (P = 0.55), respectively.

The mean number of treatment doses (± standard deviation) given was similar in the two treatment arms (6.97 ± 2.6 for cefazolin-probenecid and 6.12 ± 2.1 for ceftriaxone-placebo; p = 0.06). The median antibiotic trough concentrations were 2.35 micrograms/mL for cefazolin and 15.45 micrograms/mL for ceftriaxone. Patients in the two treatment arms were similar with regard to overall rates of adverse reaction (P = 0.15); however, nausea was more common among those in the cefazolin-probenecid arm (P = 0.048).

The once-daily regimen of cefazolin-probenecid is a cheap, practical, and effective treatment option for moderate-to-severe cellulitis, and it avoids the need to use third-generation cephalosporins in most patients.

### Gentamicin compared with ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea (G-ToG): a randomised non-inferiority trial [^115VZxHr]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Of 1762 patients approached at 14 sexual health clinics in England, 720 were enrolled between Oct 7, 2014, and Nov 14, 2016 (362 were assigned to receive ceftriaxone, and 358 to receive gentamicin). The main reasons for exclusion were participants not being interested, the trial taking too much time, a belief that the standard treatment would be successful, and the trial taking too many extra or intrusive samples. Fourteen participants did not receive their allocated medication; four in the ceftriaxone group and ten in the gentamicin group. Ninety-six participants did not return for their follow-up visit. Twenty-six participants who returned for their follow-up visit did not have primary outcome data because of incorrect sampling. Primary outcome data were therefore available for 306 (85%) of 362 participants allocated to ceftriaxone and 292 (82%) of 358 participants allocated to gentamicin.

- **Trial profile**: Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups. Treatment groups appeared to be balanced with respect to participants' history of sexually transmitted infections: 294 (41%) of 720 participants had at least one previous diagnosis of gonorrhoea, 248 (34%) of chlamydia, and 101 (14%) of syphilis; 4 (3%) of 135 women had a previous diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Protocol deviations were reported in 121 (33%) of 362 participants receiving ceftriaxone and in 124 (35%) of 358 participants receiving gentamicin; however, the majority of these deviations were considered minor. Two major protocol deviations occurred but are not detailed here.

### SPL drug information for cefuroxime axetil [^11256UxD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cefuroxime axetil PO (also known as Ceftin, Zinacef):

- **Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefuroxime axetil has been reported to cause false-negative results for blood glucose tests using ferricyanide.

- **Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefuroxime axetil has been reported to cause false-positive results for urine glucose tests using copper reduction.

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of cefuroxime axetil in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including cefuroxime axetil, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Superinfection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens may occur during treatment.

### Effects of prior effective therapy on the efficacy of daptomycin and ceftriaxone for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1174VCHm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

We sought to compare daptomycin with ceftriaxone for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Two phase-3 randomized, double-blind trials that enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CAP were conducted. Patients received intravenous daptomycin (4 mg/kg) or ceftriaxone (2 g) once daily for 5–14 days. Aztreonam could be added for patients with gram-negative infections. Clinical responses at the test-of-cure visit among patients in the intent-to-treat and clinically evaluable populations were the primary efficacy endpoints.

After combining data from the trials, the intent-to-treat population included 413 daptomycin-treated patients and 421 ceftriaxone-treated patients, and the clinically evaluable population included 369 daptomycin-treated patients and 371 ceftriaxone-treated patients. In the intent-to-treat population, the clinical cure rate among daptomycin-treated patients with CAP was 70.9%, compared with 77.4% among ceftriaxone-treated patients (95% confidence interval for the difference between cure rates, -12.4% to -0.6%). In the clinically evaluable population, the clinical cure rate was lower among daptomycin-treated patients (79.4%) than among ceftriaxone-treated patients (87.9%; 95% confidence interval for the difference between cure rates, -13.8% to -3.2%). A posthoc analysis revealed that, among those who had received up to 24 hours of prior effective therapy, cure rates were similar among daptomycin-treated (90.7%) and ceftriaxone-treated patients (88.0%; 95% confidence interval for the difference between cure rates).

### The effect of adjunctive antibiotic oral therapy on the recurrence of infective endocarditis after valve surgeries [^117SA4QX]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Adjunctive oral antibiotics following intravenous antibiotics are administered after valve surgery in some patients with active infective endocarditis (IE); however, little is known about their efficacy. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of adjunctive antibiotic oral therapy after IE surgeries. Between 2009 and 2017, 585 patients underwent valve surgery for left-sided active IE at 14 hospitals. Patients who died during hospitalization or transferred with intravenous antibiotics were excluded. Of the remaining 460 patients, 239 were treated with oral antibiotics at discharge (group O) and 221 did not take the oral antibiotic (group N).

- **Primary outcome**: All-cause mortality.
- **Secondary outcomes**: The recurrence of IE and a subset analysis of it.

The two groups had similar backgrounds, postoperative inflammatory responses, and an almost similar duration of postoperative intravenous antibiotics. The overall survival rates at 1 and 5 years were 96% and 88% in group O and 92% and 84% in group N, respectively (P = 0.425). The rates of freedom from the recurrence of endocarditis at 1 and 5 years were 98% and 94% in group O and 97% and 93% in group N, respectively (P = 0.309). In chronic hemodialysis patients, the rates of freedom from recurrence were significantly higher in group O than in group N (1 year: 100% vs 87.5%; 5 years: 95% vs 69%, P = 0.022). Adjunctive oral antibiotics following intravenous antibiotics in patients with active IE after valve surgery did not affect the overall survival and recurrence of IE, except in chronic hemodialysis patients.

### Easy-ceft1g [^11368LYY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Prescribing Ceftriaxone for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Prolonged use of Ceftriaxone for Injection may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

- **Patients with renal or hepatic impairment**: Ceftriaxone is excreted via both biliary and renal excretion. Therefore, patients with renal failure normally require no adjustment in dosage when usual doses of Ceftriaxone for Injection are administered. Dosage adjustments should not be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, in patients with both hepatic dysfunction and significant renal disease, caution should be exercised and the Ceftriaxone for Injection dosage should not exceed 2 g daily. Ceftriaxone is not removed by peritoneal- or hemodialysis. In patients undergoing dialysis, no additional supplementary dosing is required following the dialysis. In patients with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, close clinical monitoring for safety and efficacy is advised.

- **Effect on prothrombin time**: Alterations in prothrombin times have occurred in patients treated with Ceftriaxone for Injection. Monitoring prothrombin time is recommended to ensure safety and efficacy.

### A randomized, prospective study of pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia treated with ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone [^114zCLXA]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) remains a major infection among children, despite the use of pneumococcal vaccination. Ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic with activity against many bacteria, including *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (both penicillin-nonsusceptible and multidrug-resistant strains) and *Staphylococcus aureus* (including methicillin-resistant *S. aureus*). This article describes the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of pediatric patients hospitalized with CABP from a randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded clinical study (registration number NCT01530763).

- **Methods**: Pediatric patients were stratified into four age cohorts and randomized (3:1) to receive either intravenous ceftaroline fosamil or ceftriaxone, with an optional oral switch for a total treatment duration of 5–14 days. Enrollment was planned for 160 patients. Data collected included demographics, infection characteristics, and pathogens. Treatment-emergent adverse events, clinical outcomes, and microbiologic responses were assessed.

- **Results**: Ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated. Similar percentages of patients in the ceftaroline fosamil (55/121; 45%) and ceftriaxone (18/39; 46%) groups reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Coombs seroconversion was observed in 17% of patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group; however, no evidence of hemolytic anemia or hemolysis was found. No deaths were reported during the study. Ceftaroline fosamil had similar effectiveness to ceftriaxone, with high clinical cure rates.

### Ceftriaxone to prevent early-onset pneumonia in comatose patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a pilot randomized controlled trial and resistome assessment (PROTECT) [^114dHydG]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) reduces early-onset pneumonia but has an uncertain impact on mortality and non-infectious outcomes, with ongoing concerns about the subsequent development of antibiotic resistance.

- **Research question**: Does prophylactic ceftriaxone reduce the incidence of early-onset pneumonia without increasing the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes after OHCA?

- **Study design and methods**: Comatose survivors of OHCA treated with targeted temperature management, without a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia at admission, were randomized to receive ceftriaxone 2 gm or a matching placebo every 12 hours for three days. The primary outcome was early-onset pneumonia occurring ≤ 4 days after intubation, confirmed by blinded adjudicators. The abundance of antibiotic resistance genes recovered from rectal swabs before and after study drug administration was analyzed with metagenomic sequencing.

- **Results**: A total of 411 subjects were screened, and 53 (13%) were randomized. One subject withdrew, leaving 26 in each group for the final analysis. Early-onset pneumonia was diagnosed in 10 (38%) subjects receiving ceftriaxone and 18 (69%) subjects receiving placebo (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21–1.001; p = 0.05). Open-label antibiotics were administered to 14 (54%) subjects receiving ceftriaxone and 22 (85%) receiving placebo (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43–0.94), most of which were broad-spectrum (93% and 100%, respectively). After adjusting for differences in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes prior to study drug administration, subjects randomized to ceftriaxone acquired…

### Ceftriaxone combined with metronidazole is superior to cefoxitin alone in the management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children: Results from a multicenter collaborative comparative effectiveness study [^117HWwFg]. Annals of Surgery (2021). High credibility.

To compare surgical site infection rates between the two most commonly used narrow-spectrum antibiotic regimens in children with uncomplicated appendicitis, ceftriaxone with metronidazole and cefoxitin alone, a multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted. This research utilized clinical data from the Pediatric National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Appendectomy Collaborative Pilot database, complemented by antibiotic use data from the Pediatric Health Information System database, covering the period from January 2013 to June 2015.

Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have been demonstrated to be as effective as extended-spectrum (antipseudomonal) agents in preventing surgical site infections (SSIs) in pediatric uncomplicated appendicitis. However, the comparative effectiveness of different narrow-spectrum agents has yet to be extensively reported.

The study analyzed 846 patients from 14 hospitals, revealing an overall surgical site infection rate of 1.3%. Of these patients, 56.0% received ceftriaxone with metronidazole (hospital range: 0%-100%), while 44.0% received cefoxitin (range: 0%-100%). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for patient characteristics, disease severity, and hospital clustering demonstrated that ceftriaxone with metronidazole was associated with a 90% reduction in the odds of SSI compared to cefoxitin, with rates of 0.2% versus 2.7%, an odds ratio of 0.10 (95% confidence interval 0.02–0.60), and a P-value of 0.01.

### Testing strategies and predictors for evaluating immediate and delayed reactions to cephalosporins [^114PsXBK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Although 1% to 2% of the general population carries a cephalosporin allergy label (CAL), we lack validated testing strategies and predictors of true allergy.

- **Objective**: To identify cross-reactivity patterns and predictors of skin test positive (STP) in geographically disparate patients with a CAL.

- **Methods**: A total of 780 adult patients labeled with a CAL or penicillin allergy label (PAL), with unknown tolerance of cephalosporins, were identified from the Austin Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) (n = 410) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN) (n = 370) between 2014 and 2018. These patients underwent standardized skin testing.

- **Results**: Of 328 patients with a CAL, 29 (8.8%) tested STP to ≥ 1 cephalosporin(s). There were no cefazolin or ceftriaxone STP among patients with a PAL only, 0 of 452 (0%). Of 328 patients with a CAL, 16 (4.8%) were ampicillin STP. Eleven of these 16 patients had an initial allergy label to cephalexin. Twenty of 29 cephalosporin STP patients demonstrated tolerance to a cephalosporin with a different R1 side chain, and 8 of 14 ampicillin STP patients demonstrated tolerance to ≥ 1 non-amino R1 group cephalosporin. Eleven of 13 patients STP to cefazolin were skin and ingestion challenge negative to all other penicillins and cephalosporins, predicted by its distinct R1/R2 groups. Seven of 15 ceftriaxone STP patients demonstrated cross-reactivity with R1-similar cephalosporins. Time since the original reaction predicted STP testing to both penicillins, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per year of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.97).

### Ambulatory intravenous ceftriaxone in paediatric A&E: A useful alternative to hospital admission [^116ZVrDq]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The treatment of children with intravenous ceftriaxone on an ambulatory basis is described. This approach allows a child to remain at home while also being regularly reviewed when attending the Emergency Department for antibiotics.

- **Methods**: Indications for, and length of, treatment and laboratory parameters were recorded. Additionally, a survey of children's parents was undertaken to ascertain opinions regarding ambulatory treatment.

- **Results**: Thirty-six patients were treated with ambulatory ceftriaxone over four months. Indications included fever without focus, tonsillitis, periorbital cellulitis, urinary tract infection, petechial rash, and lymphadenitis. The median duration of treatment was 2.3 days. No occult bacteremia was observed, but five positive urine cultures were identified. One treatment failed, resulting in subsequent admission for alternative intravenous antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: Parental opinion favors ambulatory treatment, with 94% of parents acknowledging they would choose it again in similar circumstances. Cost analysis supports ambulatory treatment based on predicted costs of a similar length of inpatient stay.
