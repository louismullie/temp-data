## Question

can albuterol be taken with stiolto respimat

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albuterol can be taken with Stiolto Respimat, and if so, how to do it safely and appropriately. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled roles of each medication. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about concomitant use and rescue therapy. Next, I will check for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions. After that, I need to consider safety risks and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and clarify what to avoid, especially regarding asthma and LABA monotherapy risks.

> Let me first confirm the medications and their mechanisms. Stiolto Respimat is a fixed-dose combination of tiotropium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and olodaterol, a long-acting beta2-agonist, indicated for once-daily maintenance treatment of COPD, not for acute relief or for asthma [^115t7qiK]. Albuterol is a short-acting beta2-agonist used as rescue therapy for acute bronchospasm in COPD and asthma, with rapid onset and short duration of action [^112ybibm].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled guidance on rescue therapy with Stiolto. The FDA labeling explicitly instructs that Stiolto is not for acute symptom relief and that patients should be provided with a short-acting beta2-agonist for rescue, with regular SABA use discontinued when starting Stiolto and reserved for as-needed relief only [^114WGRAv] [^112ybibm]. This aligns with the principle that LAMA/LABA combinations are maintenance controllers, while SABA remains the rescue medication in COPD care pathways [^114WGRAv].

> I need to check for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions. The FDA notes that formal PK interaction studies for the fixed-dose combination were not performed, but studies of the individual components show no clinically meaningful PK interaction between tiotropium and olodaterol when coadministered, and no evidence that concomitant inhaled beta-agonists alter tiotropium exposure; however, a drug–drug database flags that salbutamol may decrease tiotropium renal clearance, which could theoretically raise tiotropium levels, though clinical significance is uncertain and not well substantiated in inhaled combination use [^115E8cYD]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this potential interaction is weak and not a reason to avoid indicated rescue SABA use with Stiolto, but it reinforces the principle of using the lowest effective SABA dose and monitoring for anticholinergic effects if SABA use escalates [^115gFjv8].

> Next, I should review safety considerations. The main concern with adding a SABA to a LABA-containing regimen is excessive beta-agonist exposure, which can increase cardiovascular effects such as tachycardia, arrhythmias, and blood pressure changes; the Stiolto label warns against excessive LABA use and advises monitoring if cardiovascular symptoms occur [^1135bdKP]. I should double-check that this risk is dose-related and more concerning with chronic overuse rather than occasional rescue use; indeed, the risk is primarily with exceeding recommended dosing or combining multiple LABA sources, which is why we avoid additional LABA agents and limit SABA to as-needed use only [^1135bdKP] [^116STjwk].

> Let me consider the clinical context and guideline alignment. In COPD, maintenance LAMA/LABA therapy is appropriate, and SABA remains standard rescue; guidelines and labeling support SABA rescue alongside LAMA/LABA maintenance, with attention to escalating SABA use as a marker of worsening control that warrants reassessment of the regimen [^116T2sVn] [^114WGRAv]. But wait, what if the patient has asthma or asthma–COPD overlap? Stiolto is not indicated for asthma, and LABA monotherapy without ICS increases asthma-related risk; thus, if asthma is present, the maintenance plan should include ICS, and SABA use should follow asthma guidelines rather than COPD labeling [^1153YKq8] [^114c32gc].

> I will now examine practical administration and monitoring. Patients should use Stiolto once daily as prescribed and reserve albuterol for breakthrough symptoms, typically up to two puffs as needed, with a few minutes between inhalers if using separate devices; if rescue use increases beyond occasional use, that should trigger a clinical review for disease progression or inhaler technique issues [^114WGRAv] [^112ybibm]. Hold on, I should verify that no special spacing is mandated — none is specified in the Stiolto label, so standard inhaler technique and patient-specific coordination suffice, with rinsing after corticosteroids if ICS are later added for asthma overlap or other indications.

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, albuterol can be taken with Stiolto Respimat, but albuterol should be used only as rescue therapy for acute symptoms, not on a scheduled basis, and patients should be counseled to stop regular SABA use when initiating Stiolto and to monitor for increasing rescue needs that could signal worsening COPD [^114WGRAv] [^112ybibm]. I should confirm the key caveats: avoid using Stiolto for acute relief, do not add other LABA-containing products, and reassess the treatment plan if rescue use becomes frequent or symptoms worsen despite adherence [^114WGRAv] [^1135bdKP].

> Finally, I need to ensure the asthma caveat is explicit. If the patient has asthma or suspected asthma–COPD overlap, Stiolto alone is inappropriate because it lacks ICS; in that scenario, therapy should be adjusted to include ICS per asthma guidelines, and SABA rescue remains appropriate within an ICS-containing regimen, with close follow-up to balance risks and benefits [^1153YKq8] [^114c32gc].

Albuterol can be used with Stiolto Respimat, but **only as rescue therapy** for acute symptoms [^114WGRAv]. Stiolto is a once-daily LAMA/LABA maintenance inhaler and is **not for acute relief**; patients should carry albuterol for breakthrough symptoms [^112ybibm]. Regular albuterol use should be minimized, and increased rescue use signals worsening control and should prompt reassessment [^114WGRAv]. There is no direct pharmacokinetic interaction, but combined beta-agonist effects can increase cardiovascular risk, so monitor for palpitations, tremor, and tachycardia [^115E8cYD] [^1135bdKP].

---

## Pharmacological compatibility

- **Mechanisms of action**: Albuterol is a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) for rapid bronchodilation, while Stiolto combines tiotropium (LAMA) and olodaterol (LABA) for sustained bronchodilation [^112RJkKS].

- **Pharmacokinetic interactions**: No direct PK interaction exists between albuterol and Stiolto components; olodaterol and tiotropium exposures are unchanged when coadministered [^115E8cYD].

- **Pharmacodynamic considerations**: Both add beta-agonist effects; excessive beta-agonist exposure can cause cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, palpitations, tremor) [^1135bdKP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **FDA labeling**: Stiolto is for maintenance only, not for acute relief; patients should have a SABA (e.g. albuterol) for rescue [^114WGRAv] [^112ybibm].

- **Rescue therapy**: Albuterol is appropriate for breakthrough symptoms, but regular SABA use should be stopped when starting Stiolto; increased rescue use indicates worsening control and should prompt reassessment [^114WGRAv] [^112ybibm].

- **Clinical practice guidelines**: SABA rescue is standard with LAMA/LABA maintenance in COPD, with monitoring for overuse and adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Combined beta-agonists can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and arrhythmia risk; use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease [^1135bdKP].

- **Hypokalemia**: Beta-agonists can lower potassium, especially with diuretics or corticosteroids; monitor if risk factors are present [^116STjwk].

- **Paradoxical bronchospasm**: Rare with inhaled agents; stop therapy if it occurs [^1135bdKP].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific factors

- **COPD exacerbations**: Increased rescue use signals deterioration; reassess therapy and consider escalation [^114WGRAv].

- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperthyroidism due to beta-agonist effects [^1135bdKP].

- **Age considerations**: Older adults may have higher cardiovascular risk; monitor closely [^notfound].

---

## Practical recommendations for patients

- **Patient education**: Teach correct use of both inhalers and emphasize that Stiolto is for maintenance, not rescue [^112ybibm].

- **Monitoring**: Track rescue use and report increased frequency or worsening symptoms promptly [^112ybibm].

- **Adverse effects**: Report palpitations, tremor, or chest pain immediately [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Routine maintenance therapy | Stiolto once daily; minimize regular albuterol use [^114WGRAv] |
| Acute symptoms | Use albuterol as rescue; monitor frequency [^112ybibm] |
| Increased rescue use | Reassess COPD control and consider therapy adjustment [^114WGRAv] |
| Cardiovascular comorbidities | Use caution; monitor closely [^1135bdKP] |

---

Albuterol can be used with Stiolto Respimat as rescue therapy, but **regular SABA use should be avoided** and increased rescue use should trigger reassessment. There is no direct interaction, but additive beta-agonist effects warrant caution in patients with cardiovascular risk.

5.2	Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes

STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in this setting is inappropriate.

STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist.

When beginning STIOLTO RESPIMAT, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing STIOLTO RESPIMAT, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.

COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If STIOLTO RESPIMAT no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT beyond the recommended dosage is not appropriate in this situation.

5.3	Excessive Use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT and Use With Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists

As with other inhaled drugs containing beta2-adrenergic agents, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta2-agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.

Confirmatory Trials

A total of 5,162 COPD patients (1,029 receiving STIOLTO RESPIMAT, 1,038 receiving olodaterol 5 mcg, and 1,033 receiving tiotropium bromide 5 mcg) were studied in two confirmatory trials of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Trials 1 and 2 were 52-week, replicate, randomized, double-blind, active controlled, parallel group trials that compared STIOLTO RESPIMAT to tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg. In these trials, all products were administered via the RESPIMAT inhaler.

The trials enrolled patients 40 years of age or older with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years, and moderate to very severe pulmonary impairment (post-bronchodilator FEV1less than 80% predicted normal [GOLD Stage 2–4]; post-bronchodilator FEV1to FVC ratio of less than 70%). All treatments were administered once daily in the morning. The primary endpoints were change from baseline in FEV1AUC0-3hrand trough FEV1after 24 weeks of treatment.

The majority of the 5162 patients were male (73%), white (71%) or Asian (25%), with a mean age of 64.0 years. Mean post-bronchodilator FEV1was 1.37 L (GOLD 2 [50%], GOLD 3 [39%], GOLD 4 [11%]). Mean beta2-agonist responsiveness was 16.6% of baseline (0.171 L). Pulmonary medications allowed as concomitant therapy included inhaled steroids [47%] and xanthines [10%].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Asthma-Related Events

Inform patients that LABA, such as STIOLTO RESPIMAT, when used as monotherapy [without an inhaled corticosteroid], increase the risk of serious asthma-related events, including asthma-related death. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.

Not for Acute Symptoms

STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations of COPD and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol. (The healthcare provider should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used.)

Instruct patients to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following:

Worsening of symptoms
Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician

Instruct patients not to stop therapy with STIOLTO RESPIMAT without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation.

Do Not Use Additional Long-Acting Beta -Agonists

Patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these products and use them only for the symptomatic relief of acute symptoms.

When patients are prescribed STIOLTO RESPIMAT, other inhaled medications containing long-acting beta2-agonists should not be used. Patients should not use more than the recommended once-daily dosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Excessive use of sympathomimetics may cause significant cardiovascular effects, and may be fatal.

Risks Associated with Beta -Agonist Therapy

Inform patients of adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists, such as palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor, or nervousness.

Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching, may occur after administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Advise patient to immediately discontinue treatment and consult a physician should any of these signs or symptoms develop.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT were evaluated in a clinical development program that included three dose ranging trials, two active-controlled trials, three active- and placebo-controlled trials, and one placebo-controlled trial. The efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT is based primarily on two 4-week dose-ranging trials in 592 COPD patients and two confirmatory active-controlled 52-week trials (Trials 1 and 2) in 5,162 COPD patients.

Dose-Ranging Trials

Dose selection for STIOLTO RESPIMAT was primarily based on trials for the individual components, tiotropium bromide and olodaterol.

Dose selection was also supported by two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 4-week trials. In one trial in 232 patients with COPD, three tiotropium doses (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mcg) were given in combination with olodaterol 5 or 10 mcg and were evaluated compared to olodaterol monotherapy. Results demonstrated improvement in trough FEV1for the combination when compared to olodaterol alone. The difference in trough FEV1for the tiotropium bromide/olodaterol doses of 1.25/5, 2.5/5, and 5/5 mcg once daily from olodaterol 5 mcg were 0.054 L (95% CI 0.016, 0.092), 0.065 L (0.027, 0.103), and 0.084 L (0.046, 0.122), respectively. In the second trial in 360 patients with COPD, three olodaterol doses (2, 5, and 10 mcg) were given in combination with tiotropium 5 mcg and were evaluated compared to tiotropium monotherapy. The difference in trough FEV1for the tiotropium/olodaterol doses of 5/2, 5/5, and 5/10 mcg once daily from tiotropium 5 mcg were 0.024 L (95% CI -0.029, 0.076), 0.033 L (-0.019, 0.085), and 0.057 L (0.004, 0.110), respectively. Results of these trials supported the evaluation of once-daily doses of tiotropium bromide/olodaterol 2.5/5 mcg and 5/5 mcg in the confirmatory trials.

5.4	Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching may occur after administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to STIOLTO RESPIMAT.

5.5	Paradoxical Bronchospasm

As with other inhaled medicines, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may cause paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped immediately and alternative therapy instituted.

5.6	Cardiovascular Effects

Olodaterol, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Long acting beta2-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hypertension.

5.7	Coexisting Conditions

Olodaterol, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients with known or suspected prolongation of the QT interval, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.

5.8	Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma

STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.

Drug Interactions

STIOLTO RESPIMAT

Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with STIOLTO RESPIMAT have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with individual components tiotropium and olodaterol.

When tiotropium and olodaterol were administered in combination by the inhaled route, the pharmacokinetic parameters for each component were similar to those observed when each active substance was administered separately.

Tiotropium

An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once-daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC0-4h, a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the Cmaxand amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium.

Common concomitant medications (long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium.

Olodaterol

Drug-drug interaction studies were carried out using fluconazole as a model inhibitor of CYP 2C9 and ketoconazole as a potent P-gp (and CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9) inhibitor.

Fluconazole: Co-administration of 400 mg fluconazole once a day for 14 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol.

Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 400 mg ketoconazole once a day for 14 days increased olodaterol Cmaxby 66% and AUC0-1by 68%.

Tiotropium: Co-administration of tiotropium bromide, delivered as a fixed-dose combination with olodaterol, for 21 days had no relevant effect on systemic exposure to olodaterol, and vice versa.

Specific Populations

Olodaterol

A pharmacokinetic meta-analysis showed that no dose adjustment is necessary based on the effect of age, gender, and weight on systemic exposure in COPD patients after inhalation of olodaterol.

Geriatric Patients

Tiotropium:

As expected for all predominantly renally excreted drugs, advancing age was associated with a decrease of tiotropium renal clearance (347 mL/min in COPD patients < 65 years to 275 mL/min in COPD patients ≥ 65 years). This did not result in a corresponding increase in AUC0-6, ssand Cmax, ssvalues.

Exacerbations

Tiotropium 5 mcg Trials Evaluating Exacerbations

The effect of tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray on exacerbations was evaluated in three 48-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that included COPD exacerbations as the primary endpoint. Exacerbations of COPD were defined as a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms (increase or new onset) related to the underlying COPD, with duration of three days or more, requiring a prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids and/or hospitalization. In a pooled analysis of the first two trials, tiotropium 5 mcg significantly reduced the number of COPD exacerbations compared to placebo with a rate ratio of 0.78 (95% CI 0.67, 0.92). In the third trial, tiotropium 5 mcg delayed the time to first COPD exacerbation compared to placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.63, 0.77).

STIOLTO RESPIMAT Trial Evaluating Exacerbations

In a one-year, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled parallel group clinical trial (Trial 5), the effect of STIOLTO RESPIMAT on COPD exacerbations was compared with tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray. Exacerbations were defined as above. Enrolled patients (3,939 patients receiving STIOLTO RESPIMAT and 3,941 patients receiving tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray) had a history of COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months. The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations. The majority of patients were male (71%) and Caucasian (79%). The mean age was 66 years, and mean post-bronchodilator FEV1percent predicted was 45%. STIOLTO RESPIMAT treatment did not demonstrate superiority to tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray for the primary endpoint, the annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations, with a rate ratio of 0.93 (99% CI, 0.85–1.02, p = 0.0498). The study did not reach the pre-specified significance level of 0.01.

5.1	Serious Asthma-Related Events – Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death

The safety and efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in patients with asthma have not been established. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see Contraindications (4)].
Use of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) as monotherapy [without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)] for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone.
A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including olodaterol, one of the active ingredients in STIOLTO RESPIMAT.
No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT has been conducted.
Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD.

Frequency of Use

The action of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should last 4 to 5 hours or longer. COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should not be used more frequently than recommended. Safety and efficacy of additional doses of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT beyond six inhalations in 24 hours have not been studied. Patients should be told not to increase the dose or frequency of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT without consulting a physician. Patients should be instructed that if they find that treatment with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, their symptoms become worse, and/or they need to use the product more frequently than usual, medical attention should be sought immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema, may occur after the administration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. Advise patients to immediately discontinue COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and consult a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Concomitant Drug Use

Remind patients that while taking COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, other inhaled drugs should be taken only as directed by a physician [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Effect of tiotropium and olodaterol on symptoms and patient-reported outcomes in patients with COPD: results from four randomised, double-blind studies [^116YRVhi]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Trials of maintenance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatments focus on improvement in lung function and reductions in exacerbations, while patients are much more concerned about symptoms and health status. Our aim was to investigate the effects of tiotropium+olodaterol on patient-reported health outcomes, breathlessness and night-time rescue medication use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compared to placebo, tiotropium or olodaterol monotherapy. Two pairs of replicate, phase III studies of 12 (OTEMTO 1+2) and 52 weeks' (TONADO 1+2) duration were evaluated, in which patients received either tiotropium+olodaterol 2.5/5 or 5/5μg, tiotropium 2.5 or 5μg, olodaterol 5μg or placebo, all delivered once daily via Respimat inhaler. Patient-reported outcomes included breathlessness assessed by transition dyspnoea index focal score, health status assessed by St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score and night-time rescue medication use at 12 or 24 weeks. Outcomes from the pooled study data are reported. Overall, 1621 and 5162 patients were treated in the OTEMTO and TONADO trials, respectively. Significantly larger improvements in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and transition dyspnoea index focal scores were observed and a greater proportion of patients were responders to therapy (based on minimum clinically important differences in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and transition dyspnoea index) with tiotropium+olodaterol compared to either monotherapy or to placebo. Tiotropium+olodaterol 5/5µg significantly reduced night-time rescue medication usage.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

COMBINED INHALER PROVES EFFECTIVE: Results from four in-depth studies show that a combined inhaler is very effective for treatment of moderate to severe chronic lung disease. Alleviating the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly sleep disturbance, is crucial to enhancing patients' quality of life. Gary Ferguson at the Pulmonary Research Institute of Southeast Michigan, together with other scientists across the USA and Germany, analysed data from four large-scale studies to evaluate the efficacy of STIOLTO Respimat, a combination of two bronchodilators-tiotropium, and olodaterol, which tackle airway obstruction and breathlessness, improving long-term lung function. They found that the new drug combination triggered significant improvements in patients' quality of life and levels of breathlessness. Use of night-time rescue medication in patients on STIOLTO Respimat was considerably reduced. A greater number of patients responded positively to the combined inhaler than to monotherapy.

Paradoxical Bronchospasm

Inform patients that STIOLTO RESPIMAT can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. Advise patients that if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, patients should discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT.

Urinary Retention

Difficulty passing urine and dysuria may be symptoms of new or worsening prostatic hyperplasia or bladder outlet obstruction. Patients should be instructed to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.

Visual Effects

Eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema may be signs of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. Inform patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs and symptoms develop. Advise patients that miotic eye drops alone are not considered to be effective treatment.

Inform patients that care must be taken not to allow the aerosol cloud to enter into the eyes as this may cause blurring of vision and pupil dilation.

Since dizziness and blurred vision may occur with the use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, caution patients about engaging in activities such as driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery.

Instructions for Administering STIOLTO RESPIMAT

It is important for patients to understand how to correctly administer STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhalation spray using the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler. Instruct patients that STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhalation spray should only be administered via the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler and the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler should not be used for administering other medications.

Instruct patients that priming STIOLTO RESPIMAT is essential to ensure appropriate content of the medication in each actuation.

When using the unit for the first time, the STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge is inserted into the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler and the unit is primed. STIOLTO RESPIMAT patients are to actuate the inhaler toward the ground until an aerosol cloud is visible and then to repeat the process three more times. The unit is then considered primed and ready for use. If not used for more than 3 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler once to prepare the inhaler for use. If not used for more than 21 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times to prepare the inhaler for use.

### Tiotropium bromide and olodaterol (stiolto respimat) [^112a2fTv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The structural formula is:

The drug product, STIOLTO RESPIMAT, is composed of a sterile aqueous solution of tiotropium bromide and olodaterol hydrochloride filled into a 4.5 mL plastic container crimped into an aluminum cylinder (STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge) for use with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler.

Excipients include, benzalkonium chloride, edetate disodium, hydrochloric acid, and water for injection.

The STIOLTO RESPIMAT cartridge is only intended for use with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler is a hand held, pocket sized oral inhalation device that uses mechanical energy to generate a slow-moving aerosol cloud of medication from a metered volume of the drug solution. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler has a light green-colored cap.

When used with the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler each cartridge, containing 4 grams of sterile aqueous solution, delivers the labeled number of metered actuations after preparation for use. Each dose (one dose equals two actuations) from the STIOLTO RESPIMAT inhaler delivers 5 mcg tiotropium (equivalent to 6.247 mcg tiotropium bromide monohydrate) and 5 mcg olodaterol (equivalent to 5.473 mcg olodaterol hydrochloride) in 22.1 mcL from the mouthpiece. As with all inhaled drugs, the actual amount of drug delivered to the lung may depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between the actuation of the inhaler and inspiration through the delivery system. The duration of inspiration should be at least as long as the spray duration (1.5 seconds).

Statistical methodology

Descriptive statistics were provided for the incidence of AEs and aggregated AE groups (based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities SMQs, or sponsor-defined pharmacovigilance end points where SMQs were not available for the medical AE concept of interest). AE incidences are described with their crude incidence (percentage of patients with the event out of all patients in the treatment group) and exposure-adjusted incidence rate (number of events per 100 patient-years at risk with the drug) in order to adjust for different exposure between the treatment arms in case of differential study discontinuation. Exposure-adjusted RRs and their 95% CIs are calculated based on a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method stratified by study to compare olodaterol versus formoterol treatment groups. AEs of interest are displayed with their RR and 95% CI in a forest plot. Time to early discontinuation of patients from the study was compared with a Cox regression analysis of treatment effect using baseline long-acting muscarinic antagonist concomitant medication (tiotropium) use as a stratification factor. This is a post hoc analysis and no formal statistical testing of hypotheses was performed. The assessment of statistical significance via 95% CIs of the RR is, therefore, considered exploratory and no adjustment for multiple testing was done.

Peters et al. showed that the addition of tiotropium to low-dose ICS resulted in significant improvements in morning and evening PEF, and pre-bronchodilator FEV 1. The combination of tiotropium and low-dose ICS was comparable to a LABA/ICS combination and was significantly better than doubling the ICS dose. In a separate study of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma despite treatment with at least high-dose ICS plus LABA, the addition of tiotropium significantly improved lung function; however, no significant differences were observed in asthma-related health status or rescue medication use in this crossover and short-term setting, the design of which may have impacted the clinical outcome. In a larger, 48-week study of a similar population of patients, the add-on therapy of tiotropium to high-dose ICS/LABA led to significant increases in lung function and significantly increased the time to first severe asthma exacerbation. Bateman et al. showed that adding tiotropium to medium-dose ICS was non-inferior to salmeterol and superior to placebo in patients with moderate asthma with the B16-Arg/Arg genotype whose asthma was not well controlled with ICS alone. Once-daily tiotropium Respimat® added on to ICS was shown to improve lung function in symptomatic adult and adolescent patients with moderate asthma. These studies support a potentially important therapeutic role for the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium as maintenance therapy in the treatment of patients with asthma.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including beta-adrenergic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids, commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and these drugs with respect to safety and effectiveness.

7.1 Anticholinergic Agents

There is the potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid coadministration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

7.2 Beta‑adrenergic Agonists

Caution is advised in the coadministration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and other sympathomimetic agents due to the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)].

7.3 Beta-receptor Blocking Agents

Beta-receptor blocking agents and albuterol inhibit the effect of each other. Beta-receptor blocking agents should be used with caution in patients with hyperreactive airways.

7.4 Diuretics

The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia which may result from the administration of non‑potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta2-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta2-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonist‑containing drugs, such as COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, with non‑potassium sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.

7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAOs or tricyclic antidepressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Mild asthma — as-needed inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) taken with a rapid-acting bronchodilator includes three regimens and associated outcomes: As-needed ICSs were evaluated with rapid-acting bronchodilators as 1) as-needed ICS plus formoterol in a single inhaler, 2) as-needed ICS plus albuterol in a single inhaler, and 3) as-needed ICS plus albuterol in separate inhalers. In the BEST study, the as-needed combination ICS–albuterol group had fewer exacerbations and higher peak flow than SABAs alone, and in BASALT, exacerbation outcomes were similar with concomitant as-needed SABA and ICS compared with physician adjustment or FeNO-based adjustment of ICS dose every 6 weeks. Albuterol–ICS can also be used before exercise in adults with exercise-induced asthma or bronchospasm. A pragmatic trial instructed one inhalation of ICS with each inhalation of SABA, or five inhalations of ICS with each nebulized SABA treatment, resulting in a significant reduction in severe exacerbation rates compared with usual care. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved the use of as-needed combination albuterol–budesonide in asthma.

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT Inhalation Spray

In a 12-week randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy parallel group trial, 108 US patients with COPD receiving either COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) or CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg) four times daily participated in pharmacokinetic evaluations. Plasma ipratropium concentrations were low with an average peak plasma concentration of 33.5 pg/mL from COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. The majority of the study participants exhibited levels below the lower limit of quantitation (< 10 pg/mL) by 4 to 6 hours following dosing. The steady state systemic exposure obtained for ipratropium bromide following COMBIVENT RESPIMAT was comparable to that of CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol. Ipratropium plasma AUC and total amount of drug excreted unchanged in urine (Ae) ratios for COMBIVENT RESPIMAT/CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol were 1.04 and 1.18, respectively. For albuterol the steady state systemic exposure was less from COMBIVENT RESPIMAT compared to that of CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol. Albuterol plasma AUC and urine Ae ratios for COMBIVENT RESPIMAT/CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol were 0.74 and 0.86, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate was evaluated in a crossover study in 12 healthy male volunteers who received CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol and the two active components separately as individual treatments. Results from this study indicated that the coadministration of these two components from a single canister did not significantly alter the systemic absorption of either component, indicating lack of any pharmacokinetic interaction between these two drugs.

Study design

After an initial screening visit and a 4-week run-in period, patients were randomised to one of four treatment sequences, during which they received each of the four treatments (tiotropium 5 μg, 2.5 μg or 1.25 μg or placebo, all delivered via the Respimat® SoftMist™ inhaler) (Figure 1). Each treatment was administered for 4 weeks, and there was no washout between treatment periods as pharmacodynamic steady state with tiotropium is known to be achieved after 3 weeks in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Seven clinic visits were scheduled: at screening (Visit 0); prior to the 4-week run-in (Visit 1); at randomisation (after the 4-week run-in [Visit 2]); every 4 weeks at the end of each treatment period (Visits 3–6); and 21 days following the end of the final treatment period (Visit 7).

Figure 1
Study design.

Tiotropium Respimat® (two puffs) or placebo Respimat® (two puffs) was administered once daily in the evening between 18:00 and 20:00. All patients were required to continue maintenance treatment with stable medium-dose ICS (400–800 μg budesonide or equivalent) for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 and until Visit 7. Patients using ICS plus short-acting β 2 -agonist or ICS + LABA fixed-dose combinations were switched to the same dose of ICS mono-product at least 8 or 24 hours, respectively, prior to Visit 1. Study medication was to be taken immediately after ICS inhalation if normal ICS dosing was in the evening. Concomitant use of the following was not permitted for maintenance treatment: systemic oral or depot corticosteroids; anticholinergics other than tiotropium; LABAs; ICS plus short-acting β 2 -agonist or ICS + LABA fixed-dose combinations; leukotriene modifiers; anti-immunoglobulin E treatment; chromone; methylxanthines; and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. Salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane metered-dose inhaler was provided by the sponsor as rescue medication for use as needed. Permitted medication for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations included salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane metered-dose inhaler, systemic corticosteroids and short-acting theophylline preparations.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^112i8LUU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

These findings are consistent with those from recent studies that demonstrated the value of using the long-acting anticholinergic, tiotropium, as add-on therapy to ICS, or as an add-on to ICS plus LABA, or compared with doubling the ICS dose, in the chronic management of moderate or severe asthma. The results of this study suggest that use of a short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator in a fixed-dose combination with a SABA has a greater effect on lung function in moderate-to-severe asthma than SABA alone, and should therefore provide better symptomatic relief. In the future, additional studies will be useful to investigate the additive effects of these drugs in patients with all spectra of asthma severity.

These results support the use of a short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator in a fixed-dose combination with a SABA in asthma, and the need for further clinical trials to determine the role of short- and long-acting anticholinergics (ipratropium and tiotropium, respectively) for managing asthma.

### Tiotropium + olodaterol shows clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life [^11334sgo]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tiotropium + olodaterol improves lung function and symptoms compared to monotherapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The OTEMTO 1 and 2 studies investigated the effects of tiotropium + olodaterol on lung function and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe COPD.

Methods

In these two replicate, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials, patients were randomised to receive tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg, 2.5/5 μg, tiotropium 5 μg or placebo for 12 weeks, via the Respimat(®) inhaler. Primary end points were St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) area under the curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC0-3) response and trough FEV1 response.

Results

In OTEMTO 1 and 2, tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 μg improved SGRQ total score by 4.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.90, -2.88) and 4.56 (95% CI -6.50, -2.63) units versus placebo (both p < 0.0001), and 2.49 (95% CI -4.47, -0.51; p < 0.05) and 1.72 (95% CI -3.63, 0.19) units versus tiotropium 5 μg. Tiotropium + olodaterol 2.5/5 μg significantly improved SGRQ score compared to placebo. Both doses significantly improved FEV1 AUC0-3 response compared to placebo and tiotropium 5 μg. Tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 and 2.5/5 μg also significantly improved trough FEV1 response compared to placebo (both studies) and separated from tiotropium 5 μg in OTEMTO 2. Adverse-event incidence was similar between treatment groups.

Conclusion

Tiotropium + olodaterol improved lung function and quality of life compared to placebo and tiotropium 5 μg.

### Tiotropium in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-a review of clinical development [^1112A9CF]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

LAMAs inhibit the bronchoconstrictor effect of acetylcholine by prolonged binding to the M3 muscarinic receptors present on airway smooth muscles and faster dissociation from M2 receptors. Tiotropium bromide, the first LAMA available for COPD in clinical practice, with a dissociation half-life of 35 h from the M3 receptor, is structurally related to ipratropium. Ipratropium has a short duration of action, with a dissociation half-life of 0.3 h from the M3 receptor and requires four-times-a-day (QID) dosing, potentially affecting adherence to therapy. In contrast, tiotropium has a long duration of action, enabling once-daily (QD) dosing. Tiotropium was first available as an inhalation powder delivered via a dry-powder inhaler (DPI; Spiriva® HandiHaler®; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc) and later became available as an inhalation spray delivered via a soft mist inhaler (SMI; Spiriva® Respimat®; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc). Tiotropium HandiHaler® and tiotropium Respimat® are indicated for long-term, QD maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD and for reducing COPD exacerbations in the United States (US), European Union (EU), and other countries. A LABA/LAMA combination is used to leverage their different mechanisms of action. While LAMAs prevent bronchoconstriction, LABAs relax bronchial smooth muscle and cause bronchodilation by stimulating β2-adrenergic receptors in airway smooth muscle which trigger cellular pathways. Tiotropium in a fixed-dose combination with the LABA olodaterol (Stiolto® Respimat® inhalation spray [Spiolto® Respimat® inhalation solution in Europe]; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc) is indicated for the long-term, QD maintenance treatment of patients with COPD.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^115rKinR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of effective asthma controller therapies, a significant proportion of patients have suboptimal asthma control, characterized by frequent symptoms, lifestyle restrictions, and healthcare use. In addition to controller medications, acute reliever or rescue medications, e.g. short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABAs) are used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. The frequency of SABA use as rescue medication reflects the frequency and intensity of symptoms, and is an important component for classifying asthma severity and level of disease control.

Short-acting anticholinergic agents have been used in asthma for decades; however, their exact role in asthma has not been well established. Studies directly comparing short-acting anticholinergic agents with a variety of SABAs have shown that SABAs provide greater bronchodilation than short-acting anticholinergic agents alone in stable asthma; however, individual studies have demonstrated that specific asthma populations, e.g. older patients, and those whose asthma is related to psychogenic factors, cigarette smoke, or β-blocking drugs, might benefit from anticholinergic therapy.

Short-acting anticholinergic agents have also been evaluated in combination with a SABA or sequentially following SABA administration. The rationale for use of a combination of a short-acting anticholinergic agent and a SABA includes differences between the two classes of medications regarding mechanisms of action, side-effect profiles, onset and duration of action, and site of action. Studies evaluating combination therapy with a short-acting anticholinergic and a SABA have shown variable results, mainly due to small numbers of patients or inappropriate patient populations; however, many of these studies showed an additional (although not significant) benefit.

Combivent® inhalation aerosol metered-dose inhaler (CVT-MDI) is a fixed-dose combination of the short-acting anticholinergic, ipratropium bromide, and the SABA, albuterol sulfate, using a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellant. It should be noted that the CFC-MDI formulation of Combivent (CVT-MDI) used in this study is no longer available, but Combivent is available in the Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler (Combivent® Respimat®), which is considered therapeutically equivalent to the CFC-MDI formulation, and studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have indicated that it has similar bronchodilator effects.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to investigate different dosing regimens of olodaterol delivered via respimat® in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma [^111ELrhC]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs) are used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as controller medication for asthma, and have been shown to improve lung function and symptom scores, and reduce the risk of severe exacerbations. Bronchodilators are also well established as treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); LABAs have demonstrated significant improvements in lung function, health-related quality of life and exacerbations in this setting.

First-generation LABAs, such as formoterol and salmeterol, have a 12-h duration of action that requires a twice-daily (BID) dosing schedule. More recently, research efforts have focused on the development of LABAs with a longer duration of action, which may allow for more convenient once-daily (QD) dosing, potentially improving adherence. Olodaterol is a novel LABA, characterised by high β 2 selectivity and a near full-agonist profile at β 2 adrenoceptors, with a duration of action over 24 h demonstrated by preclinical studies. Effective 24-h bronchodilation with olodaterol has subsequently been confirmed by single-dose studies in both asthma and COPD, along with Phase II studies in COPD investigating four doses of QD olodaterol and a comparison of QD and BID dosing and a large Phase III programme in COPD. These data also demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile and no safety concerns were identified.

Dosing and posology have been the focus of recent discussion in development of new bronchodilators. Firstly, the goal of defining the lowest effective dose to minimise safety risk is of particular importance in view of specific safety considerations for LABA use in asthma. Secondly, while demonstration of 24-h duration of action affords the opportunity to consider QD dosing, assessment of lung function trough measurements alone may not be sufficient to demonstrate that QD dosing is the most appropriate regimen. Specific clinical comparison of different doses and posologies (e.g. QD versus BID) over a 24-h period is the most appropriate method for determining the optimum dose and dosing schedule. The inhaled anticholinergic aclidinium bromide serves as a recent example of a drug developed as a QD treatment but then reassessed at later stages of clinical development and finally approved as a BID drug at a different dose.

Specific Populations

Age

Consistent with CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg), patients receiving COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) aged 65 years and over had higher steady state systemic exposures than patients aged under 65 years for both ipratropium (AUC = 166 vs. 105 pg•hr/mL, Cmax = 38.5 vs. 30.1 pg/mL) and albuterol (AUC = 5.44 vs. 3.27 ng•hr/mL, Cmax = 1.19 vs. 0.74 ng/mL).

Gender

The AUC and Cmaxvalues for ipratropium were 131 pg.hr/mL and 35.4 pg/mL in males and 123 pg.hr/mL and 31.7 pg/mL in females, respectively. The AUC- and Cmax-values for albuterol were 4.0 ng•hr/mL and 0.89 ng/mL in males and 4.2 ng•hr/mL and 0.93 ng/mL in females, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of tiotropium and olodaterol in COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117R8m4L]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of our analysis showed that TIO/OLO is an effective and safe treatment for patients with COPD of a very wide range of severity. The data obtained in the RCT have demonstrated significant improvements in through FEV1, SGRQ, dyspnea scores and a reduction in the use of rescue medication compared with the mono-components, and a significant improvement in through FEV1 in one study compared to LABA/ICS combination. No safety issues were identified in the comparative analysis with the mono-components.

These results concur with those obtained with other LABA/LAMA FDC, that also demonstrate to provide better outcomes compared with mono-components and with LABA/ICS and support the recent GOLD update that recommends LABA/LAMA as first line therapy in patients classified as GOLD D (more symptoms and increased risk of exacerbations). In a different approach based on clinical phenotypes, the Spanish guideline of management of COPD in its 2017 update recommends LABA/LAMA as first line therapy in patients classified as high risk (either FEV 1 (% predicted) < 50% or MRC ≥ 2 or > 1 exacerbations or 1 hospitalization in the previous year) irrespective of the phenotype, with the exception of the asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) in which LABA/ICS is considered the preferred initial option.

The current analysis was based on 10 completed RCTs with TIO/OLO in COPD patients. Of these, only 2 RCTs used the combination of TIO and OLO administered with separate inhalers. The remaining 8 RCTs used TIO/OLO FDC administered with the same inhaler (Respimat®). These studies evaluated adult patients (≥ 40 years), predominantly men, smokers or ex-smokers, with moderate and severe COPD, even two of the trials included up to 10.8% of patients with very severe COPD (FEV 1 (%) < 30%). All trials were considered of high-quality, both in terms of design and execution, and the risk of bias in the estimation of the effect was perceived as low.

The combination of TIO/OLO demonstrated a mean improvement in trough FEV 1 of between 60 mL to 90 mL over TIO and OLO, respectively. This improvement is in line of the mean improvement observed with dual bronchodilators versus LAMA alone. Interestingly, the superiority of TIO/OLO in terms of lung function was observed consistently in all analyzed RCTs.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114hLwH7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### A systematic review of comparative studies of tiotropium respimat® and tiotropium handiHaler® in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does inhaler choice matter? [^113aQjYf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The approval of tiotropium Respimat® in many countries has provided physicians with a choice of inhaler for the delivery of tiotropium maintenance therapy for their patients with COPD. Published evidence from comparative studies suggests that tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg and tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg provide similar clinical outcomes in COPD, indicating that physicians can choose between the two inhalers with confidence. Factors other than efficacy and safety, such as patient preference for a particular inhaler, ease of use and handling, and the efficiency of drug delivery (which has improved significantly for tiotropium with the Respimat® device) should also be taken into account with the aim of optimizing adherence and clinical outcomes with long-term tiotropium maintenance therapy.

### Effect of tiotropium and olodaterol on symptoms and patient-reported outcomes in patients with COPD: results from four randomised, double-blind studies [^114sz6VM]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

These studies demonstrated consistent improvements in patient-reported outcomes and night-time rescue medication use with once-daily tiotropium + olodaterol therapy, administered via the Respimat inhaler. Significantly greater numbers of patients were responders to therapy with tiotropium + olodaterol compared to the monotherapies and placebo, and a lower proportion of patients receiving tiotropium + olodaterol treatment experienced a worsening in their condition. In addition, significant improvements in health scores (SGRQ), breathlessness (TDI) and night-time rescue medication use for patients receiving tiotropium + olodaterol 5/5 µg were also seen compared to either tiotropium or olodaterol alone or placebo.

The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the SGRQ was reached between the tiotropium + olodaterol arm and placebo in the OTEMTO studies. Although MCID values have not been established for comparisons with an active comparator medication, there were significant improvements in SGRQ total scores and a significantly larger proportion of SGRQ responders, and lower proportion of SGRQ deteriorators (patients who achieved an improvement or worsening larger than the MCID, respectively) with tiotropium + olodaterol compared to the active comparators. This suggests that there is an improved, clinically relevant benefit for patients in QoL after treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol, compared to tiotropium or olodaterol alone.

Greater improvements over placebo in TDI focal scores with tiotropium + olodaterol were observed in the OTEMTO studies compared to the TONADO studies. As was observed for SGRQ scores, improvements with tiotropium + olodaterol compared to placebo reached the MCID for TDI focal score in OTEMTO. A greater proportion of patients receiving tiotropium + olodaterol were classed as TDI responders, according to MCID criteria, compared to tiotropium monotherapy in both studies. Furthermore, the proportion of patients who experienced a clinically relevant deterioration in TDI score was low in both studies, with significantly fewer patients receiving tiotropium + olodaterol classed as TDI deteriorators compared to placebo, and a longer time to deterioration, compared to either monotherapy. As TDI responder rates were similar for tiotropium + olodaterol between the OTEMTO and TONADO studies, but larger in TONADO for tiotropium monotherapy, these treatment differences only reached statistical significance in OTEMTO.

Clinical development of tiotropium/olodaterol Respimat®

As mentioned, the clinical development of tiotropium culminated with evidence supporting its use in a fixed-dose combination with olodaterol. The ToVITO® program, which involved more than 16,000 patients and is outside the scope of this review, was designed to evaluate the effect of tiotropium/olodaterol (2.5/5 μg and/or 5/5 μg) Respimat® on various efficacy parameters, as well as its safety. Results of these trials, and others, demonstrated that tiotropium/olodaterol provided a significant, incremental benefit over tiotropium monotherapy in alleviating COPD symptoms such as breathlessness, improving lung function and QoL, and reducing moderate and severe exacerbations (Table 3). In the DYNAGITO® trial, tiotropium/olodaterol reduced the rate of moderate and severe exacerbations by 7% compared with tiotropium alone, which did not meet the predefined significance level of 0.01. However, in a post hoc analysis using multiple covariate models similar to those used in the SPARK and FLAME trials, an 11% reduction in moderate-to-severe exacerbations was observed. Results across trials included in the ToVITO® program showed no significant differences in the frequency of general and serious adverse events between tiotropium/olodaterol Respimat® and mono components.

Table 3
Tiotropium/olodaterol combination – summary table of evidence

AUC 0–24 area under the curve from 0 to 24 h post-dose, AUC 0–12 area under the curve from 0 to 12 h post-dose, AUC 0–3 area under the curve from 0 to 3 h post-dose, BID twice a day, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ExT exercise training, FEV 1 forced expiratory volume in 1 s, HRQoL health-related quality of life, QD once daily, QoL quality of life, SGRQ St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire

Tiotropium will continue to be the first-line treatment for newly diagnosed COPD, in particular in mild to moderate cases and infrequent exacerbators. We hope that early diagnosis will be more frequent in the future and these newly diagnosed cases, probably with milder disease, might be optimal candidates for treatment with tiotropium/olodaterol if new studies demonstrate that optimal early bronchodilation results in improved long-term outcomes.

5.1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that can be life-threatening. If it occurs, therapy with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.

5.2 Cardiovascular Effects

The albuterol sulfate contained in COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, like other beta‑adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If these symptoms occur, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. There is some evidence from postmarketing data and published literature of rare occurrences of myocardial ischemia associated with albuterol. In addition, beta‑adrenergic agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.3 Ocular Effects

Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may increase intraocular pressure. This may result in precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Patients should avoid spraying COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into the eyes. If a patient sprays COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into their eyes they may cause acute eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, mydriasis, visual halos, or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival or corneal congestion. Advise patients to consult their physician immediately if any of these symptoms develop while using COMBIVENT RESPIMAT.

5.4 Urinary Retention

Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may cause urinary retention. Therefore, caution is advised when administering this medication to patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Treatment arms

The study consists of three parallel treatment arms: tiotropium 18 μg once daily via HandiHaler®, tiotropium 5 μg once daily (2.5 μg × two inhalations) via Respimat®, and tiotropium 2.5 μg once daily (1.25 μg × two inhalations) via Respimat® (Figure 1). Each participant was provided with two inhalers, Respimat® and HandiHaler®, one of which contained active medication and the other contained placebo (double dummy). All patients will be followed up for vital status until the end of the study, even if treatment is discontinued prematurely. The planned treatment time for patients will be between 2 and 3 years and is dependent on the number of fatal events observed with study completion expected in 2013. At each 12-week visit, inhalers are collected and new inhalers are distributed. Adherence with drug treatment is ascertained by counting unused HandiHaler® capsules and recording the remaining doses on the Respimat® dose-counter. Proper use of the inhalers is ascertained by direct observation at the first study visit and is maintained by counseling and demonstration, if needed, at subsequent study visits.

### The tiotropium safety and performance in respimat trial (TIOSPIR), a large scale, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial-design and rationale [^112XGTSs]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Tiotropium bromide is an effective therapy for COPD patients. Comparing across programs tiotropium Respimat Soft Mist inhaler was at least as efficacious as tiotropium HandiHaler, however, concerns have been raised about tiotropium's safety when given via Respimat.

Methods

The TIOSPIR trial (NCT01126437) compares the safety and efficacy of tiotropium Respimat 5 μg once daily (marketed) and 2.5 μg once daily (investigational) with tiotropium HandiHaler 18 μ once daily (marketed). The hypotheses to be tested are 1). that tiotropium Respimat 5 μg once daily and Respimat 2.5 μg once daily are non-inferior to HandiHaler in terms of all-cause mortality, and 2). that tiotropium Respimat 5 μg once daily is superior to HandiHaler in terms of time to first exacerbation. A spirometry substudy evaluates the bronchodilator efficacy. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, double dummy, event-driven, parallel group study. Participants can use any background treatment for COPD except inhaled anticholinergic agents. The study encompasses a wide range of COPD patients, e.g. patients with stable cardiac diseases including arrhythmia can be included. Clinical sites are international and include both primary care as well as specialists.

Results

To date, over 17,000 participants have been randomized from over 1200 sites in 50 countries with an anticipated treatment duration of 2–3 years.

Conclusion

TIOSPIR will provide precise estimates of the relative safety and efficacy of the Respimat and HandiHaler formulations of tiotropium, assess potential dose-dependence of important outcomes and provide information on the clinical epidemiology of COPD in a large international patient cohort.

### Efficacy and safety of tiotropium and olodaterol in COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Rgprt]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting bronchodilators represent the backbone of available treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Both long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) and long acting beta-agonists (LABA) confer significant benefits to patients with COPD, which include but are not limited to improvement in lung function, symptoms, health status and reduction in the exacerbations rate. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of a LAMA with a LABA were recently introduced and there are increasing number of studies supporting their efficacy and safety. LAMA/LABA combination was included in the most recent Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy as a first line choice therapy for group D (high risk and symptoms) and recommended second option in B (low risk, high symptoms) and C (high risk, low symptoms) groups, and the Spanish COPD guidelines recommend the use of LABA/LAMA combinations as first line therapy in patients highly symptomatic and/or at risk for exacerbations.

The efficacy and safety of both tiotropium (TIO), the first LAMA introduced in clinical practice, and the LABA olodaterol (OLO) have been extensively evaluated in trials and also in clinical practice. TIO/OLO FDC (5/5 μg), recently approved for the treatment of COPD, has been thoroughly assessed for its efficacy and safety in COPD.

Since the combination TIO/OLO is now approved for first line therapy in COPD it is necessary to evaluate the evidence accumulated about its efficacy and safety in these patients. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to assess the comparative efficacy, in terms of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (trough FEV 1), quality of life with St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), dyspnea (Mahler Transition Dyspnoea Index focal score), exercise capacity, use of rescue medication and safety outcomes of TIO/OLO in combination, either administered in separate or same inhaler, versus the mono-components or any other active comparator (inhaled), in adult patients with COPD.

### Concomitant use of ipratropium and tiotropium in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114vA527]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the current data evaluating the efficacy and safety of ipratropium used in combination with tiotropium in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Data Sources

A literature search using MEDLINE (1966-August 2012) and EMBASE (1973-August 2012) was conducted using the search terms ipratropium, tiotropium, combination drug therapy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. References of identified articles were reviewed for additional relevant citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles regarding the concomitant use of ipratropium and tiotropium were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Two prospective randomized controlled trials have demonstrated increases in bronchodilation with ipratropium when added to maintenance tiotropium therapy, suggesting potential benefits during short-term, combined use. One study reported significantly higher peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) responses with both ipratropium (230 mL) and fenoterol (315 mL) compared to placebo (178 mL) when added to maintenance tiotropium. The peak response with fenoterol was significantly higher than with ipratropium (FEV(1) difference = 84 mL). Another study reported a mean difference in FEV(1) of 81 mL (95% CI 27 to 136) with albuterol versus placebo and a mean difference in FEV(1) of 68 mL (95% CI 3 to 132) with ipratropium versus placebo. The difference between albuterol and ipratropium when added to maintenance tiotropium was not significant. One large observational study reported a significantly higher risk of acute urinary retention in individuals receiving combination therapy with a short- and long-acting anticholinergic agent compared to those receiving monotherapy (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.71). Individuals at highest risk were men and those with evidence of benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Conclusions

While ipratropium may provide spirometric improvements in lung function for patients receiving tiotropium maintenance therapy, the clinical significance of these improvements has not been documented and the risk of anticholinergic adverse effects is increased with combination therapy. Further studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of concomitant ipratropium and tiotropium are warranted before combination use can be recommended for select patients.

### The tiotropium safety and performance in respimat trial (TIOSPIR), a large scale, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial-design and rationale [^113tTnfG]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Tiotropium bromide is an effective therapy for COPD patients. Comparing across programs tiotropium Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler was at least as efficacious as tiotropium HandiHaler®, however, concerns have been raised about tiotropium's safety when given via Respimat®.

Methods

The TIOSPIR® trial (NCT01126437) compares the safety and efficacy of tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg once daily (marketed) and 2.5 μg once daily (investigational) with tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μ once daily (marketed). The hypotheses to be tested are 1). that tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg once daily and Respimat® 2.5 μg once daily are non-inferior to HandiHaler® in terms of all-cause mortality, and 2). that tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg once daily is superior to HandiHaler® in terms of time to first exacerbation. A spirometry substudy evaluates the bronchodilator efficacy. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, double dummy, event-driven, parallel group study. Participants can use any background treatment for COPD except inhaled anticholinergic agents. The study encompasses a wide range of COPD patients, e.g. patients with stable cardiac diseases including arrhythmia can be included. Clinical sites are international and include both primary care as well as specialists.

Results

To date, over 17,000 participants have been randomized from over 1200 sites in 50 countries with an anticipated treatment duration of 2–3 years.

Conclusion

TIOSPIR® will provide precise estimates of the relative safety and efficacy of the Respimat® and HandiHaler® formulations of tiotropium, assess potential dose-dependence of important outcomes and provide information on the clinical epidemiology of COPD in a large international patient cohort.

### Efficacy and safety of tiotropium and olodaterol in COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114oFaPE]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting bronchodilators are the cornerstone of pharmacologic treatment of COPD. The new combination of long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium (TIO) and long acting beta-agonists (LABA) olodaterol (OLO) has been introduced as fist line therapy for COPD. This article analyses the evidence of efficacy and safety of the TIO/OLO combination.

Methods

A systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) with a period of treatment of at least 6 weeks, in patients with COPD confirmed by spirometry, comparing combined treatment with TIO/OLO (approved doses only), with any of the mono-components or any other active comparator administered as an inhalator.

Results

A total of 10 Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified (N = 10,918). TIO/OLO significantly improved trough FEV 1 from baseline to week 12 versus TIO, OLO and LABA/ICS (0.06 L, 0.09 L and between 0.04 and 0.05 L, respectively). TIO/OLO improved transitional dyspnea index (TDI) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) compared with mono-components, with patients more likely to achieve clinically important improvements in TDI (risk ratio [RR]: 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.07, 1.28] versus TIO and RR: 1.14, 95%CI: [1.01, 1.28] versus OLO) and in SGRQ (RR: 1.21, 95%CI: [1.12, 1.30] versus TIO and RR: 1.28, 95%CI: [1.18, 1.40] versus OLO). Patients treated with TIO/OLO showed a significant reduction in the use of rescue medication and no significant differences in frequency of general and serious adverse events were observed between TIO/OLO and mono-components.

Conclusions

Treatment with TIO/OLO provided significant improvements in lung function versus mono-components and LABA/ICS with more patients achieving significant improvements in dyspnea and health status. No differences in adverse events were observed compared with other active treatments.

### Comprehensive assessment of the safety of olodaterol 5 mcg in the respimatdevice for maintenance treatment of COPD: comparison with the long-acting β-agonist formoterol [^113YAmYE]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This analysis included pooled data from two replicate, multicentre, double-blind, phase III studies of olodaterol (5 µg QD and 10 µg QD via Respimat ®) compared to formoterol (12 µg BID dry powder inhalation) or placebo over 48 weeks (1222.13, NCT00793624; 1222.14, NCT00796653). Both devices (the olodaterol Respimat ® and the formoterol dry powder inhaler) were used together with the respective placebo device (double-dummy administration). The blinded formoterol study medication contained Foradil ®. The studies included patients with moderate to very severe COPD (GOLD 2–4) who were aged ≥ 40 years and were current or ex-smokers (with a smoking history > 10 pack-years). Patients with a history of asthma were excluded. With the exception of LABAs, patients continued with their existing COPD maintenance treatment, including short-acting muscarinic antagonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, corticosteroids and xanthines. All patients were provided with salbutamol as rescue medication. Full details of the study methodology have been published elsewhere. In total across the two studies, 1838 patients were randomised to treatment (225 to placebo, 227 to olodaterol 5 µg, 225 to olodaterol 10 µg and 227 to formoterol 12 µg in study 1222.13; 235 to placebo, 232 to olodaterol 5 µg, 234 to olodaterol 10 µg and 233 to formoterol 12 µg in study 1222.14). This analysis focuses on the licensed dose of olodaterol (5 µg QD via Respimat ®).

After a baseline visit, patients attended study visits following 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40 and 48 weeks of treatment. AEs were recorded throughout the study, irrespective of investigator-reported causality.

Ethics

The studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and local regulations. The protocols were approved by the authorities and ethics committees of the respective institutions, and signed informed consent was obtained from all patients.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to investigate different dosing regimens of olodaterol delivered via respimat® in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma [^115T9kah]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Daily data on asthma symptoms, night-time awakenings, study medication use during treatment period, ICS medication use, amount of rescue medication (salbutamol) use, and morning and evening PEF and FEV 1 were recorded using an electronic peak flow meter with integral patient diary and reviewed by the investigator at each visit. The Asthma Control Questionnaire was completed at screening and weeks 0, 3, 8, 13 and 15, relative to study baseline.

Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were monitored throughout the trial at each patient visit. Vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram and laboratory tests were also monitored throughout the study, and reported as AEs if they were not associated with a symptom or a diagnosis already reported as an AE.

As-needed use of ICS taken with a bronchodilator for symptom relief

As-needed ICSs were evaluated with rapid-acting bronchodilators in three different regimens: 1) as-needed ICS plus formoterol (LABA) in a single inhaler, 2) as-needed ICS plus albuterol (SABA) in a single inhaler, and 3) as-needed ICS plus albuterol in separate inhalers.

Low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief was investigated in six randomized controlled trials. As-needed ICS–formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations by 60–64% compared with as-needed SABA. Compared with regular ICS, the severe exacerbation risk with as-needed ICS–formoterol was similar in blinded studies or lower in open-label pragmatic trials, possibly related to poorer adherence to regular ICS. In the meta-analysis, the risk of emergency department presentation/hospitalization was 37% lower with as-needed ICS–formoterol versus regular ICS plus as-needed SABA.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^11165v76]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 548 patients recruited from 41 study centers in the United States from December 2008 to September 2009 were screened and 226 patients were randomized using a validated system and received at least one dose of study medication; 222 randomized patients were treated with ALB-HFA, and 219 with CVT-MDI (107 received ALB-HFA, then CVT-MDI and 112 received CVT-MDI, then ALB-HFA). During the crossover period, 14 patients prematurely discontinued study medication; three patients had AEs leading to discontinuation (one taking ALB-HFA, two taking CVT-MDI), and only 3% of patients had missing data. Patient disposition is presented in Fig. 1, and demographics and baseline characteristics in Table 1.

### Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) added to combination long-acting beta2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids (LABA / ICS) versus LABA / ICS for adults with asthma [^115d6ot2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Maintenance treatment with long-acting beta2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS) can relieve asthma symptoms and reduce the frequency of exacerbations, but there are limited treatment options for people who do not gain control on combination LABA/ICS. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are a class of inhaled drug which have been effective for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are now becoming available for people with asthma to take alongside their LABA/ICS inhaler.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) to combination long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in adults whose asthma is not well controlled by LABA/ICS.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to January 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO trials portal, and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration. Studies met the inclusion criteria if they compared LAMA as an add-on to LABA/ICS versus LABA/ICS alone for adults with asthma. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. Primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), validated measures of asthma control, and serious adverse events (including mortality).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened searches and independently extracted details on risk of bias and numerical data. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) using a random-effects model. We rated all outcomes using GRADE.

Main Results

We found four double-blind, double-dummy trials comparing LAMA to placebo, including 1197 people with asthma taking combination LABA/ICS. One of the trials was designed to study glycopyrronium bromide but was withdrawn prior to enrolment, and the other three all studied tiotropium bromide (mostly 5 µg once daily via Respimat) over 48 to 52 weeks. People in the trials had a mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 55% of their predicted value, indicating severe asthma. People randomised to take tiotropium add-on had fewer exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than those continuing to take LABA/ICS alone, but the confidence intervals did not rule out no difference (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence). Over 48 weeks, 328 out of 1000 people taking their usual LABA/ICS would have to take oral corticosteroids for an exacerbation compared with 271 if they took tiotropium as well (95% CI 218 to 333 per 1000). Analyses comparing the number of exacerbations per patient in each group (rate ratio) and the time until first exacerbation (hazard ratio) were in keeping with the main result. Quality of life, as measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) was no better for those taking tiotropium add-on than for those taking LABA/ICS alone when considered in light of the 0.5 minimal clinically important difference on the scale (MD 0.09, 95% CI - 0.03 to 0.20), and evidence for whether tiotropium increased or decreased serious adverse events in this population was inconsistent (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.47; I(2) = 76%). Within the secondary outcomes, exacerbations requiring hospital admission were too rare to tell whether tiotropium was beneficial over LABA/ICS alone. There was high quality evidence showing benefits to lung function (trough FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC)) and potentially small benefits to asthma control. People taking tiotropium add-on were less likely to experience non-serious adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Tiotropium add-on may have additional benefits over LABA/ICS alone in reducing the need for rescue oral steroids in people with severe asthma. The effect was imprecise, and there was no evidence for other LAMA preparations. Possible benefits on quality of life were negligible, and evidence for the effect on serious adverse events was inconsistent. There are likely to be small added benefits for tiotropium Respimat 5 µg daily on lung function and asthma control over LABA/ICS alone and fewer non-serious adverse events. The benefit of tiotropium add-on on the frequency of hospital admission is still unknown, despite year-long trials. Ongoing and future trials should clearly describe participants' background medications to help clinicians judge how the findings relate to stepwise care. If studies test LAMAs other than tiotropium Respimat for asthma, they should be at least six months long and use accepted and validated outcomes to allow comparisons of the safety and effectiveness between different preparations.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### A randomised dose-ranging study of tiotropium respimat® in children with symptomatic asthma despite inhaled corticosteroids [^11739Bex]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Results

In total, 101 patients were randomised to receive study treatment. Seventy-six patients received tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg, 74 received tiotropium Respimat® 2.5 μg, 75 received tiotropium Respimat® 1.25 μg and 76 received placebo Respimat® (Additional file 1: Figure S1). One hundred patients completed all three treatment periods, with one patient discontinuing from the study prematurely (consent withdrawn for non-AE-related reasons during the first 4-week treatment period while receiving tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg); this patient was excluded from the full analysis set.

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics

Most patients were male (68.3%), with a mean age of 8.8 years and a mean duration of asthma of 4.5 years (Table 1). Only 5.9% of patients had been exposed to household/second-hand smoking. Approximately two-thirds of patients had concomitant diseases at screening (63.4%), the most common being allergic rhinitis (53.5%).

### Real-world effectiveness of early intervention with fixed-dose tiotropium / olodaterol vs tiotropium in Japanese patients with COPD: a high-dimensional propensity score-matched cohort analysis [^116BdFJp]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Baseline covariates

The hdPS for the probability of initiating tiotropium/olodaterol compared with tiotropium monotherapy was computed using logistic regression and included predefined demographic variables of age, sex, index calendar year, hospital size (< 199 beds, 200–499 beds, ≥ 500 beds), concomitant medications and comorbidities, number of COPD exacerbations, all-cause hospitalization, hospitalization due to respiratory conditions, and covariates identified by the hdPS multi-step algorithm from relevant data fields related to disease (ICD-10 codes), inpatient and outpatient health claim codes, and MDV laboratory codes during the baseline period. The final hdPS was then used to match one new user of tiotropium/olodaterol to one new user of tiotropium monotherapy with the same propensity score caliper of 1%.

Exposure

Exposure groups were identified according to the brand name of the first two prescriptions of each drug within 60 days. Each prescription was assumed to be sufficient for 14 days for Spiolto Respimat 28 puffs, and for 30 days for Spiriva Handihaler 18 µg, Spiriva 2.5 µg/Respimat 60 puffs, and Spiolto Respimat 28 puffs and 60 puffs. A gap of 14 days between the end of supply of the first prescription and the start of a subsequent prescription was allowed.

### Impact of prior and concurrent medication on exacerbation risk with long-acting bronchodilators in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a post hoc analysis [^1119F7Gz]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

To better understand the role of LAMA/LABA, LAMA, and LABA therapies on exacerbation risk, we aimed to explore the potential clinical impact of concurrent inhaled therapy on exacerbation prevention afforded by different bronchodilator types in symptomatic patients with COPD at low-risk of exacerbations using integrated data from two large 24-week, PBO-controlled bronchodilator trials. Subgroup analyses based on existing maintenance treatment, ICS use and as-needed albuterol use were performed to improve understanding of how these factors may influence changes in lung function and exacerbation prevention for each bronchodilator type versus PBO, and to explore the inter-dependency of lung function improvement and the magnitude of exacerbation prevention.

### Safety of tiotropium / olodaterol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: pooled analysis of three large, 52-week, randomized clinical trials [^115oMrUy]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

An extensive clinical trial program supports the efficacy and safety of tiotropium/olodaterol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We examined the safety of tiotropium/olodaterol compared with tiotropium in a large population of patients, focusing on cardiovascular and respiratory events.

Methods

Patients (n = 9942) who received once-daily tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 μg or tiotropium 5 μg (via Respimat ®) in TONADO 1 & 2 and DYNAGITO were included. The number of patients and exposure-adjusted rate of events are presented for adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, and cardiovascular and respiratory events.

Findings

Fewer patients discontinued due to AEs with tiotropium/olodaterol (5.9%) versus tiotropium (7.9%; rate ratio [RR] 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.84). There was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs, SAEs, cardiovascular AEs or central nervous system vascular AEs between treatments. Incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were 2.11 per 100 patient-years with tiotropium/olodaterol and 2.22 with tiotropium (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.72–1.25), and incidences of fatal MACE (including death with undetermined cause) were 0.91 and 1.00 per 100 patient-years with tiotropium/olodaterol and tiotropium, respectively (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.60–1.37). Respiratory AEs were generally balanced between treatment groups.

Conclusions

These results provide robust evidence that the benefits of tiotropium/olodaterol versus tiotropium are not at the expense of an increased risk of safety events. The combination is a suitable option for patients with COPD, even in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Combination bronchodilator therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114UzNK2]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Consideration of potential adverse effects of LAMA/LABA combinations

The safety profiles of both LAMAs and LABAs are well understood. However, when combining two entities, it is important to understand both the similarities and differences in adverse events. Given that both muscarinic antagonists and β 2 -agonists can have a detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system, these adverse events need to be monitored carefully in development programs for combination products. Initial results suggest that the cardiovascular safety profile of glycopyrronium plus indacaterol is similar to placebo, with no clinically significant differences observed versus placebo, and, to date, no safety concerns have been identified with tiotropium plus olodaterol. Free combinations of LAMA/LABA also seem well tolerated. No differences in blood pressure and pulse rate were observed with tiotropium plus salmeterol versus single-agent therapies and the meta-analysis of tiotropium plus formoterol data reported no differences in cumulative incidence of adverse events for the combination (33.2%) versus tiotropium alone (36.0%), stating that drug-related severe adverse events and cardiac effects were relatively rare.

### Tiotropium bromide inhalation spray (Spiriva respimat) [^113tiEe8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

An interaction study with tiotropium (14.4 mcg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes) and cimetidine 400 mg three times daily or ranitidine 300 mg once-daily was conducted. Concomitant administration of cimetidine with tiotropium resulted in a 20% increase in the AUC0-4h, a 28% decrease in the renal clearance of tiotropium and no significant change in the Cmaxand amount excreted in urine over 96 hours. Co-administration of tiotropium with ranitidine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium.

Common concomitant medications (LABA, ICS) used by patients with COPD were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium. Similarly, common concomitant medications (LABA, ICS+LABA combinations, oral corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers) used by patients with asthma were not found to alter the exposure to tiotropium.

### Olodaterol respimat inhalation spray (striverdi respimat) [^111npnSJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Instructions for Administering STRIVERDI RESPIMAT

It is important for patients to understand how to correctly administer STRIVERDI RESPIMAT inhalation spray using the STRIVERDI RESPIMAT inhaler. Instruct patients that STRIVERDI RESPIMAT inhalation spray should only be administered via the STRIVERDI RESPIMAT inhaler and the STRIVERDI RESPIMAT inhaler should not be used for administering other medications.

Instruct patients that priming STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is essential to ensure appropriate content of the medication in each actuation.

When using the unit for the first time, the STRIVERDI RESPIMAT cartridge is inserted into the STRIVERDI RESPIMAT inhaler and the unit is primed. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT patients are to actuate the inhaler toward the ground until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times. The unit is then considered primed and ready for use. If not used for more than 3 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler once to prepare the inhaler for use. If not used for more than 21 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times to prepare the inhaler for use.

### Is aclidinium alone or combined with a LABA a rational choice for symptomatic COPD patients? [^115Jgk7C]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

In case of lack of control a step-up therapy should be considered.

In any case it should be taken into account that the literature evidence suggests that in patients with mild airflow obstruction according to the GOLD spirometric classification and relatively moderate symptoms, LAMA monotherapy (for example, with aclidinium bromide; other LAMA commercially available are glycopyrronium bromide, tiotropium and umeclidinium) is often sufficient to provide adequate symptom control. In the same type of patients, but with more significant symptoms, the use of "double bronchodilation" with LAMA/LABA FDC (such as aclidinium + formoterol; other LAMA/LABA FDC commercially available are indacaterol/glycopyrronium, olodaterol/tiotropium, vilanterol/umeclidinium) can be considered. This LAMA/LABA is also preferred in patients with moderate-to-severe "disease impact", including patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation and significant symptoms; patients with moderate-to-severe disease, who remain symptomatic despite monotherapy; patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms, but without frequent exacerbations. The use of a LAMA can be also considered as add-on therapy to LABA or ICS/LABA in case of very severe "disease impact", e.g. in patients with severe spirometric obstruction suffering from frequent exacerbations. In these patients, with high eosinophil count but without history of allergy and asthma, a LAMA/LABA combination can be proposed as first choice.

### Efficacy and safety of tiotropium and olodaterol in COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115numGQ]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

TIO/OLO is an effective and safe treatment for patients with COPD of any degree of severity. The improvements obtained in lung function are superior to those observed with monotherapies or with LABA/ICS combination. These improvements also translate with different intensity to improvements in other patient-reported outcomes.

### The tiotropium safety and performance in respimat® (TIOSPIR ®) trial: spirometry outcomes [^111d7aWJ]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Spirometry substudy

The spirometry substudy was a predefined analysis which covered the duration of the study. The objective was to demonstrate that there were no differences between the interventions by testing the noninferiority of Respimat® 2.5 and 5 μg versus HandiHaler® 18 μg.

In the spirometry substudy population, trough FEV 1 and FVC were measured at baseline and every 24 weeks (± 14 days) for the duration of the trial (Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168). The pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were done in the clinic at a single time point (in triplicate) prior to the daily dosing of tiotropium, and approximately 24 hours after dosing on the previous day (between 7:00 and 10:00 am). Spirometers and their use, including daily calibration, met American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria. The highest FEV 1 and FVC values from an acceptable maneuver were recorded regardless of whether they came from different spirometric maneuvers or from the same maneuver (preferably with a maximum of five attempts, but up to eight attempts were allowed). Predicted normal FEV 1 values were calculated for patients using the European Community for Coal and Steel (ECCS) equations.

A number of medication restrictions were set on pulmonary function days for the substudy. Short-acting beta-adrenergic bronchodilators could not be taken for at least 8 hours prior to PFTs, and long-acting beta-adrenergic bronchodilators or combination beta-adrenergic bronchodilator/inhaled steroid could not be taken for at least 24 hours prior to PFTs. The morning dose of inhaled steroids could not be taken prior to PFTs and the morning dose of the study medication could not be taken prior to test-day pre-dose PFT. Short-acting (twice-daily or more frequent administration) theophylline preparations required at least a 24-hour washout, while long-acting (once-daily) theophylline preparation required at least a 48-hour washout.

### Long-term safety of tiotropium / olodaterol in older patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD in the TONADO® studies [^113Zp8N2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Age-related changes in receptor populations and nervous control mechanisms within the airways may interfere with the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments, such as bronchodilators. Older individuals require lower doses of methacholine to initiate bronchoconstriction, signifying increased bronchial reactivity. However, bronchodilator responsiveness may decline with increasing age, as shown by a longer onset of bronchodilator action in this population, potentially due to age-related dysfunction in β 2 -receptor activity within the airways. Data from human studies on potential age-related changes in airway muscarinic receptors are limited, and their clinical significance in older patients has not yet been identified. Thus, the efficacy of tiotropium in patients aged ≥ 80 years was shown to be comparable with that in patients aged < 80 years, with a similar safety profile across the age groups. Additionally, tiotropium/olodaterol demonstrated significant improvements from baseline in lung function and symptomatic response across patients of all age groups in a subgroup analysis of the TONADO® and OTEMTO® studies. Importantly, no safety concerns were found in elderly patients receiving tiotropium/olodaterol versus the monocomponents or placebo.

Side effects associated with the use of β 2 -agonists increase dose-proportionally and may increase with advancing age, particularly with the concomitant use of other drugs in patients with comorbidities, such as the elderly. The most common side effect associated with the use of anticholinergics is dry mouth, which in elderly patients can impact the ability to communicate, and may lead to secondary events such as predisposing to malnutrition and increasing the risk of respiratory infections. Nevertheless, in the present analysis, no increase in the proportion of patients experiencing dry mouth was observed with tiotropium/olodaterol compared with the monocomponents.

A strength of this analysis is that the large size of the TONADO® studies permits the analysis of older patients, including patients up to 97 years of age. Limitations include the exclusion of patients with very severe or unstable conditions from the TONADO® studies; therefore, these data may not be representative of elderly patients with extreme individual conditions encountered in clinical practice. Also, due to a low number of patients in the oldest age group (> 85 years), this group was too small for statistical analysis. Additionally, as this is a post hoc safety analysis, these results are not confirmatory.

Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) — formulations and eligibility: Add-on LAMA can be prescribed in a separate inhaler (tiotropium) or as a combination 'triple' inhaler for patients aged ≥ 18 years — beclometasone-formoterol-glycopyrronium, fluticasone furoate-vilanterol-umeclidinium, or mometasone-indacaterol-glycopyrronium — if asthma is not well controlled with medium or high-dose ICS-LABA. Adding LAMA to ICS-LABA modestly improves lung function (Evidence A).

### Efficacy and safety of tiotropium and olodaterol in COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114iAnTT]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Regarding safety, no differences were observed in the frequency of general and serious adverse effects between TIO/OLO FDC and the mono-components; thus reassuring the excellent safety profile of this combination.

The strengths of the review are those typical of a systematic review: exhaustive search for studies, a reasonably high number of available studies, studies of high methodological quality, possibility of performing a meta-analysis, low heterogeneity and high consistency between studies. However, as limitations we highlight that all clinical trials were performed by the same pharmaceutical company, common limitation when a drug is reviewed by a meta-analysis. Another limitation is that it was not possible to do a subgroup analysis according to the patient's baseline level of severity and a different design related to variable duration of clinical trials (between 6 and 24 weeks).

### A systematic review of comparative studies of tiotropium respimat® and tiotropium handiHaler® in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does inhaler choice matter? [^113mVPzG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review evaluated pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety results from published studies of tiotropium Respimat® and tiotropium HandiHaler® at the licensed doses (5 and 18 μg), respectively, with the aim of summarizing evidence that might inform the choice of tiotropium inhaler in clinical practice.

The results of several randomized dose-finding studies and the TIOSPIR® study have demonstrated that tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg has a pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety profile that is comparable with that of tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg. Results from post-hoc and pooled analyses provide further confirmation that overall lung function, exacerbation, quality of life and safety outcomes are equivalent for the two tiotropium inhalers across a range of patient subtypes. The efficacy and safety of tiotropium, when administered by either Respimat® or HandiHaler®, is supported by previously published systematic reviews.

There has been debate about the safety of inhaled anticholinergics and, in particular, the cardiac safety of tiotropium administered by Respimat®, which was triggered by meta-analysis and database analysis that reported an increase in mortality in patients treated with tiotropium Respimat®. The meta-analysis examined data from five randomized, controlled trials of tiotropium Respimat® and found an increased risk of mortality compared with placebo. However, there was no direct comparison with tiotropium HandiHaler®, and the analysis was limited by differences in the populations studied, the tiotropium dose used, and length of follow-up. The investigators also noted that low event rates precluded precise estimates of risk. The authors of the Dutch database analysis commented that it was unclear whether the apparent association between the use of tiotropium Respimat® and an increased risk of death was causal or due to residual confounding by COPD severity. One source of confounding could be the substantial differences in the population treated with tiotropium HandiHaler® and tiotropium Respimat®. Although the analysis was adjusted for several factors, the adjustment was incomplete, and a channelling effect towards more severe patients being treated with tiotropium Respimat® was described by the same group.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^114bepu7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

Co-primary efficacy endpoints of CVT-MDI and ALB-HFA were compared using mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM). The MMRM model has treatment, period, day, and the interaction between treatment and day as fixed effects, test-day baseline value as a covariate, and patient as random effect. In the MMRM model, day refers to the start (day 1) or end (day 29) of 4 weeks of treatment. In the results section, only results for day 29 will be presented. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to address multiple comparisons. The null hypothesis for FEV 1 AUC 0–6 response was tested first (alpha = 0.025, one-sided); if this null hypothesis was rejected, the null hypothesis for peak FEV 1 response was tested next (alpha = 0.025, one-sided).

The primary efficacy analysis was performed on a modified full analysis set (FAS). The FAS consisted of all patients receiving study medication, who were documented to have taken at least one dose of investigational drug, and who had no missing test-day baseline values or missing responses for FEV 1 AUC 0–6 and peak FEV 1 after 4 weeks of treatment. Seven patients who reported that their study medication devices were working improperly, and whose treatment blind was broken prior to database lock, were excluded from all efficacy analyses.

A post-hoc analysis was also performed on endpoints related to the co-primary endpoints. The MMRM model described above was used to analyze the ratio of FEV 1 AUC 0–6 response to test-day baseline FEV 1, and the ratio of peak FEV 1 response to test-day baseline FEV 1.

### Albuterol sulfate (albuterol) [^116STjwk]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of albuterol and other oral sympathomimetic agents is not recommended since such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. This recommendation does not preclude the judicious use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic stimulant type in patients receiving albuterol. Such concomitant use, however, should be individualized and not given on a routine basis. If regular coadministration is required, then alternative therapy should be considered.

Monamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants

Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.

Beta-Blockers

Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

Diuretics

The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of nonpotassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics.

Digoxin

Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^113HUsRa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with asthma require frequent rescue medication for acute symptoms despite appropriate controller therapies. Thus, determining the most effective relief regimen is important in the management of more severe asthma. This study's objective was to evaluate whether ipratropium bromide/albuterol metered-dose inhaler (CVT-MDI) provides more effective acute relief of bronchospasm in moderate-to-severe asthma than albuterol hydrofluoroalkaline (ALB-HFA) alone after 4 weeks.

Methods

In this double-blind, crossover study, patients who had been diagnosed with asthma for ≥ 1 year were randomized to two sequences of study medication "as needed" for symptom relief (1–7 day washout before second 4-week treatment period): CVT-MDI/ALB-HFA or ALB-HFA/CVT-MDI. On days 1 and 29 of each sequence, 6-hour serial spirometry was performed after administration of the study drug. Co-primary endpoints were FEV 1 area under the curve (AUC 0–6) and peak (post-dose) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) response (change from test day baseline) after 4 weeks. The effects of "as needed" treatment with ALB-HFA/CVT-MDI were analyzed using mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM).

Results

A total of 226 patients, ≥ 18 years old, with inadequately controlled, moderate-to-severe asthma were randomized. The study met both co-primary endpoints demonstrating a statistically significant treatment benefit of CVT-MDI versus ALB-HFA. FEV 1 AUC 0-6h response was 167 mL for ALB-HFA, 252 mL for CVT-MDI (p < 0.0001); peak FEV 1 response was 357 mL for ALB-HFA, 434 mL for CVT-MDI (p < 0.0001). Adverse events were comparable across groups.

Conclusions

CVT-MDI significantly improved acute bronchodilation over ALB-HFA alone after 4 weeks of "as-needed" use for symptom relief, with a similar safety profile. This suggests additive bronchodilator effects of β 2 -agonist and anticholinergic treatment in moderate-to-severe, symptomatic asthma.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

ATROVENT HFA has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, oral and inhaled steroids commonly used in the treatment of COPD. With the exception of albuterol, there are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of ATROVENT HFA and these drugs with respect to safety and effectiveness.

Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of ATROVENT HFA with other anticholinergic-containing drugs (7.1)

7.1	Anticholinergic Agents

There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid coadministration of ATROVENT HFA with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5)].

Table 4
LABA and LAMA combinations under investigation: ongoing trials

ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for Phase II and III trials of fixed-dose combinations of LAMA + LABA. Access date: 12/05/12.

LABA = long-acting β 2 -agonist; LAMA = long-acting muscarinic antagonist; AE = adverse event; TDI = Transition Dyspnea Index; FDA = Food and Drug Administration.

Clinical Phase II trials have investigated the optimal dosing for olodaterol added to a fixed dose of tiotropium and for tiotropium added to a fixed dose of olodaterol. Significant improvements in peak FEV 1 were demonstrated with tiotropium/olodaterol 5/2 μg (p = 0.008), 5/5 μg (p = 0.012), and 5/10 μg (p < 0.0001) versus tiotropium monotherapy. Significant improvements were also seen in trough FEV 1 with tiotropium/olodaterol 5/10 μg versus tiotropium monotherapy (p = 0.034), and with all doses of the combination tested versus olodaterol monotherapy, with evidence of dose ordering (Table 3).

There is little information available from studies of aclidinium plus formoterol; only initial results of preclinical cardiac safety in beagle dogs have been reported.

Of the LAMA/LABA FDCs currently under investigation, tiotropium plus olodaterol, umeclidinium plus vilanterol, aclidinium plus formoterol, and glycopyrronium plus indacaterol have the largest Phase III programs, focusing on efficacy, safety, exacerbations, exercise, and dyspnea (Table 4). The development program for umeclidinium plus vilanterol involves four large pivotal trials, one large safety study, and two studies assessing exercise endurance, with two ongoing trials investigating lung function and efficacy. Phase III studies of glycopyrronium plus indacaterol will compare the combination with a range of comparators, including fluticasone/salmeterol combination and tiotropium, across a variety of end points (FEV 1, exacerbations, TDI, and safety). The tiotropium plus olodaterol development program includes two main registration trials, three examining exercise and functional capacity, one examining long-term safety, and a comprehensive lung function trial.

LAMAs for asthma — background and scope are outlined. LAMAs comprise a pharmacologic class of long-acting bronchodilators, and the role of LAMAs in the management of asthma was not addressed in Expert Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. The Expert Panel examined the harms and benefits of LAMAs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma and addressed three key questions, but it did not examine the role of LAMA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years. With the exception of one study that examined the LAMA umeclidinium, the RCTs reviewed by the Expert Panel used tiotropium bromide, and at the time this report was written tiotropium bromide (Respimat) was the only formulation of LAMA with US FDA approval for asthma treatment. Because the majority of LAMA studies used a comparative efficacy design rather than an effectiveness design, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood.

### Long-term safety of tiotropium / olodaterol in older patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD in the TONADO® studies [^115cJKWQ]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prevalence of COPD is projected to rise over the next few decades owing to the aging of the world's population and the increased long-term exposure to risk factors for this disease –.

Long-acting bronchodilators are recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for maintenance therapy of patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD. Tiotropium is an established once-daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) that improves lung function and patient-reported outcomes such as dyspnea and quality of life, and reduces exacerbations in patients with COPD. Olodaterol is a more recently approved and marketed long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) that provides 24-h bronchodilation and symptomatic benefits in patients with COPD. The added benefits of combining tiotropium and olodaterol as a fixed-dose combination (FDC), and the long-term efficacy and safety of tiotropium/olodaterol treatment over 52 weeks versus the monocomponents, were demonstrated in the Phase III TONADO® 1 and 2 trials.

The prevalence of COPD increases with age, and older age is associated with poor prognosis and an increased risk of mortality in patients with COPD, particularly in those aged 80 years and older. Elderly patients with COPD may be at increased risk of adverse events (AEs) because of a general decrease in protective organ functions, and an increased incidence of comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular (CV), neurologic, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and infectious diseases. In addition, those taking multiple medications due to comorbid conditions are at increased risk of drug–drug interactions –. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the safety of COPD medications is affected by aging. Inhaled therapies are recommended by GOLD for patients with COPD, irrespective of age. No age-specific dose reductions of olodaterol, tiotropium, or tiotropium/olodaterol are required based on pharmacologic data –. Nevertheless, there is a need for further information on the efficacy and safety of inhaled therapies in the population of vulnerable older patients, or patients over the age of 80, as highlighted in the latest American Thoracic Society guidelines.
