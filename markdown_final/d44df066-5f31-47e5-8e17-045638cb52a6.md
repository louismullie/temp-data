## Question

Menopause symptoms in woman 55 years old. Fsh was 1.0

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level of 1.0 IU/L in a 55-year-old woman who is experiencing menopausal symptoms, and what the appropriate next steps for diagnosis and management are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether menopause is a clinical diagnosis and how much weight to give a single FSH value. Then, I should verify what FSH patterns are expected in normal menopause and whether 1.0 IU/L fits that pattern. Next, I will consider potential explanations for a profoundly low FSH in this context, including assay error, exogenous hormone use, and central causes like hypopituitarism. After that, I should outline a practical, guideline-based workup and immediate management of symptoms. Finally, I will synthesize a clear interpretation and plan with appropriate caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic principle: menopause is a clinical diagnosis defined by 12 months of amenorrhea in the appropriate age range, and hormone testing is not required to make the diagnosis in women with a uterus. Moreover, a single FSH value is not reliable for staging the menopausal transition because of substantial within-person variability and overlap across stages, so I should not anchor on a solitary FSH result here [^116fv8Zt] [^115z9tT1] [^116psjq3].

> Wait, let me verify what FSH should look like in normal menopause physiology. As ovarian feedback wanes, FSH typically rises into the menopausal range, with STRAW+10 describing late menopausal transition and early postmenopause as having FSH greater than about 25 IU/L, and many laboratories operationalize postmenopausal FSH as roughly 25–40 IU/L or higher. A value of 1.0 IU/L is therefore physiologically discordant with expected postmenopausal hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and should prompt me to double-check the result and the clinical context before concluding anything definitive [^116xD4wk] [^115jedhD] [^112axZTg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider explanations for an unexpectedly low FSH. First, I need to check for laboratory error or a preanalytical issue and repeat FSH with estradiol and LH on a fresh sample, ideally using the same assay for consistency. Second, I should confirm whether the patient is using any hormonal therapy that suppresses gonadotropins, including combined estrogen–progestin therapy, progestin-only methods, or even some complementary products, because exogenous hormones can lower FSH into the premenopausal range despite ovarian failure. Third, I must consider central hypogonadism. In a postmenopausal woman, the absence of appropriately elevated FSH and LH strongly suggests gonadotrope dysfunction, so I should evaluate for hypopituitarism with a pituitary-directed assessment if the repeat testing confirms low gonadotropins [^112GZptU] [^115Md3hA] [^113UB9pj].

> I will now examine the differential for central causes if the repeat FSH and LH remain inappropriately low. Pituitary adenoma or other sellar lesions, prior pituitary surgery or radiation, infiltrative disease, apoplexy, or traumatic brain injury can impair gonadotrope function; I should obtain a pituitary MRI and screen other pituitary axes with morning cortisol, free T4, and prolactin, recognizing that low gonadotropins in a postmenopausal woman are sufficient to diagnose central hypogonadism when not on hormone therapy. But wait, what if the low FSH reflects a transient post-surgical or post-chemotherapy effect? STRAW+10 notes pelvic surgery can transiently raise FSH, so I should also remember that transient perturbations can occur, though a value of 1.0 IU/L would still be atypical for that scenario and should still trigger repeat testing and clinical correlation [^112GZptU] [^117GPcpR] [^115Md3hA].

> Next, I should review immediate management of menopausal symptoms while the diagnostic workup proceeds. For bothersome vasomotor symptoms, nonhormonal options such as SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, or cognitive behavioral therapy can be offered; if systemic estrogen is considered, I need to ensure there is no contraindication and use the lowest effective dose, ideally initiating in women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, with shared decision-making about risks and benefits. For genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen is effective and safe for most patients, and documentation of hormone levels is not required for treatment decisions. I should confirm that any unscheduled bleeding receives appropriate evaluation to exclude endometrial pathology if she is on or off therapy [^115E3niW] [^113scWk6] [^112ejpbZ] [^116fdu8w].

> Let me reconsider the assay and biological variability issues to ensure I am not overinterpreting a single value. FSH shows substantial pulsatility and intercycle variability during the menopausal transition, and no single cutoff cleanly separates pre-, peri-, and postmenopause; this is why guidelines emphasize clinical criteria and, when needed, repeat measurements rather than a one-off lab result. Therefore, repeating FSH with estradiol and LH in the same laboratory and comparing to the clinical picture is essential before labeling a central cause or assuming an artifact [^116psjq3] [^116fv8Zt] [^115z9tT1].

> Putting this together, my interpretation is that an FSH of 1.0 IU/L in a 55-year-old with menopausal symptoms is incompatible with typical postmenopausal physiology and most likely reflects either assay error, exogenous hormone suppression, or central hypogonadism. I should repeat FSH with estradiol and LH, review all medications and supplements, and if gonadotropins remain inappropriately low, pursue pituitary imaging and a broader pituitary axis evaluation. In parallel, I will treat symptoms based on severity and patient preference, using nonhormonal therapies or carefully selected hormone therapy after risk counseling, and I will not use this single FSH value to define menopausal status or to guide definitive management decisions [^112GZptU] [^113scWk6] [^116fv8Zt] [^115z9tT1].

An FSH of 1.0 IU/L in a 55-year-old woman with menopausal symptoms is **not consistent with menopause** [^116xD4wk] and suggests ongoing ovarian activity or exogenous estrogen exposure [^112GZptU]. Menopause is a clinical diagnosis of 12 months of amenorrhea [^116fv8Zt]; in women with a uterus, **FSH is not required** and can be misleading due to variability [^115z9tT1]. If the uterus is absent or cycles are unclear, repeat FSH and estradiol when off hormones for 4–6 weeks [^notfound]; **FSH < 25 IU/L** (especially 1.0 IU/L) indicates ongoing ovarian function or estrogen exposure [^116xD4wk]. Evaluate for exogenous estrogen, ovarian cysts, or pituitary disease [^112GZptU], and manage symptoms with nonhormonal options or low-dose local estrogen if needed [^1161RVZR] [^115Udhwz].

---

## Interpretation of FSH level in menopausal context

- **Normal FSH ranges**: In reproductive-age women, FSH is typically 3–20 IU/L; in perimenopause, it rises and fluctuates; in postmenopause, it is usually > 25 IU/L and often > 40 IU/L [^116xD4wk].

- **FSH of 1.0 IU/L**: This is far below the menopausal range and indicates ongoing ovarian activity or exogenous estrogen exposure [^111bzBFD].

- **Clinical significance**: An FSH of 1.0 IU/L in a 55-year-old with menopausal symptoms is inconsistent with typical menopause and warrants further evaluation [^112GZptU].

---

## Clinical guidelines for diagnosing menopause

According to the Endocrine Society and STRAW+10, **menopause is a clinical diagnosis** of 12 months of amenorrhea [^116fv8Zt]; in women with a uterus, hormone testing is not required and can be misleading [^116fv8Zt]. In women without a uterus or with unclear cycles, presumptive diagnosis may rely on vasomotor symptoms plus FSH and estradiol, but **FSH alone is insufficient** [^116psjq3].

---

## Possible explanations for low FSH in a menopausal woman

Several scenarios can explain an **FSH of 1.0 IU/L** in a 55-year-old with menopausal symptoms:

| **Possible explanation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Exogenous estrogen exposure | Hormone therapy, contraceptives, or bioidentical creams can suppress FSH [^111bzBFD] |
| Functional ovarian cyst | Ovarian cysts can produce estrogen and suppress FSH [^notfound] |
| Pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction | Central causes (e.g. hypopituitarism) can lower gonadotropins [^112GZptU] |
| Laboratory error | Rare; repeat testing is advised if results are incongruent with the clinical picture [^117GPcpR] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

Given the discrepancy, the following **diagnostic steps are recommended**:

- **Confirm clinical status**: Document menstrual history and symptoms; menopause is defined by 12 months of amenorrhea [^116fv8Zt].

- **Repeat hormone testing**: Measure FSH, LH, and estradiol after 4–6 weeks off any hormones; FSH < 25 IU/L suggests ongoing ovarian function or estrogen exposure [^112GZptU] [^111bzBFD] [^116xD4wk].

- **Evaluate for exogenous estrogen**: Review all medications, supplements, and topical products for hidden estrogen sources [^111bzBFD].

- **Imaging studies**: If central dysfunction is suspected, consider pituitary MRI; if ovarian pathology is suspected, consider pelvic ultrasound [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Symptom management**: Even with low FSH, treat vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms with nonhormonal options or local vaginal estrogen if needed [^115uKnuE] [^112ejpbZ].

- **Bone health**: Assess bone density and calcium/vitamin D intake; consider bisphosphonates or SERMs if indicated [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Evaluate and manage modifiable risk factors [^112gaeGy].

- **Continued evaluation**: If ongoing ovarian function is confirmed, continue contraception until menopause is definitively diagnosed [^115nuLeY].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

An FSH of 1.0 IU/L in a 55-year-old with menopausal symptoms is **not consistent with menopause** and suggests ongoing ovarian activity or estrogen exposure [^112GZptU]. Confirm the diagnosis clinically, repeat hormones off therapy, and evaluate for exogenous estrogen or ovarian or pituitary pathology [^111fQFew]. Manage symptoms and risks regardless of FSH, and **reassess menopausal status over time** [^116fv8Zt].

Inclusiveness of the STRAW + 10 criteria — evidence supports applicability for most women, and the staging system is applicable regardless of age, demographic, BMI, or lifestyle characteristics; the model does not use age as a criterion. However, women meeting criteria for POI/premature ovarian failure (age < 40 y with 4 mo of amenorrhea and two serum FSH levels [at least a month apart] in the menopausal range) do not easily fit this model, and the course in POI appears more variable, with studies of reproductive aging in POI considered a research priority.

Definition of menopausal stage and group assignments

Assignment to the different menopausal groups was determined following the slightly modified Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop +10 guidelines, which take systemic hormone status and self-reported menstrual cycle into account. Menstrual cycle was assessed based on the menstrual diary for 6 to 12 months. FSH and E 2 levels were immunoassayed using IMMULITE 2000 XPi (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, UK). The analytical sensitivity limit provided by the manufacture is 0.1 IU/L for FSH and 0.055 nmol/L for E 2. Intra-assay precision values for the lower end of the detection range are 6.8 ± 0.2 IU/L (mean ± SD) with 2.9% coefficient of variation (CV) for FSH and 0.33 ± 0.03 nmol/L with 9.9% CV for E 2. Corresponding precision values for higher end of the detection range are 103 ± 3.2 IU/L, CV 3.1% for FSH and 6.6 ± 0.32 nmol/L, CV 4.9% for E 2. Due to high pulsatile variability of the E 2 level, only the FSH level was used together with self-reported menstrual cycle for defining menopausal stage. For participants whose menstrual bleeding pattern was not natural, that is, they had undergone hysterectomy or were using progesterone-containing contraceptives, the group assignment was solely based on the systemic FSH level, but with a more stringent cut-off value than used for participants with natural menstrual bleeding (Table 2).

Questionnaire surveys

Three separate questionnaire surveys were conducted. The prequestionnaire in phase one assessed medical and gynecological issues, use of hormonal contraception, pelvic floor dysfunctions, and self-reported weight and height (see PDF, Supplemental Digital Data 1, which provides English translation). The health screen questionnaire in phase two assessed health and safety for participation in the physiological performance measurements (see PDF, Supplemental Digital Data 3, which provides English translation). The full baseline questionnaire in phase three assessed, for example, sociodemographic variables, diseases and medication, psychological functioning, gynecological status, and reproductive health and history, menopausal symptoms, life habits (sleeping, smoking, alcohol consumption, and eating habits), current physical activity, life-long physical activity history, and physical activity over the past 12 months (see PDF, Supplemental Digital Data 4, which provides English translation). This survey is repeated at each follow-up laboratory visit.

### The role of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in assessing ovarian reserve [^117Qa2XK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) has been suggested as a marker for the quantity of oocytes remaining within the ovaries (ovarian reserve). It was shown to correlate with antral follicle counts (AFC), outcomes from ovarian stimulation, and onset of menopause. Thus, AMH was previously considered to be the ideal marker of ovarian reserve because it is exclusively produced by granulosa cells and is the only marker that was thought to be stable throughout the menstrual cycle. However, recent studies demonstrate fluctuations in AMH levels during the menstrual cycles, questioning the utility of AMH as a marker of oocyte quantity.

Objective

We report the case of a 32-yr-old Gravida 0 woman with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who presented for fertility treatment with unstable AMH levels.

Patient and Methods

The patient's initial FSH and LH levels were both below 1.0 mIU/ml. Estradiol was 28 pg/ml. Her initial AMH and AFC were 0.20 ng/ml and 0, respectively. She underwent three cycles of fertility treatment.

Results

During the 16-wk course of treatment with human menopausal gonadotropins, normal follicular development was observed. Both AMH and AFC gradually increased during treatment and peaked at 1.26 ng/ml and 6, respectively. On the third cycle of treatment, she successfully conceived.

Conclusion

In the case of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, AMH concentration increases because human menopausal gonadotropin stimulates the growth of FSH-dependent follicles. Thus, AMH has limitations because it only reflects the growing follicular pool that is responsive to gonadotropins. Therefore, AMH may not be solely reflective of the underlying primordial pool.

### Modest follicle-stimulating hormone elevations in younger women: warn but don't disqualify [^117FVKwd]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Markers of quantitative defects in egg production (low ovarian reserve) have often been used to exclude patients from treatment, even when egg quality is apt to be satisfactory. Women younger than 38 years of age with modest FSH elevations (10–15 or even 20 IU/L) have acceptable pregnancy rates despite their limited production of eggs ("quality matters more than quantity") and so should be given the opportunity to try IVF.

### Can follicle-stimulating hormone be used to define menopausal status? [^116psjq3]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the ability of the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to distinguish among premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women.

Methods

We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the second phase of the Massachusetts Women's Health Study (1986 to 1995), a population-based cohort of 427 premenopausal and perimenopausal women identified from the first phase of the Massachusetts Women's Health Study (1981 to 1986).

Results

Boxplots of FSH levels throughout the menopausal transition displayed considerable overlap. Logistic regressions and their resulting receiver operating characteristic curves further demonstrated that, although FSH is a statistically significant predictor of menopausal status, no single value of FSH is expedient for distinguishing premenopausal from perimenopausal or perimenopausal from postmenopausal women.

Conclusion

FSH alone is not an effective predictor of transition into the perimenopausal or postmenopausal period. Specifically, the frequently recommended FSH cutoff of 40 IU/L is inappropriate by itself for clinical determination of postmenopausal status.

### How should postmenopausal androgen excess be evaluated? [^115Q1bxv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence of clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess connotes a unique differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women. Providers need to be able to discriminate between changes of the normal ageing process compared to potential pathology in older women. The evaluation and treatment of postmenopausal hirsutism and hyperandrogenism is reviewed. Androgen excess may have long-term negative health consequences and as such should be detected and treated.

### Andropause or male menopause? Rationale for testosterone replacement therapy in older men with low testosterone levels [^112PNaFU]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide rationale for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in older men with low testosterone levels and symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency.

Methods

The relevant literature was reviewed using PubMed.

Results

Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies indicate that total and free testosterone levels fall with aging, and they may be accompanied by symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency. Testosterone treatment of younger men with very low testosterone levels and hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular disease is associated with improvements in symptoms, body composition, bone density, and hematocrit/hemoglobin. Studies evaluating testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels are limited, but they suggest some increase in fat free mass, some decrease in fat mass, and some increase in bone density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.

Conclusion

The Testosterone Trial should provide definitive information regarding the potential benefits of TRT in men ≥ 65 years of age. If efficacy is confirmed, we will still need more information regarding the risks of TRT in older men.

### Value of the day 3 follicle-stimulating hormone measurement [^117C3XkR]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Although elevated day 3 FSH is associated with diminished ovarian reserve, the predictive value is low in young women. Its use in this population as an exclusion criterion is unjustified.

### Cycle and hormone changes during perimenopause: the key role of ovarian function [^114cK8U6]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

The menopausal transition is the stage in reproductive life commonly defined as commencing with the onset of menstrual irregularity. Classic studies of the endocrinology of the transition postulated the existence of inhibin in women to explain the observed increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels without a significant decrease in estradiol (E2). Descriptions were provided of cycle characteristics during the transition, emphasizing the unpredictability of the endocrine changes rather than the occurrence of an orderly and progressive decline in ovarian function. Women older than the age of 45 exhibited menstrual irregularity when the average number of primordial follicles per ovary decreased to approximately 100. Inhibin B is a major regulator of FSH secretion and a product of small antral follicles. Its levels respond to the early follicular phase increase and decrease in FSH. The age-related decrease in ovarian primordial follicle numbers, which is reflected in a decrease in the numbers of small antral follicles, leads to a decrease in inhibin B, which in turn leads to an increase in FSH, hypothesized to act as a stimulus to the maintenance of circulating E2 in the follicular phase until late in the transition. Concurrently, the concentrations of testosterone do not change significantly. Early follicular phase FSH levels in women reporting menstrual irregularity fluctuate markedly, with a more uniform increase in levels when no menses have occurred for at least 3 months. Anovulatory cycles occur at increased frequency in the last 30 months before final menses or menopause. In ovulatory cycles, FSH shows little, if any, increase, but anovulatory cycles are usually characterized by low levels of inhibin B, markedly increased levels of FSH, and low levels of E2. Thus, the heterogeneity of follicular phase FSH represents a mixture of ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. Longitudinal data indicate that both ovulatory and anovulatory cycles occur after entry into both the early and late menopausal transition and that ovulatory cycles occur even after final menses. There is no endocrine marker of menopause, which may be primarily an endometrial event. Using the hormonal concentrations in ovulatory cycles observed in women in mid-reproductive age as controls and comparing such concentrations in late reproductive age women older than 45 either continuing to cycle regularly or having entered the early or late menopausal transition, a gradual increase in follicular phase FSH and E2 and a decrease in inhibin B were observed in ovulatory cycles. Anovulatory cycles showed markedly increased FSH with low E2 and inhibin B. No specific endocrine change was characteristic of either the early or late menopausal transition, confirming the observations of previous studies regarding the unpredictability of cycle characteristics and hormone changes with the approach of menopause. Antimüllerian hormone correlates with follicle numbers and shows a large age-related decrease to reach undetectable levels at menopause. Thus, the marked decrease in follicle numbers during late reproductive age appears to predispose to erratic and unpredictable cycle characteristics, with normal ovulatory cycles continuing to occur episodically. There is no specific endocrine marker of the early or late transition, making measurements of FSH or E2 unreliable in attempting to stage an individual with regard to approaching menopause.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^114kU4Qa]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Premature and early menopauses

Nonsurgical mid-life cessation of menses can occur outside of the expected age range. Entering menopause before age 45 is considered "early", whereas entering menopause before age 40 is designated as "premature" and is termed Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). The prevalence of these two types is estimated at about 5% and 1% to 2%, respectively. Progress of early menopause typically follows the same stages as spontaneous menopause. A diagnosis of POI, however, requires two occasions of amenorrhea for over 4 months, accompanied by documented elevation in circulating gonadotrophins (serum FSH concentration > 40 IU/L), reduced circulating androgens, and low E 2 levels. In addition, the decline in ovarian function in POI does not compare with spontaneous menopause, as hormone levels can be extremely variable and some women have reported spontaneous return of menses or even pregnancy. There is also an inconsistent and varied symptom experience for women with POI, with additional symptoms like hair loss, dry eyes, cold intolerance, joint clicking, and hypothyroidism.

POI and early menopause are often linked to underlying factors beyond gonadal hormone levels. Cigarette smoking, high body mass index, and low socioeconomic status have all been associated with POI and early menopause. POI has been linked with genetic abnormalities, metabolic or autoimmune disorders, infections, and enzyme deficiencies, though it is often idiopathic. Recent research also suggests that women with POI do not report a reduction in menopausal symptoms with aging.

Notably, ovary-sparing hysterectomy can reduce the age of menopause by an average of 4 years through compromise of ovarian function, related to age at surgery. A prominent hypotheses for ovarian cessation after uterine removal is that the surgery affects blood flow to the ovaries, but evidence for this is mixed. Other possible causes are that the uterus itself regulates pituitary FSH secretion and thus affects follicle development. It may also be that the condition that led to hysterectomy increases the risk for ovarian failure. Thus, depending on the timing of surgery, gradual ovarian cessation before age 45 due to hysterectomy might be considered noninduced, early menopause.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^117GPcpR]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Hysterectomy and endometrial ablation — women who have undergone these procedures cannot be staged by menstrual bleeding criteria and can only be assessed using supportive criteria (endocrine markers of ovarian aging). It is recommended that clinicians and researchers wait at least 3 months after surgery to assess endocrine status, as pelvic surgeries may transiently raise FSH levels; in most cases staging will be limited to classifying premenopausal or postmenopausal status. A single sample for FSH and estradiol may be ambiguous or misleading, and at least one repeated measurement is often required.

### The forgotten variable: impact of luteinizing hormone on the prediction of ovarian reserve [^111gL7gH]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

The impact of basal LH levels in the prediction of ovarian function in women initiating fertility treatment remains controversial. The present study demonstrates high-normal basal LH levels as a good, and low-normal basal LH levels as a negative prognostic sign for oocyte yield in regular-cycling women with borderline basal FSH levels (10.1–15 mU/mL).

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^115jedhD]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Early postmenopause (Stages +1a, +1b, +1c) — FSH continues to increase and estradiol decreases until approximately 2 years after the FMP, after which levels stabilize, so STRAW + 10 recommended subdivision into three substages (+1a, +1b, and +1c). Stages +1a and +1b each last 1 year; Stage +1a marks the end of the 12-month period of amenorrhea required to define that the FMP has occurred; together +1a and +1b are estimated to last, on average, 2 years and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are most likely to occur during this stage. Stage +1c represents stabilization of high FSH and low estradiol values estimated to last 3 to 6 years; therefore, the entire early postmenopause lasts approximately 5 to 8 years.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112gaeGy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, more specifically with respect to cardiovascular risk assessment, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to consider evaluating the baseline risk of CVD and taking this risk into consideration when advising for or against menopausal hormone therapy in females < 60 years of age or < 10 years past menopause onset considering hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms.

### Antimüllerian hormone as predictor of reproductive outcome in subfertile women with elevated basal follicle-stimulating hormone levels: a follow-up study [^112vvJMh]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the role of serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) as a predictor of live birth and reproductive stage in subfertile women with elevated basal FSH levels.

Design

A prospective observational cohort study conducted between February 2005 and June 2009.

Setting

Tertiary fertility center.

Patient(S)

Subfertile women with [1] a regular menstrual cycle (mean cycle length 25–35 days); [2] basal FSH concentrations ≥ 12.3 IU/L; and [3] younger than 40 years (n = 96).

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Live birth and reproductive stage according to the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop.

Result(S)

A cumulative live birth rate of 63.5% was observed during a median follow-up of 3.3 years (n = 85). The AMH level was significantly associated with live birth. There was evidence of a nonlinear prediction pattern, with an increase in chances of live birth until an AMH level of 1 μg/L. Other ovarian reserve tests and chronological age appeared of limited value in predicting live birth. In addition, AMH was significantly associated with the timing of reproductive stages (n = 68) (i.e., the occurrence of menopausal transition or menopause during follow-up).

Conclusion(S)

The present findings suggest applicability of AMH determination as a marker for actual fertility in subfertile women with elevated basal FSH levels.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^113xW3KT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal Transition and Circulating Testosterone

Menopausal transition is associated with a decrease in the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume, as well as a decline in serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker for antral follicle count and ovarian reserve. When the number of antral follicles and ovarian granulosa cells decrease, estradiol levels decline and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increase. Menopause, the last spontaneous menstruation, occurs on average at age 51 years when circulating estradiol has decreased to a level insufficient to stimulate the endometrium to grow and then shed. During this period, menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, sweating, and sleep problems, are common and associated with the gradual decline in estradiol.

In contrast to the decrease in estradiol, circulating levels of testosterone decline as a consequence of age-related, but not menopause-related, reductions in secretion by both the adrenal gland and the ovary. This means a 50% reduction in testosterone in women aged 40–45 compared with women in the 18–24 age group. In premenopausal women, about 50% of circulating testosterone arises from direct secretion from the ovary and the adrenal gland, in equal amounts, under pituitary control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively. The remaining 50% of testosterone is produced from peripheral conversion by ovarian and adrenal inactive androgen precursors (A4, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEAS). Testosterone is further converted in target tissues to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5α reductase, and together these hormones constitute the 2 classical bioactive androgens that bind to the androgen receptor. In postmenopausal women, a larger part of these active androgens is synthesized in peripheral tissue from DHEA within the cell according to the concept of intracrinology.

### A prospective study of the association between endogenous hormones and depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women [^116CW3yy]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Across a woman's lifetime, variations in hormone levels are known to influence mood and well-being. Whether absolute or changes in hormone levels over time are associated with depression among postmenopausal women remains unclear.

Methods

The Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project is a longitudinal population-based study of women who were followed through the menopausal transition. This analysis is based on data collected from 138 postmenopausal women in years 11 and 13 of the study, who were assessed for the presence of depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were developed to determine whether absolute or changes in hormone levels were associated with depression.

Results

No significant associations were found between depressive symptoms and the absolute levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone, free androgen index, estradiol, free estradiol, or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). On the other hand, women with a decline in total serum estradiol over the 2-year period had a more than threefold increased risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2–9.9). A large increase in FSH levels over this period was also associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0–6.7). These associations remained even after adjustment for initial depression score, as well as a range of potential confounding factors.

Conclusions

Changes in estradiol and, to a lesser extent, in FSH levels are associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women. These results further support a role for fluctuating rather than absolute hormone levels in depression in later life.

### Management of menopausal symptoms: a review [^1149FNSf]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on menopause:

- **Definition**: Menopause is defined as the natural biological process in women that signifies the permanent end of menstruation and fertility.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of menopause is primarily related to the depletion of ovarian follicles, which leads to decreased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This hormonal change triggers the various symptoms associated with menopause.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of menopause-related vasomotor symptoms differs across geographic regions: estimated at 46% in North America, 45–69% in Latin America, 74% in Europe, and 22–63% in Asia.
- **Risk factors**: Several risk factors are associated with more severe menopausal symptoms. These include a history of depression, certain lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity, and undergoing premature or surgical menopause.
- **Disease course**: Menopause is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations. The most common symptoms include vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, genitourinary symptoms like vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, and mood changes.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of menopause is generally favorable, the symptoms eventually subside without intervention.

Diagnosis in perimenopause and menopause

1.3 Although there are currently no diagnostic criteria for PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, we suggest that a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS can be based upon a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. The presence of PCO morphology on ultrasound would provide additional supportive evidence, although this is less likely in a menopausal woman (2|⊕⊕○○).

1.3 Evidence

The natural history of PCOS through perimenopause into menopause is poorly studied, but many aspects of the syndrome appear to improve. Ovarian size, follicle count, and anti-Mullerian hormone levels (a marker of antral follicle count) decrease with normal aging in women with and without PCOS. However, the decline in ovarian volume and follicle count may be less in women with PCOS than in normal women. Similarly, androgen levels decline with age in women with and without PCOS (serum T declines ∼50% between the ages of 20 and 40 y), with reports of improved menstrual frequency in PCOS, although there is little evidence to support a decline in serum T associated with the menopause transition per se.

The diagnosis of PCOS in postmenopausal women is more problematic than in adolescents. There are no age-related T cutoffs for the diagnosis. Furthermore, T assays used to diagnose hyperandrogenemia in women are imprecise, even for assays utilizing tandem mass spectrometry technology. Nevertheless, supporting studies have shown that peri- and postmenopausal mothers of women with PCOS with a history of irregular menses tended to have features of PCOS as well as metabolic abnormalities, implying that aspects of the PCOS phenotype may persist with age. Very high T levels and/or virilization may suggest an androgen-producing tumor in postmenopausal women.

1.3 Values and preferences

We recognize that the diagnosis of PCOS in postmenopausal women is problematic but feel that it is unlikely that a woman can develop PCOS in the perimenopause or menopause if she has not had symptoms earlier. We recognize that there are few prospective studies to document the natural history of ovarian function with age in women with PCOS.

2.0 Associated morbidity and evaluation

Cutaneous manifestations

2.1 We recommend that a physical examination should document cutaneous manifestations of PCOS: terminal hair growth (see hirsutism guidelines, Ref.), acne, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

### Follicle-stimulating hormone, its association with cardiometabolic risk factors, and 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women [^115E9aAr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Readers may have concerns that estrogens protect women from CVD, but participants with higher FSH had lower estradiol in Table 1. It is possible that participants with higher FSH also had better metabolic parameters. The associations between FSH and metabolic parameters were independent of estradiol as shown in Figure 2, which led to a negative association between FSH and calculated 10‐year CVD risk. The equations calculating the 10‐year ASCVD risk did not contain estradiol, which also indicates that estradiol fluctuates at such a low level in postmenopausal women that it may not influence 10‐year ASCVD risk. Some studies found that estradiol levels were not associated with risk of CVD in hormone replacement nonusers after menopause. 39, 40

Our study had some strengths. First, it presented a novel association between FSH and 10‐year ASCVD risk for the first time in a large sample. Second, the study was performed in a general population as opposed to a clinic‐based population, providing better external validity of the results.

### Estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone as predictors of onset of menopause transition-related bone loss in pre-and perimenopausal women [^114U4uTm]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The menopause transition (MT) may be an opportunity for early intervention to prevent rapid bone loss. To intervene early, we need to be able to prospectively identify pre- and perimenopausal women who are beginning to lose bone. This study examined whether estradiol (E2), or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), measured in pre- and perimenopausal women, can predict significant bone loss by the next year. Bone loss was considered significant if bone mineral density (BMD) decline at the lumbar spine (LS) or femoral neck (FN) from a pre- or early perimenopausal baseline to 1year after the E2 or FSH measurement was greater than the least detectable change. We used data from 1559 participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and tested E2 and FSH as separate predictors using repeated measures modified Poisson regression. Adjusted for MT stage, age, race/ethnicity, and body mass index, women with lower E2 (and higher FSH) were more likely to lose BMD: At the LS, each halving of E2 and each doubling of FSH were associated with 10% and 39% greater risk of significant bone loss, respectively (p < 0.0001 for each). At the FN, each halving of E2 and each doubling of FSH were associated with 12% (p = 0.01) and 27% (p < 0.001) greater risk of significant bone loss. FSH was more informative than E2 (assessed by the area under the receiver-operator curve) at identifying women who were more versus less likely to begin losing bone, especially at the LS. Prediction was better when hormones were measured in pre- or early perimenopause than in late perimenopause. Tracking within-individual change in either hormone did not predict onset of bone loss better than a single measure. We conclude that measuring FSH in the MT can help prospectively identify women with imminent or ongoing bone loss at the LS. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

STRAW + 10 staging — late reproductive stage (Stage − 3) and early menopausal transition (Stage − 2) criteria specify that the late reproductive stage "be subdivided into two substages (− 3b and − 3a)". In Stage − 3b, "menstrual cycles remain regular without change in length or early follicular phase FSH levels; however, AMH and antral follicle counts are low", and "Most but not all studies… suggest that inhibin-B is also low". In Stage − 3a, "subtle changes in menstrual cycle characteristics, specifically shorter cycles… begin", and "Early follicular phase (cycle days 2–5) FSH increases and becomes more variable, with the other three markers of ovarian aging being low". Early menopausal transition (Stage − 2) "is marked by increased variability in menstrual cycle length, defined as a persistent difference of 7 days or more in the length of consecutive cycles", with persistence "defined as recurrence within 10 cycles of the first variable length cycle". The late menopausal transition (Stage − 1) principal criterion includes "Interval of amenorrhea of ≥ 60 days".

### The value of follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and clinical findings as markers of the late menopausal transition [^114vYpYk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

The Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop proposed bleeding and hormonal criteria for the menopausal transition, but operational definitions of hormone parameters were not specified.

Objective

This paper investigates the longitudinal relationship of annual serum FSH levels with four proposed bleeding criteria for the late menopausal transition in two cohort studies. The goal is to provide empirically based guidance regarding application of hormonal criteria that may be optimal for widespread application in clinical and research settings for assessing menopausal stage.

Design/Setting

Prospective menstrual calendar and annual serum FSH data were collected from two population-based cohort studies: the Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project and the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation.

Participants

Participants in the study were 193 Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project and 2223 Study of Women's Health Across the Nation women aged 42–57 yr at baseline who contributed 10 or more menstrual cycles and at least one annual serum FSH value.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Association between bleeding criteria for the late menopausal transition and FSH was a main outcome measure. Associations of bleeding criteria, FSH, and hot flashes with the final menstrual period were also measured.

Results

A single FSH measure is an independent marker of the late menopausal transition, but FSH concentrations are less predictive of menopausal stage than any of four proposed bleeding criteria. Criterion FSH values for the late transition are similar across both studies. Experience of hot flashes adds no information in the presence of hormonal and bleeding criteria.

Conclusions

An annual serum FSH concentration of 40 IU/liter could be incorporated, in conjunction with bleeding markers, into the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop paradigm for markers of the late menopausal transition.

### Follicle-stimulating hormone: more than a marker for menopause: FSH as a frontier for women's mental health [^1147GP47]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The average current life expectancy entails that women will spend over one-third of their lives in menopause. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in women begin to increase roughly six years before the final menstrual period, reaching a menopausal plateau that is nearly 14 times the level of FSH observed in men, a profound sex-specific difference. A promising new body of work examines whether these age-associated increases in FSH contribute to multiple menopause-related conditions, including psychiatric morbidities. This paper highlights research advances showing the potential role of FSH and its underlying mechanisms in mental health conditions for women in menopause and makes the call for more research.

Initial evaluation approaches vary: some Task Force members recommend minimal screening with free T4, morning cortisol, and testosterone, whereas others include TSH, LH, FSH, and IGF-I; interpretive notes include that low gonadotropins in postmenopausal women provide evidence of hypopituitarism and in men exclude primary hypogonadism when testosterone is low, normal or low TSH helps identify central hypothyroidism when free T4 is low, and if baseline testing suggests hypopituitarism, further stimulation tests of the pituitary-adrenal or GH-IGF-I axis should be performed.

In women, age-related changes in ovarian function begin in the mid-30s with decreased fertility and compensatory hormonal changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis that maintain follicle development and estrogen secretion in the face of a waning pool of ovarian follicles. The menopause transition is characterized by marked variability in follicle development, ovulation, bleeding patterns, and symptoms of hyper- and hypoestrogenism. The menopause, which is clinically defined by the last menstrual period, is followed by the consistent absence of ovarian secretion of estradiol.

Materials and Methods

Participants

The data were from the participants in SPECT‐China, a cross‐sectional survey in East China (ChiCTR‐ECS‐14005052). Recruitment and enrollment have been previously described in detail. 15, 16, 17 Chinese citizens ≥ 18 years old who had lived in their current area for ≥ 6 months were selected. We also excluded subjects with severe communication problems, acute illness, or who were unwilling to participate. From January 2014 to December 2015, 10 441 subjects who were 18 to 93 years old were recruited into the SPECT‐China study from 22 sites in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces (Figure 1). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 2008. Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study.

### Identifying women who share patterns of reproductive hormones, vasomotor symptoms, and sleep maintenance problems across the menopause transition: group-based multi-trajectory modeling in the study of women's health across the nation [^1123gGK5]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify groups of women who share levels and patterns of change in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), self-reported sleep maintenance problems, and frequent vasomotor symptoms (VMS) up to 10 years before and after their final menstrual period and to evaluate their premenopausal characteristics.

Method

Group-based multi-trajectory modeling grouped 1,407 women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation who had an observed natural menopause and did not use hormone therapy, based on repeated measures of FSH, sleep maintenance problems, and frequent VMS relative to final menstrual period. Multivariable analyses assessed race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking, and depressive symptoms as predictors of group membership.

Results

Women formed five distinct groups: (1) low symptoms (low VMS/sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 552; 39.2%); (2) moderate VMS and sleep problems/low FSH rise (N = 169; 12.0%); (3) dominant sleep problems (lower VMS/high sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 203; 14.4%); (4) dominant VMS (high VMS/lower sleep problems)/high FSH rise (N = 297; 21.1%)); and (5) high symptoms (high VMS/high sleep problems)/intermediate FSH rise (N = 186; 13.2%)). Multivariate analyses showed that race/ethnicity, premenopausal body mass index and depressive symptoms, and increasing depressive symptoms during the early phase of the transition predicted group membership.

Conclusions

Women can be classified based on shared levels and patterns of FSH, sleep maintenance problems, and frequent VMS across the menopause transition. Either VMS or sleep maintenance problems can be dominant in the face of high FSH. Experiencing one menopause-related symptom or hormone profile does not automatically imply that another is also being experienced.

### Sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism: a case-controlled observational study [^114onype]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a rare condition in which there is a deficiency of 1, multiple, or all of the hormones produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Hypopituitarism has an estimated annual incidence of 4.21 cases per 100 000 and a prevalence of 45.5/100 000 that may be increasing. The mortality rate in men with hypopituitarism caused by benign nonfunctioning adenomas has decreased in recent decades and is now close to that of the background population. By contrast, women with hypopituitarism remain at increased risk of mortality, as well as cardiovascular events and fractures. The pituitary gland produces hormones (the gonadotropins LH and FSH and ACTH) that control the production of sex hormones (estrogens, androgens, and progesterone), and insufficient replacement of sex steroids in women with hypopituitarism has been suggested as a factor contributing to this discrepancy between men and women. Men with pituitary insufficiency and low androgen levels receive testosterone replacement whereas women with hypopituitarism and estrogen deficiency are only recommended estrogen replacement until the expected age of menopause and not androgen replacement. Lower androgen levels in women without any pituitary disorders have been reported to be associated with increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, and lower bone mineral density, but a comprehensive understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of sex steroids, in particular androgens, in women is lacking.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), ie, deficiency of LH/FSH and thereby estrogen production, is diagnosed according to strict criteria combining clinical and laboratory variables in both pre- and postmenopausal women. By contrast, there is no established definition of androgen deficiency in women, and it is unclear how HH, alone or in combination with ACTH deficiency, affects the sex hormone profile. Progress in defining sex steroid deficiency, understanding its consequences, and optimizing its replacement therapy has been hampered by the lack of sensitive and specific analytical methods for determining sex hormone levels. The performance of immunoassays that are used in clinical routine is insufficient for measurements of the low levels of sex steroids present in women, particularly after menopause, and in women with hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, and ovarian failure. In such settings, the use of mass spectrometry-based analytical methods is required. High-quality sex steroid data from mass spectrometry in women with hypopituitarism may provide important clues to the regulation and importance of sex steroids in women, but studies to generate these data have not yet been performed.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^113qHJwk]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Invasive breast cancer — definition of menopause and diagnostic criteria state that menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis, and is usually a clinical diagnosis made after ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea; natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58 years. In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function may still be intact or may resume over time, with the likelihood of resuming after chemotherapy higher among those aged < 40 years. Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen or ovarian suppression; FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause, and FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of the following: Prior bilateral oophorectomy; Age ≥ 60 years; Age < 60 with amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range; Age < 60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial assessments; Age < 60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in postmenopausal range. Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^112R8CrC]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Unlike the cross-sectional studies, most prospective studies have systematically confirmed the menopausal transition as a period of heightened risk for development of depressive symptoms and/or depression. The Penn Ovarian Aging Study showed an increased risk for depressive symptoms during the transition to menopause followed by a decrease in this risk in subsequent years (that is, in the postmenopausal period); the authors also suggested that depression and hormone-related symptoms could share some underlying mechanisms since history of severe PMS (premenstrual syndrome), emergence of hot flashes and sleep problems were independent predictors of depression in this population. Two long-term prospective studies followed women with no history of depression across the menopause transition to examine the risk for new onset of depression. In both studies, a 6–8-year follow-up of premenopausal women (n = 460 and n = 231, respectively) revealed a significant increased risk (twofold to fourfold) for developing depression in women as they entered perimenopause compared to those who remained premenopausal. Moreover, greater variation of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels over the follow-up period appear to be associated with higher depressive scores and diagnosis of MDD; an indicator that wide fluctuation in hormonal levels, rather than their absolute levels, may be a contributing factor to the emergence of depression in biologically vulnerable women. Other mediators of the risk for depression in this particular population include ethnicity (higher risk in African American, lower risk in Asian population), lower education, past history of postpartum blues or postpartum depression, cigarette smoking, stressful life events.

As highlighted above, epidemiologic evidence supports the 'critical timing' hypothesis for the occurrence of depression, most likely linked to periods of hormone instability rather then hormone deficiency. Interestingly, different areas of medicine exploring health-related outcomes in midlife and aging women seem to agree on the same notion of a 'critical timing window' being associated with the menopausal transition and the importance of proper timing for preventive or therapeutic strategies. For example, recent evidence from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) showed changes in processing speed and verbal episodic memory in women during the menopausal transition, with memory performance returning to premenopausal levels in the postmenopausal years. Changes in estrogen levels during the menopausal transition have also been associated with heightened risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including larger adventitial carotid artery diameters, changes in lipids, and increased blood pressure.

### Predicting the age at natural menopause in middle-aged women [^111KKrxp]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Higher estradiol and FSH levels, irregular menstrual cycles, and menopausal symptoms are strong indicators of approaching menopause in middle-aged women. Additionally, information related to life habits and socioeconomic factors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking habits, relationship status, physical activity, and the use of hormonal contraception may provide useful information for assessing the time to natural menopause. The suggested approach for predicting ANM could be useful for clinicians when making decisions related to the use of hormonal contraception and treatment for menopausal symptoms in perimenopausal women. However, further studies with a similar methodological approach, long-term follow-up time and a more comprehensive set of covariates are warranted to develop models with improved predictive performance that would be applicable in more heterogeneous populations and for women in their 30s or early 40s.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypogonadism in females: In the presence of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, we recommend measuring serum estradiol (E2), FSH, and LH. Clinicians should exclude other causes of menstrual irregularities related to impaired ovulation, and in cases of amenorrhea clinicians should also exclude pregnancy. We suggest against dynamic testing with GnRH, which offers no useful diagnostic information. We recommend that in postmenopausal women, the absence of high serum FSH and LH is sufficient for a diagnosis of gonadotrope dysfunction provided the patient is not on hormonal replacement therapy.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

Late menopausal transition (Stage −1) — amenorrhea of 60 days or longer marks this stage, and quantitative criteria include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw, approximating more than 40 IU/L in previously used urine-based standards. Based on menstrual calendar and hormonal changes, this stage is estimated to last, on average, 1 to 3 years, and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are likely to occur. Researchers and clinicians should carefully evaluate the appropriate FSH value depending on the assay used.

### Is early menopause a different entity from premature ovarian insufficiency? [^112NsMuR]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that 1%–3% of women will become menopausal before the age of 40 and 0.1% below the age of 30. Vasomotor symptoms may not always be present at the initial diagnosis of POI. It may take months or years to progress from stages of ovarian insufficiency to true menopause. In some cases, such as genetic syndromes (i.e. Turner's syndrome, which is due to the loss of an X chromosome and has a prevalence of 1/2000–2500 births), primary hypogonadism may be evident even earlier. Specific phenotypical abnormalities (e.g. webbed neck, small mandible, high‐arched palate, crowded teeth, Madelung deformity) predominate, and POI is initially presented as primary amenorrhoea. This is also the case for partial loss of an X chromosome, terminal deletions of its long arm or X autosomal translocations. POI also develops in 20% of premutation carriers in the gene encoding fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1), the so‐called 'fragile X syndrome' (1/4000 male and 1/8000 female persons).

The age at which ovarian insufficiency occurs cannot be accurately determined and more research is needed for this purpose. Although POI is universally defined as menopause occurring at an age > 2 standard deviations below the mean estimated for the reference population, specific attention should be paid to younger ages, in which the likelihood of identifying a secondary cause is high. Except for karyotype and FMR1 gene testing, extensive investigation for rare genetic syndromes is not recommended for every patient presenting with POI. This is particularly indicated in those women with an identifiable family history of early ovarian insufficiency, especially if it has occurred at an age younger than 30 years. It may provide some advantages regarding the therapeutic management of POI, and genetic counselling of the patient's family members.

### A novel low-impact resistance exercise program increases strength and balance in females irrespective of menopause status [^113BaCPL]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics by PRE-(PRE), peri- (PERI), and post- (POST) menopause following randomization into 12 wk of habitual physical activity (CON, n = 25) or supervised low-impact resistance exercise (EXC, n = 45) intervention groups.

Participants were classified as pre- (PRE), peri- (PERI), or post- (POST) menopause based on baseline serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations and menstrual cycle history as described in Bondarev et al. Participants not using hormonal contraception medications were PRE if reporting regular menstrual cycle with FSH concentration less than 17 IU·L⁻¹, PERI if reporting irregular menstrual cycle with FSH of 9.5 to 30 IU·L⁻¹ or if occasional menstrual bleeding occurred during past 3 months even if FSH > 30 IU·L⁻¹, and POST if reporting no menstrual bleeding during the past 6 months with FSH > 30 IU·L⁻¹ or no menstrual bleeding had occurred during past 3 months and FSH > 39 IU·L⁻¹. If participants were using hormonal contraception medications, the categorization was based solely on FSH level and stricter cutoff values were applied (PRE: FSH < 15 IU·L⁻¹, PERI: FSH 15–39 IU·L⁻¹, POST: FSH > 39 IU·L⁻¹).

General study design

Following enrollment, participants were randomly assigned to either 12 wk of the exercise training intervention (EXC) or nontraining, habitual physical activity control (CON) group using covariate adaptive blocked randomization for age (40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55+ yr) and BMI (< 25, ≥ 25 kg·m⁻²) by an external investigator (Fig. 1). The block randomization method was chosen to ensure an even distribution of premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal females across the two intervention groups, without the need for additional blood samples for hormone analysis before randomization. In addition, participants were randomized to complete strength and muscle thickness measures on either the dominant or nondominant side, ensuring they were counterbalanced between groups.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171UtFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Testosterone assessment and related remarks — age effects, binding, and testing considerations: Testosterone levels demonstrate an age-related decline, with healthy men reaching the highest serum T levels around the age of 30 years and thereafter showing a gradual decline at a rate of 1–2% annually, and the level below which symptoms occur has not been clearly established; about 2% of circulating T is free, 44% is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 54% is bound to albumin and other proteins. For borderline low T values, two measurements performed with the same assay are preferred. When assessing fertility is required, clinicians should perform semen analysis before starting T replacement, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces circulating gonadotropins with reductions of up to 60% for FSH and 50% for LH.

### Relation between climacteric symptoms and ovarian hypofunction in middle-aged and older Japanese women [^111HBrFa]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To gain insight into the characteristics and current status of climacteric symptoms reported by middle-aged and older women in Japan, we surveyed women presenting at our menopause clinic.

Design

The participants included 1,069 women, ranging in age from 40 to less than 60 years (mean age, 50.2 y). Climacteric (indefinite) symptoms were objectively assessed with the use of the Keio questionnaire, which grades the severity of 40 types of symptoms classified into 20 subgroups. The total scores obtained for the 40 symptoms were used to calculate symptom prevalence and severity. To evaluate ovarian function, concentrations of estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in sera were measured.

Results

The most frequent symptom was general fatigue, reported by 88.2% of the women. Shoulder stiffness was the symptom rated to be severe by the highest percentage of women (38.1%). The prevalence and severity of hot flushes (and sweats) were slightly higher in perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women than in premenopausal and late postmenopausal women. The prevalence and severity of hot flushes and sweats were higher in women with estradiol < 25 pg/mL and FSH > 40 mIU/mL than in those with estradiol ≥ 25 pg/mL and FSH ≤ 40 mIU/mL.

Conclusion

General fatigue and shoulder stiffness, symptoms with low hormone dependence, are the two most frequent climacteric symptoms in our clinic. Hot flushes and sweats, symptoms with high hormone dependence, are also common symptoms.

### Is this woman perimenopausal? [^115z9tT1]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Perimenopause is a time of transition for women at midlife. Women want to know whether they are starting this change and physicians need to know the accuracy of a clinical examination in identifying perimenopausal women. These women should be counseled about alleviating climacteric symptoms, using contraception, and preventing diseases such as osteoporosis.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of self-assessment, symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests in diagnosing women in perimenopause.

Data Sources

English-language articles that presented data relevant to diagnosis of perimenopause were identified in a MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2001. References of these articles and other publications also were reviewed.

Study Selection

Cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of women aged 40 years or older that used the definition of perimenopause as 3 to 11 months of amenorrhea or irregular periods, included a premenopausal control group, and reported a clinical examination finding. Of 1246 articles identified, 16 studies were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles for quality (L. A.B. and C.M.S.). Discrepancies were resolved by a third author (K.N.).

Data Synthesis

The prior probability of perimenopause is directly related to a woman's age. After considering age, the following yielded the greatest positive likelihood ratios (LRs+): self assessment of going through the transition (LR+ range, 1.53–2.13), symptoms of hot flashes (LR+ range, 2.15–4.06), night sweats (LR+ 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.63–2.21), vaginal dryness (LR+ range, 1.48–3.79), high follicle-stimulating hormone levels (LR+ 3.06; 95% CI, 2.06–4.54), and low inhibin B levels (LR+ 2.05; 95% CI, 0.96–4.39). Self-assessment of perimenopausal status had the smallest negative LR (range, 0.18–0.36).

Conclusions

No one symptom or test is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out perimenopause. Clinicians should diagnose perimenopause based on menstrual history and age without relying on laboratory test results.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^111bzBFD]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnostic investigations — HCPs should diagnose POI based on the presence of spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles and biochemical confirmation. The guideline group recommends the following diagnostic criteria: disordered menstrual cycles (spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles) for at least 4 months, and an elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration ≥ 25 IU/l. FSH assessment should be repeated after 4–6 weeks if there is diagnostic uncertainty, and FSH testing for the diagnosis of POI does not have to be timed to a specific day of the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy should be excluded in women presenting with amenorrhea. Use of hormonal therapy (including oral, injectable, or long-acting contraceptives) may conceal or cause amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles, and potentially lower FSH concentrations; some hormonal therapy (e.g., combined oral contraceptive) may need to be ceased before a diagnosis of POI can be confirmed. Women who have had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before age 40 have a diagnosis of POI and additional diagnostic testing is unnecessary. The guideline group does not recommend diagnosing POI based on serum estradiol concentrations; however, a low estradiol concentration indicates hypoestrogenism, and in combination with an elevated FSH concentration, provides additional confirmation of the POI diagnosis.

A meta-analysis of 52 observational studies showed an increase of 0.52 cases/1000 in women starting MHT at age 50 and continuing therapy for 5 years, with risk persisting 5 years after stopping MHT at 0.37 cases/1000 when ages 55 to 59. Overall WHI estimates for EPT showed HR, 1.41 and in cumulative follow-up HR, 1.24, and adequately powered RCTs are needed to ascertain risk.

The many menopauses

Spontaneous menopause

Spontaneous menopause (often referred to as "natural menopause") is diagnosed retrospectively after a year has elapsed since a woman's last menstrual period (LMP). The majority of women experience menopause between 45 and 55 years of age. Before the cessation of menses, women enter the menopausal transition (perimenopause); cycle lengths become variable as hormone levels begin to fluctuate and gradually fall. With fewer follicles maturing in the aging ovaries, levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) become elevated due to disinhibition, although 17β-estradiol (E 2) levels become highly variable. On average, the perimenopausal period lasts about 4 years. After the LMP, both E 2 and progesterone remain circulating at very low levels (2–35 pg/mL and 0–0.8 ng/mL, respectively), although high FSH levels stabilize. Postmenopausal women also produce low but stable quantities of androgens such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroandrosterone (DHA), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS). In most postmenopausal women, reduction in ovarian hormones is associated with the emergence of physiological symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113UB9pj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

1.1.2 Evidence

Evidence to support screening for hypopituitarism in patients with an incidentaloma also comes from small observational studies. In combined data in micro- and macroincidentalomas, hypopituitarism was present in seven of 66 and 19 of 46 patients. Deficits of gonadotropins (not associated with hyperprolactinemia) were detected in up to 30% of patients, of the ACTH/cortisol axis in up to 18%, thyroid axis in up to 28%, and GH axis in up to 8%.

Different approaches can be taken to the initial evaluation of the patient for hypopituitarism. Some Task Force members recommend a minimal screening with the measurement of free T 4, morning cortisol, and testosterone levels, whereas others recommend that the initial evaluation should also include the measurement of TSH, LH, and FSH and IGF-I. A broad initial approach to this testing is favored by some to avoid the repeated blood sampling that would be needed to confirm a central origin of target organ deficiencies should they be detected. Low gonadotropin levels in postmenopausal women provide evidence of hypopituitarism and in men exclude primary hypogonadism when testosterone levels are low. Similarly, normal or low TSH levels help distinguish a pituitary etiology of hypothyroidism when the free T 4 is low. Gonadal function can be assessed in premenopausal women by history and examination. If baseline testing suggests hypopituitarism, further stimulation tests of the pituitary-adrenal or GH-IGF-I axis should be performed.

### Ovarian function in girls and women with GALT-deficiency galactosemia [^115dVEoc]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

What is primary or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)?

Primary or premature ovarian insufficiency is a spectrum disorder of ovarian dysfunction that differs considerably among women. In its mildest form, POI may present as diminished ovarian reserve with subfertility and often an elevated FSH level in a woman's fourth decade of life. However, more severe forms of POI will present with primary amenorrhea in the young adolescent with absent sex steroid production and a complete lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Many women with POI have an intermediate phenotype, with normal progression through puberty and later onset of irregular to absent menstrual cycles and/or infertility. Proposed clinical criteria for the diagnosis of intermediate POI include secondary amenorrhea for at least 4 consecutive months or more, prior to the age of 40, in the setting of low estradiol and elevated FSH (Goswami and Conway; Welt).

The term "primary ovarian insufficiency" was first used in the literature more than 60 years ago (Albright) and was re-introduced recently as a more appropriate term to replace less encompassing, compassionate, and descriptive terms such as "premature ovarian failure" or "premature menopause" that had come into use (Welt). POI is not, in fact, the early onset of natural menopause. Many women with POI experience irregular ovarian function after their diagnosis, with months of regular menses and ovulation alternating with intervals of amenorrhea and hypoestrogenism. Antral follicle counts, determined by ultrasound, and serum FSH levels may vary considerably. This fluctuating course of ovarian function is seldom seen once a woman has experienced natural menopause and amenorrhea at a more typical age. Of note, 5–10% of women given a diagnosis of POI may still spontaneously conceive, and there is very little evidence that any current treatment increases this rate (Van Kasteren and Schoemaker).

### Don't obtain follicle-stimulating hormone levels in women… [^115nuLeY]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Menstrual bleeding patterns for women after age 40 are less predictable than in the younger years due to the normal menopausal transition. Menopause is defined as the absence of menstrual periods for one year when no other cause can be identified. During this time, blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone vary both from woman to woman and from day to day in the same woman. A follicle-stimulating hormone level does not predict when the transition to menopause will occur, diagnose that it has begun, or provide reassurance that contraception is no longer necessary. If there are no other causes of irregular or abnormal bleeding, the treatment for these women will not change based on the follicle-stimulating hormone level.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — premenopausal patients and menopausal assessment: If premenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Panel recommended 5 years of tamoxifen alone (category 1) or tamoxifen with OFS (category 1) or OFS plus AI for 5 years (category 1). Patients premenopausal at diagnosis who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have continued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses, and menopausal status cannot be determined while receiving OFS. Because AIs can stimulate ovarian function, to assure a true postmenopausal status, serial assessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol is mandatory when considering this subset for AI therapy; frequency of testing of estradiol and FSH/LH levels should be individualized.

### Usefulness of FSH measurements for determining menopause in long-term users of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate over 40 years of age [^114Jyzek]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the usefulness of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements for determining menopause in 40–55-year-old users of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA).

Study Design

FSH levels were measured in 355 blood samples from 82 amenorrheic women during an 18-month period. Blood was collected every 90 days immediately prior to DMPA administration.

Results

Using FSH values > 35 mIU/mL as being in the post menopausal range, 32 women (39.0%) presented at least one FSH measurement in the postmenopausal range and 14 of them (43.7%) had more than one elevated FSH measurement and were considered postmenopausal. In five users (15.6%), only the last FSH measurement was within the postmenopausal range, and in 13 women (40.6%), FSH returned to normal values following one measurement that was within the postmenopausal range.

Conclusions

The menopausal status in DMPA users in amenorrhea should be determined based on at least two consecutive high FSH evaluations, since, as shown here, 40.6% of the women with high FSH had a low FSH in the subsequent determination. FSH measurements should be done only in women ≥ 50 years old because there is a greater possibility of being in postmenopause. However, we do not recommend the interruption of DMPA use prior to the quantification of FSH.

### Gonadotropin trajectories among postmenopausal women not using hormone therapy [^116CGC2x]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

While evidence suggests that gonadotropins may play an important role in aging-related changes in body composition and health outcomes, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) patterns have not been well characterized in older women. We characterized patterns of FSH and LH change over time after menopause.

Methods

In a sample of 291 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative OsteoPerio study who were not using hormone therapy, we estimated FSH and LH trajectories over a 20-year period using group-based trajectory modeling. Descriptive statistics identified differences according to hormone trajectory group.

Results

We estimated 3 FSH trajectories. The low FSH trajectory (36.1% of sample) showed had stable FSH, the moderate FSH trajectory (52.9%) showed FSH increased 30 years after menopause, and the high FSH trajectory (11.0%) showed FSH initially declined then increased 20 years after menopause. The moderate and high FSH trajectory groups were more likely to be never smokers, had lower measures of adiposity, and more severe hot flashes. We estimated 3 LH trajectories. The low LH trajectory (29.6%) showed LH declined over time, the moderate LH trajectory (56.0%) initially declined then increased 30 years after menopause, and the high LH trajectory (14.4%) initially decline then steeply increase 30 years after menopause. The moderate and high LH trajectory groups had lower measures of adiposity at baseline.

Conclusion

There is variability in gonadotropin levels during the postmenopausal period in women not using hormone therapy. Research is needed to study whether postmenopausal gonadotropin patterns are associated with aging-related outcomes.

### Frequency of anovulation and early menopause among women enrolled in selected adult AIDS clinical trials group studies [^114WFrzb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To obtain information on the prevalence of anovulation and early menopause and on pituitary-gonadal function among human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected women, a study was undertaken that used stored serum samples from women aged 20–42 years who participated in selected Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocols. Defined progesterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were considered presumptive evidence of ovulation and of menopause, respectively. Anovulation occurred in 16 (48%) of 33 women for whom progesterone levels were tested; early menopause occurred in 2 (8%) of 24 women for whom FSH levels were tested. No statistically significant differences were seen in the demographic and clinical characteristics of anovulatory and ovulatory women, although women who ovulated had higher CD4 T cell counts and were less likely to have reported a recent change in menstrual periods. These data support the findings of prior studies of increased frequency of amenorrhea and/or irregular menstrual cycles, particularly among women with lower CD4 T cell counts.

### Testing and interpreting measures of ovarian reserve: a committee opinion [^116F5BHL]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Antimüllerian hormone (AMH) — characteristics and clinical role: Serum concentrations of AMH are gonadotropin independent and remain relatively consistent within and between menstrual cycles in both normal, young, ovulating women and women with infertility; AMH levels may be decreased in women currently using hormonal contraceptives and should be interpreted with caution in those patients. AMH is a more sensitive measure of ovarian reserve than FSH and tends to decline before FSH rises; for this reason, AMH has largely replaced basal FSH and E2 level testing as a biomarker of ovarian reserve, although basal FSH and E2 levels may provide additional information in women with very low AMH levels.

### Time to the final menstrual period [^111A4RmU]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine, for a woman aged > 45 years, whether selected hormonal, health status, and demographic measures are related to the time to final menstrual period (FMP) from a point where 6 weeks separate the shortest and longest cycles experienced to date.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Volunteers in an academic research environment.

Patient(S)

Ninety-nine menstruating women aged 46 years to 55 years on entry completed menstrual diaries, gave annual blood samples, and were interviewed annually. They were observed for a mean period of 1.5 years. Seventy-seven reached FMP during observation.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Time to reach FMP from the date of a marker event-the difference between the longest and shortest of recent cycles reaching 6 weeks.

Result(S)

Women self-rating as in the transition have a greater "hazard" or probability of FMP at any time after the marker event. Allowing for this and other covariates, the hazard is estimated to increase by 30% (confidence interval [CI]: 10%, 60%) for each year of age and 50% (CI: 7%, 118%) for each unit increase in log FSH, measured at the time of the marker event.

Conclusion(S)

For women aged > 45 years, the time remaining in the menopausal transition from the day on which ≥ 6 weeks separate the longest and shortest recent cycles is related to self-rating of menopausal status and to serum FSH level. The median number of months remaining ranges from 11 for those with FSH of > 20 IU/L and who see themselves as in transition to 21 months for those with lower FSH and who notice little evidence of being in transition.

### The menopausal transition – endocrinology [^112axZTg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Melbourne Women's MidLife Health Project (MWMHP) and related studies have yielded valuable information regarding the endocrine changes of the menopausal transition, which are summarized in this review.

Aim

To describe the endocrinology of the menopause transition.

Main Outcome Measures

Includes changes in inhibins A and B, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol, cross-sectionally in regularly cycling volunteers, and longitudinally (including testosterone) in women passing through the menopause transition.

Methods

Early follicular phase hormone concentrations were measured by well-characterized immunoassays in normal volunteers aged 20–50 years, and in 438 subjects initially recruited between ages 45 and 55 for a longitudinal study of the menopause transition, the MWMHP, in which annual blood samples were obtained. The data summarized here includes the first 6 years of follow-up. These volunteers also recorded menstrual cycle data and responded to detailed annual questionnaires.

Results

In regularly cycling female volunteers aged more than 40 years, it was established that inhibin B is a significant determinant of circulating FSH levels. From the MWMHP, the central endocrine event marking the onset of menstrual irregularity was shown to be a fall in follicular phase inhibin B concentrations, with a nonsignificant rise in FSH and no change in estradiol or inhibin A. Cross-sectional analysis of data from women in the early stages of the MWMHP showed a wide variation in circulating FSH levels, irrespective of menopausal status, indicating that single FSH measurements provide little useful information regarding menopausal status. Based on the prospective determination of the date of final menses (FMP), it was shown that estradiol levels begin to fall and FSH levels to rise about 2 years before FMP. At the time of FMP, FSH levels were approximately 50% of those ultimately reached postmenopausally, while estradiol had fallen by approximately 50% from reproductive age levels. Despite a major decline in sexual function, as women transited the menopause, there was no significant decline in circulating testosterone levels, the decline in sexual function being correlated with the decline in estradiol, not testosterone. Analysis of data from related studies showed that endocrinologically normal ovulatory cycles could be observed in women who had already experienced cycle irregularity, even more than 3 months of amenorrhea, and could occur close to or at the time of FMP.

Conclusions

An extensive database on the endocrinology of the menopause transition, including both cross-sectional and longitudinal information, has been obtained.
