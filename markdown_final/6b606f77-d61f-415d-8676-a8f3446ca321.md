## Question

Bacterial vaginosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bacterial vaginosis: how to diagnose it, what the first‑line treatments are, how to manage recurrent disease, whether to treat partners, what to do in pregnancy, and what emerging therapies might matter. Let's break this down step‑by‑step. First, I need to think about defining BV and confirming why it matters. Then, I should verify the best diagnostic criteria and a practical workflow. Next, I will review first‑line regimens and selection nuances, followed by a careful look at recurrent BV strategies. After that, I should examine partner management data and pregnancy modifications. Finally, I will consider safety, resistance, and future directions, while self‑checking key points against guidelines and pivotal trials as I go [^112iwPBi].

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. BV is a polymicrobial vaginal dysbiosis with depletion of protective Lactobacillus species and overgrowth of anaerobes such as Gardnerella and Prevotella, and it is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive‑age women, carrying increased risks for adverse reproductive outcomes and STI/HIV acquisition, so I need to ensure our approach balances symptom control and mitigation of sequelae [^112iwPBi] [^111aLKtC].

> I need to verify the diagnostic standards. The laboratory gold standard remains the Gram stain with Nugent scoring, whereas the bedside clinical standard uses Amsel criteria, requiring at least three of homogeneous thin discharge, vaginal pH > 4.5, positive whiff test with KOH, and presence of clue cells, and I should remind myself that FDA labeling for intravaginal metronidazole and clindamycin also embeds these criteria operationally, which helps standardize diagnosis at the point of care [^111hK5ws] [^114gb27d] [^1151SPZz]. Wait, let me verify the role of molecular diagnostics: NAATs and sequencing‑based assays are increasingly available and informative for research and prognostication, but they are not yet the clinical standard of care for routine diagnosis, so I should not overstate their role in everyday practice [^112iwPBi].

> Next, I should set a practical diagnostic workflow. I will take a targeted sexual and OB/GYN history, assess douching and recent antibiotics, perform a speculum exam with pH testing, whiff test, and microscopy for clue cells, consider a Gram stain for Nugent scoring where available or validated point‑of‑care tests, and ensure I exclude other causes such as Trichomonas and Candida to avoid anchoring on a single diagnosis prematurely [^114gb27d] [^116ecoQF]. Hold on, I should verify that syndromic management alone can miss coinfections; CDC guidance emphasizes appropriate testing where feasible, which aligns with ruling out concurrent vaginitis and cervicitis etiologies [^116ecoQF].

> Now, I will examine first‑line treatment in nonpregnant patients. CDC‑recommended regimens include oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, or metronidazole 0.75% gel 5 g intravaginally daily for 5 days, or clindamycin 2% cream 5 g intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days, with comparable short‑term efficacy across nitroimidazole and clindamycin options, and equivalent failure rates between metronidazole and clindamycin in meta‑analysis at early follow‑up [^116ecoQF] [^115sSA9Z]. Let me double‑check single‑dose options: secnidazole 2 g oral granules once is FDA‑approved and listed by CDC among alternatives, which can help adherence‑challenged situations, and tinidazole regimens are acceptable second‑line options per CDC guidance [^113VnMeJ] [^117Xmr7W] [^114fsSas]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized alcohol avoidance to all nitroimidazoles; I need to be precise: the secnidazole label specifically advises avoiding alcohol during treatment and for at least 2 days afterward, whereas counseling for metronidazole has evolved and should follow local labeling and practice standards, so I will avoid over‑claiming here [^117Xmr7W] [^116ecoQF].

> Let me consider regimen selection and counseling to optimize outcomes. Route choice (oral vs intravaginal), adherence likelihood, cost and access, prior adverse reactions, and patient preference all matter, and I should counsel on using condoms or abstaining during therapy, avoiding douching, and recognizing that short‑term cure is similar across agents but behavior such as abstinence or consistent condom use and refraining from douching correlates with improved cure in the early post‑treatment window, which I should emphasize in shared decision‑making [^116ecoQF] [^116XWrAk]. I need to ensure I also discuss that intravaginal nitroimidazoles and clindamycin can predispose to secondary candidiasis in some suppressive strategies, so patients know when to report new pruritus or cottage‑cheese discharge promptly [^114xe75Z].

> Turning to recurrence, I should define the burden clearly. Despite initial cure rates around 70–85% within a month, up to 50–60% of women experience recurrence within 6–12 months, likely due to biofilm persistence, incomplete Lactobacillus restoration, sexual reinfection dynamics, and potentially antimicrobial resistance, so I must plan beyond a single acute course for those with repeated episodes [^116Ac4vJ] [^112xu3YB]. Hold on, I should verify microbiologic dynamics: rapid shifts occur with nitroimidazole therapy, but Gardnerella may clear more slowly and rebound, consistent with the biofilm hypothesis, which supports considering suppressive or adjunctive strategies in selected patients [^1118PQ7X].

> For evidence‑based recurrent BV management, I will start by confirming the diagnosis again and addressing behaviors, then consider either a prolonged course of metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 10–14 days for a first recurrence or moving to suppressive therapy. Suppressive 0.75% metronidazole gel twice weekly for 16 weeks significantly reduces on‑treatment recurrence versus placebo, although candidiasis is more common, and the benefit attenuates after stopping, which I should frame realistically when setting expectations [^114xe75Z]. Let me also review adjunctive options: vaginal Lactobacillus crispatus CTV‑05 (Lactin‑V) following standard therapy reduced 12‑week recurrence in a phase 2b RCT, suggesting microbiome restoration can be beneficial, although access may be limited outside trials, and antibiofilm agents remain largely investigational at this time [^1146PqoV] [^112fqYRd].

> I will now examine microbial predictors that might refine risk counseling. Higher pretreatment abundance of Prevotella and persistence or rebound of Gardnerella immediately post‑treatment have been associated with increased short‑term recurrence risk, while a greater relative presence of Lactobacillus post‑treatment is favorable, which reinforces the notion that timing and microbiome state shortly after antibiotics matter for prognosis and might guide intensity of follow‑up [^1125B53B] [^111nhBpc]. I should double‑check behavioral correlates too: having an untreated regular sexual partner was associated with greater recurrence risk in microbiome‑linked analyses, again pointing to the reinfection versus relapse interplay I must discuss with patients [^116c6dEb].

> Partner management is often asked about, so let me think this through carefully. The biologic and epidemiologic rationale for sexual transmission is compelling, but the most rigorous trial to date found no overall reduction in female recurrence when male partners received 7 days of oral metronidazole versus placebo, although better adherence among treated men correlated with less female treatment failure, and current international guidelines recommend against routine partner treatment outside research or exceptional circumstances, so I should not default to partner antibiotics in standard care [^112CQfWe] [^114Dz9ZQ] [^116LmS3w]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in highly selected couples with frequent recurrences and high likelihood of adherence, a synchronized trial of partner therapy with strict condom use during treatment may be considered with shared decision‑making and clear discussion of uncertain benefit, but this is not guideline‑endorsed routine practice, and condoms during and just after treatment remain a reasonable harm‑reduction strategy regardless [^112CQfWe] [^114Dz9ZQ].

> Pregnancy requires a distinct lens, so I will verify the screening and treatment stance. Do not routinely screen or treat asymptomatic pregnant patients to prevent adverse outcomes, but do test and treat symptomatic BV, and consider treatment in those at increased risk such as prior preterm birth, recognizing that overall antibiotic treatment does not reduce preterm birth in the general pregnant population, though treatment before 20 weeks may confer benefit in some analyses, which I should contextualize when counseling [^114R1i6a] [^1118uXGb] [^111Y9niF] [^114H3Y9u]. I need to ensure regimen choice is appropriate: oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or oral clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for 7 days are preferred, and if treatment is intended to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, avoid topical regimens for that specific purpose, as evidence for benefit is lacking in that context [^114pLHUK] [^114kX2MY].

> Safety and resistance merit a quick check. Metronidazole and clindamycin remain effective, with Cochrane showing similar short‑term failure rates, and historical susceptibility data suggest very low baseline metronidazole resistance among vaginal anaerobes, though clindamycin exposure may select for resistance among anaerobes, so stewardship and diagnosis confirmation matter, especially with repeated courses and in recurrent disease where suppressive strategies may be preferred over endless empiric repeats [^115sSA9Z] [^114Geo5n]. Let me verify labeling considerations: metronidazole extended‑release is FDA‑indicated for BV in nonpregnant women and should be used for proven or strongly suspected susceptible infections, which aligns with confirming diagnosis rather than reflexive retreatment [^114Rr35y].

> Next, I should review follow‑up and quality‑of‑care points. In recurrent presentations, I must re‑evaluate the diagnosis against standardized criteria rather than perpetuating empiric antibiotics, consider microscopy or Gram stain where feasible, and plan structured follow‑up, as recommended by SOGC and international guidelines, especially if stepping into longer or suppressive regimens or adjunctive probiotics [^111hK5ws] [^115AVAen] [^112B4ctM]. Let me reconsider the role of newer diagnostics one more time: while NAAT‑based and sequencing approaches are informative and may yield prognostic insights, they are not yet routine replacements for Amsel/Nugent in most clinical settings, so I should deploy them judiciously where available and validated [^112iwPBi].

> Finally, I will keep an eye on emerging therapies. Antibiofilm strategies are a promising frontier but largely preclinical, underscoring the current reality that optimizing existing regimens, behavior counseling, and selective use of suppressive therapy or probiotics are the most evidence‑based tools we have today, and future trials will need to integrate partnership dynamics and microbiome endpoints to move the needle on sustained cure [^112fqYRd] [^111HNDm7]. But wait, what if I am missing a simpler lever? Reinforcing condom use during treatment windows, discouraging douching, aligning regimen to adherence realities like single‑dose secnidazole when appropriate, and considering early follow‑up to catch early microbiome relapse may together yield incremental gains while we await better biofilm‑targeted options [^113VnMeJ] [^116XWrAk].

> Putting this together, my stepwise plan is to confirm BV with Amsel/Nugent and exclude coinfections, treat with a first‑line CDC regimen tailored to patient preferences and adherence, counsel on behaviors that improve cure, and for recurrences, escalate to extended or suppressive strategies and consider adjunctive Lactobacillus crispatus where accessible, reserving partner treatment for select, highly adherent couples after shared decision‑making and avoiding routine partner antibiotics, while modifying approach in pregnancy to treat symptomatic cases with oral regimens and avoiding routine screening, and all along, I will double‑check guidance updates and individual risk factors to refine the plan at follow‑up [^116ecoQF] [^114xe75Z] [^1146PqoV] [^114Dz9ZQ] [^114R1i6a].

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial vaginal dysbiosis with **high recurrence** and **biofilm persistence** that complicate management. Diagnosis relies on **Amsel or Nugent criteria**, with molecular tests as adjuncts [^111hK5ws] [^112iwPBi]. First-line treatment is **metronidazole or clindamycin**, but recurrence is common; suppressive metronidazole gel or probiotics (e.g. Lactin-V) can reduce recurrence [^116ecoQF] [^114xe75Z] [^1146PqoV]. BV increases risk of HIV/STIs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, so treat symptomatic pregnant women and consider screening high-risk pregnancies [^113N2LYx] [^1118uXGb]. Partner treatment is **not routinely recommended**, but consistent condom use and avoiding douching may help prevent recurrence [^114Dz9ZQ].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

BV is characterized by a **shift from Lactobacillus dominance to anaerobes** such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., and Mobiluncus spp [^111aLKtC]. Biofilm formation, especially by Gardnerella, protects bacteria from antibiotics and the immune system, contributing to persistence and recurrence [^117Ft2sr]. Sexual activity, multiple partners, and douching are associated with BV; however, it is not classified as an STI [^111aLKtC].

---

## Clinical presentation

BV often presents with **thin, grayish-white, malodorous discharge** and vaginal irritation, itching, or burning [^111aLKtC]. Many women are asymptomatic, which complicates diagnosis and management [^111aLKtC].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on the **Amsel clinical criteria** or the **Nugent score** [^111hK5ws]. Amsel criteria require **three of four findings**: homogeneous discharge, vaginal pH > 4.5, positive whiff test, and clue cells on microscopy [^111hK5ws]. Nugent scoring uses Gram-stained smears to assess bacterial morphotypes [^111hK5ws]. Molecular diagnostics, including NAATs, are increasingly used to improve accuracy [^112iwPBi].

---

## Treatment

First-line treatments include **metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days**, metronidazole gel 0.75% intravaginally once daily for 5 days, or clindamycin cream 2% intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days [^116ecoQF]. Alternative regimens include clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, clindamycin ovules 100 mg intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days, secnidazole 2 g orally as a single dose, or tinidazole 2 g orally once daily for 2 days [^114fsSas].

---

## Recurrence and management

BV recurrence is common, with rates up to 50% within 6 months [^112xu3YB]. Factors contributing to recurrence include **biofilm persistence**, reinfection from untreated partners, and failure to restore Lactobacillus dominance [^112xu3YB]. Suppressive therapy with twice-weekly metronidazole gel significantly reduces recurrence [^114xe75Z]. Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus crispatus (Lactin-V), have shown promise in preventing recurrence [^1146PqoV].

---

## Complications

BV is associated with **increased risk of HIV and other STIs**, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, miscarriage, and postpartum endometritis [^111aLKtC]. Treatment of symptomatic pregnant women is recommended to prevent adverse outcomes.

---

## Prevention

Prevention strategies include **consistent condom use**, avoiding douching, and maintaining a healthy vaginal microbiome. Partner treatment is not routinely recommended but may be considered for recurrent cases.

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include antibiofilm agents, probiotics, and **vaginal microbiome transplantation** [^113Sasc2]. These approaches aim to disrupt biofilms, restore Lactobacillus dominance, and reduce recurrence [^1114nKdN].

---

Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal dysbiosis with significant health implications. Effective management requires **accurate diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and strategies to prevent recurrence**.

### Suppressive antibacterial therapy with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114xe75Z]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of suppressive vaginal metronidazole in reducing symptomatic episodes of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Study design**: A multicenter prospective study was conducted, starting with an initial 10-day open-label treatment using metronidazole gel. Asymptomatic responders were then randomly assigned to receive metronidazole vaginal gel or placebo twice weekly for 16 weeks, followed by 12 weeks off therapy.

- **Results**: Of 157 eligible women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis, 112 of 127 returning evaluable women (88.2%) responded clinically and were randomly assigned. During suppressive therapy, recurrent bacterial vaginosis occurred in 13 women (25.5%) receiving metronidazole and 26 (59.1%) receiving placebo [RR 0.43, CI = 0.25–0.73, P = 0.001]. Across the entire 28-week follow-up, recurrence was noted in 26 (51.0%) of those on treatment compared to 33 (75%) on placebo [RR 0.68, CI = 0.49–0.93, P = 0.02]. The probability of remaining cured was 70% for those on metronidazole compared to 39% on placebo, declining to 34% and 18%, respectively, by the 28-week follow-up. Adverse effects were uncommon; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis was significantly more frequent in metronidazole-treated women [P = 0.02].

- **Conclusion**: Suppressive therapy with twice-weekly metronidazole gel significantly reduces the recurrence rate of bacterial vaginosis; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis is common.

### Randomized trial of Lactin-V to prevent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis [^1146PqoV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis affects 15 to 50% of women of reproductive age, and recurrence is common after treatment with an antibiotic agent. The high incidence of recurrence suggests the need for new treatments to prevent bacterial vaginosis recurrence.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial to evaluate the ability of *Lactobacillus crispatus* CTV-05 (Lactin-V) to prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. Women 18 to 45 years of age who had received a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and who had completed a course of vaginal metronidazole gel as part of the eligibility requirements were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive vaginally administered Lactin-V or placebo for 11 weeks; follow-up occurred through week 24. The primary outcome was the percentage of women who had a recurrence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12.

- **Results**: A total of 228 women underwent randomization: 152 to the Lactin-V group and 76 to the placebo group; of these participants, 88% in the Lactin-V group and 84% in the placebo group could be evaluated for the primary outcome. In the intention-to-treat population, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12 occurred in 46 participants (30%) in the Lactin-V group and in 34 participants (45%) in the placebo group (risk ratio after multiple imputation for missing responses, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.87; P = 0.01). The risk ratio for recurrence by week 24 (also calculated with multiple imputation for missing responses) was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.92). At the 12-week visit, L. cr

### High recurrence rates of bacterial vaginosis over the course of 12 months after oral metronidazole therapy and factors associated with recurrence [^112xu3YB]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We wished to determine recurrences of bacterial vaginosis (BV) after treatment over the course of 12 months and to establish factors associated with recurrence.

- **Methods**: Women with symptomatic BV (a Nugent score [NS] of 7–10 or of 4–6 with ≥ 3 Amsel criteria) were enrolled. BV was treated with 400 mg of oral metronidazole twice a day for 7 days. Participants completed a questionnaire and vaginal swabs were collected at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; the study endpoint was an NS of 7–10.

- **Results**: A total of 121 (87%) women with an NS of 7–10 and 18 (13%) with an NS of 4–6 and ≥ 3 Amsel criteria were enrolled; 130 (94%) returned ≥ 1 vaginal sample. Sixty-eight women (58% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 49%-66%]) had a recurrence of BV (NS 7–10), and 84 (69% [95% CI, 61%-77%]) had a recurrence of abnormal vaginal flora (NS 4–10) by 12 months. A past history of BV, a regular sex partner throughout the study, and female sex partners were significantly associated with recurrence of BV and abnormal vaginal flora by multivariate analysis; the use of hormonal contraception had a negative association with recurrence.

- **Conclusion**: Recommended treatment is not preventing the recurrence of BV or abnormal vaginal flora in the majority of women; factors associated with recurrence support a possible role for sexual transmission in the pathogenesis of reBV.

### State of the art for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^112iwPBi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among reproductive-age women and is associated with various adverse health outcomes, including an increased risk of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as adverse birth outcomes. Although it is known that BV is a vaginal dysbiosis characterized by a shift in the vaginal microbiota from protective Lactobacillus species to an increase in facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria, its exact etiology remains unknown.

The purpose of this minireview is to provide an updated overview of the range of tests currently used for the diagnosis of BV in both clinical and research settings.

- **Traditional BV diagnostics**: Discusses conventional methods used for BV diagnosis.
- **Molecular diagnostics**: Focuses on advanced molecular diagnostic assays such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). It also highlights multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), given their increasing usage in clinical practice and research studies regarding the vaginal microbiota and BV pathogenesis.

Additionally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of BV diagnostic tests and explore future challenges in this field of research.

### Solosec [^117Xmr7W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage for bacterial vaginosis**: The recommended dosage of Solosec for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in female patients aged 12 years and older is a single 2-gram packet of granules taken once orally, without regard to the timing of meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Recommended dosage for trichomoniasis**: The recommended dosage of Solosec for the treatment of trichomoniasis in patients aged 12 years and older is a single 2-gram packet of granules taken once orally, without regard to the timing of meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Since trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease, sexual partners should be treated with the same dose and at the same time [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

- **Instructions for the preparation and administration of Solosec**: Open the Solosec packet by folding over the corner (marked by an arrow) and tearing across the top. Sprinkle the entire contents of the Solosec packet onto applesauce, yogurt, or pudding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The granules will not dissolve. Consume all of the mixture within 30 minutes without chewing or crunching the granules. A glass of water may be taken after the administration of Solosec to aid in swallowing. The granules are not intended to be dissolved in any liquid. Avoid consumption of alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol during treatment with Solosec and for at least 2 days after completing therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Treatment of bacterial vaginosis before 28 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the incidence of preterm labor [^114H3Y9u]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the benefits of treating bacterial vaginosis (BV) during pregnancy to reduce the incidence of preterm labor (PTL).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether treatment of BV with vaginal clindamycin or oral metronidazole before 28 weeks of pregnancy reduces PTL incidence.

- **Search strategy**: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, CENTRAL, and SciELO databases were searched until December 30, 2017. Search terms included "bacterial vaginosis" and "preterm labor". No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials that evaluated treatment of BV with clindamycin or metronidazole to reduce PTL incidence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The risk of PTL was evaluated by the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous data from each study were combined for meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel model.

- **Main results**: Nine reports were included in the systematic review, with eight reports included in the meta-analysis. No reduction in the incidence of PTL was found for either metronidazole (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71–1.25) or clindamycin (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75–1.36).

- **Conclusions**: Use of oral metronidazole or vaginal clindamycin to treat BV before 28 weeks of pregnancy did not reduce the incidence of PTL. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018086173.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^111nhBpc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a secondary analysis of vaginal microbiota data and accompanying clinical and behavioral data collected from women who participated in three clinical trials at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC), Australia, evaluating new interventions for improving BV cure: Strategies to Prevent BV (SToPBV), StepUp-1, and StepUp-2. The parent trials have been described elsewhere. In brief, SToPBV was an open-label randomized controlled trial of combined oral contraceptive pill use following first-line antibiotic treatment to prevent BV recurrence. StepUp-1 and StepUp-2 were open-label single-arm pilot studies that assessed the acceptability and tolerability of male partner treatment for BV and its impact on the genital microbiota of couples. The supplementary material details the interventions assessed in the parent studies.

Across the three studies, women presenting to MSHC were eligible to participate if they were diagnosed with BV (defined as ≥ 3 Amsel criteria and Nugent score [NS] = 4–10) and received first-line treatment (oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for seven days, or if contraindicated, clindamycin 2% vaginal cream applied intravaginally nocte for seven nights or metronidazole 0.75% gel applied intravaginally nocte for five nights). Additional study-specific eligibility criteria were applied. Of note, women were eligible for SToPBV if they were not currently using hormonal contraception and had no combined oral contraceptive pill–related contraindications. Women were eligible for the StepUp studies if they met the specified criteria.

### Metronidazole [^114Rr35y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole extended-release 750 mg tablets are indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in non-pregnant women. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of metronidazole extended-release tablets and other antibacterial drugs, these tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

- **Culture and susceptibility information**: When available, this information should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### The effect of introduction of a guideline on the management of vaginal discharge and in particular bacterial vaginosis in primary care [^1161vd78]. Family Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge, and its association with obstetric and gynecological complications is increasingly recognized. It was our impression that BV was poorly understood and underdiagnosed in family practice. The aim of this study was to explore the management of patients with vaginal symptoms by family practitioners and to determine if the management changed after the assimilation of best practice guidelines.

- **Method**: Family practitioners were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire of their perceived practice and to record actual practice when consulted about vaginal symptoms for a minimum of four weeks. Consensus best practice guidelines were then provided, and practice recorded for a similar period.

- **Results**: Baseline data was received from 34 practitioners and suggested that the symptoms and signs of different vaginal infections were not well known. Most symptomatic patients were only investigated at re-presentation with unresolved symptoms or at recurrence, and 43% of respondents treated with empirical antifungals as a first-line approach. Pregnant patients were only occasionally asked about symptoms and only occasionally examined if symptomatic. Pre-guideline practice data from 30 practitioners showed 1.2 patient consultations per week, of which 60% were examined and 55% had a high vaginal swab (HVS) sent. Only 2% had near-patient tests done. Post-guideline data from 23 family practitioners indicated a lower recorded consultation rate at 0.7 per week, but 90% of these were examined, and 77% had an HVS sent.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114fsSas]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bacterial vaginosis, and more specifically in respect to antibiotic therapy, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend offering any of the following regimens as second-line therapy in patients with BV:

- **Clindamycin 300 mg**: PO BID for 7 days.
- **Clindamycin ovules 100 mg**: Intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days.

### Current treatment of bacterial vaginosis-limitations and need for innovation [^1166JtZJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Practitioners and patients alike widely recognize the limitations of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Options remain extremely limited, and our inability to prevent the frequently, often relentless, symptomatic recurrences of BV and to reduce serious sequelae such as preterm delivery remains an acknowledged but unresolved shortcoming. Our incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this unique form of vaginal dysbiosis has been a significant impediment to developing optimal treatment and prevention approaches.

New drugs have not been forthcoming and are not likely to be available in the immediate future; hence, reliance on the optimal use of available agents has become essential as improvised, often unproven regimens are implemented. In this review, we will explore the limitations of currently recommended therapies, with a particular focus on the contribution of reinfection and pathogen persistence to BV recurrence and the development of interventions that target these mechanisms. Ultimately, to achieve sustained cure and effectiveness against BV-associated sequelae, it is possible that we will need approaches that combine antimicrobials with biofilm-disrupting agents and partner treatments in those at risk of reinfection.

### Clindesse [^1151SPZz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Two clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Clindesse for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study involving 144 non-pregnant female patients aged 18 to 64 with a baseline Nugent score ≥ 4, Clindesse demonstrated statistically significantly higher cure rates over placebo as measured by therapeutic cure, clinical cure, and Nugent score cure. Therapeutic cure was a composite endpoint requiring both clinical cure and Nugent score cure. Clinical cure required normal vaginal discharge, vaginal pH < 4.7, < 20% clue cells on wet mount preparation, and negative "whiff" test (detection of amine odor on addition of 10% KOH solution to a sample of the vaginal discharge). A Nugent score of 0–3 was considered a Nugent score cure. The Nugent scoring is based on microscopic examination of the Gram's stained vaginal smears for quantification of specific bacterial morphotypes. Cure rates were consistently higher for Clindesse compared to placebo.

### The effects of antimicrobial therapy on bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women [^115sSA9Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a very common cause of vaginitis, associated with a high incidence of obstetric and gynecologic complications and an increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. This has led to renewed research interest in its treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents on BV in non-pregnant women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and African Healthline (December 2007); and proceedings of relevant international conferences (from 1981 at the time of writing).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing any two or more antimicrobial agents, or antimicrobial agents with placebo or no treatment, in women with clinical or Gram-stain criteria of BV.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the original publications, while the third author cross-checked the data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four trials involving 4,422 participants were reviewed. Most examined symptomatic women only. Only seven trials analyzed results by intention to treat; we re-analyzed the remainder. Compared with placebo, clindamycin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.37). Clindamycin and metronidazole showed identical rates of treatment failure, irrespective of regimen type, at two and four-week follow-up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.46; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.18, respectively). Clindamycin tended to cause a lower rate of adverse events.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^111HNDm7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is difficult to eradicate due to BV biofilms protecting BV bacteria, such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, and other genera. With the growing understanding of biofilms, we systematically reviewed the knowledge on the efficacy of anti-BV biofilm agents.

- **Methods**: We searched literature in the Scopus, Medline, and Embase databases for empirical studies investigating substances for the treatment of BV biofilms or prevention of their recurrence and their efficacy and/or safety.

- **Results**: Of 201 unique titles, 35 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Most studies (89%) reported on preclinical laboratory research on the efficacy of experimental antibiofilm agents (80%) rather than their safety. Over 50% were published within the past 5 years. Agents were classified into 7 groups: antibiotics, antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants/surfactant components. Enzymes and probiotics were most commonly investigated. Earlier reports of antibiotics having anti-BV biofilm activity have not been confirmed. Some compounds from other classes demonstrated promising anti-BV biofilm efficacy in early studies.

- **Conclusions**: Further research is anticipated on successful antibiofilm agents. If confirmed as effective and safe in human clinical trials, they may offer a breakthrough in BV treatment. With rising antibiotic resistance, antibiofilm agents will significantly improve the standard of care for BV management.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^111wBKTy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We explored the relationship between bacterial vaginosis (BV) recurrence and the ratio of nonoptimal to optimal bacteria present in the vaginal microbiota both pretreatment and immediately posttreatment. Pretreatment, the ratios of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) to Lactobacillus, and Gardnerella to L. iners, were not associated with BV recurrence. However, immediately posttreatment, higher levels of total BVAB relative to Lactobacillus spp., and higher levels of Gardnerella relative to L. iners, were both associated with increased odds of BV recurrence (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.81], P = 0.017 and AOR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.09–1.95], P = 0.012). The ratio of pathobionts to Lactobacillus was not associated with recurrence at either time point.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^114Cnv2i]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first review to detail research evidence on different anti-BV biofilm treatments. These findings inform clinicians about developments in the field and, in turn, offer their patients hope of a long-term cure.

Several limitations of this review should be acknowledged. While publication bias was not specifically assessed, it was noted that the majority of publications reported on effective compounds. Quite likely, significant research work that has found investigative compounds ineffective remains unpublished and was consequently not captured by this review. Additionally, the heterogeneity of study designs made comparisons among findings difficult since observations in laboratory cultures and animal models are not often reflected in human subject research.

### A randomized trial of the duration of therapy with metronidazole plus or minus azithromycin for treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis [^116XWrAk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginitis worldwide. Currently recommended treatments have poor efficacy and are associated with high rates of BV recurrence. We examined whether a longer duration of treatment with metronidazole or combination therapy with metronidazole and azithromycin would enhance the cure rates for BV. In addition, we examined factors other than drug therapy associated with cure.

- **Methods**: Women with symptomatic BV (defined by a modified Amsel criteria) were enrolled in a 4-arm study that compared metronidazole for 7 days versus 14 days, plus or minus azithromycin on days 1 and 3. Data regarding interim behaviors were also obtained, as were vaginal specimens for Gram staining.

- **Results**: At the first follow-up visit (7 days after the completion of therapy), there was a significant difference in cure rates among patients who received 7 days of metronidazole therapy, compared with those who received 14 days of therapy, combined across azithromycin therapy (P = 0.0003). There was no effect associated with azithromycin therapy. There were no differences in cure rates between any of the treatment groups at 21 days after completion of therapy. Abstinence or protected sex, refraining from douching, and a lower baseline Nugent score for the vaginal Gram stain were all significantly associated with cure.

- **Conclusions**: Cure rates for BV were significantly improved by 14 days of metronidazole treatment (compared with 7 days of treatment), but the effects were not sustained, suggesting that relapse or reinfection occurred. Combination therapy with azithromycin did not enhance cure rates.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116Ac4vJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recommended first-line antimicrobial treatments, metronidazole or clindamycin, provide broad anaerobic coverage and are administered orally or intravaginally. These regimens have similar efficacy and cure approximately 70–85% of women with BV within one month; however, more than 50% experience recurrence of symptoms and/or BV on microscopy within six months. The low rate of sustained cure not only highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence, but also compounds women's distress and frustration, leading to repeated presentations to health services or adoption of unproven home remedies.

Factors including persistence of a BV-associated biofilm, failure to recolonize the vagina with lactobacilli, reinfection from an untreated partner, and host genetic and/or immune factors may all play a role in recurrence. Frustratingly for both clinicians and patients, the contribution of reinfection and vaginal relapse cannot be differentiated, as the clinical presentation of both mechanisms of recurrence is identical. Point-of-care laboratory tests cannot resolve this issue yet, and molecular methods, including next-generation sequencing, are unable to identify a unique or specific microbial signature to separate the two routes of recurrence.

While persistence or resistance of BVAB or BV biofilm following antibiotic therapy is likely to be the dominant mechanism among some women, there is robust evidence to support the exchange of both optimal and detrimental bacteria between partners during sexual activity. These data suggest that reinfection of women with pathogenic bacteria from an untreated partner could be a contributing factor to recurrence.

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from the overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.

- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition to a decrease in lactobacilli.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In non-pregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.

- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116zQFCV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal condition that affects approximately 30% of reproductive-aged women globally. While the etiology of BV has not been established, the vaginal microbiota of women with BV is typically deficient in optimal Lactobacillus spp (e.g. Lactobacillus crispatus), with high diversity and high abundance of anaerobes. Recommended treatment for BV involves antibiotic therapy with metronidazole or clindamycin, both of which provide broad coverage of anaerobes. One-month cure post-treatment is approximately 70%–85%; however, up to 50% of women experience BV recurrence within 12 weeks following antibiotics. BV recurrences are distressing for women and result in repeat presentations to clinical services and repeated antibiotic use. Furthermore, the sequelae associated with BV carry significant implications for a woman's reproductive and sexual health and impose a large economic burden.

There has been little progress made toward improving long-term BV cure, partly because the mechanisms driving BV recurrence are multifactorial and incompletely understood. Prior studies exploring the association between microbial signatures of the vaginal microbiota (i.e. diversity metrics, community types, and individual taxa) and BV treatment outcomes have produced mixed results regarding the contribution of bacterial diversity to treatment failure. Interestingly, a number of studies have reported a positive association between BV recurrence and high relative and absolute abundance of Gardnerella (or individual Gardnerella spp) pretreatment.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^115p1hzt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

What is clear now is that there is a substantial body of epidemiological and microbiological data to support the role of sexual transmission in the BV syndrome. As is the case for established STIs, prevalent BV is associated with an earlier age of sexual debut and is uncommon in women reporting no sexual activity. In a 12-month cohort study, young women engaging in penile-vaginal sex were more likely to have a vaginal microbiota dominated by Gardnerella spp. than women reporting no sex. In a cross-sectional study of 17- and 18-year-old women, the presence and abundance of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and P. bivia were associated with a history of penile-vaginal sex. Furthermore, a meta-analysis showed a positive association between increased numbers of male sexual partners or a recent change of male partner and risk of BV (relative risk [RR] = 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.8). Conversely, consistent condom use was associated with a decreased risk of BV (RR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.8–0.9).

### Treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis with tinidazole [^111CnSQY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a challenging clinical condition. In women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis, relapses are common, even after prolonged courses of maintenance therapy. Due to its spectrum of activity, tinidazole was used in a patient with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.

- **Case**: A 23-year-old woman taking oral contraceptives with a single sexual partner was treated for recurrent bacterial vaginosis with multiple courses of metronidazole gel 0.75%, including maintenance therapy regimens. The patient experienced repeated recurrences shortly after stopping treatment. However, a single course of oral tinidazole resulted in a prolonged period free of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment options for recurrent bacterial vaginosis are currently limited. Tinidazole may be a useful option in women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.

### Antimicrobial resistance associated with the treatment of bacterial vaginosis [^114Geo5n]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was undertaken to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility of vaginal anaerobic bacteria before and after treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A randomized clinical trial of 119 nonpregnant women with bacterial vaginosis receiving either intravaginal metronidazole for 5 days or clindamycin for 3 days was performed. Women had one baseline and three follow-up visits at which quantitative vaginal cultures were performed. Anaerobic isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Complete susceptibility data was available on 95 women (47 metronidazole and 48 clindamycin). Of 1059 anaerobic bacterial isolates, less than 1% demonstrated resistance to metronidazole. In contrast, 17% demonstrated baseline clindamycin resistance, and 53% demonstrated resistance to clindamycin after therapy. Women exposed to clindamycin (but not metronidazole) had high frequencies (80%) of clindamycin-resistant anaerobic bacteria that persisted for 90 days after treatment.

Treatment of bacterial vaginosis with clindamycin is associated with marked evidence of antimicrobial resistance among vaginal anaerobic bacteria, which may increase the vaginal reservoir of macrolide-resistant bacteria.

### Metronidazole vaginal [^114gb27d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole vaginal gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis.

- **Diagnosis criteria**: For the purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of:
	- A homogeneous vaginal discharge with a pH greater than 4.5.
	- A "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution.
	- Clue cells visible on microscopic examination.

- **Gram's stain results**: Consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, the results include:
	- Markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology.
	- Predominance of Gardnerella morphotype.
	- Absent or few white blood cells.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus, should be ruled out.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116c6dEb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal dysbiosis that often recurs following first-line antibiotics. This study investigated if vaginal microbiota composition was associated with BV recurrence.

- **Methods**: We analyzed samples and data from 121 women who participated in three published trials evaluating novel interventions for improving BV cure, including concurrent treatment of regular sexual partners (RSPs). Women diagnosed with BV received first-line antibiotics and self-collected vaginal swabs pretreatment and the day after finishing antibiotics (immediately posttreatment). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on vaginal samples. Logistic regression explored associations between BV recurrence and features of the vaginal microbiota pre- and posttreatment.

- **Results**: Sixteen women (13% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 8%-21%]) experienced BV recurrence within one month of treatment. Women with an untreated RSP were more likely to experience recurrence than women with no RSP (P = 0.008) or an RSP who received treatment (P = 0.011). A higher abundance of Prevotella pretreatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05–1.91]) and Gardnerella immediately posttreatment (AOR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.03–1.49]) were associated with increased odds of BV recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Having specific Prevotella spp prior to recommended treatment and the persistence of Gardnerella immediately posttreatment may contribute to the high rates of BV recurrence. Interventions that target these taxa are likely required to achieve sustained BV cure.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences, including an increased risk of acquiring others, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus-2, as well as adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes and cervical cancer risk. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or those experiencing poverty, the very groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs). U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single-dose, point-of-care treatment strategy, novel to the U.S. but evidence-based and consistent with international guidelines, to address existing deficiencies in the availability of inexpensive and accurate point-of-care diagnosis. This strategy also aims to overcome substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow-up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117DFYcd]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis affecting women globally, yet an unacceptably high proportion of women experience BV recurrence within six months of recommended antibiotic therapy. The low rate of sustained cure highlights our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence, which has been attributed to possible persistence and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) or a BV-associated biofilm following antimicrobials and/or reinfection occurring from sexual partners.

There is robust evidence supporting the exchange of bacteria between partners during sexual activity. While the hypothesis that women treated for BV are subsequently reinfected with BVAB following sex with an untreated sexual partner is not new, the failure of past partner treatment trials has eroded confidence in this concept. If reinfection is a key driver of recurrence, antimicrobial regimens directed at women alone are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure, justifying the approach of partner treatment to reduce reinfection.

In this manuscript, we present the molecular and epidemiological evidence underlying the hypothesis that BV is sexually transmitted, and we summarize why research considering sexual partnerships remains necessary. We also outline the significant barriers and challenges identified while undertaking partner treatment studies. Additionally, we discuss the factors impacting our ability to determine their effectiveness. Ultimately, the pathogenesis of BV recurrence is likely multifaceted.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^112S4V3C]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Many of the previous partner trials opted for stat 2g doses of oral metronidazole to improve adherence, and we know adherence is essential to the success of any intervention; however, the short duration of activity of this single dose may have had limited impact on the male genital microbiota. Newer single-dose nitroimidazoles approved for the treatment of BV, such as 2g oral secnidazole, have similar efficacy to metronidazole but a longer half-life and thus may be more suited to partner treatment. However, secnidazole and tinidazole have similar resistance patterns to metronidazole, and other drug classes or combinations of antimicrobials may be required to cover candidate BV pathogens.

Clindamycin, which is commonly used in women with a contraindication to nitroimidazoles but also used first-line, is a lincosamide antibiotic with broad spectrum activity against Gram-positive cocci as well as anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clindamycin has been shown to have greater efficacy than the nitroimidazoles against A. vaginae, Gardnerella spp., and Mobiluncus spp., and planktonic clinical isolates of Gardnerella exhibit a relatively higher susceptibility rate and lower resistance rate to clindamycin compared to metronidazole, suggesting clindamycin may be more optimal for reducing the abundance of Gardnerella. While the effectiveness of metronidazole and clindamycin in clearing BVAB from women is still debated, data is needed to show the effectiveness of these agents on BVAB in men.

Newer biofilm-disrupting agents, for example dequalinium chloride and TOL-463…

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117VSfPt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is clear that therapies solely directed at women have failed to achieve a high rate of sustained cure. By continuing to ignore the potential risk of sexual transmission and reinfection when evaluating the efficacy of treatments, the effectiveness of these strategies is likely to be consistently underestimated. When managing a patient with bacterial vaginosis (BV), incorporating the regular partner who may be a source of reinfection provides an opportunity to make an impact on treatment outcomes.

We need to continue to assess how antimicrobials change the genital microbiomes of both women with BV and their partners to ensure the most effective regimens are utilized. Furthermore, in order to overcome the shortcomings of past partner treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we need innovative ways to engage women with BV and their partners to ensure recruitment of monogamous couples and promote adherence to treatment. Continued research into the pathogenicity of bacteria shared between couples may assist us in developing new treatment strategies, as well as provide evidence to support partner treatment as an adjunctive therapy to improve health outcomes for women.

### Antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis [^1114xE4P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection with a prevalence ranging from 10% to 50% worldwide. BV results in an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora. Microorganisms associated with BV have been isolated from the normal flora of the male genital tract, and their presence could be related to the recurrence of BV after antibiotic treatment. Therefore, treating sexual partners could decrease the recurrence of infection and possibly reduce the burden of the disease.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness in women and the safety in men of antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women treated for BV.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialized Register (23 July 2016), CENTRAL (1991 to 23 July 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to 23 July 2016), Embase (1974 to 23 July 2016), LILACS (1982 to 23 July 2016), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (23 July 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (23 July 2016), and the Web of Science™ (2001 to 23 July 2016). We also hand-searched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors, and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any antibiotic treatment with placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention by the sexual partners of women treated for BV.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We resolved any disagreements through discussion.

### Rapid and profound shifts in the vaginal microbiota following antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis [^1118PQ7X]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common polymicrobial disease associated with numerous negative reproductive health outcomes, including an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus acquisition. BV is treatable with antibiotics, but relapse is common. A more detailed understanding of bacterial dynamics during antibiotic therapy for BV could identify conditions that favor establishment, maintenance, and eradication of BV-associated bacterial species, thereby improving treatment outcomes.

- **Methods**: We used mathematical models to analyze daily quantitative measurements of 11 key bacterial species during metronidazole treatment for 15 cases of BV.

- **Results**: We identified complete reorganization of vaginal bacterial composition within a day of initiating therapy. Although baseline bacterial levels predicted a longer time to clearance, all anaerobic species were eliminated rapidly within a median of 3 days. However, reemergence of BV-associated species was common following treatment cessation. Gardnerella vaginalis, a facultative anaerobe, was cleared more slowly than anaerobic BV-associated species, and levels of G. vaginalis often rebounded during treatment. We observed gradual Lactobacillus species growth, indicating that untargeted microbes fill the transient vacuum formed during treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Under antibiotic pressure, the human microbiome can undergo rapid shifts on a scale of hours. When treatment is stopped, BV-associated bacteria quickly reemerge, suggesting a possible role for intermittent prophylactic treatment.

### Changes in the vaginal microenvironment with metronidazole treatment for bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy [^114azSq2]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with preterm delivery, but there is little evidence that treatment improves pregnancy outcomes. This study examined whether oral or vaginal metronidazole treatment for BV in early pregnancy was more effective in restoring the normal vaginal environment.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing oral and intravaginal metronidazole for treatment of BV in early pregnancy (< 20 weeks). Vaginal samples collected at baseline and four weeks after treatment were evaluated using gram stain, culture, colorimetric detection of sialidase, and immunoassay for measurement of proinflammatory cytokines interleukins-1beta, -6, -8 (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). The effect of treatment was compared between groups (using chi-square and t test) and within individuals (McNemar's test).

- **Results**: Of the 126 subjects, 108 (86%) completed follow-up (55 oral, 53 intravaginal). Within the study population, 34% achieved therapeutic cure, and there was no significant difference between treatment groups. BV-associated bacteria were significantly reduced in both groups; however, few subjects regained colonization with protective lactobacilli. Among women who achieved therapeutic cure, the level of IL-1beta dropped significantly (p < 0.001) and SLPI increased (p = 0.003). More women in the vaginal treatment group had undetectable sialidase after treatment (p = 0.013).

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with oral or intravaginal metronidazole in early pregnancy reduced colonization with BV-associated bacteria but was not effective in achieving the full restoration of the vaginal microenvironment.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: A systematic review [^1142qKYq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Symptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) can be treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Topical alternatives include vaginal metronidazole gel and clindamycin cream. In multiple recurrences of BV, longer therapeutic courses are often recommended. Since BV treatment is based on the presence of abnormal vaginal discharge and the standard syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), asymptomatic pregnant women may tend to remain untreated due to this therapeutic approach.

In the past, several risk factors have been associated with BV, including race and ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, antibiotic therapy, multiple sex partners, smoking, and young or teenage age. However, the risk factors for BV during pregnancy are inconsistent, underreported, and often overlooked. Hence, BV risk factors are typically more prevalent among pregnant women and require further exploration. Clinicians need to understand the risk factors, symptoms, and potential sequelae of BV to monitor and treat women of reproductive age effectively.

The existence of BV among pregnant women has momentously attracted the attention of both clinicians and the scientific community due to its potential link with adverse clinical outcomes during pregnancy. BV has been associated with a higher risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery, miscarriage, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and transmission or acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and STIs. Increasing evidence indicates that vaginal microbiota (VMB) dysbiosis may be the causative reason behind the premature rupture of membranes.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116xEuEg]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is plausible that both penile skin and urethral carriage of BVAB need to be targeted to achieve sufficient clearance of BVAB from the male genitalia and impact reinfection in women. Two pilot partner treatment trials targeted BVAB in men for seven days at the distal urethra with 400 mg metronidazole bid, and at the sub-preputial space and coronal sulcus with topical 2% clindamycin cream applied bid. Treatment had an immediate effect on the composition of the penile-skin and urethral microbiota, with a decrease in the prevalence and abundance of BVAB; however, this change was not sustained at 1–3 months. Despite re-emergence of BVAB in men, the female partners of treated males experienced a significant and sustained decrease in the prevalence and abundance of BVAB to endpoint. Although not powered to detect the effect of partner treatment, the pooled BV recurrence rate among the 50 couples undergoing treatment across both trials was only 8% at 1 month and only 17% among the 29 couples followed to 3 months. Both are lower recurrence rates than would normally be expected in sexually active couples where a history of BV was common, as in other trials where recurrence among couples ranged from 40% to 80%. These data raise important questions: How effective does partner treatment need to be at reducing BVAB in men, and for what duration do the organisms need to be suppressed to elicit a positive and sustained result in the female? Effective male partner treatment may only need to disrupt the continued cycle of exposure to BVAB for a short period.

### Patient characteristics and factors contributing to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis presented in primary care [^115cZtpP]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

This study adds to the knowledge on the dismal effect of antibiotic use on vaginal dysbiosis. We suggest medical professionals take this into account when counselling patients known to have recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) when they need antibiotics for another condition. Furthermore, we suggest that general practitioners (GPs) prioritize in-person consultation over repeat prescriptions in patients with recurring complaints. Critical evaluation of the previous diagnosis is justified using standardized criteria, such as Amsel criteria, and warrants microbiological testing before treatment is initiated again, to prevent unnecessary prescriptions and further development of antibiotic resistance.

In conclusion, the present study provides tools for GPs to better recognize patients at risk of developing recurring complaints and to re-evaluate their approach to the diagnosis and treatment of reBV.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^1125B53B]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we identified specific vaginal taxa that were associated with BV recurrence within one month of treatment. Specifically, we found that a higher abundance of Prevotella spp immediately prior to treatment and Gardnerella spp immediately following treatment were both associated with increased odds of BV recurrence. Additionally, women who experienced recurrence had increased levels of BV-associated bacteria, primarily representing Gardnerella, relative to Lactobacillus spp, primarily representing L. iners, present in their vaginal microbiota immediately posttreatment compared to women who did not experience recurrence. Neither bacterial diversity nor the degree of compositional change following treatment were associated with BV recurrence. These data provide insight into key taxa that may play a role in treatment failure following recommended BV therapy.

Prevotella and Gardnerella are commonly recovered from the vaginal microbiome of women with BV, and species from both genera possess characteristics that are important for BV initiation and persistence. In vitro, Prevotella bivia has been shown to produce ammonia and amino acids, which enhance the growth of other BV-associated bacteria, including Gardnerella spp and Peptostreptococcus spp. Gardnerella, in turn, produces amino acids, which stimulate the growth of P. bivia. In addition, both Gardnerella spp and Prevotella spp produce sialidases, and there is evidence that Prevotella may be a dominant source of vaginal sialidase.

### A pilot study of treatment of bacterial vaginosis with a buffering vaginal microbicide [^111xj8yy]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an extremely common problem for women and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and HIV infection. Currently available antibiotic treatments are moderately effective but may need to be repeated frequently because of the recurrent nature of the disease. We undertook a pilot study of a buffering vaginal microbicide in the treatment of BV.

- **Methods**: Women with clinically diagnosed BV were recruited to receive seven applications (5 g per application) of BufferGel trademark (ReProtect, LLC, Baltimore, MD), a topical vaginal microbicide, and had clinical and gram stain evaluation of response. Subjects were evaluated at 2–3 days after the last application of BufferGel as a test of cure and again at 1 month to assess for relapse. Subjects with BV at test of cure were offered oral metronidazole.

- **Results**: Thirty-one women were screened, 16 were offered enrollment, and 10 completed the study. Treatment with BufferGel was clinically effective in 70% of women at 2–3 days after treatment and in 40% of women by 1-month follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that 5 g of BufferGel vaginally once a day appears to be a moderately effective treatment for BV.

### Solosec [^113VnMeJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) with similar designs were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Solosec 2 gram for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was defined by the following criteria: (a) the presence of an off-white (milky or gray), thin, homogeneous vaginal discharge; (b) a vaginal pH ≥ 4.7; (c) the presence of Clue cells ≥ 20% of the total epithelial cells on a microscopic examination of the vaginal saline wet mount; (d) a positive "whiff" test (detection of amine odor on addition of 10% KOH solution to a sample of the vaginal discharge); and (e) a Nugent score ≥ 4.

Trial 1 enrolled 144 non-pregnant female patients aged 19 to 54 years, and Trial 2 enrolled 189 non-pregnant females aged 18 to 54 years. Among the participants in both trials, 54% were Black or African American. Efficacy was assessed by the clinical outcome evaluated 21 to 30 days following a single dose of Solosec. A clinical responder was defined as having "normal" vaginal discharge, a negative "whiff" test, and clue cells < 20%. Additional endpoints included Nugent score cure (a Nugent score of 0–3) and therapeutic outcome, with a therapeutic responder defined as a clinical responder with a Nugent score cure. In Trial 2, the endpoints were also assessed at Day 7–14.

In both trials, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients experienced clinical response, Nugent score cure, and therapeutic response at 21 to 30 days following a single dose of Solosec compared to placebo. The results for the endpoints were statistically significant.

### Characterization and treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114h7Zfb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but treatable condition, with several effective treatments available, including oral and intravaginal metronidazole, clindamycin, and oral tinidazole. However, as many as 50% of women with BV experience recurrence within one year of treatment for incident disease. Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections may lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of recurrent BV are not entirely known.

Recommended treatment for recurrent BV consists of an extended course of metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice daily for 10–14 days). If ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by twice per week for 3–6 months, is an alternate treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of recurrent BV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance. Secnidazole may be an attractive new option due to its one-time dosing.

Initial studies on biofilm disruption, use of probiotics and prebiotics, and botanical treatments have shown some promise but must be studied further before use in the clinic. Despite limitations, antimicrobial therapy will remain the mainstay of treatment for recurrent BV for the foreseeable future.

### Treatment of male sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112CQfWe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The study aimed to determine if the treatment of male sexual partners of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) with oral metronidazole, administered twice daily for 7 days (i.e. multidose metronidazole), significantly decreased BV recurrence rates in females.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, 2-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled women with recurrent BV diagnosed by Amsel and Nugent criteria. Multidose metronidazole for 7 days was dispensed to the women. Male partners were randomized to receive either a placebo or multidose metronidazole for 7 days and were asked to refrain from unprotected sex for 14 days. Female follow-up visits were conducted on day 21, and at 8 and 16 weeks. Male follow-up visits occurred between days 14–21. BV cure was defined by 0–2 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 0–6 in the female partner, with the primary endpoint at 16 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 214 couples were enrolled. In the intent-to-treat population, there was no significant difference between treatment arms for the primary outcome. BV treatment failure occurred in 81% and 80% of women in the metronidazole and placebo arms, respectively, through the third follow-up visit (P > .999). However, women whose male partners adhered to the study medication were less likely to experience treatment failure (adjusted relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.99; p = 0.035). This finding persisted in post hoc comparisons in the metronidazole arm.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, the study did not find that treatment of male partners with multidose metronidazole significantly reduces BV recurrence in female partners. However, women whose partners adhered to the multidose metronidazole regimen were less likely to fail treatment.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^112uReir]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a neglected and poorly treated condition with a significant burden for women worldwide. In Australia, a BV prevalence of 12% was reported, compared to 30% in North America and over 50% in southern and eastern Africa. Women of reproductive age are most affected.

BV is a polymicrobial condition with a complex pathophysiology where the native vaginal microbiome, mainly *Lactobacillus* species, is disrupted by increased numbers of *Gardnerella* species, such as *G. vaginalis* and *G. swidsinskii/leopoldi*, which grow together in biofilms with *Prevotella* species, such as *P. bivia*. Significant adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes are associated with BV, including miscarriage, preterm labor, preterm rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

BV treatment has changed very little since metronidazole was first introduced 40 years ago. Owing to teratogenic concerns with metronidazole during that time, clindamycin was added as an alternative in the late 1980s. Standard-of-care treatment with one of these antibiotics can achieve an initial cure rate between 80% and 90%. However, more than half of all patients experienced recurrence within 6 months, and up to 80% within 9 months of treatment. With the general increase in antimicrobial resistance, repeated use of antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent BV is clearly unsustainable.

Several factors are believed to play a role in the high recurrence rates, such as the ineffective penetration of these antibiotics.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^112u1cXw]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There is long-standing evidence to support the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis (BV). In the 1950s, Gardner and Dukes first characterized BV and hypothesized that "husbands must be treated simultaneously if recurrences by reinfection are to be prevented". When vaginal discharge from women with BV was transferred to those without, 11 out of 15 women developed clinical signs and microbiological features of BV, indicating the BV syndrome was infectious.

Initially, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from women with BV and hypothesized to be a new sexually transmitted infection (STI) responsible for the syndrome. However, when 13 "healthy" women were inoculated with pure cultures of G. vaginalis, which were incubated for 24 hours prior to inoculation and in the stationary phase of growth, only one developed BV. In a subsequent study, which used fresh cultures of G. vaginalis incubated for 12 hours prior to inoculation and during the late logarithmic phase of growth, 5 out of 9 women developed the BV syndrome. This finding suggests that the phase of growth and environmental signals may control the expression of bacterial virulence factors that confer a greater pathogenic potential to G. vaginalis. This is supported by more recent evidence.

In support of the initial hypothesis that G. vaginalis is the etiologic agent responsible for BV, it was isolated from the urethra of 91 out of 101 husbands of women with BV, but only 1 out of 38 male medical students. Successive studies also isolated G. vaginalis from the urethra of male partners of women with BV.

Regarding specific circumstances for bacterial vaginosis, more specifically concerning pregnant patients, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering metronidazole 500 mg PO BID for 7 days or clindamycin 300 mg PO BID for 7 days if treatment for the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes is used. Do not use topical (vaginal) therapy for this indication.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^111Y9niF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes and, in particular, preterm birth (PTB). Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of PTB and its consequences.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (May 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trials and extracted data independently. We contacted study authors for additional information.

- **Main results**: We included fifteen trials of good quality, involving 5888 women. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.20; 10 trials, 4357 women). Treatment did not reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (Peto OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 15 trials, 5888 women) or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) (Peto OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.28; four trials, 2579 women). However, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation may reduce the risk of preterm birth less than 37 weeks (Peto OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.84; five trials, 2387 women).

### Prognostic indicators of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis [^114KC3PS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Recurrence rates of bacterial vaginosis (BV) are extremely high following all forms of therapy. Various diagnostic tests are available to differentiate BV from other vaginal disorders; however, none predict recurrence after treatment, nor are they validated for monitoring ongoing responses to treatment. This study aimed to determine which tests, and at what optimal times, possess prognostic value in predicting recurrence.

A prospective cohort study monitored 74 highly recurrent BV (reBV) patients for up to nine months. Symptomatic BV patients were treated with oral metronidazole and evaluated at cessation of treatment and monthly intervals. Index tests included Amsel, Nugent, BV Blue, and Affirm VPIII, as well as a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based test under initial evaluation in this study.

- **Prognostic performance**: The qPCR-based LbRC (Lactobacillus Relative Composition) assay predicted BV recurrence when performed shortly after oral metronidazole treatment. It demonstrated both 90% positive predictive values (PPV) and 74% negative predictive values (NPV). Nugent scores showed 93% PPV but poor NPV at 57%. No other test, at any subsequent time, was found to be prognostic.

The LbRC assay, and to a lesser extent, Nugent tests performed a week after oral metronidazole, predicted recurrence. This suggests that the recurrence in this cohort was predominantly due to relapse caused by incomplete restoration of eubiosis soon after therapy. This is the first study in an under-evaluated population of reBV patients highlighting the necessity for and potential pathway to a prognostic modality due to the high recurrence rates of BV.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^117Vf9oX]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

The study results and associated clinical data were previously published, and all data provided were de-identified for this study. The original clinical study protocol was approved by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Pro #00006122) with a waiver of oversight from the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT01347632).

A total of 69 women were screened from symptomatic discharge, and 35 women were enrolled in the study. Vaginal microbiota data were generated by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, providing taxonomic resolution at the general level. Thirty-three women completed all three visits. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was evaluated by vaginal microbiota compositional data (molecular-BV).

- **Treatment protocol**: After biological samples were obtained at visit 1 (V1), women with BV were prescribed twice daily, 500-mg metronidazole (MNZ) for 7 days. Participants returned for visit 2 (V2) 7–10 days after completing the course of MNZ therapy and visit 3 (V3) 28–32 days after completing treatment.

- **Sample evaluation**: At all three visits, samples were obtained to evaluate vaginal semen (ABAcard, West Hills, CA), vaginal pH, gram stain for Nugent score, and semiquantitative vaginal flora culture. Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples were collected, followed by vaginal swabs and three full-thickness biopsies.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113Sasc2]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Ultimately, however, the pathogenesis of BV recurrence is complex, with reinfection likely to be important but not the sole driver of recurrence. In some women, vaginal relapse (i.e. the re-emergence or persistence of BVAB) may be the dominant mechanism. There has been considerable focus recently on new therapeutic approaches aimed at biofilm eradication, thereby removing the protected sanctuary containing bacterial pathogens and potentially eliminating a mechanism of BVAB persistence. Some of these approaches are included as alternative treatments in guidelines.

Similarly, evidence of antimicrobial resistance is reported; however, its contribution to recurrence is unclear, and new antimicrobial drug classes have not been forthcoming. The development of new molecular assays, which diagnose BV based on the specific pathogenic bacterial strains or the presence of antimicrobial resistance, may ultimately result in more precise and targeted therapies to improve cure.

Given the failure of therapeutic solutions, the approach of partner treatment to prevent reinfection is justified. However, it is apparent to clinicians and researchers that a combination of strategies is likely required to achieve sustained cure and support the restoration of a vaginal microbiota associated with optimal sexual and reproductive health. This may involve the combined use, for example, of agents to disrupt BV biofilm, more effective delivery of antibiotics, partner treatment, and vaginal microbiome transplantation from 'healthy' donors with a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^113zCB82]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Literature search results**: Of 333 articles identified (Figure 1), 201 unique titles and abstracts were screened against inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 1), and 49 proceeded to full-text review. Of those, 13 were excluded due to the investigation of non–BV-associated bacteria or for not studying BV-specific biofilms. Two articles, despite meeting all selection criteria, were additionally excluded during data extraction as their results could not be adequately extracted. Citation chaining yielded 1 additional eligible reference, bringing the final number of publications to 35.

- **Characteristics of included publications**: All articles were published in English, starting from 1998. Over 50% (n = 18) were published in the past 5 years (January 2017–May 2023). Of 35 publications, 18 originated in Europe (Germany and Portugal, 5 each; United Kingdom, 3; Austria and Italy, 2 each; Belgium, 1), 9 from North America (United States, 7; Canada, 2), and 8 from Asia (China, 6; Korea and Taiwan, 1 each).

- **Research settings and experimental focus**: The studies were predominantly carried out on laboratory cell cultures, reflecting the early stage of research (Table 2). The types of research facilities conducting experiments were not described; however, the author affiliations suggest a variety of settings, such as university, hospital, and industrial research laboratories. Experimental agents were predominantly used alone and mostly to eradicate BV biofilms rather than prevent their formation. Nine studies sought to evaluate the efficacy of the investigative therapeutic in combination with other antimicrobials.

### Vaginitis: Diagnosis and treatment [^112C9UWw]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases.

Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin.

The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplificat…

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1114nKdN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The ongoing search for new therapeutics against bacterial vaginosis has been complicated by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and the role of biofilms. Numerous promising agents are being investigated, and findings indicate that the application of anti-BV biofilm agents may bring a potential breakthrough in the treatment of BV; however, this field is still predominantly in the preclinical stages of research. With concerns about antibiotic resistance, action is urgently needed to advance the study of these diverse antibiofilm agents into animal and human trials. Unfortunately, the absence of optimal animal models for BV is slowing the momentum of this critical development.

### The biofilm in bacterial vaginosis: Implications for epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment [^117Ft2sr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Recent evidence supports the view that bacterial vaginosis presents as a polymicrobial biofilm infection. This has far-reaching implications for the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Recent findings**: Gardnerella vaginalis is presumably the first species to adhere to the vaginal epithelium and then becomes the scaffolding to which other species adhere. Not all G. vaginalis strains form biofilms: G. vaginalis can be present in the vagina in a planktonic or biofilm mode of growth. The presence of planktonic (dispersed) or biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis can be reliably shown in urine sediments in both women and men, and there is an absolute concordance in the carriage of biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis between women with bacterial vaginosis and their partners. In-vitro data suggest that selected probiotic lactobacilli might be an effective means to conquer the biofilm.

- **Summary**: Future epidemiological research may benefit from biofilm-based urine diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis to a significant extent. The search for novel therapeutic agents can now be more directed towards the biofilm-breaking agents but is currently hampered by the lack of a proper in-vitro model of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.
