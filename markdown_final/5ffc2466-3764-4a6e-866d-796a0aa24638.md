## Question

patient with DM-2 with ckd-3a, What is the best therapy zocor or atorvastatin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statin is the better choice for a patient with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage 3a: simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin, and what the evidence‑based rationale and dosing strategy should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's cardiovascular risk category and LDL‑C targets in diabetes with CKD. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines prefer as first‑line statin in diabetic CKD and why. Next, I will compare simvastatin and atorvastatin on potency, pharmacokinetics, renal considerations, and drug–drug interactions. After that, I will examine clinical trial and meta‑analytic data, including CKD‑specific outcomes and any renal effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with dosing, escalation, and monitoring, and consider when to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibition if LDL‑C remains above target.

> Let me first confirm baseline risk and LDL‑C targets. Diabetes plus CKD G3a confers very high atherosclerotic risk, and European guidance recommends intensive LDL‑C lowering with statins toward an LDL‑C goal generally below 70 mg/dL for CKD G3, alongside at least a 50% reduction from baseline when feasible, which justifies high‑intensity therapy in many such patients [^1163iZ99] [^115N7LgC] [^113SCkQV]. I should also note that KDIGO supports statin or statin/ezetimibe for adults ≥ 50 years with non‑dialysis CKD regardless of baseline LDL‑C, emphasizing absolute risk over lipid thresholds, which fits this case [^1179Lk3M] [^111HDmj7].

> Next, I should review which statin guidelines actually prefer in diabetic CKD. Hold on, I need to check contemporary nephro‑diabetes guidance. The ABCD‑UKKA 2024 guideline explicitly recommends atorvastatin 20 mg as the first‑line lipid‑lowering agent in diabetes with CKD due to better tolerability and clinically important drug interaction concerns with simvastatin, with upward titration as needed to reach targets and additional caution only as eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116ABzL7] [^115u3p1M]. KDIGO is molecule‑agnostic but consistent in recommending statins broadly in non‑dialysis CKD, and KDOQI commentary highlights atorvastatin as a practical first‑line option given potency and fewer problematic interactions than simvastatin in polypharmacy [^1179Lk3M].

> I will now examine potency and intensity because achieving LDL‑C < 70 mg/dL often requires high‑intensity therapy. Let me verify intensity classifications. ESC recognizes atorvastatin 40–80 mg as high‑intensity, which commonly yields ≥ 50% LDL‑C reduction, whereas simvastatin is typically a moderate‑intensity agent at doses used in practice, making LDL‑C target attainment more challenging in very‑high‑risk CKD populations [^1163iZ99] [^115N7LgC]. This potency difference is clinically relevant when rapid and substantial LDL‑C lowering is required to mitigate risk in diabetes with CKD [^1163iZ99].

> Now, pharmacology and interactions. Wait, let me verify the drug–drug interaction burden. Both agents are CYP3A4 substrates, but simvastatin has well‑established clinically significant interactions with agents common in cardiometabolic care, including diltiazem and amlodipine, that necessitate dose caps and increase myopathy risk, whereas atorvastatin is less constrained by such interactions in routine practice, which is why guidance leans toward atorvastatin first [^116ABzL7] [^1179Lk3M]. Hold on, I should verify renal dosing. I initially thought simvastatin required strict dose limitation purely because of CKD stage 3, but I need to check; in fact, major guidance emphasizes interaction‑driven limits and overall tolerability rather than a blanket CKD 3 dose cap, while atorvastatin generally requires no adjustment down to eGFR about 30 mL/min/1.73 m², supporting its simplicity in CKD 3a [^116ABzL7] [^1179Lk3M].

> Next, I should review renal outcomes because slowing CKD decline is a secondary goal. Post hoc pooled analyses across six large atorvastatin RCTs showed a small, dose‑dependent improvement in the slope of kidney function over time with atorvastatin 10 mg and more with 80 mg, suggesting modest renoprotection that tracks with cardiovascular risk reduction, although these were not CKD‑enriched trials and the clinical magnitude is modest [^114cDodr] [^116ThKYu] [^115FJbW9] [^116XQ5pP] [^1122Jcua]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; high‑quality meta‑analyses in CKD show statins reduce cardiovascular events and mortality but do not convincingly slow CKD progression to ESKD, so any renal signal should be considered supportive but not definitive for choosing therapy [^111dWVpb] [^117NoZJS]. But wait, what if albuminuria improves. I initially thought CARDS showed atorvastatin slowed albuminuria progression; let me double‑check the renal subanalysis. Actually, CARDS showed a modest improvement in eGFR decline and greater apparent benefit in those with baseline albuminuria, but it did not reduce the incidence of albuminuria or promote regression, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize the eGFR slope findings instead [^116ThKYu].

> I should now cross‑validate with disease‑specific and head‑to‑head evidence. No large RCT directly pits simvastatin versus atorvastatin exclusively in diabetic CKD 3a, so I must triangulate from available trials. CARDS demonstrated significant primary prevention benefit with atorvastatin 10 mg in type 2 diabetes, including benefit in participants with eGFR 30–60, and TNT supports greater LDL‑C lowering and outcome benefits with higher‑dose atorvastatin, aligning with intensity‑driven risk reduction [^115CXk6G] [^1157hV7d]. SHARP, meanwhile, established simvastatin plus ezetimibe reduced major atherosclerotic events in advanced CKD, but it does not isolate simvastatin monotherapy efficacy and underscores the additive role of ezetimibe when more LDL‑C lowering is required, which is highly relevant if targets are not met on statin alone [^113D4DDP]. Finally, the 4D hemodialysis data remind me that dialysis‑stage results differ; atorvastatin did not reduce the composite MACE overall in dialysis, underscoring that our patient with CKD 3a is not analogous to ESRD cohorts and should still receive statin therapy per non‑dialysis CKD guidance [^112SR2AN] [^111VHvjK].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For a patient with type 2 diabetes and CKD 3a, I should prefer atorvastatin over simvastatin because it is guideline‑endorsed first‑line in diabetic CKD, achieves high‑intensity LDL‑C reduction more readily, carries fewer problematic interaction‑driven dose constraints, and has supportive evidence of modest eGFR slope benefit, all while aligning with LDL‑C targets for CKD G3 [^116ABzL7] [^1163iZ99] [^115N7LgC] [^114cDodr] [^1157hV7d]. I would typically start atorvastatin 20–40 mg daily in CKD 3a, titrating to 40–80 mg if needed to reach LDL‑C < 70 mg/dL or ≥ 50% reduction, with no routine renal dose adjustment required at this stage, monitoring for tolerance and interactions as I escalate intensity [^116ABzL7] [^1163iZ99].

> I should confirm an escalation plan if LDL‑C remains above target on maximally tolerated statin. The next step is to add ezetimibe, which is safe across CKD stages and was effective in SHARP when combined with simvastatin, and remains guideline‑supported as adjunct to statins in diabetic CKD when targets are unmet [^113D4DDP] [^116ABzL7]. If targets still are not achieved, PCSK9 inhibitors can be considered in very high‑risk CKD G3 patients, as efficacy and cardiovascular benefit appear preserved in stage G3 CKD, though access and indications vary by region [^115N7LgC] [^1153BZqK].

> Next, I should review safety, interactions, and monitoring. Before choosing simvastatin, I need to check for interacting drugs such as diltiazem or amlodipine that would compel low dose caps and raise myopathy risk; this is a key reason to avoid simvastatin in complex polypharmacy typical of diabetes with CKD, favoring atorvastatin instead [^116ABzL7] [^1179Lk3M]. I should monitor liver enzymes at baseline and if clinically indicated, assess for muscle symptoms with CK as needed, and counsel on rare statin‑associated dysglycemia, noting that large meta‑analyses show a small increase in diabetes risk that is substantially outweighed by the reduction in major cardiovascular events, particularly in patients who already have diabetes [^111M9EAW] [^111dWVpb]. Hold on, I should verify glycemic impact relevance here; in established diabetes, the signal pertains more to slight HbA1c/worsening glycemia rather than new onset, and cardiovascular benefits still predominate, so continuation of high‑intensity statin remains appropriate [^111M9EAW].

> Finally, I need to ensure context boundaries are clear. If kidney function later declines into G4–G5 or dialysis, the approach changes; initiating statins on dialysis is not recommended though continuation is reasonable if already prescribed, so I will reassess therapy should eGFR fall below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or if dialysis is initiated, while maintaining an LDL‑C‑lowering strategy off dialysis per current guidance [^115N7LgC] [^117Aby8S].

> Bottom line, after reviewing guidelines, pharmacology, and outcomes, I recommend atorvastatin as the first‑line statin for this patient with type 2 diabetes and CKD 3a, starting at 20–40 mg daily and titrating to high‑intensity as needed to reach LDL‑C < 70 mg/dL or ≥ 50% reduction, adding ezetimibe if targets are not met and considering PCSK9 inhibition thereafter, while avoiding simvastatin due to interaction‑driven dose limitations and lower practical intensity in this high‑risk setting [^116ABzL7] [^1163iZ99] [^115N7LgC] [^113D4DDP] [^1153BZqK].

Atorvastatin is **preferred over simvastatin** for patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage 3a because it achieves greater LDL-C lowering, offers stronger cardiovascular risk reduction, and is recommended by major guidelines for high-risk CKD patients [^115N7LgC] [^1163iZ99] [^116ABzL7]. Atorvastatin **does not require dose adjustment in CKD 3a**, has fewer drug interactions, and is better tolerated at higher intensities. Simvastatin is less potent, has more interactions, and is limited to moderate intensity due to myopathy risk. Use **atorvastatin 20–40 mg daily** and titrate to LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction; monitor lipids, LFTs, and CK regularly.

## Pharmacological differences

| **Parameter** | **Simvastatin (Zocor)** | **Atorvastatin** |
|-|-|-|
| Potency | Moderate | High |
| LDL-C reduction | 30–40% (20–40 mg) | 43–60% (10–40 mg) |
| Half-life | ~2 hours | ~14 hours |
| Metabolism | CYP3A4 | CYP3A4 |
| Dose adjustment in CKD 3a | Not required | Not required |
| Maximum recommended dose | 40 mg (due to myopathy risk) | 80 mg (with caution) |

## Clinical evidence in T2DM with CKD stage 3a

### Cardiovascular outcomes

In terms of cardiovascular outcomes, the **CARDS trial** showed a 37% reduction in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin in T2DM, including patients with CKD [^115CXk6G]. Meta-analyses also confirm significant cardiovascular risk reduction in CKD stages 1–3 [^115dKJ4P]. The **SHARP study** (simvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg) reduced major atherosclerotic events in CKD, but simvastatin alone is less potent and is limited by myopathy risk at higher doses [^113D4DDP].

---

### Renal outcomes

For renal outcomes, **atorvastatin** modestly slows eGFR decline and reduces proteinuria in CKD, including diabetic nephropathy [^1122Jcua] [^111U2YG6]. Simvastatin shows **limited renal benefit** and primarily offers cardiovascular benefit in CKD [^111dWVpb].

---

## Safety and tolerability

For safety and tolerability, **atorvastatin** has a lower myopathy risk at higher doses, fewer drug interactions, and requires no dose adjustment in CKD 3a. Simvastatin has a **higher myopathy risk** at ≥ 40 mg, significant CYP3A4 interactions, and is limited to moderate intensity.

---

## Guideline recommendations

- **ESC 2023**: High-intensity statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) for T2DM with CKD to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or ≥ 50% reduction [^113SCkQV] [^1163iZ99].
- **KDIGO 2022**: Statin or statin/ezetimibe for CKD stages 1–4, especially with diabetes.
- **ABCD-UKKA 2024**: Atorvastatin 20 mg first-line in T2DM with CKD, titrate to LDL-C targets [^114awWMB].

---

## Practical considerations

**Drug interactions**: Atorvastatin has fewer interactions than simvastatin, which interacts with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem) [^114awWMB]. **Patient adherence**: Atorvastatin's once-daily dosing and lower side-effect burden may improve adherence.

---

## Recommended dosing and monitoring

Start **atorvastatin 20–40 mg daily** and titrate to LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction. **Monitoring**: Lipid panel, LFTs, and CK at baseline and periodically; monitor renal function and electrolytes per CKD care.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Atorvastatin is the **preferred statin** for T2DM with CKD stage 3a because it provides greater LDL-C lowering, stronger cardiovascular risk reduction, and better tolerability at higher intensities. Simvastatin is less potent, has more interactions, and is limited by myopathy risk. Use **atorvastatin 20–40 mg daily**, titrating to LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction; monitor lipids, LFTs, and CK regularly.

The role of statins: Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and serve as the lipid-modifying agent of choice for individuals with diabetes. Simvastatin is linked to several side effects and drug interactions with agents like diltiazem and amlodipine. Therefore, atorvastatin 20 mg is recommended as the first-line lipid-lowering agent. Dose titration up to a maximum dose of 80 mg should be approached with caution, particularly when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

Rosuvastatin is classified as a high-intensity statin. For individuals in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1–2, no dose adjustment is necessary. In CKD stage 3 or lower, the initiating dose is 5 mg. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that the maximum dose for patients with eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m² is 10 mg. However, European and SPC guidelines recommend avoiding rosuvastatin when eGFR is below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

In cases of statin intolerance, consider switching to an alternative statin, reducing the dose, or adjusting to alternate day dosing.

The role of ezetimibe: Ezetimibe functions by blocking the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and upregulating hepatic LDL receptor expression, which facilitates the reduction of atherogenic lipoproteins. The primary role of ezetimibe in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is as an adjunctive agent to statin therapy or as an alternative for those with statin intolerance. Ezetimibe is suitable for use in mild to severe kidney disease and can be co-administered with any dose of statin.

Lipid management

Four studies in patients with varying degrees of CKD severity confirmed the safety of intensive LDL-C lowering with statins alone (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin), or with statin in combination with ezetimibe (simvastatin), and demonstrated a reduction in serious atherosclerotic events but did not show a significant effect on the progression of CKD. In contrast, in patients on haemodialysis, neither the 'German Diabetes Dialysis Study' (4D study) nor the 'A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Haemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events' (AURORA study) found a significant reduction in three-point MACE with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, respectively, compared with placebo. For PCSK9 inhibitors, subgroup analyses from the FOURIER study of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab showed that the LDL-C-lowering effect is maintained in patients with CKD stage G3 and that CV benefits are independent of baseline eGFR.

The ESC guidelines recommend LDL-C targets of < 70 mg/dL for CKD stage G3 and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL for CKD stages G4/5 without dialysis in combination with at least a 50% reduction in baseline LDL-C. Initiation of statin therapy is not recommended in patients requiring dialysis but should be continued if previously prescribed. Kidney transplant recipients should also receive statin therapy (note interaction with, e.g. calcineurin inhibitors, e.g. rosuvastatin with tacrolimus possible, fluvastatin with ciclosporin possible), although this is only supported by limited study results.

### The unique character of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease and its implications for treatment with lipid-lowering drugs [^113bqUmu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Although the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), there are very limited data to guide the use of lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs) in this population. This is because the major trials of LLDs in the general population have included very few individuals with CKD. The pathophysiological and epidemiological differences of CVD in the CKD population suggest that study findings derived from the general population may not be directly applicable to those with CKD. Moreover, the few trials directed at patients with kidney disease have not shown clear clinical benefits of LLDs.

The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Work Group has provided consensus-based guidelines for managing dyslipidemias in individuals with CKD and after renal transplantation. Since the publication of these statements, further data have emerged, and multiple studies are ongoing to better define the role of LLDs in patients with CKD. This article reviews the data pertinent to the CKD population and provides updated recommendations for the use of LLDs in this population.

### Effect of pravastatin in people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^1165pJDW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Although diabetes is a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), limited data describe the cardiovascular benefit of hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in people with both of these conditions. This study sought to determine whether pravastatin reduced the incidence of first or recurrent cardiovascular events in people with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and concomitant diabetes, using data from three randomized trials of pravastatin 40 mg daily versus placebo. CKD was defined by estimated GFR < 60 or 60 to 89.9 ml/min per 1.73 m² with proteinuria. Of 19,737 patients, 4,099 (20.8%) had CKD but not diabetes at baseline, 873 (4.4%) had diabetes but not CKD, and 571 (2.9%) had both conditions. The primary composite outcome was time to myocardial infarction, coronary death, or percutaneous/surgical coronary revascularization.

Median follow-up was 64 months. After adjustment for trial and random treatment assignment, the incidence of the primary outcome was lowest in individuals with neither CKD nor diabetes (15.2%), intermediate in individuals with only CKD (18.6%) or only diabetes (21.3%), and highest in individuals with both characteristics (27.0%). Pravastatin reduced the relative likelihood of the primary outcome to a similar extent in subgroups defined by the presence or absence of CKD and diabetes. For example, pravastatin was associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of the primary outcome by 25% in patients with CKD and concomitant diabetes and by 24% in individuals with neither characteristic. However, the absolute reduction in the risk was not stated.

### Long-term effects following 4 years of randomized treatment with atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on hemodialysis [^111VHvjK]. Kidney International (2016). High credibility.

The 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse) Study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing 4 years of treatment with atorvastatin to placebo in 1255 hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint of cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) was non-significantly reduced by 8%. However, long-term effects remained uncertain. Therefore, surviving patients were invited to a follow-up survey conducted by questionnaire.

Post-trial statin therapy was at the nephrologist's discretion, and outcomes were centrally adjudicated and analyzed by intention to treat and time to the first event in the original treatment groups. The median overall follow-up was 11.5 years. Post-trial statin use and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not differ between groups. Statin treatment non-significantly affected the former primary outcome (relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.07). The risk of all cardiac events combined and the risk of cardiac death were significantly lower in the original statin group compared to placebo (0.83, 0.70–0.97, and 0.80, 0.66–0.97). No significant effect was detected on cerebrovascular events, fatal stroke, fatal cancer, non-vascular, or all-cause death. No rhabdomyolysis was reported.

Thus, after 4 years of atorvastatin treatment in diabetic hemodialysis patients, similar effects on outcomes were found after 11.5 years of follow-up as were found at the end of the original study. There was no evidence of emerging hazards in the long term, confirming clinical practice guidelines.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes-a tiered approach: An overview of the joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^115u3p1M]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). High credibility.

For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, we suggest the following treatment targets: total cholesterol ≤ 4.0 mmol/L, non‐HDL cholesterol ≤ 2.5 mmol/L, and LDL cholesterol ≤ 1.8 mmol/L. For pragmatic reasons, we have not suggested percentage reductions in baseline levels, nor have we suggested a graded approach to therapy. We are aware that with time pressures and conflicting demands, lipid management is often neglected. Clear targets and a simple stepwise approach to management can help more people access appropriate therapy.

In most cases, atorvastatin 20 mg is suggested as the first‐line lipid‐lowering agent, with dose titration or use of higher intensity statins as required, according to the summary of product characteristics (SPC) and local guidance. Specialist advice should be sought at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². In people with statin intolerance, ezetimibe alone or in combination with bempedoic acid can be used. Fibrates cause a reversible increase in creatinine, and specialist advice is recommended when these are used in people with CKD.

There are newer agents, such as inclisiran, PSCK9 inhibitors, and icosapent ethyl, available for people who do not meet treatment targets using statins or ezetimibe. These agents have specific licensing indications, including specific cholesterol ranges, and also local restrictions. For these agents, evidence for benefit exists up to stage G3b CKD.

Lipid‐lowering therapy is effective in lowering CVD risk; however, there are specific side effects to be aware of which are listed on the individual summary of product characteristics, and these should be reviewed.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in persons with chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111dWVpb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Lipid-lowering therapy is not widely used in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite a high burden of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease in this population.

To synthesize evidence examining the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on clinical outcomes in persons with CKD, researchers utilized several data sources, including MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, covering literature from January 2000 through November 2011. The study selection focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared lipid-lowering therapy with control treatment in persons with CKD, including subgroup analyses of trials in the general population.

Abstracts were screened, and data were extracted on study methodology, population, interventions, cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and adverse events by one author and confirmed by another. Study quality was determined by consensus, and random-effects model meta-analyses were performed.

Eighteen RCTs, all involving adults, met the eligibility criteria. These included five RCTs focused on CKD populations, and 13 were CKD subgroup analyses from trials in the general population. Sixteen RCTs examined the use of statins, while two explored statins plus ezetimibe. Although lipid-lowering therapy does not improve kidney outcomes, it significantly decreases the risk of cardiac mortality with a pooled risk ratio (RR) from six trials of 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.91]; P < 0.001. Additionally, it reduces cardiovascular events, including revascularization (pooled RR from nine trials, 0.78 [CI, 0.71 to 0.86]; P < 0.001), and myocardial infarction (pooled RR from nine trials, 0.74 [CI, 0.

### Controversies regarding lipid management and statin use for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with CKD [^114bqeQd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at heightened risk for dying of cardiovascular disease. Results from randomized clinical trials of statin drugs versus placebo demonstrate that statin drugs or statin plus ezetimibe reduce the absolute risk for coronary heart disease and mortality among adults with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2013 clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD recommends that adults 50 years or older with non-dialysis-dependent CKD be treated with a statin or statin plus ezetimibe regardless of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

However, at least nine guidelines published during the last five years address lipid management for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and not all guidelines address the utility of lipid-lowering therapy in adults with CKD. Because most patients with CKD receive the majority of their clinical care from non-nephrologists, differences in recommendations for lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention may negatively affect the clinical care of adults with CKD and cause confusion for both patients and providers.

This review addresses the identification and management of lipid levels in patients with CKD and discusses the existing controversies regarding testing and treatment of lipid levels in the CKD population.

### A controlled, prospective study of the effects of atorvastatin on proteinuria and progression of kidney disease [^111U2YG6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney diseases, particularly if presenting with significant proteinuria, are commonly associated with substantial alteration of serum lipid levels. Experimental evidence suggests that lipid abnormalities may contribute to the progression of kidney disease; however, studies in humans on the subject are scarce.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, controlled open-label study, the authors evaluated the effects of one-year treatment with atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, versus no treatment on proteinuria and progression of kidney disease in 56 patients with chronic kidney disease. Before randomization, all patients had been treated for one year with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) and other antihypertensive drugs.

- **Results**: By the end of one-year treatment, urine protein excretion decreased from 2.2 ± 0.1 to 1.2 ± 1.0 g every 24 hours (P < 0.01) in patients treated with atorvastatin in addition to ACE inhibitor and ARBs. By contrast, urinary protein excretion decreased only from 2.0 ± 0.1 to 1.8 ± 0.1 g every 24 hours (P value not significant) in patients who did not receive atorvastatin in addition to ACE inhibitor or ARBs. During this time, creatinine clearance decreased only slightly and not significantly (from 51 ± 1.8 to 49.8 ± 1.7) in patients treated with atorvastatin. By contrast, during the same period of observation, creatinine clearance decreased from 50 ± 1.9 to 44.2 ± 1.6 mL/min (P < 0.01) in patients who did not

### Statins for improving renal outcomes: a meta-analysis [^116xPB9V]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Statins are frequently used to prevent cardiovascular events. Several recent studies suggest that statins may also have renal benefits, although this is controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the effect of statins on the change in kidney function and urinary protein excretion.

Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference proceedings, and the authors' personal files were searched. Published or unpublished randomized, controlled trials or crossover trials of statins that reported assessment of kidney function or proteinuria were included, and studies of individuals with ESRD were excluded. Data were extracted for study design, subject characteristics, type of statin and dose, baseline/change in cholesterol levels, and outcomes (change in measured or estimated GFR [eGFR] and/or urinary protein excretion).

Weighted mean differences were calculated for the change in GFR between statin and control groups using a random-effects model. A random-effects model was also used to calculate the standardized mean difference for the change in urinary protein excretion between groups. Twenty-seven eligible studies with 39,704 participants (21 with data for eGFR and 20 for proteinuria or albuminuria) were identified. Overall, the change in the weighted mean differences for eGFR was statistically significant (1.22 ml/min per year slower in statin recipients; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44 to 2.00). In subgroup analysis, the benefit of statin therapy was statistically significant in studies of participants with cardiovascular conditions.

### Is statin-induced diabetes clinically relevant? A comprehensive review of the literature [^113Axsh9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

In populations predisposed to the development of diabetes, such as those who are insulin-resistant, obese, or older, statins may increase the risk of developing diabetes. Although the conversion to diabetes has been identified from post hoc analyses, it appears to be a class effect with a dose-response relationship. However, statins have not been clearly shown to increase diabetic microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Thus, the clinical significance of increased glucose levels in patients treated with statins is uncertain.

While the exact mechanism by which statins increase the risk of diabetes is unknown, a possible explanation is through a reduction in adiponectin levels. Despite the fact that higher statin doses are more likely to lead to new-onset diabetes, for every case of diabetes caused, approximately three cardiovascular events are reduced with high-dose versus moderate-dose statin therapy. Overall, the small risk of developing type 2 diabetes with statin therapy is far outweighed by the potential of statins to decrease cardiac events.

Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The 2013 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination therapy to reduce ASCVD risk in patients aged 50 years and over with CKD who are not on dialysis, as well as for those aged 18–49 years with known ASCVD and non-dialysis dependent CKD. The 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Multispecialty cholesterol guidelines recommend a high-intensity statin with ezetimibe and/or PCSK9i for high-risk ASCVD patients with CKD and LDL-C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL. While evidence for LDL-C lowering in the prevention of ASCVD in CKD patients primarily derives from post hoc analyses, subgroup analyses of multiple clinical trials support benefit. A meta-analysis of 13 studies showed that statins reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events in Stage 3 CKD (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.78) and Stage 4 CKD (pooled HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.40–0.96) patients. There was no significant benefit in patients with Stage 5 CKD and those on dialysis, but overall, more patients with Stages 4 and 5 CKD need to be included in lipid-lowering trials.

The primary objective of the GOULD multicenter observational registry (NCT02993120) is to evaluate changes in use of evidence-based lipid-lowering therapies and, secondarily, trends in LDL-C levels over time in patients with ASCVD in the United States. Patients were enrolled between 2017 and 2018 and followed prospectively for 2 years. Only 17.1% of all patients with ASCVD had intensification of LLT, and two-thirds of patients continued.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of lipids in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Abbreviated summary of the Joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guideline 2024 [^113u9ruj]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

This guideline is based on the opinion of the ABCD and UKKA working group and is an update of previous 2021 and 2017 guidance. The 2024 update is based on searches conducted between January 2020 and March 2023. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and hand-searched reference lists and articles identified by ABCD-UKKA writing group members. Search terms used included 'diabetes', 'lipids', AND 'chronic kidney disease/nephropathy'. We also reviewed all related guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), UKKA, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), the European Renal Association Best Practice Guidelines, and the American and European Diabetes Associations.

The recommendation grades range from 1 (strong recommendation) to 2 (weak recommendation), and the corresponding evidence quality is: A (high-quality evidence), B (moderate-quality evidence), C (low-quality evidence), and D (very low-quality evidence). Standard lipid abbreviations are used, including total cholesterol (TC), chylomicron (CM), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), and triglycerides (TG).

- **Recommendations for lipid measurement and frequency of monitoring**: There is clear evidence relating LDL cholesterol levels to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and evidence concerning reducing LDL cholesterol levels and ASCVD risk. There is also a relative risk attributable to non-HDL cholesterol (calculated as TC minus HDL cholesterol).

### Diabetes: Statins for microvascular complications-all but the kidney [^112n9eWz]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

A new study shows that statin therapy before the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is not associated with an increased risk of microvascular disease and might even be beneficial for retinopathy and neuropathy. These data suggest a potential protective effect of statins in specific complications, which should be further investigated in randomized controlled trials.

### Cholesterol metabolism in CKD [^114YYMuD]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a substantial risk of developing coronary artery disease. Traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia do not adequately explain the high prevalence of CVD in CKD. Both CVD and CKD are inflammatory states, and inflammation adversely affects lipid balance. Dyslipidemia in CKD is characterized by elevated triglyceride levels and high-density lipoprotein levels that are both decreased and dysfunctional. This dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein becomes proinflammatory and loses its atheroprotective ability to promote cholesterol efflux from cells, including lipid-overloaded macrophages in the arterial wall. Elevated triglyceride levels result primarily from defective clearance.

The weak association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and coronary risk in CKD has led to controversy over the usefulness of statin therapy. This review examines disrupted cholesterol transport in CKD, presenting both clinical and preclinical evidence of the effect of the uremic environment on vascular lipid accumulation. Preventative and treatment strategies are explored.

### Efficacy and safety of lipid lowering by alirocumab in chronic kidney disease [^1153BZqK]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Many of these individuals with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are unable to achieve optimal LDL-C levels on statins and require additional lipid-lowering therapy. To study this, we compared the LDL-C-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab in individuals with hypercholesterolemia and impaired renal function (defined as eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m²) to those with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²).

A total of 4,629 hypercholesterolemic individuals with or without impaired renal function were pooled from eight phase 3 ODYSSEY trials, which included double-blind treatments of 24–104 weeks. Participants were administered alirocumab 150 mg or 75/150 mg every two weeks, compared to a placebo or ezetimibe. Overall, 10.1% had impaired renal function, and over 99% were receiving statin treatment. Baseline LDL-C levels in alirocumab and control groups were comparable.

LDL-C reductions at week 24 ranged from 46.1% to 62.2% or 48.3% to 60.1% with alirocumab among individuals with or without impaired renal function, respectively. Similar reductions were observed for lipoprotein(a), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides. Safety data were similar in both treatment subgroups, regardless of the degree of chronic kidney disease. Renal function did not change over time in response to alirocumab.

This post hoc efficacy analysis is limited by the evaluation of alirocumab treatment effects on renal and lipid parameters by serum biochemistry. Despite this limitation, alirocumab consistently lowered LDL-C regardless of renal function status.

### HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for people with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis [^117NoZJS]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most frequent cause of death in people with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is similar to people who have existing coronary artery disease. This is an update of a review published in 2009, which includes evidence from 27 new studies (25,068 participants) in addition to the 26 studies (20,324 participants) assessed previously. It excludes three previously included studies (107 participants). This updated review includes 50 studies (45,285 participants); of these, 38 studies (37,274 participants) were meta-analyzed.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits, such as reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke; and to slow the progression of CKD to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The study also assesses harms, including muscle and liver dysfunction, withdrawal, and cancer, of statins compared with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or another statin in adults with CKD who were not on dialysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialized Register up to 5 June 2012 through contact with the Trials' Search Coordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of statins with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or other statins on mortality, cardiovascular events, kidney function, toxicity, and lipid levels in adults with CKD not on dialysis were the focus of our literature searches.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two or more authors independently conducted data collection and analysis.

The review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of statins on health outcomes for people with CKD who are not on dialysis, highlighting important considerations for clinical practice.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^111M9EAW]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of summary data from randomised controlled trials have shown that statin therapy increases the risk of diabetes, but less is known about the size or timing of this effect, or who is at greatest risk. We aimed to address these gaps in knowledge through analysis of individual participant data from large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials of statin therapy that participated in the CTT Collaboration. All double-blind randomised controlled trials of statin therapy of at least 2 years' scheduled duration and with at least 1000 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. All recorded diabetes-related adverse events, treatments, and measures of glycaemia were sought from eligible trials. Meta-analyses assessed the effects of allocation to statin therapy on new-onset diabetes (defined by diabetes-related adverse events, use of new glucose-lowering medications, glucose concentrations, or HbA1c values) and on worsening glycaemia in people with diabetes (defined by complications of glucose control, increased use of glucose-lowering medication, or HbA1c increase of ≥ 0.5%). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on these outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

- **Findings**: Of the trials participating in the CTT Collaboration, 19 trials compared statin versus placebo (123,940 participants, 25,701 [21%] with diabetes; median follow-up of 4.3 years).

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^114cDodr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

The slope of kidney function: The average annual change in kidney function, assessed by the estimate of the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level based on a mean (SD) number of 4.7 (1.4) measurements from the mixed model, displayed a linear pattern over time, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure S1. Patients randomized to placebo and 10 mg and 80 mg atorvastatin had slopes (estimate [SE]) of 0.009 (0.0008), 0.011 (0.0006), and 0.014 (0.0006) (mg/dL)⁻¹/y, respectively (P < 0.0001 for each group).

In the adjusted models, with adjustments for (1) number of serum creatinine measures, (2) age and sex, and (3) change in LDL at month 3 from baseline, the slopes did not change. Additionally, slope × study interaction was tested to assess the homogeneity of slopes across the studies. The study × slope interactions assessed in each of the 3 pooled groups (atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg and placebo) were all statistically significant, indicating differences in slopes among the different studies (P < 0.0005 in all groups). Overall, the slopes were, however, all in the same direction. The fully adjusted model had minimal impact on the values of the slopes, where slopes (SE) for placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg were 0.008 (0.0007), 0.011 (0.0005), and 0.014 (0.0006), respectively.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^116uW21A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Kidney function decreases during a person's lifetime, and this decline is a powerful predictor of both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Statins lower cardiovascular risk, which may relate to their beneficial effects on kidney function. We studied whether atorvastatin influences the decline in kidney function and assessed the association between individual kidney function slopes and cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Methods and results**: Data were collected from 6 large atorvastatin cardiovascular outcome trials conducted in patients not specifically selected for having kidney disease. Slopes of serum creatinine reciprocals, which represent measures of change in kidney function ([mg/dL] −1 /y), were analyzed in 30,621 patients. Based on treatment arms, patients were categorized into three groups: placebo (n = 10,057), atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 12,763), and atorvastatin 80 mg daily (n = 7,801). To assess slopes, mixed‐model analyses were performed for each treatment separately, including time in years and adjustment for study. These slopes displayed linear improvement over time in all three groups. Slope estimates for patients randomized to placebo or atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg were 0.009 (0.0008), 0.011 (0.0006), and 0.014 (0.0006) (mg/dL)⁻¹/y, respectively. A head‐to‐head comparison of atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg based on data from one study ([Treating to New Targets]; n = 10,001) showed a statistically significant difference in slope between the two doses (P = 0.0009). From a Cox proportional hazards model using slope as a predictor, a significant (P < 0.0001) negative association between kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes was found.

### Protection against nephropathy in diabetes with atorvastatin (PANDA): a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of high- vs. low-dose atorvastatin(1) [^111TL9ki]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). High credibility.

To compare the renal effects of low- vs. high-dose atorvastatin in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and optimally managed early renal disease, we conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial. We assessed the 2-year progression of nephropathy for subjects on atorvastatin 80 mg/day (n = 60) versus 10 mg/day (n = 59), all patients having Type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria or proteinuria. Demographics showed a mean age of 64 years (SD: 10 years); HbA(1c) 7.7% (SD: 1.3%), 61 mmol/mol (SD: 10 mmol/mol); blood pressure 131/73 mmHg; renin-angiotensin system blocker use > 80%; and dual blockade > 67%. Participants were recruited from diabetes clinics in Greater Manchester.

Over an average of 2.1 years of follow-up, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease estimated glomerular filtration rate declined by 3 ml/min/1.73 m² in the combined group. The mean (95% CI) between-group difference during follow-up was not significant [2.2 ml/min/1.73 m² (−1.1 to 5.4 ml/min/1.73 m²), P = 0.20], after adjusting for baseline differences in renal function; a positive difference favored the 80 mg dose. Similarly, there was no significant difference in creatinine clearance by Cockcroft and Gault [2.5 ml/min (-2.4 to 7.3 ml/min), P = 0.32]; serum creatinine/24-h urine collections [4.0 ml/min (-4.8 to 12.7 ml/min), P = 0.38]; cystatin C (P = 0.69); or 24-h urine protein or albumin excretion (P = 0.92; P = 0.93). No significant between-group differences in deaths or adverse events were recorded.

In conclusion, for patients with Type 2 diabetes with early renal disease, there was no statistical difference in renal function between those taking low or high doses of atorvastatin.

### American Diabetes Association indications for statins in diabetes: Is there evidence [^115frQxr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Both in primary prevention and for very-high-risk patients, statins seem to reduce major cardiovascular events irrespective (at least in part) of the baseline and post-therapy LDL levels achieved. Should statins be generally prescribed in a fixed-dose manner? We would not go so far as to suggest that, but indeed, in the diabetic individual whose LDL cholesterol is seemingly within normal limits, this should be considered. The indication for statin therapy in diabetic individuals should not rely solely on LDL levels but on the inherent cardiovascular risk that accompanies this disease (even if goal LDL levels are met).

We believe that the standards of care for individuals with diabetes should mirror the evidence. Replacing a fixed-dose statin trial scheme with a treat-to-target LDL guideline is controversial. This inherent problem with the guidelines should be amended. Evidence based on "hard" outcome trials of statin use should guide our treatment goals and considerations, not epidemiologic or extrapolated LDL-based data.

### American Diabetes Association indications for statins in diabetes: Is there evidence [^113ncpqA]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

None of the clinical outcome trials were treat-to-target LDL trials; all were based on a fixed-dose statin algorithm, disregarding the reduction in LDL achieved. Thus, it would not be wholly adequate to blame the mere reduction in LDL for the beneficial effect noted. As proven by the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT TIMI22) trial and others, at least part of the statin effect can be analyzed through its reduction of other surrogate markers such as CRP. A more prudent, evidence-based approach would support a fixed high-dose atorvastatin regimen for all diabetic patients with proven coronary heart disease, with an exclusion criterion of an initial LDL cholesterol < 70 mg% due to lack of evidence.

Currently, trials that try to answer some of the questions raised above are underway. The IMPROVE-IT trial [Examining Outcomes in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome: Vytorin (Ezetimibe/Simvastatin) versus Simvastatin], programmed to end by 2011, will assess the additive value of ezetimibe therapy to statin therapy in high-risk patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. HPS2-THRIVE (Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) and AIM-HIGH (Athero-thrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes study) both include high-risk patients (including those with diabetes and documented vascular disease) and examine a possible additive effect of a new extended-release niacin formulation to statin therapy on "hard" cardiovascular outcomes such as "time to fi".

### Statin-induced diabetes: Will it change clinical practice [^114NBzGb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

If future studies were to confirm that some or all of the statins are associated with an increased risk for incident diabetes, would it change clinical practice? Would increases in glycemia be clinically acceptable in the context of the benefit conferred by the use of these medications? We have learned from other trials that improvement of surrogate markers does not necessarily translate into clinical benefit. It is well established that in people at increased cardiovascular risk, with and without diabetes, statins provide substantial benefit by decreasing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and overall mortality. Post hoc analyses have suggested that in high-risk subjects without diabetes, it is those with features of the metabolic syndrome who derive a greater benefit from statin use.

The development of diabetes is of clinical concern because of the risk of its associated complications. Because cardiovascular disease accounts for almost two-thirds of deaths in people with diabetes, the protective effect of statins on this major complication may suffice to support their use despite a potential risk of new-onset diabetes. What about the effects of statins on microvascular disease? A recent analysis of more than 345,000 patients in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System showed that statin-induced increases in glycemia were mild. Within a 2-year period of follow-up, fasting plasma glucose increased from 98 to 105 mg/dl in statin users without diabetes and from 97 to 101 mg/dl in their non-statin-using counterparts. In subjects with diabetes, the observed increases in fasting plasma glucose were similar.

### Effects of atorvastatin on kidney outcomes and cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes: an analysis from the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) [^116ThKYu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). High credibility.

We examined whether atorvastatin affects diabetic kidney disease and whether the effect of atorvastatin on cardiovascular disease (CVD) varies by kidney status in patients with diabetes.

- **Study design**: The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) was a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting & participants**: Patients with type 2 diabetes and no prior CVD (n = 2,838).

- **Intervention**: Random allocation to atorvastatin, 10 mg/day, or placebo, with a median follow-up of 3.9 years.

- **Outcomes**: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CVD.

- **Measurements**: Baseline and follow-up GFRs were estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. The urinary albumin-creatinine ratio was measured on spot urine samples.

Results indicated that at baseline, 34% of patients had an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a modest improvement in the annual change in eGFR (net, 0.18 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.32; P = 0.01), which was most apparent in those with albuminuria (net improvement, 0.38 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; P = 0.03).

At baseline, 21.5% of patients had albuminuria, and an additional 6.8% developed albuminuria during follow-up. Atorvastatin did not influence the incidence of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.73 to 3.04; P = 0.3) or regression to normoalbuminuria (hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.57 to 2.49; P = 0.6). In 970 patients with moderately decreased eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m², there was a 42% reduction in major CVD events with treatment, including a 61% reduction.

### The effect of long-term aggressive lipid lowering on ischemic and atherosclerotic burden in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1149ACvX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiac mortality is the main cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we sought the efficacy of long-term intensive lipid level lowering on atherosclerotic burden in patients with CKD. Patients with CKD (n = 38; age, 64 ± 11 years) and a similar group of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD; n = 31) were treated prospectively with atorvastatin, up to 80 mg/d. Lipid profile, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT; a marker of atherosclerotic burden), and dobutamine echocardiography were measured at baseline and 2 years. Predictors of change in maximal IMT were sought in a linear model.

- **Results**: Despite similar cholesterol level lowering, patients with CAD showed an improvement in maximum IMT, whereas those with CKD did not (mean between-group difference, 0.07 mm; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.12). Change in maximal IMT was associated with kidney disease (R2 = 0.09; P = 0.013), smoking (R2 = 0.083; P = 0.017), baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (R2 = 0.064; P = 0.045), very low density cholesterol (VLDL-C) level (R2 = 0.084; P = 0.021), and calcium channel blocker use (R2 = 0.094; P = 0.01). In a multivariate model, kidney disease and baseline LDL-C and VLDL-C levels remained independent predictors of change in maximal IMT (model R2 = 0.24; P = 0.004). Only patients with CAD decreased their number of ischemic segments (2.5 ± 1.4 to 1.2 ± 1.5 segments; P = 0.002). Overall change in ischemic segment number correlated with change in maximal IMT (r = 0.32; P = 0.019).

### Association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during statin treatment with cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^112dqMT1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In regard to lipid management, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) require special consideration when compared with other high-risk groups. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CKD, with a continual increase in the risk of CVD from the early stages of CKD along with a decline in renal function. However, the association between LDL-C level and cardiovascular outcomes in the CKD population seems to be less apparent, and the role of statin treatment in this population is unclear compared with that in other high-risk populations.

Most notably, in contrast to the more predominant benefit of LDL-C reduction in high-cardiovascular risk populations, the 4D (Deutsche Diabetes Dialysis Study) and AURORA (A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events) trials have unequivocally proven that statin treatment plays no role in reducing cardiovascular events among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Moreover, subgroup analyses in the SHARP (Study of Heart and Renal Protection) study and recent meta-analyses have revealed a trend of reduced benefit of statins as CKD progressed from stage 3 to stage 5. This trend of a weak association between cardiovascular risks and LDL-C levels or statin treatment during advanced CKD stages is believed to be multifactorial. The factors include changes in cholesterol metabolism, such as low LDL-C production but longer plasma residence time and lower LDL-C levels but a higher ratio of oxidized and small-dense LDL particles.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^1157hV7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

- **Figure description**: Modeled slopes of the reciprocal of serum creatinine are illustrated across the three groups: placebo (green), atorvastatin 10 mg (black), and 80 mg (red).

To perform a formal comparison between the atorvastatin doses, the TNT dataset was analyzed. The analysis indicated a significant dose effect of atorvastatin on the average annual change in kidney function. In patients randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg, the slope was significantly lower (estimate [SE] of 0.012 [0.0007] mg/dL⁻¹) compared to the slope observed in the 80 mg group (0.015 [0.0007] mg/dL⁻¹, P = 0.0009).

The eGFR slopes exhibited a similar pattern. The slopes (estimate [SE]) for placebo, 10 mg, and 80 mg atorvastatin were 0.25 (0.068), 0.51 (0.054), and 0.78 (0.056) mL/(min·1.73 m²) per year, respectively (P = 0.0002 for placebo and P < 0.0001 for atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg). The adjusted models affected the slopes negligibly. These findings translate to an estimated eGFR increase of 1.3, 2.6, and 3.9 mL/(min·1.73 m²) over a 5-year period for placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg, and 80 mg, respectively. In a formal comparison using TNT data, a dose effect was observed again (0.58 [0.065] and 0.86 [0.065] mL/(min·1.73 m²) in the atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg groups, respectively, P = 0.003).

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^115FJbW9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

In the pooled analysis, individual data of 30,621 patients from 6 RCTs who were randomly assigned to either placebo (10,057), atorvastatin 10 mg (12,763), or atorvastatin 80 mg (7,801), were analyzed. The median treatment duration was 3.9 years (range: 1–4.9 years).

Pooled demographic and baseline characteristics of the 6 RCTs varied significantly due to differences in disease conditions and study design. Among the three groups, variations were noted in sex, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, reciprocal serum creatinine, plasma total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, and the use of diuretics, RAAS inhibitors, and/or aspirin. Notably, age was significantly lower in the atorvastatin 10-mg group compared with the placebo and atorvastatin 80-mg groups.

The atorvastatin 80-mg group had a slightly but significantly lower number of individuals of African descent compared to the atorvastatin 10-mg group and a higher number of individuals of white descent compared to the placebo group. At baseline, the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was higher and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in the atorvastatin 80-mg group compared to both the placebo and atorvastatin 10-mg groups.

### Statin therapy and risk of developing type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^111HDC4Y]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **Research design and methods**: We searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Cochrane databases for randomized clinical trials from inception to February 2009, using the following medical subject heading terms: diabetes, statins, HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, cerivastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin. To increase the sensitivity of our search, eligible studies were cross-referenced using the Science Citation Index (SCI). We also reviewed recently presented data at national and international meetings. In addition, we looked through Internet-based sources of information and corresponded with experts in the field. In cases where eligible statin trials did not report diabetes incidence data in the published article, we contacted the investigators directly for this information.

Our meta-analysis included all randomized placebo-controlled trials that have reported data on the incidence of type 2 diabetes during follow-up. To generate summary statistics, we included both primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention trials but excluded registries and other nonrandomized analyses, as well as studies where patients had preexisting diabetes or where one statin was compared with another. Additionally, we excluded studies where other lipid-lowering medications were used either in lieu of or in addition to statins. Studies examining the role of statins on nonclinical outcomes where no data on diabetes was available were also excluded.

### Association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during statin treatment with cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^1153RZPW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Covariates in this study were demographics (age, sex, and body mass index), use of medical resources (outpatient visits and number of hospitalizations in the year before the index date), primary disease for CKD, comorbidities, medications at baseline, and laboratory data at baseline. Body mass index was determined using the most recently available data in the year preceding the index date.

Primary disease for CKD included polycystic kidney disease, hypertension nephropathy, diabetes nephropathy, and glomerulonephritis (i.e. immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), obstructive nephropathy, interstitial nephritis, and others. Comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, dementia, and heart failure. Primary disease for CKD and comorbidities were identified if reported at more than two outpatient visits or one inpatient stay in the year before the index date.

Baseline laboratory data, including hemoglobin, glycohemoglobin, proteinuria, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, and alanine aminotransferase, were identified using the most recent data within three months preceding the index date. However, to avoid lipid profile detection before the initiation of statin treatment, the latest data during the first three-month follow-up was used to identify the lipid profile, including LDL, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol. Finally, the use of antihypertensive agents, antidiabetic drugs, and other medications was identified according to the criteria.

### Association of thiazide diuretics with diabetes progression, kidney disease progression, cardiovascular outcomes, and death among patients with diabetes who initiate statins [^116Vzeuh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Statins have been associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) progression; however, their cardiovascular benefit in patients with DM outweighs the harm. The effects of concomitant use of other medications that increase blood glucose levels, such as thiazide diuretics, are not well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the association of concomitant use of thiazide diuretics and statins on DM progression, cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and death in patients with DM.

This retrospective cohort study involved veterans with DM who initiated statins between 2003 and 2015. The cohort included thiazide users (those who used thiazides and statins concomitantly for six months or more) and active comparators (those who used calcium channel blockers [CCB] but not thiazides, alongside statins for six months or more). We excluded patients younger than 18 years old, those with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or worse, or those using loop diuretics. We propensity-score-matched comparison groups on 99 baseline characteristics, including demographics, healthcare utilization, co-morbidities, cardiovascular scores, vital signs, laboratory data, and medication class usage.

Outcomes were:

- **DM progression**: New insulin initiation, increase in the number of glucose-lowering medication classes, and hyperglycemic episodes.
- **Kidney disease progression**: Doubling of serum creatinine, incidence of chronic kidney disease stage 5, initiation of renal replacement therapy, and incidence of diabetic nephropathy.
- **Cardiovascular outcomes**: Acute myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest.
- **Total mortality**.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of lipids in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Abbreviated summary of the Joint Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association (ABCD-UKKA) guideline 2024 [^114awWMB]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The recommendations for lipid management in type 2 diabetes highlight important considerations. Until relatively recently, type 2 diabetes was considered a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk equivalent. However, it is now clear that diabetes itself is not a CVD risk equivalent. Certain characteristics are required to escalate CVD risk, most notably a longer duration of diabetes and/or the presence of albuminuria. In addition, chronic kidney disease (CKD), based on reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), also enhances CVD risk. Thus, the combination of type 2 diabetes with albuminuria, stage G3 CKD or higher substantially increases the risk of CVD.

Several large-scale prospective CVD outcome studies have involved people with type 2 diabetes and CKD. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration database, established in 1994, includes individual participant data from statin trials with at least 1,000 participants and ≥ 2 years of follow-up. In the 2008 CTT meta-analysis of outcomes in over 18,000 people with diabetes from 14 randomised trials of statin therapy, a 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol reduced the combined endpoint of coronary heart disease (CHD) death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) by 22%, CVD events by 21%, vascular death by 13%, and all-cause death by 9%. Coronary revascularisation was reduced by 25% and stroke by 21%.

A further CTT meta-analysis in 2016, involving data from 28 trials (n = 183,419; 35,781 with diabetes), confirmed that statins reduce the risk of a first major vascular event by 21% per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. The CTT examined risk ratios in sub-divisions of participants stratified by estimated GFR (eGFR) categories (≥ 60, 45– < 60, 30– < 45, < 30, and dialysis). Smaller effects were observed as…

### Association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during statin treatment with cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^112DGtcw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In the highest cardiovascular risk populations, the reduction of LDL-C through statin treatment is considered a crucial preventive strategy for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Large-scale studies on PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors have found that in high-risk patients with lipid levels well-controlled through statin treatment, further reduction of LDL-C by PCSK9 inhibitors can provide additional protective effects. This finding encouraged major medical societies to set a lower LDL-C treatment target for high-risk patients in their treatment guidelines.

By contrast, in populations with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the association between LDL-C reduction through statin treatment and subsequent risk of CVD seems to be less obvious. Because relevant evidence was lacking, this study evaluated the association between LDL-C levels and subsequent outcomes among patients with stage 3 CKD.

### Statins and cardiovascular primary prevention in CKD: A meta-analysis [^115dKJ4P]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple meta-analyses of lipid-lowering therapies for cardiovascular primary prevention in the general population have been performed. Other meta-analyses of lipid-lowering therapies in CKD have also been performed, but not for primary prevention. This meta-analysis assesses lipid-lowering therapies for cardiovascular primary prevention in CKD.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed. MEDLINE was searched between January 2012 and September 2013 for new studies using predefined search criteria without language restrictions. A variety of sources, including previously published meta-analyses, were also reviewed. Inclusion criteria were randomized control trials of primary prevention with lipid-lowering therapy in non-end stage CKD.

- **Results**: Six trials were identified, five including patients with stage 3 CKD only. These studies included 8,834 participants and 32,846 person-years of follow-up. All trials were post hoc subgroup analyses of statins in the general population. Statins reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (the prespecified primary outcome) by 41% in stages 1–3 CKD compared with placebo (pooled risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.48 to 0.72). For the secondary outcomes, the risk ratios were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.88) for total mortality, 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.72) for coronary heart disease events, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.28 to 1.13) for stroke. In study participants with stage 3 CKD specifically, the results were similar.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in chronic kidney disease [^111HDmj7]. KDIGO (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning the evaluation of dyslipidemia, the KDIGO 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining a lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides) in adult and pediatric patients with newly identified CKD, including those treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation.

### The lipid lowering and onset of renal disease (LORD) trial: a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial assessing the effect of atorvastatin on the progression of kidney disease [^111xXy1o]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

There have been two published meta-analyses reporting on the effects of statins on kidney function. One was conducted by Fried et al, and the most recent, reported by Sandhu et al. (2006), includes most of the 25 RCTs mentioned above. The subject numbers are substantially larger in the Sandhu analysis as the larger cardiovascular trials were included. This, however, is a limitation as this inclusion mixes prospective studies with post-hoc sub-studies of major randomized controlled trials. Thus, the authors' conclusions must be interpreted with caution.

The meta-analyses support the suggestion that statins have a beneficial effect on kidney function. The Sandhu et al. meta-analysis also implies that statins have a more protective effect on kidney function in subjects recruited with cardiovascular disease, and that the more potent statin, atorvastatin, has a greater effect on protecting kidney function than the less potent statins such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. Based on the need for further clarification and investigation of the role of statins in slowing CKD progression, the LORD Trial was designed. This trial is intended to have inclusion criteria that reflect common clinical practice to enable the results to be as clinically relevant as possible.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^116XQ5pP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

This large-scale post hoc analysis, including individual data from six long-term cardiovascular outcome trials, demonstrates that in patients at risk or with cardiovascular disease (CVD), atorvastatin modestly improves kidney function over time in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, this analysis shows that kidney function improvement is strongly associated with lower cardiovascular risk independent of treatment, whereas a decrease in kidney function is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes. For each standard deviation increment of the slope of kidney function, we observed a 13% to 14% reduction in major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality while being treated with atorvastatin (either 10 or 80 mg daily).

Our data indicate that the efficacy of cardiovascular protection over the long term, obtained with atorvastatin, is reflected by effects on the course of kidney function over time. Furthermore, our results emphasize the bidirectional connection between the cardiovascular system and the kidneys (i.e. the cardiorenal axis) in treating cardiovascular disease. This implies that both CVD reduction and renoprotection are achieved by treating patients at risk or with CVD with atorvastatin. Conversely, a renoprotective strategy, as represented by atorvastatin treatment according to our data, translates into better cardiovascular risk management. In daily clinical practice, one may therefore consider incorporating kidney function trajectories to assess the success of cardiovascular risk management regimens, in addition to the control of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure (BP).

### The effect of statins on renal outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B9znb]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017).

The effects of statins on renal outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease were conflicting. The aim of the study was to investigate whether statins treatment could affect renal outcomes, specifically albuminuria or proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), for patients with diabetic kidney disease. We searched PubMed, OVID (including MEDLINE and EMBASE), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of statins in diabetic kidney disease patients were selected. The main outcomes were albuminuria or proteinuria, and secondary outcomes included levels of eGFR.

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted information from the enrolled trials. Eleven randomized controlled trials with a total of 543 diabetic kidney disease participants were included in our study. The overall estimates showed that statins statistically reduced albuminuria (standardized mean differences -0.71, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.23, P = 0.004), though marked heterogeneity was found within studies. However, analysis results indicated that statins could not reduce overt proteinuria (standardized mean differences -0.14, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.26, P = 0.49) or slow the rate of reduction in eGFR (standardized mean differences 0.06, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.26, P = 0.53).

In general, our study demonstrated that statins might have beneficial effects on reducing albuminuria in patients with diabetic kidney disease. However, there was no strong evidence that the same intervention affected overt proteinuria or eGFR outcomes.

### The cost-effectiveness of lipid lowering for primary cardiovascular prevention in chronic kidney disease: moving beyond statins [^114KRpVb]. Kidney International (2019). Low credibility.

Because of the high risk of cardiovascular disease, patients with chronic kidney disease may benefit from cholesterol-lowering therapy beyond statins. A cost-effectiveness analysis of adding ezetimibe to high-dose statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease found treatment with ezetimibe to be cost-effective for many patients with chronic kidney disease. We describe the importance of this topic and explain key assumptions necessary for the investigators to arrive at their conclusions.

### Atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis [^112SR2AN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Statins reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the benefit of statins in such patients receiving hemodialysis, who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and death, has not been examined.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, prospective study of 1,255 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving maintenance hemodialysis. They were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of atorvastatin per day or a matching placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death from cardiac causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Secondary endpoints included death from all causes and all cardiac and cerebrovascular events combined.

- **Results**: After four weeks of treatment, the median level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced by 42 percent among patients receiving atorvastatin, and among those receiving placebo, it was reduced by 1.3 percent. During a median follow-up period of four years, 469 patients (37 percent) reached the primary endpoint, of whom 226 were assigned to atorvastatin and 243 to placebo (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.10; P = 0.37). Atorvastatin had no significant effect on the individual components of the primary endpoint, except that the relative risk of fatal stroke among those receiving the drug was 2.03 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.05 to 3.93; P = 0.04). Atorvastatin reduced the rate of all cardiac events combined (relative risk, 0.82; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.99; P = 0.03, nominally significant).

### Atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis [^114YkPZK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

The 4-D study, conducted by Wanner C and colleagues in 2005 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine, focused on chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, and dyslipidemia.

- **Objective**: The trial sought to determine the role of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing hemodialysis.

- **Study design**: The study was a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: It included 1,255 patients (578 female, 677 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM undergoing hemodialysis.

- **Exclusion criteria**: These included hematopoietic disease or systemic disease unrelated to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); recent vascular intervention, congestive heart failure (HF), or myocardial infarction within three months before enrollment; unsuccessful kidney transplantation; and therapy-resistant hypertension.

- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups: 619 received atorvastatin (20 mg/day) and 636 received a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference was found in death from cardiac causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke after 3 years (31.9% vs. 30.5%; relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.10).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in fatal stroke (4% vs. 2%; RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.93) and a significant decrease in all cardiac events combined (33% vs. 39%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99). No significant difference was observed in overall mortality (48% vs. 50%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08).

- **Conclusion**: In patients with T2DM undergoing hemodialysis, atorvastatin did not significantly reduce mortality or major cardiac events but was associated with an increase in fatal strokes.

### Should all diabetic patients be treated with a statin [^115fjSi4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetic patients: The vast majority of clinical trials examining cholesterol reduction as a means to reduce cardiovascular risk were performed using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Only three trials recruited diabetic patients exclusively, but some other trials included sufficient diabetic patients to facilitate prespecified or post hoc analyses of the effect of statins in these patients.

### Simvastatin reduces chronic kidney disease and renal failure risk in type 2 diabetes patients: Post hoc ACCORD trial analysis [^111mixea]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

The research design and methods of this study are based on the ACCORD trial, which has been detailed in previous reports. ACCORD was a randomized, multicenter trial with a double 2×2 factorial design involving 10,251 type 2 diabetes patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Participants needed to meet the overarching glycemia trial entry criteria, as well as the criteria for either the lipid or blood pressure components of the trial.

All participating patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and exhibited a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.5% or higher. For those with clinical cardiovascular disease, the age range was 40 to 79 years. Patients with subclinical cardiovascular disease or at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors were aged between 55 and 79 years.

- **Eligibility for the lipid trial**: Patients needed an LDL-C level of 60 to 180 mg/dl. The HDL-C level had to be below 55 mg/dl for women and individuals of Black ethnicity, or below 50 mg/dl for all other groups. Additionally, triglyceride levels were required to be below 750 mg/dl if not receiving lipid therapy or below 400 mg/dl if undergoing lipid therapy.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: These included frequent or recent serious hypoglycemic events, unwillingness to monitor glucose levels at home or use insulin injections, having a body mass index greater than 45 kg/m², a serum creatinine level exceeding 1.5 mg/dl (132.6 µmol/l), or the presence of other serious illnesses.

### Atorvastatin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on hemodialysis [^112dEoc8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis are at high cardiovascular risk. Lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins reduces the incidence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. In contrast, two randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trials have been completed in hemodialysis patients that showed no significant effects of statins on cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: A post hoc analysis was conducted of the 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyze) study to investigate whether LDL-cholesterol at baseline is predictive of cardiovascular events and whether the effect of atorvastatin on clinical outcomes depends on LDL-cholesterol at baseline.

- **Results**: High concentrations of LDL-cholesterol by tendency increased the risks of cardiac endpoints and all-cause mortality. Concordantly, atorvastatin significantly reduced the rates of adverse outcomes in the highest quartile of LDL-cholesterol (≥ 145 mg/dl, 3.76 mmol/L). The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 0.69 (0.48 to 1.00) for the composite primary endpoint, 0.58 (0.34 to 0.99) for cardiac death, 0.48 (0.25 to 0.94) for sudden cardiac death, 0.62 (0.33 to 1.17) for nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.68 (0.47 to 0.98) for all cardiac events combined, and 0.72 (0.52 to 0.99) for death from all causes, respectively. No such decrease was seen in any of the other quartiles of LDL-cholesterol at baseline.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis, atorvastatin significantly reduces the risk of associated adverse outcomes in those with high LDL-cholesterol levels at baseline.

### Comparison of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin for lipid lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Results from the URANUS study [^1125YfkT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite the proven benefits of statin therapy, studies suggest that many patients with diabetes fail to achieve lipid goals in clinical practice. Statins differ in their lipid-modifying efficacy and their ability to enable patients to achieve lipid goals. Trials in patients with hypercholesterolemia have shown that rosuvastatin is more effective than atorvastatin at reducing LDL-C and achieving US and/or European LDL-C goals over treatment periods ranging from 6 to 52 weeks. The URANUS (Use of Rosuvastatin versus Atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes mellitUS) study is a direct comparison of the effects of rosuvastatin with atorvastatin on LDL-C, other plasma lipids, and LDL-C goal achievement in patients with diabetes. This study was designed to reflect the optimal treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia in the clinical setting, in that statin dose was titrated upwards from the recommended start dose to that required to enable patients to achieve the LDL-C goal.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^1179Lk3M]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guideline for the management of dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) was published in 2003. Since then, considerable evidence, including randomized controlled trials of statin therapy in adults with CKD, has helped better define medical treatments for dyslipidemia. In light of this new evidence, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) formed a work group to manage dyslipidemia in patients with CKD. This work group developed a new guideline that contains substantial changes from the prior KDOQI guideline.

KDIGO recommends the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with CKD primarily based on the risk for coronary heart disease, which is largely driven by age. The KDIGO guideline does not recommend using low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as a guide for identifying individuals with CKD to be treated, nor as treatment targets. Initiating statin treatment is no longer recommended in dialysis patients.

To assist US practitioners in interpreting and applying the KDIGO guideline, NKF-KDOQI convened a work group to write a commentary on this guideline. For the most part, our work group agreed with the recommendations of the KDIGO guideline, although we describe several areas where we believe the guideline statements are either too strong or need to be more nuanced. Additionally, we identified areas of uncertainty and inconsistency, as well as made further research recommendations.

The target audience for the KDIGO guideline includes nephrologists, primary care practitioners, and non-nephrology specialists.

### Disparate effects of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin on C-reactive protein concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1162ZGsG]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The ability of high sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict cardiovascular risk has been confirmed in diverse population cohorts, including type 2 diabetic patients. Patients who have lower hsCRP levels after statin therapy have better clinical outcomes, regardless of the resultant level of LDL. Reduction in LDL and hsCRP are independent indicators of the success of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk.

To assess any difference between the effect of long and short half-life statins on hsCRP and its variability, we conducted a crossover study with equivalent lipid-lowering doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^1122Jcua]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Kidney function decreases during the lifetime, and this decline is a powerful predictor of both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Statins lower cardiovascular risk, which may relate to beneficial effects on kidney function. We studied whether atorvastatin influences kidney function decline and assessed the association between individual kidney function slopes and cardiovascular outcome.

- **Methods and results**: Data were collected from 6 large atorvastatin cardiovascular outcome trials conducted in patients not selected for having kidney disease. Slopes of serum creatinine reciprocals, representing measures of kidney function change ([mg/dL]⁻¹/y), were analyzed in 30,621 patients. Based on treatment arms, patients were categorized into 3 groups: placebo (n = 10,057), atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 12,763), and 80 mg daily (n = 7,801). To assess slopes, mixed-model analyses were performed for each treatment separately, including time in years and adjustment for study. These slopes displayed linear improvement over time in all 3 groups. Slope estimates for patients randomized to placebo or atorvastatin 10 mg and 80 mg were 0.009 (0.0008), 0.011 (0.0006), and 0.014 (0.0006) (mg/dL)⁻¹/y, respectively. A head-to-head comparison of atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg based on data from one study (TNT [Treating to New Targets]; n = 10,001) showed a statistically significant difference in slope between the two doses (P = 0.0009). From a Cox proportional hazards model using slope as a predictor, a significant (P < 0.0001) negative association between kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes was observed.

### The effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with simvastatin plus ezetimibe in patients with chronic kidney disease (study of heart and renal protection): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^113D4DDP]. Lancet (2011). High credibility.

The study SHARP, published by Baigent C and colleagues in 2011 in the journal Lancet, is related to chronic kidney disease and dyslipidemia. The trial question was: what is the role of simvastatin plus ezetimibe in patients with advanced CKD? The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, RCT. The population comprised 9270 patients (3470 female, 5800 male). Inclusion criteria encompassed patients with advanced CKD. Key exclusion criteria included a history of MI or coronary revascularization procedures, chronic liver disease, active inflammatory muscle disease, previous adverse reactions to a statin or to ezetimibe, treatment with contraindicated drugs, or child-bearing potential.

- **Interventions**:
	- N = 4650 for simvastatin plus ezetimibe (20 mg simvastatin and 10 mg ezetimibe daily)
	- N = 4620 for placebo (matching placebo daily)

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant decrease in major atherosclerotic events (11.3% vs. 13.4%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94)

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary artery disease (4.6% vs. 5%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11)
	- Significant decrease in non-hemorrhagic stroke (2.8% vs. 3.8%; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.94)
	- Significant decrease in arterial revascularisation procedures (6.1% vs. 7.6%; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93)

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant differences in excess risk of major adverse events.

### Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS): Multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial [^115CXk6G]. Lancet (2004). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the role of lipid-lowering therapy with statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetes is inadequately defined. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of atorvastatin 10 mg daily for primary prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes without high concentrations of LDL-cholesterol.

- **Methods**: 2838 patients aged 40–75 years in 132 centres in the UK and Ireland were randomised to placebo (n = 1410) or atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 1428). Study entrants had no documented previous history of cardiovascular disease, an LDL-cholesterol concentration of 4.14 mmol/L or lower, a fasting triglyceride amount of 6.78 mmol/L or less, and at least one of the following: retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension. The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of the following: acute coronary heart disease events, coronary revascularisation, or stroke. Analysis was by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: The trial was terminated 2 years earlier than expected because the prespecified early stopping rule for efficacy had been met. The median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (IQR 3.0–4.7). 127 patients allocated placebo (2.46 per 100 person-years at risk) and 83 allocated atorvastatin (1.54 per 100 person-years at risk) had at least one major cardiovascular event (rate reduction 37% [95% CI -52 to -17], p = 0.001). Treatment would be expected to prevent at least 37 major vascular events per 1000 such people treated for 4 years.
