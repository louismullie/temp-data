## Question

What strategy would you use to condition the market to sell a new class of therapy for Waldenstrom?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about strategies to condition the market for selling a new class of therapy for Waldenström macroglobulinemia, with explicit reasoning and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current WM treatment landscape and unmet needs. Then, I should define the product's value proposition and positioning. Next, I will map stakeholders and craft tailored engagement. After that, I need to build an integrated evidence plan spanning regulatory, HTA, and real-world evidence. Then, I will design access and pricing strategies, followed by implementation and launch readiness. Finally, I should set up monitoring and iteration loops, and I will double-check for any gaps or inconsistencies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the current WM landscape and unmet needs so I don't anchor on outdated paradigms. WM is a rare, incurable IgM lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with heterogeneous biology; most patients harbor MYD88 L265P, while CXCR4 mutations are present in a substantial subset and correlate with inferior outcomes to BTK inhibitors, and the median age is around 70 with frequent comorbidities, so tolerability matters as much as efficacy [^113R3Uim] [^112T3Bsw]. Hold on, I should verify frontline standards: bendamustine–rituximab remains a widely used, time-limited option with strong durability, while BTK inhibitors like ibrutinib and zanubrutinib are active but continuous and may underperform in CXCR4-mutated disease, underscoring a need for alternatives or combinations that overcome resistance and minimize toxicity [^113R3Uim] [^117VjDrT] [^112T3Bsw]. I need to ensure I also note that rituximab monotherapy is no longer appropriate first-line and that proteasome inhibitors and venetoclax have roles, particularly venetoclax in t(11;14) or as salvage, which shapes sequencing and differentiation opportunities [^116VADJw] [^114nvsZc].

> Now, I will define the product's value proposition and positioning, but wait, let me verify the competitive context before I overstate claims. If the new therapy is a next-generation BTK inhibitor, I should emphasize improved selectivity and fewer off-target toxicities versus ibrutinib, and I must be cautious not to overpromise superiority in CXCR4-mutated disease without data; if it is a CXCR4 antagonist, I should position it to overcome BTKi resistance and improve depth and durability; if it is a BCL2 inhibitor like venetoclax, I should highlight activity irrespective of CXCR4 status and potential synergy with BTK inhibitors; if it is a novel mechanism, I should articulate a clear, biologically plausible rationale linked to MYD88/CXCR4 signaling or IgM biology and show clinical impact on response depth, time to response, and durability with acceptable safety in older adults [^117VjDrT] [^112T3Bsw] [^114nvsZc]. Hold on, I should verify that any positioning aligns with observed clinical signals and not just preclinical hypotheses, especially in a disease where cross-trial comparisons are perilous and guideline uptake is conservative [^116VADJw].

> Next, I should review stakeholder mapping and tailored engagement, and I need to ensure I don't miss key influencers. Clinicians span community hematologists, academic WM experts, and guideline authors; payers include CMS, commercial plans, and ICER; patients and caregivers value oral, non-chemo options and quality of life; regulators and HTA bodies demand rigorous, context-appropriate evidence; and advocacy groups like the IWMF shape education and access, so I should co-create education, co-author publications, and align trial designs with real-world practice constraints [^116eTDtw]. Wait, let me verify that my engagement plan includes addressing CXCR4 testing and sequencing, because clinicians will ask how this therapy fits with BTK inhibitors and whether companion diagnostics are needed, which can materially change uptake and payer policies [^112T3Bsw].

> I will now examine the integrated evidence plan, and I should double-check that it meets both regulatory and HTA expectations. Regulatory approval will hinge on randomized data where feasible or high-quality single-arm trials with meaningful endpoints; for WM, major response and durable PFS are critical, and head-to-head or add-on designs versus established backbones like BR or BTK inhibitors will be most persuasive, with stratification by MYD88/CXCR4 status to address heterogeneity [^117VjDrT]. For HTA, I need comparative effectiveness, quality-of-life gains, and economic value; frameworks like FRAME highlight that large effect sizes and robust RWE meaningfully influence decisions, so I should plan prospective RWE studies and modeling to demonstrate cost-effectiveness within accepted thresholds and to mitigate uncertainties in trial generalizability [^113xPCWn] [^112kaUQj]. But wait, what if randomized data are infeasible due to rarity? Then I should consider externally controlled designs or RWE-augmented submissions, documenting comparability and addressing bias explicitly to satisfy regulators and HTA reviewers [^116zixyb].

> Let me consider access and pricing strategy, and I should confirm that affordability and equity are embedded from the start. Value-based pricing tied to outcomes, risk-sharing or outcomes-based contracts, and tiered access in ex-US markets can align price with clinical benefit; early engagement with payers to define evidentiary requirements and endpoint acceptability reduces delays, and policies emphasizing equity and system strengthening support sustainable access to high-cost therapies in rare diseases [^114XmAdA]. Hold on, I should verify that my economic model uses appropriate cost-effectiveness thresholds and transparently addresses indirect costs, caregiver burden, and downstream savings, as these materially sway payer decisions in hematology [^112kaUQj].

> Implementation and launch readiness come next, and I need to ensure operational details are not overlooked. Institutional readiness requires multidisciplinary pathways, infusion capacity, REMS where applicable, and pharmacy operationalization; I should also anticipate diagnostic workflows for MYD88/CXCR4 testing and define clear treatment sequencing relative to BR and BTK inhibitors, supported by practical guidance and EMR-embedded order sets [^1136N98w] [^113R3Uim]. Wait, let me verify that training materials cover safety, monitoring, and mitigation of class-specific toxicities, and that patient-facing resources explain benefits, risks, and logistics in plain language to reduce barriers to adoption [^1136N98w].

> I should now set up monitoring and iteration, and I need to ensure feedback loops are timely. Early adoption metrics, real-world outcomes, and safety surveillance should be captured and shared with stakeholders; if signals diverge from trials, I must be ready to adjust messaging, refine patient selection, or pursue label expansion with additional studies, maintaining transparency with regulators, payers, and clinicians [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that my pharmacovigilance plan includes proactive outreach to centers and patients to capture rare events and that my HEOR team is prepared to update cost-effectiveness models as new RWE accrues [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the overall strategy coherence and check for gaps. The plan aligns unmet need with a differentiated value proposition, integrates regulatory and HTA evidence requirements, embeds equity and access considerations, and provides operational guardrails for launch; however, I should confirm that the competitive narrative remains data-driven and avoids overreach, especially around CXCR4-mutated outcomes where expectations are high but evidence may still be evolving [^113R3Uim] [^112T3Bsw]. If new data emerge that contradict initial assumptions, I need to pivot positioning transparently and update stakeholders to preserve trust and credibility in this small, expert community [^notfound].

To condition the market for a new Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) therapy, a **multifaceted strategy** is essential: establish clear clinical differentiation (e.g. superior efficacy, safety, or convenience) [^113Sx59q], generate robust evidence (RCTs, RWE, biomarker-driven data) [^113xPCWn], and engage key stakeholders early (clinicians, patients, payers, regulators) [^114DLrhD]. Use targeted education, peer influence, and digital outreach to build awareness and trust, and align pricing with value while addressing access barriers [^114XmAdA]. This integrated approach accelerates adoption and market penetration.

---

## Clinical differentiation and value proposition

- **Identify unmet needs**: WM is rare and incurable [^113R3Uim]; current standards (BR, BTK inhibitors) have limitations (toxicity, resistance, CXCR4-mediated resistance) [^112T3Bsw] [^114F1m7D].

- **Define differentiation**: Articulate clear advantages — e.g. superior efficacy (higher MRR/VGPR), improved safety (fewer cytopenias, infections, cardiotoxicity), or convenience (oral, fixed-duration) [^114F1m7D].

- **Develop value proposition**: Emphasize outcomes that matter (deep responses, durable PFS, quality of life, reduced healthcare utilization) [^114F1m7D].

---

## Evidence generation strategy

Robust evidence is critical to **persuade clinicians, regulators, and payers** [^113Sx59q].

| **Evidence type** | **Purpose** | **Key activities** |
|-|-|-|
| Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) | Demonstrate superiority vs standard of care | - Head-to-head vs ibrutinib or BR <br/> - Stratify by MYD88/CXCR4 status [^117VjDrT] [^112T3Bsw] |
| Real-world evidence (RWE) | Validate effectiveness, safety, and adoption | - Post-marketing studies <br/> - Registry analyses <br/> - Patient-reported outcomes [^113xPCWn] |
| Biomarker-driven data | Support precision medicine and payer acceptance | - MYD88/CXCR4 stratification <br/> - Predictive models [^112T3Bsw] |

---

## Stakeholder engagement and education

Early, sustained engagement builds **trust and adoption** [^notfound].

- **Clinicians**: Conduct CME, congress symposia, and peer-to-peer programs; provide practical tools and case studies [^116eTDtw].

- **Patients**: Develop clear, accessible materials; partner with advocacy groups (e.g. IWMF) to build awareness and trust [^116eTDtw].

- **Payers**: Present health-economic data (cost-effectiveness, budget impact) and negotiate value-based contracts [^113Sx59q].

- **Regulators**: Engage early to align on trial design, endpoints, and labeling [^114DLrhD].

---

## Marketing and communication strategy

A coordinated campaign shapes **perceptions and drives demand**.

- **Scientific communication**: Publish in high-impact journals; present at major hematology meetings (ASH, EHA, ICML) [^notfound].

- **Digital marketing**: Use targeted online content, social media, and webinars to reach clinicians and patients [^116eTDtw].

- **Peer influence**: Leverage key opinion leaders and early adopters to champion adoption [^notfound].

- **Patient stories**: Share real-world testimonials to humanize benefits and build emotional resonance [^notfound].

---

## Pricing and access strategy

Pricing must reflect **value** while ensuring access [^114XmAdA].

- **Value-based pricing**: Align price with clinical and economic value, using ICER thresholds and QALY metrics [^112kaUQj].

- **Access programs**: Offer patient assistance, co-pay support, and flexible payment models [^notfound].

- **Payer negotiations**: Provide budget-impact models, outcomes guarantees, and risk-sharing agreements [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adaptation

Continuous monitoring enables **timely course correction**.

- **Market surveillance**: Track uptake, prescriber sentiment, and competitive dynamics.

- **Feedback loops**: Gather clinician and patient input to refine messaging and support.

- **Adaptive strategies**: Adjust pricing, access, or education in response to market shifts or new evidence [^notfound].

---

A successful market-conditioning strategy for a new WM therapy requires **clear differentiation**, robust evidence, early stakeholder engagement, targeted communication, and value-aligned pricing, with continuous monitoring to adapt and sustain adoption.

### The urgent need for breakthrough therapies and a world without type 1 diabetes [^116RS1FH]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The Path to Breaking Through T1D

Despite the clear and pressing needs faced by those with T1D, some nonetheless claim that insulin replacement and diabetes technologies are so good that little risk should be tolerated when developing new T1D therapies. We believe the data show otherwise. It is therefore imperative that we continue to bring innovative therapies to address the significant and serious unmet needs of those living with T1D.

Insulin replacement can no longer be seen as the only therapeutic option for T1D. We must aim to modify the overall course of T1D, employing targeted therapeutic strategies for each stage of the disease (Table 1). Ideally, multiple therapeutic options and modalities would be available at each stage, allowing people with T1D more choice in the most appropriate care for them. Some progress has been made in bringing novel types of therapies to market, for example, teplizumab and donislecel.

Table 1
Treatment strategies beyond targeting glycemic control, therapeutic goals, and ideal treatment characteristics for each stage of type 1 diabetes

T1D type 1 diabetes

Teplizumab is an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and is the first disease-modifying therapy approved for use in T1D. Teplizumab is indicated to delay the onset of stage 3 T1D in children and adults aged ≥ 8 years with stage 2 T1D. Donislecel is an allogeneic pancreatic cellular therapy indicated for the treatment of adults with T1D who are unable to approach their target HbA1c because of repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia despite intensive diabetes management and education. Donislecel is the first approved cell therapy available in type 1 diabetes but must be used in conjunction with concomitant immunosuppression. These therapies represent important first steps at moving beyond the insulin-centric paradigm of the last hundred years; however, more is needed to fully meet the needs of people with T1D.

Bringing novel treatments and cures to fruition requires new solutions to long-existing challenges. Researchers and regulators must move beyond the insulin-centric paradigm of the previous 100 years, and the regulatory environment must protect public health without suppressing innovation. Insulin-based treatments cannot remain the status quo — the T1D community can and should do better. We must also foster a health system that allows breakthrough therapies to be available and accessible to all who need them.

### Selecting initial therapy for newly diagnosed waldenströM macroglobulinemia… [^116VADJw]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

1report on 30 newly diagnosed patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia treated with ibrutinib. Clinically relevant responses were seen in all patients. Responses occurred rapidly with an 18-month progression-free survival of 92%. Their article, along with the recently published article by Dimopoulos et al 2, which demonstrated a significantly higher response rate, deeper responses, and superior PFS with the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab compared with rituximab alone, firmly establishes ibrutinib as a reasonable choice for the treatment of newly diagnosed WM. Review of the most recently updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines gives 12 options for the initial treatment of WM.

The large number of options reflects the fact that, in most instances, they represent phase II trials. Therefore, the level of evidence that would allow one to select a given regimen over another is inherently weak. Given the paucity of phase III trials, how does one select therapy for this patient population. Table 1 provides a review of trials that include patients with newly diagnosed WM. These trials are selected and do not represent all studies. Moreover, they are not comparable because they are not balanced for age and stage. Nonetheless, one can draw several conclusions. All initial combination therapies seem to be highly effective, with clear superiority over single-agent rituximab, which should no longer be considered appropriate initial therapy for this disorder. In follicular lymphoma, obinutuzumab seems to produce a longer PFS when combined with chemotherapy than rituximab does and may be a superior albeit not widely tested monoclonal antibody choice.

11With these excellent outcomes, how does one decide among available therapies. There are several important issues to consider when assessing therapeutic options. WM is a disorder that affects a much older patient population than other low-grade lymphomas and CLL. As a consequence, these patients are subject to competing risks of death unrelated to WM. 12, 13In fact in one study, 40% of patients older than age 75 years did not die of WM. Therefore, one should expect multiple comorbidities and a long natural history, so immediate and late toxicity profiles become as important as the consideration of benefits and response rates in selecting initial therapy. One of the first combination chemotherapy trials for WM used rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone. The regimen produces a remarkably high response rate using a regimen familiar to all oncologists.

More importantly, in this trial, with long follow-up, mortality related to WM and mortality unrelated to WM were identical, suggesting that as many patients succumb to the disease as succumb to unrelated problems. 14This regimen was a standard of care until the East German Lymphoma Study Group published a comparative trial of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone and rituximab plus bendamustine. 15Although these regimens demonstrated virtually identical response rates, they showed that rituximab plus bendamustine had a lower toxicity profile and longer PFS. However, both are reasonable options for therapy of fixed duration. Bortezomib is highly active in the treatment of WM. However, patients with WM are uniquely predisposed to the development of peripheral neuropathy mediated by the immunoglobulin M monoclonal protein.

### Today's research, tomorrow's practice-white paper from the translation of new therapy (TNT) radiotheranostics kick-off pre-meeting of the annual world molecular imaging conference 2024 [^111gaHAx]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Theranostics, a concept combining "therapy" and "diagnostics", is poised to enter an exponential growth phase. By using specific diagnostic markers to guide the selection and application of targeted treatments directed at those markers, this approach aims to improve effectiveness and reduce unnecessary interventions. While several agents have been approved by the FDA recently, multiple additional theranostics are being developed, studied in clinical trials and expected to enter clinical practice in short order. As part of the "Translation of New Therapy (TNT) Interest Group's Radiotheranostics Kick-off" pre-meeting of the annual World Molecular Imaging Conference (WMIC) 2024 over 350 attendees with 10% leaders from industry, 60% senior and junior investigators in academia and 30% trainees discussed the key challenges and opportunities in implementing a theranostic research program in academia, which are addressed in this white paper. Overarching themes included funding, regulatory hurdles, and workforce training. Panel recommendations included leveraging existing expertise and patient populations, securing revenue streams, exploring alternative funding sources, and developing a multifaceted approach to promote training, education and public awareness, including fostering academic-industry partnerships. By shedding light on the gap between research and real-world program implementation, this white paper and forthcoming pre-meetings at WMIC aim to define a practical framework for building successful programs based on insights from recent research.

### Quetiapine (quetiapine fumarate) [^117XcJTr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heat Exposure and Dehydration

Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)].

Concomitant Medication

As with other medications, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the­-counter drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Pregnancy

Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with quetiapine extended-release tablets. Advise patients that quetiapine extended-release tablets may cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms (agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder) in a neonate. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to quetiapine extended-release tablets during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Infertility

Advise females of reproductive potential that quetiapine extended-release tablets may impair fertility due to an increase in serum prolactin levels. The effects on fertility are reversible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program

Quetiapine extended-release tablets are indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for adolescents with schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that may include other measures (psychological, educational, and social). Effectiveness and safety of quetiapine extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age for schizophrenia or less than 10 years of age for bipolar mania. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. The decision to prescribe atypical antipsychotic medication will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient's symptoms [see Indications and Usage (1.4)].

### A consensus statement on the use of digital twins in medicine [^1116spSx]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We take the findings as support for our recommendations as follows: people are generally positive towards DTs, but they want to keep agency with respect to whether or not to use this technology, which should be enabled. Healthcare professionals are expected to be sufficiently competent in using this technology for the benefit of patients, which should be fostered in curricula. People are, in principle, willing to provide the necessary resources (data, financial compensation models) to develop DTs; but private actors, who may actually develop those technologies, are confronted with considerable skepticism. To counteract this skepticism, the state and public institutions should have a key role in developing a health system that critically relies on DTs; including preserving options that do not need such technologies.

DT technology represents a clear departure from the core idea of today's healthcare system, which states that physicians and the research system that supports them are the ultimate arbiter not only on how to treat patients, but more importantly, on defining what constitutes a disease in the first place. This conceptualization of disease and treatment rationales is by necessity a human affair, typically the result of consensus-finding processes among physicians organized in specialist societies. While data-driven approaches, particular evidence-based medicine, are attempts to objectivize the process, a large swath of medicine is still a very human intuition-driven enterprise with vast differences in available care pathways and ultimately health outcomes. The core of this enterprise is an international, national, regional, or individual understanding of disease and treatment strategies. By necessity, the AI tools that are being introduced today reflect this situation, that is, the AI tools, trained on current medical data, are a mere reflection of current medical concepts, definitions, and approaches. Constrained as such, current AI cannot evolve beyond what is happening in medicine today. In contrast, DT technology, in its most advanced state, applies a predominately data-driven approach for predicting a future state given a patient's current health data. At its core, a DT should "know" the principles of how processes at different scales evolve over time, but it will not be constrained by them. Rather, DTs will use machine-derived states to trigger corrective actions in the form of health interventions. It is unclear at this point whether humans will be able to understand the meaning of these states, and whether these states can be translated into current medical concepts. This begs the question: if DTs will emerge as a key tool in healthcare, in the form of personal digital replicas guiding our treatment choices, what is the role of the traditional bearer of medical knowledge and wisdom, the physician? Can physicians remain the epistemic authority in healthcare, given that they operate using a scheme of thought that may no longer allow them to understand machine predictions of a patient's health state? How should patients deal with the technology, both in the role of data providers and consumers of DT services? Is there an emergent role for technology companies that build and maintain digital medical twins? And finally, what are sensible regulatory approaches to ensure fair and equitable access to the technology? Our paper provides possible answers to these questions, boldly proposing a future healthcare system with new stakeholders, such as tech companies and novel roles of traditional players like physicians, but also contrasting the current perspective of the population versus a different outlook on technological development. Realistically, changes will appear gradually, as will be the capabilities of the DT technology, which, in its first incarnation, will likely be built on today's AI capabilities using only little multi-scale simulations. The paper acknowledges this fact by discussing the near-, mid- and long-term effects of DT technology on the healthcare system.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen [^113Kmj37]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; Dosage and Administration, Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose].

Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see OVERDOSAGE]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets.

### Needs of key stakeholders to make advance care plans and advance directives for people with dementia: a scoping review [^1165kERC]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Caregivers and family members

Education and resources

Caregivers and family members are often central to making decisions for PWD, yet many lack the knowledge and support to confidently participate in ACP/AD planning. Here, tailored educational resources are essential, ideally including scenario-based guidance that captures the progression of dementia and evolving goals of care. These materials should help caregivers navigate complex treatment decisions over time. For formal caregivers, training should also address cultural variations in care preference, including racial and ethnic attitudes towards ACP/AD and end-of-life decisions.

Communication with HCPs

Regular and meaningful communication with healthcare professionals helps caregivers and family members to better understand medical decisions and the broader goals of care. Studies highlight the potential of decision-support interventions to improve this dialogue, especially in facilitating difficult conversations between surrogate decision-makers and clinical teams. Caregivers and family members also reported feeling more engaged when ACP/AD sessions are led by nurses and take place in triadic settings, where the PWD, carers and HCP are all present. These formats foster trust and shared understanding and may reduce the sense of isolation caregivers often report in decision-making processes.

Dementia treatment information and involvement in care planning

Providing information that is tailored to the stage and context of dementia is critical. Caregivers need clarity around the potential risks and outcomes of specific treatments, as well as the practical and ethical implications of decisions such as resuscitation orders or feeding interventions. Involving caregivers and family members in the planning process acknowledges the importance of relational dynamics and promotes decisions that are aligned with the values of both the PWD and their support network. Identifying an enduring power of attorney or health proxy should also be approached as a collaborative and anticipatory process, not just a legal formality.

In summary, future research should examine how triadic decision-making models - engaging HCPs, patients and families - used in other chronic illnesses, can inform dementia care planning. Such models could help overcome the challenge of medicalization in dementia-related ACP by fostering trust and shared understanding among all parties involved.

### The roadmap to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion in hematology clinical trials: an American Society of Hematology initiative [^116eTDtw]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Decentralized trials (DCTs) have the potential to allow for broader and more diverse clinical trial participation. However, there are potential drawbacks. Specifically, if DCTs rely heavily on technology, it could represent a digital barrier for older, rural, and underrepresented racial and ethnic populations who may not have access to or familiarity with the Internet, smart phones, and tablets, etc. On the contrary, face-to-face visits may disproportionally burden patients who have caregiving responsibilities or those of lower socioeconomic status. Careful consideration needs to be given to the implementation of DCTs, including options for virtual participation, remote data collection that leverages technology, and electronic health or registry records.
7 Limited access to trial information.

An important component of diversity solutions, especially for rare hematologic diseases, is access to robust, reliable epidemiological and patient-level diversity data. The lack of these data within and outside the United States is a barrier to achieving diversity in clinical trials. Establishing national and global standards for self-identification may help solve this problem.

Social media is 1 of the primary ways people seek out information. Therefore, it is important for researchers to leverage digital platforms, when appropriate, to engage in patient communities. Working with advocacy groups and digital thought leaders who have significant social media presence can help disseminate research information in patient-friendly language to broad groups, thereby improving clinical trial awareness, interest, and enrollment.
8 Community physicians often are not engaged in the clinical trial ecosystem.

Diverse enrollment for rare diseases requires (a) strategic engagement of community physicians and (b) trial design models that can be implemented at local community centers, where trial processes are completed either as an extension of a research center or as a research site themselves.

To accomplish this effectively, trial sponsors should aim to raise awareness about their trials to community physicians, by developing plain language versions of the protocol and creating trial-specific educational resources. Such resources help build understanding around the rationale for all elements of the trial design and inform the community physician's decision as it relates to offering a trial to their people living with classical hematologic diseases.

### Venlafaxine [^113ZwhCp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment with venlafaxine tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including venlafaxine tablets may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

Sustained Hypertension Venlafaxine treatment is associated with sustained increases in blood pressure in some patients. (1) In a premarketing study comparing three fixed doses of venlafaxine (75, 225, and 375 mg/day) and placebo, a mean increase in supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) of 7.2 mm Hg was seen in the 375 mg/day group at week 6 compared to essentially no changes in the 75 and 225 mg/day groups and a mean decrease in SDBP of 2.2 mm Hg in the placebo group. (2) An analysis for patients meeting criteria for sustained hypertension (defined as treatment-emergent SDBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and ≥ 10 mm Hg above baseline for 3 consecutive visits) revealed a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of sustained hypertension for venlafaxine:

An analysis of the patients with sustained hypertension and the 19 venlafaxine patients who were discontinued from treatment because of hypertension (< 1% of total venlafaxine-treated group) revealed that most of the blood pressure increases were in a modest range (10 to 15 mm Hg, SDBP). Nevertheless, sustained increases of this magnitude could have adverse consequences. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported in post marketing experience. Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before treatment with venlafaxine. It is recommended that patients receiving venlafaxine have regular monitoring of blood pressure. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving venlafaxine, either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.

### Idelalisib (Zydelig) [^115ydinB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of Zydelig was based on progression free survival (PFS), as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). The trial was stopped for efficacy following the first pre-specified interim analysis. Results of a second interim analysis continued to show a statistically significant improvement for Zydelig + R compared to placebo + R for the major efficacy outcome measure of PFS (HR: 0.18, 95% CI [0.10, 0.32], p < 0.0001).

At the final analysis, with a median follow-up of 8.3 months for the Zydelig + R group, and 5.6 months for the placebo + R group, the median PFS for the Zydelig + R group was 19.4 months (95% CI: 12.3, Not Reached) versus 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.0, 7.3) for the placebo + R group (HR: 0.15, 95% CI [0.09, 0.24], p < 0.0001).

Updated efficacy results are shown in Table 7 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 1.

### Guidance for an effective approach to integrated evidence planning in a dynamic world [^113Sx59q]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The value of a medicine is defined by its impact on patients, caregivers, health system, and society. A pharmaceutical company will generate evidence to demonstrate this value in various studies, including randomized clinical trials, non-interventional and observational studies, real-world data analyses, modeling, and simulation. The quality and strength of the evidence supporting a medicine's effectiveness, safety and product quality will drive decisions by healthcare system stakeholders for marketing authorization (regulatory authorities). Additional evidence of comparative clinical, humanistic, economic, and societal value of the medicine will be critical for reimbursement coverage by HTA (health technology assessment) bodies and payers, guideline inclusion by clinical societies, and ultimately the treatment decision between a patient and their healthcare provider (HCP). The purpose of this article is to provide practical guidance for an effective approach to evidence planning for pharmaceutical companies. In the first section, we give a brief overview of the requirements for evidence generation from the perspectives of healthcare system decision makers, key functions involved in evidence generation within a pharmaceutical company, and different archetypes of products. We then discuss how a company can implement effective integrated evidence planning across the lifecycle of a product. We also review how requirements are likely to evolve given recent changes in major healthcare system regulations, such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) drug price negotiations in the US and EU HTA Regulation (HTAR) in Europe, and finally provide some practical recommendations of how to start implementing a new integrated evidence approach.

v1. 4 months; P <. 001). The overall, major, and very good partial response rates were 84%, 81%, and 19%, respectively. The major response rate was lower in those with refractory versus relapsed disease. The median follow-up time was 33 months, and the median progression-free survival was 30 months. Introduction 1Treatment options for WM include alkylating agents, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, proteasome inhibitors, and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 2Highly recurring somatic mutations in MYD88and CXCR4are found in patients with WM, and can affect disease presentation, prognosis, and treatment response to BTKis. MYD88-mutated WM cells engineered to express either wild-type or mutated CXCR4with venetoclax triggered apoptosis and sensitized cells to various chemotherapeutics including BTKis. 6In a prospective phase I study, all four patients with WM attained a major response to venetoclax.

The median DOR for the 19 patients who attained PR was 34 months and for the six patients who attained VGPR was 37 months. The DOR for the one patient who attained MR was 9 months. P = 0.006). All 32 patients were alive at time of data cutoff, for a 30-month overall survival rate of 100%. 14 2Importantly, a rapid decline in PFS between months 24 and 36 was observed in 10 patients who completed the 2-year course of Protocol therapy, suggesting that indefinite continuation of venetoclax may be necessary in patients with WM. Importantly, CXCR4mutation status did not affect response or PFS to venetoclax, in contrast to experiences with BTKis. 13, 16, 17 18, 19Our results suggested similar levels of efficacy for venetoclax for either BTKi-naive or previously exposed patients, thereby offering a meaningful, active treatment option for those previously exposed to a BTKi.

Summary of Discontinued Clinical Trials in Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and First-Line CLL

Zydelig is not indicated for patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma or previously untreated CLL either as monotherapy or in combination with rituximab or BR. Safety data described below reflect exposure to Zydelig in three randomized, double-blind clinical trials (Studies 312–0123, 313–0124, and 313–0125) in patients with CLL and iNHL.

In Study 312–0123 (NCT01980888), 311 patients with previously untreated CLL received up to 6 cycles of BR with or without Zydelig 150 mg twice daily.

In Study 313–0124 (NCT01732913), 295 patients with previously treated iNHL [FL 66%, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) 19%, SLL 9%, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) 6%] received 8 doses of R with or without Zydelig 150 mg twice daily. Patients had a median of one prior therapy.

In Study 313–0125 (NCT01732926), 475 patients with previously treated iNHL (FL 63%, MZL 15%, SLL 11%, LPL/WM 11%) received up to 6 cycles of BR with or without Zydelig 150 mg twice daily. Patients had a median of two prior therapies.

These three studies were terminated early due to a higher incidence of fatal and/or serious adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Zydelig in combination with R or BR. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were in the system organ classes of infections and infestations, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Zydelig. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders - Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)

### Policies to promote affordability and access across the life cycle of costly new drugs [^114XmAdA]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Strong health systems are also essential to scaling access. Beyond tools like health technology assessment and demand forecasting aiming for more efficient use of existing resources, countries need robust infrastructure, skilled workforces, effective procurement, and innovative delivery models. Health system strengthening has emerged as a key development strategy, recognising that resilient, well funded systems are vital for equitable healthcare. Though resource intensive, such systems enable efficient allocation through tools including reimbursement mechanisms, market based models, pharmacovigilance, and regulatory oversight, ensuring new (and older) treatments reach patients when they are needed.

Key messages

Persistent systemic challenges in the medicine life cycle hinder equitable access to novel therapies, whether for ongoing health challenges or acute health emergencies
Tackling these challenges requires actions that prioritise equity from research and development through to post-market use
Strategic, coordinated collaboration across countries and sectors is essential, as is the need to embed equity considerations from the start of the medicine life cycle
Effective solutions include enforceable pricing and access provisions in publicly funded research and development, alternative innovation models, global collaboration on regulatory processes, and expanded localised manufacturing

### Analysis and prediction of cardiovascular research hotspots, trends and interdisciplinarity [^114xYqJp]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Comprehensive data and analyses on cardiovascular research could clarify recent research trends for the academic community and facilitate policy development. We examined publications and reference data to identify research topics, trends and interdisciplinarity for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

We extracted and clustered text fragments from the titles and abstracts of 2512445 publications using artificial intelligence techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) for semantic analysis. Cardiovascular experts identified topics and document clusters based on the output of those semiautomatic methods. We also applied machine learning algorithms to predict the trends over the next 5 years in each field. We examined the crossover between the two cluster groups using citation relationships in the documents.

Results

Research in clinical studies showed the most notable increase; that was followed by research in population and basic studies. The research hotspots were minimally invasive treatments for valve disease, circulatory haemodynamics, and prevention and control of hypertension. The fastest-growing topics were health monitoring, evidence-based medicine and immunotherapy. We found extensive crossover relationships among document clusters for the periods of 2017–2018 and 2020–2021.

Conclusions

This study provides valuable insights into the research hotspots for cardiovascular research, including an increasing emphasis on early disease detection and prevention, exploration of minimally invasive treatments and assessment of risk factors. The research landscape demonstrates signs of interdisciplinarity and integration as reflected in citation relationships. These findings suggest practical implications for optimising resource allocation in healthcare systems, guiding clinical guideline updates and informing policy-making to prioritise high-impact research areas aligned with evolving CVD challenges. Given the evolving global burden of CVD, continuous research and innovation are imperative, with interdisciplinary collaboration assuming a pivotal role in advancing scientific knowledge.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study data and participants

Data were drawn from the HCP‐A Lifespan 2.0 Release and included 725 healthy adults aged 36 to 90 across four sites with harmonized MRI protocols. Participants with major psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) or neurological conditions (e.g. stroke, brain tumors, Parkinson's disease) requiring diagnosis/treatment were excluded. After quality control, 582 participants remained for MAP MRI and DTI analyses. Exclusions were based solely on psychiatric or neurological conditions; medication use was recorded but not exclusionary. Demographics, years of education (YOE), and body mass index (BMI) were recorded (Table 1). Although race was not a focus, MoCA analyses were adjusted for it. Among the 582 participants, 388 were White, 83 Black, 42 Asian, 32 Hispanic/Latino, and 37 other.

2.2 Participant classification and its validation

The HCP‐A study assessed cognition and motor function using two National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox measures (Table 1). Cognitive performance was evaluated via the Fluid Cognition Composite Score, reflecting domains sensitive to aging and neurodegeneration. Physical endurance was assessed using the 2‐Minute Walk Test. Based on these metrics, participants were clustered into four non‐diagnostic groups using k ‐means clustering (as detailed in section 2.5): CMT, CD, MD, and CMD. MoCA, walk speed, and grip strength, which are established markers of cognitive and motor performance, respectively, were used to validate group classifications.

### Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [^114k9GGt]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Strategies for advancing generic agents to late-stage trials

Legislation is needed to provide incentives for development of generic drugs as marketable treatments for AD (Table 3). In the US and Europe, statutes and regulatory policies have led to the development of many new drug therapies for rare diseases, and similar legislative strategies including tax incentives and market exclusivity might be used to enhance interest in repurposed drug development. Legislation can be advanced to incentivize development of repurposed generics for serious illnesses for which there are insufficient alternative therapies such as AD/NDDs. Attaching payment to the indication for which the repurposed agent is approved would allow revenue generation from sales for the new use of the agent. An innovation surcharge could be collected from generic wholesalers when a new use is involved. Other solutions might include enabling generic companies to have larger pharmaceutical enterprises advance Phase 3 studies of their generic repurposed agents in return for fees collected from the generic developer if the development program is successful. Many nations and regions are re-examining their policies regarding market access for repurposed agents including Europe, Sweden, United Kingdom, and Australia. Japan has a novel approval mechanism for off label use of drugs applicable to repurposed agents and has considered an approach to approval of repurposed drugs based on demonstration of safety in the population treated by the new use. In the European Union, a Virtual Repurposing Observatory group has been established to conduct a pilot project comprised of support from not-for-profit stakeholders to generate data on new therapeutic uses of established medicines. Information from the Observatory could help transform the process for approval of repurposed agents.

### Mapping the research landscape of cleft lip and palate management: insights from a bibliometric perspective [^1115PhA6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is the most common congenital anomalous deformity of the oral face, and treatment of CLP has changed dramatically with the development of surgical techniques and advances in humanistic medicine. However, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research trends in this field is still lacking.

Methods

The authors systematically analyzed 3994 publications related to CLP treatment in the Web of Science Core Collection from 2005 to 2024 by bibliometric methods.

Results

The results showed that global CLP research has shown a continuous growth trend, with the USA leading the way with 1084 publications, and the United Kingdom and The Netherlands significantly leading the way in terms of publication quality (average number of citation 26.13/24.76). Core research institutions include University of Sao Paulo and Chang Gung Hospital. Core authors Shi Bing and Semb Gunvor lead the field with 45 and 44 publications, respectively. Keyword analysis reveals that research hotspots have shifted from basic repair to multidimensional rehabilitation, including emerging directions such as symmetry aesthetics, orthodontic treatment, and speech therapy. Clustering of co-cited literature identified 19 themes, highlighting the importance of nonsurgical dimensions such as psychological adjustment and unmet needs.

Conclusion

This study reveals for the first time the evolution of the knowledge structure of CLP treatment through visual analysis, providing valuable insights into clinical care and contributing to the advancement of the field of CLP management.

Quantifying regulatory andassessments

Assigning summary values to each of the variables potentially impacting the role of RWE enabled analysis of the most to least commented variables and their type: positive (+), mixed (~), or negative (−).

Within the Clinical context area, the most frequently discussed variables were severity, rarity, and lack of alternative treatment, mentioned in at least 94% of regulatory and 85% of HTA reports. This was followed by unmet need (85% and 82% respectively) and authorities' knowledge of disease characteristics (73% and 78% respectively, Figure S8). The vast majority of comments on these variables confirmed the severity, rarity, and unmet need of the disease object of the submission.

HTAbs commented more frequently than regulatory agencies on health equity (0% for regulatory agencies and 37% for HTAbs) and product administration advantages (18% and 52% respectively).

In the Strength of evidence area, the most discussed variables were effect size (63% for regulatory agencies and 83% for HTAbs) and bias/comparability (61% and 69%, respectively; Figure 3). In contrast, variables describing RWD sources were the least acknowledged, with 37% of RWE studies lacking comments on all of the variables in this category (29% for regulatory agencies and 47% for HTAbs), compared to 5% for the study design category and 26% for effect size.

Figure 3
Frequency of positive, neutral, and negative summary values across all submissions for RWE variables. HTAbs, health technology assessment bodies; RWE, real‐world evidence.

The type of commentary in the Strength of evidence area was primarily negative (37% for regulatory agencies and 47% for HTAbs), addressing uncertainties regarding data sources and study designs. Positive commentary was more common among regulatory agencies (33%) than HTAbs (16%). HTAbs' positive comments mainly focused on effect size, while they spread across nearly all considered variables for regulatory agencies.

5.2 Risk of Teratogenicity

MAVENCLAD may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus during MAVENCLAD dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course.

In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before initiation of each treatment course of MAVENCLAD and prevented by the use of effective contraception during MAVENCLAD dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during treatment with MAVENCLAD should discontinue treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. MAVENCLAD is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception.

5.3 Lymphopenia

MAVENCLAD causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. In clinical studies, 87% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients experienced lymphopenia. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment course and were lower with each additional treatment course. In patients treated with a cumulative dose of MAVENCLAD 3.5 mg per kg over 2 courses as monotherapy, 26% and 1% had nadir absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 and less than 200 cells per microliter, respectively. At the end of the second treatment course, 2% of clinical study patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter; median time to recovery to at least 800 cells per microliter was approximately 28 weeks.

Additive hematological adverse reactions may be expected if MAVENCLAD is administered prior to or concomitantly with other drugs that affect the hematological profile [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. The incidence of lymphopenia less than 500 cells per microliter was higher in patients who had used drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS prior to study entry (32.1%), compared to those with no prior use of these drugs (23.8%).

Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential including lymphocyte count prior to, during, and after treatment with MAVENCLAD. See Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) for timing of CBC measurements and additional instructions based on the patient's lymphocyte counts and clinical status (e.g., infections).

### Frontline treatment of symptomatic MYD88L265P-mutant waldenstrom macroglobulinemia… [^114F1m7D]. ASCO Daily News (2021). Medium credibility.

The discovery of the highly recurrent, gain-of-function MYD88 L265P mutation, harbored by more than 90% of patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, was critical in deepening our understanding of the disease biology. 1The mutated MYD88protein triggers Bruton tyrosine kinase activation, a seminal finding that led to the use of BTK inhibitors, a novel class of drugs for WM. The crucial decision to initiate treatment is still guided by the 2002 consensus recommendations from the Second International Workshop on Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, and the overarching goals of treatment are to control the disease and improve the quality of life. 4 Rituximab-based chemotherapy regimens have been the mainstay of treatment of nearly 2 decades, with good data to support their use in WM.

In a subset analysis of the phase III StiL trial, bendamustine plus rituximab was markedly superior to rituximab plus CHOP for patients with WM in terms of efficacy and has been universally adopted as a frontline regimen. 7, 8 The phase III StiL NHL7–2008 MAINTAIN trial recently reaffirmed the efficacy of BR, but failed to show any clinically meaningful advantage of additional 2-year rituximab maintenance therapy in patients who had achieved at least a partial response following induction with 4–6 cycles of BR. 9 The patients who relapsed within 2 years of BR therapy demonstrated dismal outcomes, but BTKi-based salvage therapies were unavailable to the majority of these patients.
9. The approval of ibrutinib was a turning point in the management of symptomatic WM. 10 However, when originally studied in the patients with relapsed/refractory disease, ibrutinib was noted to be predominantly effective only in MYD88 L265P-mutant WM.

11As frontline therapy, it was evaluated in the MYD88-mutant population only, demonstrating an impressive overall response rate, although complete response was elusive. L265P 12Acalabrutinib, is another BTKi has shown an ORR of 93% and 2-year PFS of 90% for treatment-naive WM. 13Zanubrutinib, a newer BTKi with fewer off-target effects, has demonstrated marked efficacy in the frontline setting in the BGB3111-Au003 study. 24%). 15Among patients with MYD88-mutant WM, additional somatic subclonal, nonsense, or frameshift mutations in the CXCR4 gene, similar to the germline mutations encountered in WHIM syndrome, can be identified in up to 30% to 40% of patients, but their clinical impact on patients treated with a BTKi is unfolding. In particular, the concurrent presence of L265P CXCR4mutation is predictive of poorer outcomes with a BTKi. WHIM/NS 16. MYD88 L265P-mutant WM.

Unfortunately, there currently are no prospective data comparing these two approaches in WM. Therefore, even with the availability of more options, the decision regarding the optimal frontline treatment strategy is largely empirical, relying heavily on single-arm phase II trials, randomized phase III trials with control arms that are considered obsolete today, cross-trial comparisons, drug access, patient preference and comorbidities. In our opinion, BR remains a viable and appealing option, given the finite duration of therapy, manageable adverse effect profile, lack of cardiotoxicity, low rates of second malignancies, and clinical efficacy regardless of the. MYD88 genotype. If the presence of MYD88mutation is confirmed and the patient prefers an oral regimen administered continuously until progression or unacceptable toxicity, a BTKi would be a suitable frontline agent.

### FRAME: framework for real-world evidence assessment to mitigate evidence uncertainties for efficacy / effectiveness-an evaluation of regulatory and health technology assessment decision making [^113xPCWn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Real-World Evidence (RWE) is increasingly used in submissions to regulatory agencies and health technology assessment bodies (HTAbs) to support the efficacy and effectiveness of new medicines and indications. However, there is limited information on the RWE characteristics that impact its role in approval and reimbursement decisions. To investigate these characteristics, we developed FRAME: a Framework for Real-world evidence Assessment to Mitigate Evidence uncertainties for efficacy/effectiveness. We compiled a list of medicinal product indications where RWE supported the efficacy of interventional trials or assessed effectiveness in observational settings. FRAME was applied to a prioritized subset of these submissions to authorities from North America, Europe, and Australia. For each product indication, we extracted information on characteristics describing the submission, clinical context, strength of evidence, and process factors from publicly available assessment reports. Of the 87 identified medicinal product indications, 15 were prioritized, covering 68 submissions and 76 RWE studies across 11 authorities in scope. Four main results emerged: (i) low granularity within assessment reports on the analyzed variables, limiting the learnings from analyzing them; (ii) variability in how RWE was assessed within and across regulatory agencies and HTAbs; (iii) a positive association between the proportion of positive comments from authorities on RWE studies and their impact on decision making. Particularly, a large effect size was consistently noted when RWE was considered primary evidence; and (iv) limited use of advanced RWE study designs. These findings support five recommendations to enhance shared learning on RWE, clarify its evidentiary value, and generate evidence to better support authorities' decision making.

### Agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme) [^111gev2T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to FABRAZYME administration, consider pretreating with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids. Administration of FABRAZYME should be supervised by a healthcare provider knowledgeable in the management of hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis has occurred during the early course of enzyme replacement therapy and after extended duration of therapy. Initiate FABRAZYME in a healthcare setting with appropriate medical monitoring and support measures, including access to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment.

If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) occurs, discontinue FABRAZYME and immediately initiate appropriate medical treatment, including use of epinephrine. Consider the risks and benefits of re-administering FABRAZYME following severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis). Inform patients of the symptoms of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and to seek immediate medical care should symptoms occur.
Consider testing for IgE antibodies in FABRAZYME-treated patients who experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and consider the risks and benefits of continued treatment in patients with anti-FABRAZYME IgE antibodies. There are no marketed tests for antibodies against FABRAZYME. If testing is warranted, contact Genzyme Corporation at 1–800–745–4447 [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
Patients who have had a positive skin test to FABRAZYME or who have tested positive for FABRAZYME-specific IgE antibodies have been rechallenged with FABRAZYME using a rechallenge protocol. Rechallenge of these patients should only occur under the direct supervision of qualified personnel with appropriate medical monitoring and support measures readily available [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Novel treatment options for multiple myeloma [^113CessL]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common hematologic malignancy in the United States, is characterized by repeated cycles of remission and relapse, with increasing resistance to treatment after each line of therapy. Despite the virtually incurable nature of MM, recent therapeutic breakthroughs have fundamentally reshaped its treatment landscape. This review explores evolving care paradigms, spanning from newly diagnosed MM to relapsed or refractory disease. In the frontline setting, treatment strategies have shifted beyond their traditional emphasis on autologous stem-cell transplant eligibility to a broader categorization of patients on the basis of their suitability for quadruplet therapy. In the relapsed/refractory setting, novel immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies and bispecific antibodies, have revolutionized treatment, offering new hope for patients with previously limited options. Precision medicine is playing a growing role in MM treatment, with venetoclax showing significant efficacy in patients with t(11;14) translocation, advancing targeted therapy for this subgroup. On the horizon, investigational CAR-T products and cereblon E3 ligase modulators, such as mezigdomide and iberdomide, may provide faster, more durable responses compared with current therapies. In addition, belantamab mafodotin, an antibody-drug conjugate withdrawn from the US market in 2022, is on the verge of reapproval after positive results from recent randomized trials. While these therapies offer significant potential, challenges remain in managing toxicity, ensuring treatment accessibility, and optimizing sequencing strategies. As the therapeutic arsenal expands, the need for personalized MM treatment plans that balance efficacy with quality of life becomes even more essential.

### Venetoclax-based treatment combinations in relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma: practice patterns and impact of secondary cytogenetic abnormalities on outcomes [^116ZgNNy]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we report efficacy and outcomes with venetoclax-based regimens in a cohort of heavily pretreated patients, majority of whom were triple-class refractory. Despite improvements in therapeutic strategies for MM, heavily pretreated disease continues to present a challenge particularly in frail patients not eligible for immune effector therapies. Even in candidates eligible for CAR-T therapy, effective bridging strategies can be limited given the high likelihood of drug refractoriness to various classes of antimyeloma therapy. Here, we demonstrate excellent ORR of 57% with venetoclax based therapies in triple-class refractory patients harboring a t(11;14). This is better than historical ORRs of around 30–45% without various combination therapies in triple-class refractory patients, highlighting utility of venetoclax- based combinations in heavily pretreated patients. The ORR of 64% and median PFS of 11.8 months in patients with t(11;14) are consistent with previously reported studies. This response rate and durability is comparable to that seen with bispecific antibodies in a similar population, highlighting the utility of this approach in clinical practice.

Identification of product indications: Search and prioritization strategy

We conducted a two‐stage search and prioritization strategy (Figure S2).

Stage 1: Search – We compiled an extensive list of medicinal product indication (hereafter product) submissions that included RWE to support the efficacy of interventional trials or assess effectiveness in observational settings. Sources included publications on the use of RWE in authority decisions identified through a targeted review, gray literature including presentations from authorities, and case studies from relevant data/technology companies.

Stage 2: Prioritization – For the identified submissions, we screened authorities' assessment reports to confirm the use of RWE for efficacy/effectiveness and gather additional information to determine which to prioritize for in‐depth review.

For the prioritization, the following was considered:
Select submissions dated between January 2017 and June 2024 to reflect the period associated with increasing interest around RWE.
Identify at least one submission per authority in scope, and to enable comparisons, prioritize products assessed by multiple authorities.
Include both submissions with a positive and negative opinion, as well as where RWE contributed to decision making and where it did not.
Ensure a balanced range of values across the following factors that could impact the contribution of RWE to authority decisions: (i) types of application (new Marketing Authorisation Applications — MAA, Extension of Indication — EoI), (ii) therapeutic area, (iii) orphan designation, (iv) rarity, and (v) study design.

Regarding the study designs, we classified them following the FDA guidanceand corresponding literature. This led to consider the following spectrum: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) that use RWD (shortened to RCT with RWD); Single‐Arm Trials (SAT) analyzed with an external control arm that relies on RWD (SAT contextualized); and observational studies.

### Zanubrutinib (Brukinsa) [^117VjDrT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia

The efficacy of BRUKINSA was evaluated in ASPEN [NCT03053440], a randomized, active control, open-label trial, comparing BRUKINSA and ibrutinib in patients with MYD88 L265P mutation (MYD88) WM. Patients in Cohort 1 (n = 201) were randomized 1:1 to receive BRUKINSA 160 mg twice daily or ibrutinib 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by number of prior therapies (0 vs 1–3 vs > 3) and CXCR4 status (presence or absence of a WHIM-like mutation as measured by Sanger assay).

The major efficacy outcome was the response rate defined as PR or better as assessed by IRC based on standard consensus response criteria from the International Workshop on Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (IWWM)-6 criteria. An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR).

The median age was 70 years (range: 38 to 90) and 68% were male. Of those enrolled, 2% were Asian, 91% were White, and 7% were of unknown race. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 was present in 93% patients at baseline and 7% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. A total of 82% had relapsed/refractory disease with 85% having received prior alkylating agents and 91% prior anti-CD20 therapy. The median number of prior therapies in those with relapsed/refractory disease was 1 (range: 1 to 8). A total of 91 (45%) patients had International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) high WM.

The study did not meet statistical significance for the prespecified efficacy outcome of superior CR+VGPR as assessed by IRC, tested first in patients with R/R disease in ASPEN.

Table 20 shows the response rates in ASPEN based on IRC assessment.

### Diagnosis and management of waldenströM macroglobulinemia… [^113R3Uim]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance Waldenström macroglobulinemia, an IgM-associated lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, has witnessed several practice-altering advances in recent years. With availability of a wider array of therapies, the management strategies have become increasingly complex. Our multidisciplinary team appraised studies published or presented up to December 2015 to provide consensus recommendations for a risk-adapted approach to WM, using a grading system. Observations Waldenström macroglobulinemia remains a rare, incurable cancer, with a heterogeneous disease course. The major classes of effective agents in WM include monoclonal antibodies, alkylating agents, purine analogs, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. However, the highest-quality evidence from rigorously conducted randomized clinical trials remains scant.

Conclusions and Relevance Recognizing the paucity of data, we advocate participation in clinical trials, if available, at every stage of WM. Specific indications exist for initiation of therapy. Outside clinical trials, based on the synthesis of available evidence, we recommend bendamustine-rituximab as primary therapy for bulky disease, profound hematologic compromise, or constitutional symptoms attributable to WM. Dexamethasone-rituximab-cyclophosphamide is an alternative, particularly for nonbulky WM. Routine rituximab maintenance should be avoided. Plasma exchange should be promptly initiated before cytoreduction for hyperviscosity-related symptoms. Stem cell harvest for future use may be considered in first remission for patients 70 years or younger who are potential candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation.

At relapse, retreatment with the original therapy is reasonable in patients with prior durable responses and good tolerability to previous regimen. Ibrutinib is efficacious in patients with relapsed or refractory disease harboring MYD88 L265P mutation. In the absence of neuropathy, a bortezomib-rituximab–based option is reasonable for relapsed or refractory disease. In select patients with chemosensitive disease, autologous stem cell transplantation should be considered at first or second relapse. Everolimus and purine analogs are suitable options for refractory or multiply relapsed WM. Our recommendations are periodically updated as new, clinically relevant information emerges.

### 2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis [^111SYMbp]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Inadequate renal response or refractory lupus nephritis — In people with any LN class with inadequate renal response (i.e., have not achieved at least a partial renal response by 6–12 months), we conditionally recommend consideration of escalation strategies based on prior regimen: for initial dual therapy, escalate to triple therapy (glucocorticoids plus either MPAA plus belimumab, MPAA plus CNI, or ELNT CYC plus belimumab); for initial triple therapy, change to an alternative listed triple therapy or consider addition of an anti-CD20 agent to MPAA or ELNT CYC. Close monitoring is emphasized because treatment should be escalated or changed earlier, even at ≤ 3 months, in patients with rapidly declining GFR or increasing proteinuria due to risk of potentially irreversible damage. GPS states medication dose and patient adherence should be assessed regularly throughout treatment as an important first step in evaluating inadequate response or refractory LN. For refractory disease (ie, failed two standard therapy courses), we conditionally recommend treatment escalation to a more intensive regimen, including the addition of anti-CD20 agents, combination therapy with three non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressive agents (ie, MPAA, belimumab and CNI), or referral for investigational therapy; when refractory LN is diagnosed, one may consider a kidney biopsy, and in cases of true refractory LN, meta-analyses suggest that 80–90% of patients convert to partial or complete responders with rituximab.

Principles for novel neurologic therapeutics — The statement provides guiding principles for the American Academy of Neurology's (AAN) approach when evidence is limited or there is no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved indication, and it does not provide clinical recommendations; the AAN recommends an approach in which the patient and neurologist carefully review all available evidence and discuss the potential risks and benefits of the therapy, including when patients are contemplating asserting their right to try. FDA review and approval remain the gold standard supporting the introduction and continued use of therapeutics for neurologic diseases, and potential novel treatments that have not been approved or even reviewed by the FDA may emerge from different sources, including government coordination-supported basic, translational, and clinical research; industry-sponsored investigations; patient advocacy groups; traditional medicines used in indigenous cultures; and other substances or approaches with variable levels of evidence favoring their possible roles as treatments or evaluating their risks. The underlying tenets include the critical role of high-quality evidence and the importance of the relationship between the patient and physician to inform decision making related to any contemplated therapy.

Susceptibility Pattern of MAC Isolates

Susceptibility testing was performed on MAC isolates recovered at baseline, at the time of breakthrough on therapy or during post-therapy follow-up. The T100 radiometric broth method was employed to determine azithromycin and clarithromycin MIC values. Azithromycin MIC values ranged from < 4 to > 256 µg/mL and clarithromycin MICs ranged from < 1 to > 32 µg/mL. The individual MAC susceptibility results demonstrated that azithromycin MIC values could be 4 to 32 - fold higher than clarithromycin MIC values.

During treatment and post-treatment follow - up for up to 3.7 years (median: 9 months) in Study 189, a total of 6/68 (9%) and 6/57 (11%) of the patients randomized to azithromycin 600 mg daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day respectively, developed MAC blood culture isolates that had a sharp increase in MIC values. All twelve MAC isolates had azithromycin MICs ≥ 256 µg/mL and clarithromycin MICs > 32 µg/mL. These high MIC values suggest development of drug resistance. However, at this time, specific breakpoints for separating susceptible and resistant MAC isolates have not been established for either macrolide.

### A group concept mapping study of stakeholder perspectives on digital therapeutics economic value drivers [^112cDx8S]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The study revealed both anticipated and unexpected insights, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how different stakeholder groups influence a DTx ability to generate economic value. Two observations merit particular attention.

The improvement of patients' clinical outcomes emerged as a primary concern across all stakeholder groups (Fig. 2). However, despite this broad consensus, this cluster ranked only fourth in importance for Public Stakeholders. This discrepancy may be attributed to the heterogeneous composition of this stakeholder category, encompassing individuals with diverse backgrounds in technology, clinical practice, and payer systems. Also, the complexity of decision-making regarding coverage, payment and reimbursement has intensified, with priority setting and resource allocation posing significant challenges. Public stakeholders are tasked with evaluating not only the clinical and financial impact of individual DTx interventions but also their broader implications for healthcare systems and populations. This evaluation must be conducted in the context of competing alternative treatments and interventions, all vying for limited funding and coverage. Therefore, while the clinical impact of these interventions is crucial, it is not the sole determining factor for final decision.

A second observation relates to Researchers appearing to give less consideration to some factors as compared to other stakeholders groups. This is particularly evident for factors within the DTx Associated Costs, DTx Monetization Models, and DTx Healthcare System Impact clusters, despite Researchers acknowledging the importance of these factors. This divergence potentially reflects the heterogeneous composition of this stakeholder category, as well as Researchers' primary involvement in early stages of DTx development, such as conducting research, knowledge generation, and initial clinical validation. Their priorities or mandates may differ, as they are typically not tasked with examining costs during these initial stages of technology development and clinical validation. However, failing to consider these costs impact early on could negatively impact payment, reimbursement and adoption decisions. This finding underscores the critical role that all stakeholders, including researchers, play in ensuring DTx demonstrate economic value to potential payers. As innovations from research institutions often struggle to achieve commercial success, there exists a significant opportunity to enhance the commercialization of innovative research. A promising starting point could be fostering collaboration among major DTx stakeholder groups, such as through public-private partnerships. These collaborations should aim to integrate commercialization expertise earlier in the DTx lifecycle, ensuring that market viability is considered from the outset of development. By bridging the gap between academic research and commercial application, stakeholders can work together to overcome the challenges that currently hinder the successful translation of DTx innovations into commercially viable products.

### Genomic landscape of waldenströM macroglobulinemia and its impact on treatment strategies… [^112T3Bsw]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract Next-generation sequencing has revealed recurring somatic mutations in Waldenström macroglobulinemia, including. 4, 5Herein, we discuss the genomic landscape of WM and the impact of underlying genomics on disease presentation, transcriptional changes, treatment outcome, and overall survival. The use of MYD88and CXCR4mutation status to guide treatment in treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with WM is also discussed. 37Importantly, mutated MYD88–directed SYK activation triggers STAT3 and AKT prosurvival signaling. In preclinical studies, the addition of an SYK inhibitor triggered synthetic lethality when combined with ibrutinib. 37Taken together, these studies show that mutated MYD88 can direct multiple prosurvival cascades that lead to NFKB, AKT, ERK, and STAT3 activation in WM cells.

In vitro modeling of WM cells transduced with mutated CXCR4 reveals increased drug resistance in the presence of its ligand CXCL12 to multiple therapeutics including bendamustine, fludarabine, bortezomib, idelalisib, and ibrutinib. 43–45These studies also showed that resistance mediated by mutated CXCR4 could be reversed by use of CXCR4-blocking agents in both in vitro and in vivo studies. 43–45. The presence of CXCR4mutations has also affected clinical outcomes with other agents. Fewer major responses were preliminarily reported with the BTK inhibitor zanubrutinib, as well as with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, in prospective studies in patients with WM. 58, 59Time to response was also reported to be longer in patients with WM with CXCR4mutations receiving ixazomib-based therapy, a proteasome inhibitor, in a prospective phase II study.

60Conversely, a prospective study of patients with CXCR4-mutated WM treated with carfilzomib-based therapy showed no effect on clinical outcome. 61In a retrospective study, Sklavenitis-Pistofidis et al 62showed that bortezomib-based therapy could overcome the negative impact of CXCR4mutations on progression-free and overall survival. Conversely, those with wild-type MYD88showed earlier progression. 64In a retrospective study, Paludo et al 65also observed a trend for shorter progression-free survival and time to next treatment among genotyped patients with MYD88wild-type WM who received alkylator-based therapy. There were no differences in overall response rates between genotyped patients who were MYD88mutated or wild type, and no data on major responses were reported.

Although the previously discussed studies indicate that CXCR4represents an important target in WM, differences in response outcome could be modulated by the type of CXCR4mutation as well as its clonal presence. In a study by Castillo et al, 66patients on ibrutinib with nonsense mutations showed fewer major responses and shorter progression-free survival compared with those with frameshift CXCR4mutations or those wild-type for CXCR4. Given the importance of CXCR4mutation status in WM, a clinical trial assessing the impact of the CXCR4 inhibitor ulocuplumab with ibrutinib in patients with CXCR4-mutated WM was initiated. Mavorixafor, an orally administered CXCR4 antagonist, is also in clinical development for CXCR4-mutated WM.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Institutional readiness for novel therapeutics: a framework for multidisciplinary integration [^1136N98w]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The landscape of therapeutic options for rare diseases is rapidly expanding, including a range of novel treatments such as antisense oligonucleotides, enzyme replacement therapies, targeted small molecules, mRNA, and gene replacement therapies. The integration of these high-cost, advanced therapeutics into clinical practice presents significant challenges. This focused review aims to outline the practical aspects of implementing non-gene therapy therapeutics that have been recently approved for rare diseases in a clinical setting, focusing on the multidisciplinary efforts required for successful integration, the coordination with various healthcare specialists, and the management of institutional and insurance-related barriers. Effective implementation necessitates strong institutional support and comprehensive infrastructure, including specialized clinics and dedicated pharmacy services. Key strategies involve developing new treatment protocols, ensuring robust payor support, and coordinating with pharmaceutical companies. The successful deployment of these new to market therapeutics hinges on a well-coordinated, institution-wide approach that addresses both clinical and logistical challenges. Emphasizing multi-disciplinary collaboration and patient-centric care, institutions can navigate the complexities of recently approved rare disease treatments, improving outcomes and access for this vulnerable patient population.

### Multimodal gradients unify local and global cortical organization [^114WSxWL]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Generating multimodal connectome matrices

To investigate the vertex-wise multimodal connectomes, we first constructed a downsampled fsLR-5k surface using HCP's workbench tools (wb_command). The fsLR-32k surface templates and resampling spheres between "fsaverage" and "fs_LR" were accessed from the HCP's open-access pipeline. Subsequently, we downsampled the surface template, registration spheres, and mid-wall mask to 5k, resulting in a mesh comprising 4432 cortical vertices for each hemisphere. All vertex-wise analyzes were performed based on this fsLR-5k surface.

We calculated vertex-wise MPC matrices for each participant. Consistent with previous work, we constructed 14 equivolumetric surfaces between the pial and white matter boundaries to sample qT1 intensities across cortical depths. This procedure generated distinct intensity profiles reflecting intracortical microstructural composition at each cortical vertex. Data sampled from surfaces closest to the pial and white matter boundaries were removed to mitigate partial volume effects. Intensity values at each depth were mapped to a common template surface, resampled to fsLR-5k surface, and spatially smoothed across each surface independently (full width at half maximum [FWHM] = 3 mm). Vertex-wise intensity profiles were cross-correlated using partial correlations controlling for the average cortex-wide intensity profile and log-transformed. This procedure resulted in the MPC matrices representing participant-specific similarity in myelin proxies across the cortex.

To generate each individual's SC, we employed MRtrix on pre-processed DWI data. Each surface vertex from the fsLR-5k surface was translated into a volumetric region of interest that filled the cortical ribbon using workbench tools. This process yielded ~10 k seeds/targets for structural connectome generation. Anatomical segmentations and volumetric seeds were then mapped to DWI space, applying the non-linear registration warp-field mentioned earlier. Next, we estimated multi-shell and multi-tissue response functionsand performed constrained spherical deconvolution to derive a fiber orientation distribution map. This procedure, achieved through MRtrix, generated a tractogram with 40 M streamlines, with a maximum tract length of 250 mm and a fractional anisotropy cutoff of 0.06. To reconstruct whole-brain streamlines weighted by cross-sectional multipliers, we applied spherical deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2). Connection weights between seeds/targets were defined as the streamline count after SIFT2.

### Accelerating drug development for neuroblastoma: consensus statement from the third neuroblastoma drug development strategy forum [^114DLrhD]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

High-risk neuroblastoma is a poor prognosis cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for a disproportionate number of childhood cancer deaths. Many viable biological targets have been identified, and the number of potential combinations is even larger. Several products have attained marketing authorization for treatment of patients with neuroblastoma. Patient outcomes remain poor, with approximately 50% of children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma cured of their disease. International, multistakeholder Neuroblastoma Drug Development Strategy (NDDS) meetings were established more than a decade ago. This third NDDS meeting included academia, industry, regulatory, and patient advocacy representatives to prioritize agents and to address key challenges in drug development in this disease. Given the central role that anti-GD2 therapy plays, novel GD2-directed combinations were a key focus, including epigenetic enzymes such as EZH2 and immunologic targets such as IL15 and TIGIT as potential combination partners. GD2-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells were a top priority, along with emerging CAR-T targets such as B7-H3 and GPC2. Recognizing that combination therapies are likely to be most impactful for patients and for advancing therapies to frontline, another key focus was on high priority combinations of targeted therapies, including Aurora A kinase plus BCL2 or ATR inhibitors. Additional targets and agents were prioritized or deprioritized based upon current data. Access to drugs for clinical trials was viewed as a major barrier to progress. Strategies to overcome this challenge focused on united efforts by the international scientific and advocacy community and early engagement by industry with regulatory authorities.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112PFWM2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC cost/value methodology — therapies requiring a value statement: Consistent with the 2014 cost/value clinical practice guidelines, we suggest that clinical guidelines include economic value statements about all interventions for which economic evaluations of adequate quality are available, including preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies, and approaches to health care delivery relevant to the clinical guidelines. The decision about whether an economic value statement is appropriate should rely on the judgment of clinical and economic experts on the guideline writing committee, taking into account the clinical and population health relevance, cost, and available evidence. To the extent feasible, guideline committees should consider including economic value statements for: 1) interventions that receive Class 1 and 2A recommendations in the clinical guidelines, and 2) interventions for which an understanding of economic value is likely to influence adoption. An example of the latter would be an intervention that is expected to substantially impact total health care spending, either because it has a high cost or because a large number of individuals are likely to be eligible. When high-quality economic evaluations are scarce, economic value statements may highlight evidence gaps that can be addressed in future research (eg, indeterminate economic value due to a small number of studies). The first step in developing economic value statements is a review of the literature and consultation with subject matter experts in the field to identify all economic evaluations relevant to particular clinical guidelines.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^112kaUQj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### Ofatumumab (Arzerra) [^112K5ppo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Previously Untreated CLL

The efficacy of ARZERRA was evaluated in a randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study; 447 patients previously untreated for CLL were randomized to receive either ARZERRA as monthly intravenous infusions (Cycle 1: 300 mg on Day 1 and 1,000 mg on Day 8; subsequent cycles: 1,000 mg on Day 1 every 28 days) in combination with chlorambucil (10 mg/m2 orally on Days 1 to 7 every 28 days) or chlorambucil alone (10 mg/m2 orally on Days 1 to 7 every 28 days). Patients received treatment for a minimum of 3 cycles. Treatment was continued for 3 cycles beyond maximal response (2 consecutive response assessments of stable disease, partial response, or complete response) for up to 12 cycles. Approximately 60% of patients received 3 to 6 cycles of ARZERRA and 30% received 7 to 12 cycles.

This trial enrolled patients for whom fludarabine-based therapy was considered to be inappropriate by the investigator for reasons that included advanced age or presence of co-morbidities. In the overall trial population, the median age was 69 years (range: 35 to 92 years) and 69% of patients in both arms were at least 65 years of age. In the overall trial population, 72% of patients had 2 or more co-morbidities and 48% of patients had a creatinine clearance of less than 70 mL/min. Sixty-three percent (63%) of patients were male and 89% were white. Elevated beta-2 microglobulin (β2m) > 3,500 mcg/L was present in 72% of patients at baseline.

Efficacy was evaluated by progression-free-survival (PFS) as assessed by a blinded Independent Review Committee (IRC) using the International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines (2008). ARZERRA plus chlorambucil resulted in statistically significant improvement in IRC-assessed median PFS compared with chlorambucil alone (22.4 months versus 13.1 months; hazard ratio: 0.57 [0.45, 0.72]) (Table 9; Figure 1).

Secondary efficacy endpoints, including overall response (OR), complete response (CR), and duration of response, were also assessed by the IRC using the 2008 IWCLL Guidelines (Table 9).

### Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) [^116w4mBd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In KEYNOTE-051, the study population characteristics were median age of 11 years (range: 3 to 16); 71% female; 86% White and 14% Asian; and 57% had a Lansky/Karnofsky Score of 100. Seventy-one percent of patients had Stage IV and 14% had Stage III disease. Fifty-seven percent of patients received one prior line of therapy and 29% received two prior lines of therapy.

Discordant results were observed between local MSI-H or dMMR tests and central testing among patients enrolled in Cohort K of KEYNOTE-158. Among 104 tumor samples that were MSI-H or dMMR by local testing and also tested using the FoundationOne®CDx (F1CDx) test, 59 (56.7%) were MSI-H and 45 (43.3%) were not MSI-H. Among 169 tumor samples that were MSI-H or dMMR by local testing and also tested using the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel, 105 (62.1%) were dMMR and 64 (37.9%) were pMMR.

Efficacy results are summarized in Tables 83 and 84.

Exploratory analysis by TMB

In an exploratory analysis performed in 138 patients (Cohort K of KEYNOTE-158) who were tested retrospectively for tumor mutation burden (TMB) using an FDA-approved test, 45 (33%) had tumors with TMB score of < 10 mut/Mb; ORR in these 45 patients was 6.7% (95% CI: 1.4, 18.3). Among the 45 patients with TMB score of < 10 mut/Mb, 39 of the patients were pMMR/not MSI-H when tested using an FDA-approved test.

### New strategies for enhancing enrollment of underrepresented minorities in lymphoma clinical trials [^114pGTJS]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Clinical trials are essential for evaluating the efficacy of novel treatment strategies, informing treatment decisions, and advancing our understanding of cancer biology and therapy. Trials offer patients early access to new treatments, with the potential of improving outcomes and quality of life; access to clinical trials is an essential component of high-quality cancer care. Despite this critical role, < 5% of patients participate cancer clinical trials, with significant underrepresentation of disadvantaged patient populations, including underrepresented minorities. Regulatory bodies such as the National Institutes of Health and the FDA are increasingly focused on addressing this disparity by requiring inclusion patients from diverse backgrounds.

Access to clinical trials is a key component of high-quality lymphoma (and more generally, cancer) care. Improving access to clinical trials for all patients with lymphoma is thus essential to improving outcomes in patients with lymphoma. Increasing the representativeness of trials is not just equitable, it is essential to ensuring the evaluation of safety and efficacy of novel therapies. Clinical and correlative scientific data gathered through clinical trials are also essential for furthering our understanding of lymphoma biology and biomarkers of response and resistance to treatment, which may allow personalization of therapy and may aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Because practice-changing clinical trials advance the standards of lymphoma care, disparity in access to clinical trials will result in lost opportunities for outcome improvement and widen the gap of disparities between those with and without access.

Barriers to participation exist at multiple levels, including societal, institutional, interpersonal, and patient levels. Overcoming these barriers require multilevel strategies. Strategic investment in clinical trial infrastructure in health care centers serving target patient populations can improve access to trials in communities in which patients receive their care. Collaborations between sponsors, investigators, regulatory authorities, key community stakeholders, and patient groups are essential to align research efforts with community priorities, addressing disparities, and support changes that promote health equity.

Improving access for patients through culturally adapted educational material and patient-centered supports to reduce the burdens of participation in clinical trial can significantly affect patient opportunity to participate in clinical trials. By combining these strategies, we can make clinical trials more patient centric and inclusive, ultimately improving trial participation and outcomes. Addressing these multifaceted barriers and providing comprehensive support will ensure that the benefits of research are accessible to all patient populations.

### Biomarker utilization for regulatory decision making: a landscape analysis of neurological drug products approved by FDA (2008–2024) [^115j3bbV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past 15years, biomarkers have evolved into a significant component of neurological drug development and regulatory evaluation, with expanded roles and increasing impact. This landscape analysis covers new molecular entity (NME) products approved by Food and Drug Administration from 2008 to 2024 for neurological diseases, which demonstrates the growing utilization of biomarkers in regulatory decision making. This includes their use as surrogate endpoints, confirmatory evidence, and basis for dose selection. Our analysis suggested prominent roles of biomarkers in various therapeutic modalities, including small molecules, oligonucleotides, and monoclonal antibodies, as well as in the context of rare or slowly progressive diseases. However, several challenges hinder the effective utilization of biomarker data, including lack of established clinical relevance, variability in data quality, and bioanalytical issues. Addressing these challenges will require cross-sector collaboration, rigorous analytical validation, and a clear demonstration of the linkage between biomarker changes and meaningful clinical benefits. By strengthening the evidentiary foundation of biomarker data, stakeholders can accelerate innovative drug development for neurological diseases and other therapeutic areas.

### Characteristics of clinical trials associated with appeal and return on investment to participants: a review and framework [^115LWSP7]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, the control group on a clinical trial could alter the perception of appeal or return on investment from trial participation. For instance, control arms that do not mirror current standard treatments can potentially subject control group patients to suboptimal care, while casting doubt on the real advantages for patients in the experimental group. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generally requires studies to employ what is considered the standard of care at the initiation of the study, that standard can change over the course of the study, sometimes leading to a control arm that was demonstrated to be inferior to an approach approved after the study was initiated. Placebo, while uncommon in cancer clinical trials, can be administered if there is no clear standard of care at the time in which the study is being conducted.

Investigated agent and subsequent approval

The return on investment to participants from receiving a particular investigational agent in a clinical trial is easier to assess retrospectively, as it is dependent on the agent's efficacy, which is determined after the trial concludes. However, when therapies are already approved in a different tumor type or treatment setting, these could be considered as potentially more promising, and as such could be assessed in a prospective fashion (Figure 3).

Figure 3.
Pros and cons of different classes of investigational agents by retrospective analysis in clinical Trials. Arrow from left to right indicates classes of agents with less perceived value (left) to higher perceived value (right). For each class of agent, pros and cons of participation in a study based on retrospective assessment of the agent from a participant perspective is shown.

First-in-class drugs are pharmaceutical agents with novel mechanisms of action that are thought to be innovative and can lead to unprecedented patient outcomes.

One of the potential appeals of participating in trials is the ability to access innovative, first-in-class drugs. While these agents could be revolutionary and lead to changes in the standard of care, there is often minimal data regarding safety and efficacy at the time in which they are being studied. On the other hand, agents that improve upon previously available ones or that are already proven effective in other indications may have a similar mechanism of action and therapeutic indications as first-in-class agents, but are designed to enhance the efficacy and/or tolerability of existing drugs. As such, participating in studies evaluating such agents could lead to significant patient benefits with potentially less uncertainty about the potential efficacy and toxicity, and would allow to evaluate the appeal of the agent in a prospective fashion.

Inform patients that PML has occurred in patients who received OCREVUS. Inform the patient that PML is characterized by a progression of deficits and usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months. Instruct the patient of the importance of contacting their healthcare provider if they develop any symptoms suggestive of PML. Inform the patient that typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Hippocampal avoidance prophylactic cranial irradiation (HA-PCI) for small-cell lung cancer better preserves white matter networks compared to conventional PCI [^115yhQrU]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hippocampal avoidance during prophylactic cranial irradiation (HA-PCI) is proposed to reduce neurocognitive decline, while preserving the benefits of PCI. We evaluated whether (HA-)PCI induces changes in white matter (WM) microstructure and whether sparing the hippocampus has an impact on preserving brain network topology. Additionally, we evaluated associations between topological metrics with hippocampal volume and neuropsychological outcomes.

Methods

In this multicenter randomized phase 3 trial (NCT01780675), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients underwent neuropsychological testing and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before, 4 months (33 PCI, 37 HA-PCI) and 1 year (19 PCI, 17 HA-PCI) after (HA-)PCI. Changes in WM microstructure were investigated using whole-brain voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Both hippocampal and whole-brain graph measures were used to evaluate the topological organization of structural networks. Correlation analysis was performed to associate topological metrics with neuropsychological outcomes and hippocampal volume.

Results

Both HA-PCI and PCI were associated with decreased FA in major WM tracts, such as the corpus callosum, at 4 months and 1 year post-treatment. While these FA decreases did not differ significantly between treatment groups, only PCI demonstrated increased MD over time. Additionally, PCI showed decreased global efficiency and increased characteristic path length over time when compared to HA-PCI. Significant correlations were found between whole-brain graph measures and neuropsychological outcomes.

Conclusion

While both techniques induce important changes in the WM microstructure, HA-PCI might better preserve the topological organization of brain networks than PCI. The neuroprotective role of hippocampal sparing still needs further investigation.

### Global access to multiple myeloma therapies [^112G9sjz]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Initial reports indicate that access to contemporary therapies currently used in North America for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) varies internationally. No studies have quantitatively reported the extent of disparities in the access to MM therapies worldwide, with a goal to investigate access to MM therapies and barriers globally.

Methods

From June 18 to July 15, 2023, an electronic survey was distributed to 176 oncologists treating MM outside the United States. MM drugs were categorized by accessibility, with the cutoff for adequate access set at 60% of respondents affirming easy/moderate access.

Results

Ninety-five (54%) respondents from 33 countries completed the survey. Fifty-one percent of the respondents were from university-based academic programs, and 17% of the responders treated only plasma cell disorders. Most respondents had adequate access to noncellular MM therapies, except for isatuximab, ixazomib, selinexor, and elotuzumab. Among the cellular therapies, 17% had access to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy, whereas 23% had access to approved T-cell engagers (TCEs). Financial stress on patients and health care systems has emerged as a primary barrier to global inaccessibility of treatment drugs.

Conclusion

Global access to novel MM therapies remains challenging, and we have identified barriers and suggested strategies to bridge this gap.

### Patient and public health perspectives to inform expansion of hepatitis B treatment guidelines [^114Fq8Sr]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Elimination goals and the agenda for wider treatment may also prompt increased interest in novel surveillance tools for hepatitis B, including novel biomarkers of risk for long-term liver complications including HCC. These strategies are currently out of reach for most populations due to access barriers and cost, and if they are to inform routine practice, tools must be made widely accessible and affordable.

Having more individuals engage in existing NA therapy expands the population who are in a position to receive the new therapies for hepatitis B under development that are aiming at functional hepatitis B cure because a common eligibility criteria for these new therapies is based on HBV DNA suppression while on NA therapy. Current hepatitis B therapy does not exist in long acting or injectable formulation, but development of such agents could be of benefit in many populations, in particular to support adherence. Thus, expanded use of existing therapy "with support for parallel monitoring and follow-up" readies individuals, populations and clinical services for the roll-out of new therapies, and could further incentivize investment from pharmaceutical companies, funders, and the clinical research community.

Expanding treatment eligibility globally can play a role in improving future access to screening, sustainable care, and treatment by creating demand, which should drive the market towards reduced diagnostic and NA costs, and drive governments and health care systems to implement policies and leverage integrated care delivery to improve access. Therefore, there is a practical, service-level beneficial impact of wider treatment, including enhancements in clinical service provision, improvement in access to robust screening and risk assessment, opportunities to participate in clinical trials, and development of novel treatment strategies. These advances can improve quality of life, promote engagement in long-term care and treatment, and support the delivery of equitable, cost-effective healthcare.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112T2tTd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Selecting therapies for economic value statements in AHA/ACC guideline development is framed with explicit strength language: the authors state, "we suggest that clinical guidelines include economic value statements" for all interventions with adequate-quality economic evaluations; whether a value statement is appropriate "should rely on the judgment of clinical and economic experts". To the extent feasible, committees "should consider including economic value statements" for interventions with Class 1 and 2A recommendations and for interventions where understanding economic value is likely to influence adoption, with examples including high-cost therapies or those eligible to a large number of individuals. When high-quality evaluations are scarce, value statements "may highlight evidence gaps", and the first step in developing them is a literature review and consultation with subject matter experts to identify all relevant economic evaluations.

### Golimumab (Simponi aria) [^1112xda6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Malignancies in Adult Patients

The risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including SIMPONI ARIA should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF-blocker in patients who develop a malignancy.

In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-blockers including the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving anti-TNF treatment compared with patients in the control groups. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly patients with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF-blocking therapy. Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported with TNF-blocker use, including SIMPONI ARIA, in rheumatoid arthritis and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.

Rare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocking agents. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Nearly all of the reported TNF-blocker associated cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### Outcomes and level of evidence in radiation therapy research and different categories of radiotherapy innovations: an ESTRO-VBRO bibliometrics analysis of the literature [^114fmg44]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

The ESTRO-Value-Based Radiation Oncology project aims to enhance patient access to high-value radiotherapy innovations, by identifying interventions delivering meaningful benefit. To understand the role of the quality of evidence in implementation decisions, this paper analyses the study designs and endpoints used to appraise selected types of radiotherapy innovations in the literature.

Methods

This review used a quantitative bibliometric approach to analyse a representative set of 23 radiotherapy innovations, identified within the radiation therapy research published between 2012 and 2022 in the Web of Science database. Abstracts were searched manually to extract information about study designs and endpoints. Interventions were allocated into one of four defined radiotherapy categories, based on a decision algorithm developed in a parallel project.

Results

3,721 abstracts were identified and categorised using the decision algorithm into four categories: Drug-centred, Radiation-centred, Radiation-enabling or Operational radiotherapy interventions. The study designs were highly variable across these categories: in Drug-centred innovations, 20.3% were clinical trials compared to 6.8% for Radiation-centred. The predominant design across all categories was Prospective observational studies, ranging from 53.9% in Radiation-enabling to 23.0% in Drug-centred innovations. Regarding endpoints, the main focus for Drug-centred innovations was on Clinical endpoints and Overall survival. For Radiation-centred and Radiation-enabling innovations, Toxicity endpoints were more frequently reported.

Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the differences in radiotherapy research output for various categories of radiotherapy interventions. This supports the development of a tailored appraisal strategy for each category, based on the required level of evidence and meaningful endpoints to support reimbursement and clinical implementation.
