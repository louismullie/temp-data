## Question

Sotalol for sick sinus syndrome first-line

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sotalol is appropriate as first-line therapy for sick sinus syndrome and how this relates to standard care in tachy-brady presentations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and clinical phenotype of sick sinus syndrome. Then, I should verify sotalol's pharmacologic effects and how they interact with sinus node dysfunction. Next, I will check FDA labeling and contraindications. After that, I should review guideline-consistent standards of care for sick sinus syndrome, especially the role of pacemakers. Finally, I will weigh risk-benefit and clarify management nuances in tachy-brady syndrome, including whether antiarrhythmics have any role after pacing is secured.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. Sick sinus syndrome is fundamentally an intrinsic dysfunction of the sinus node causing bradyarrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, pauses/arrest, sinoatrial block) often with alternating atrial tachyarrhythmias (tachy-brady syndrome), so the primary problem is impaired automaticity and conduction leading to pathologically slow rates and intermittent pauses, not rapid rates per se.

> Now, I need to check sotalol's pharmacology and ask whether it helps or harms this physiology. Sotalol has dual Class II beta-blocking effects that slow sinus rate and AV nodal conduction and Class III effects that prolong repolarization and the QT interval, which means it can further depress sinus node function and produce or worsen bradycardia while adding torsades risk via QT prolongation; that is mechanistically misaligned with an intrinsic bradyarrhythmic disorder like sick sinus syndrome [^116nswoy] [^112Ajea4] [^1127Ru4t].

> Hold on, I should verify the regulatory labeling because this dictates safety boundaries. FDA labeling contraindicates sotalol in sinus bradycardia and in bradyarrhythmias including sick sinus syndrome or second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker, and it warns against initiation when baseline QTc exceeds 450 ms due to proarrhythmia risk; wait, one line in a summary conflated bradycardia thresholds with QTc numbers, but the correct initiation threshold refers to QTc > 450 ms, not heart rate in milliseconds, so I should double-check and adhere to the label language and QTc criteria for initiation and monitoring [^112jJ6EA] [^1136UnVe] [^1127Ru4t].

> Next, I should review the standard of care for sick sinus syndrome. The evidence-based first-line therapy for symptomatic bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome is permanent pacing (atrial or dual-chamber depending on conduction system status), which relieves symptoms, prevents syncope, and improves quality of life; antiarrhythmic drugs are not primary therapy for the bradycardic substrate of sick sinus syndrome and, in fact, may worsen bradycardia if used without pacing support [^115trHF2] [^111mgTkn].

> But wait, what about tachy-brady syndrome where atrial tachyarrhythmias coexist — could sotalol be justified there? The treatment sequence is key: I need to ensure bradyarrhythmic safety first with pacemaker implantation; only after pacemaker protection should any antiarrhythmic be considered, and even then sotalol remains a cautious choice because it still exerts sinus- and AV-nodal slowing and prolongs repolarization, so selection demands meticulous QTc and bradycardia monitoring if used post-pacing at all [^112jJ6EA] [^1136UnVe] [^1127Ru4t].

> I will now examine the risk–benefit profile more critically. The risks include exacerbation of baseline bradycardia, longer pauses, syncope, and even asystole in unpaced sick sinus syndrome, plus torsades due to QT prolongation; observational and real-world initiation data consistently show bradycardia and QTc prolongation are common during sotalol loading, which underscores why inpatient monitored initiation and strict QTc thresholds are recommended, yet none of this converts sotalol into a bradycardia therapy — it simply frames its hazards when used for other indications like AF rhythm control [^1127Ru4t] [^115s7eXr] [^1174KfVf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm there is no credible evidence endorsing sotalol as primary therapy for sick sinus syndrome itself. Authoritative reviews emphasize removing extrinsic factors and pacing for symptomatic disease; there are no guideline-aligned recommendations to treat the sinus node dysfunction with a beta-blocking Class III agent like sotalol, and the FDA contraindication in SSS without a pacemaker further reinforces that sotalol is not an acceptable first-line strategy for this condition [^115trHF2] [^111mgTkn] [^112jJ6EA].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is explicit: sotalol is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker and is not first-line therapy for the bradyarrhythmic substrate; the evidence-based first-line treatment for symptomatic sick sinus syndrome is permanent pacemaker implantation, after which antiarrhythmic drugs may be considered for concurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias with careful attention to QTc and bradycardia risks if sotalol is chosen at all [^112jJ6EA] [^115trHF2] [^1136UnVe].

Sotalol is **not first-line** for sick sinus syndrome (SSS) [^111mgTkn] because it can worsen bradycardia and cause life-threatening proarrhythmia, including torsades de pointes [^1127Ru4t]. Sotalol is **contraindicated in SSS without a pacemaker** and should only be considered if a permanent pacemaker is in place and other options have failed [^112jJ6EA]. First-line management is **pacemaker implantation**, with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for tachyarrhythmias once pacing is established [^111mgTkn] [^115trHF2].

---

## Pharmacological properties of sotalol

Sotalol is a **non-selective beta-blocker with class III antiarrhythmic effects** [^112Ajea4]; it prolongs action potential duration and refractory periods and slows heart rate and AV conduction [^116nswoy]. These effects increase the risk of bradycardia and QT prolongation [^114imPeh], especially in patients with intrinsic sinus node dysfunction.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding sotalol use in SSS

Current guidelines and clinical evidence **do not support sotalol as first-line therapy** for SSS [^111mgTkn] because it can exacerbate bradycardia and induce life-threatening arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes [^1127Ru4t]. The FDA explicitly contraindicates sotalol in patients with SSS without a pacemaker due to these risks [^112jJ6EA].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of sotalol in SSS

Sotalol carries **significant risks** in patients with SSS, including:

- **Bradycardia**: Sotalol's beta-blocking effects [^112Ajea4] can exacerbate sinus node dysfunction, leading to severe bradycardia or sinus arrest [^114imPeh].

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Sotalol prolongs the QT interval [^116nswoy], increasing the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia [^1127Ru4t].

- **Proarrhythmia**: Sotalol can induce new or worsen existing arrhythmias, particularly in patients with underlying sinus node dysfunction [^1127Ru4t].

Given these risks, sotalol initiation requires **careful monitoring**, including baseline and serial ECGs, QT interval assessment [^1136UnVe], and electrolyte monitoring. Hospitalization is recommended at initiation [^111ReZpC] to enable prompt management of potential adverse events [^1127Ru4t].

---

## Alternative first-line treatments for SSS

The primary treatment for symptomatic SSS is **permanent pacemaker implantation** [^111mgTkn]. Pacemakers effectively manage bradycardia, improve symptoms, and reduce the risk of syncope and other complications associated with sinus node dysfunction [^116vtv1z] [^115trHF2]. Once pacing is established, **pharmacological therapy may be considered** for associated tachyarrhythmias; beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are commonly used because they control tachyarrhythmias without significantly exacerbating bradycardia when pacing support is available.

---

## Clinical scenarios where sotalol may be considered

Sotalol may be **considered** in specific clinical scenarios where:

- **Permanent pacemaker**: The patient has a permanent pacemaker in place, providing protection against bradycardia [^112jJ6EA].

- **Refractory tachyarrhythmias**: The patient experiences refractory tachyarrhythmias that have not responded to other antiarrhythmic medications [^1125CmqL] [^111Yv6QN].

- **Careful monitoring**: The patient can be closely monitored for QT prolongation and other adverse effects [^1136UnVe].

Even in these scenarios, sotalol should be **used cautiously**, with careful dose titration and regular monitoring of rhythm and QT interval [^1127Ru4t].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Sotalol is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for sick sinus syndrome [^112jJ6EA] because it can worsen bradycardia and precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias [^1127Ru4t]. The primary treatment for symptomatic SSS is **permanent pacemaker implantation** [^111mgTkn]; once pacing is established, beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used to manage associated tachyarrhythmias. Sotalol should be reserved for patients with a pacemaker [^112jJ6EA] in whom other antiarrhythmic medications have failed, with careful monitoring and dose titration [^1136UnVe].

### Sick sinus syndrome: a review [^115trHF2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome refers to a collection of disorders marked by the heart's inability to perform its pacemaking function. Predominantly affecting older adults, sick sinus syndrome comprises various arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias with or without accompanying tachyarrhythmias. At least 50 percent of patients with sick sinus syndrome develop alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, also known as tachy-brady syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome results from intrinsic causes or may be exacerbated or mimicked by extrinsic factors.

- **Intrinsic causes**: Degenerative fibrosis, ion channel dysfunction, and remodeling of the sinoatrial node.
- **Extrinsic factors**: These can be pharmacologic, metabolic, or autonomic.

Signs and symptoms are often subtle early on and become more obvious as the disease progresses. They are commonly related to end-organ hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion is most common, with syncope or near-fainting occurring in about one-half of patients. Diagnosis may be challenging and is ultimately made by electrocardiographic identification of the arrhythmia in conjunction with the presence of symptoms. If electrocardiography does not yield a diagnosis, inpatient telemetry monitoring, outpatient Holter monitoring, event monitoring, or loop monitoring may be used. Electrophysiologic studies also may be used but are not routinely needed.

Treatment of sick sinus syndrome includes removing extrinsic factors, when possible, and pacemaker placement. Pacemakers do not reduce mortality, but they can decrease symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sick sinus syndrome [^111mgTkn]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome comprises a variety of conditions involving sinus node dysfunction and commonly affects elderly persons. While the syndrome can have many causes, it usually is idiopathic. Patients may experience syncope, pre-syncope, palpitations, or dizziness; however, they often are asymptomatic or have subtle or nonspecific symptoms. Sick sinus syndrome has multiple manifestations on electrocardiogram, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and tachycardia (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome).

Diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome can be difficult because of its nonspecific symptoms and elusive findings on electrocardiogram or Holter monitor. The mainstay of treatment is atrial or dual-chamber pacemaker placement, which generally provides effective relief of symptoms and lowers the incidence of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic events, heart failure, and mortality compared with ventricular pacemakers.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112TmzWq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 133 AF/AFL patients were admitted for sotalol initiation between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, meeting the study inclusion criteria. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are reported for the study population in Table 1.

- **Demographics**: The average age was 70.0 ± 12.3 years, and 60.2% were male. Notable baseline comorbidities included hypertension (82.7%), hyperlipidemia (72.2%), diabetes (36.1%), coronary artery disease (CAD) (53.4%), cardiomyopathy (32.3%), a history of smoking (30.1%), and obstructive sleep apnea (40.6%). The mean baseline creatinine level was 1.08 ± 0.45 (median: 0.97). Prior ablation occurred in 20.3% of patients, and 32.3% had undergone cardioversion before enrollment.

A total of 94.0% of patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of AF, and 23.2% had a diagnosis of AFL, with some patients having a prior diagnosis of both arrhythmias. Patients presented with a mean ejection fraction of 59.9 ± 7.8% and a mean QTc of 453.7 ± 37.6 ms before sotalol dosing. A baseline left bundle branch block was present in 4.5% and right bundle branch block in an additional 8.3% (Table 3).

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115bx5mk]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

We observed that the mean QTc duration at the time of admission did not increase in response to sotalol by the time of hospital discharge. This is partly due to the drug being initiated during hospitalization to monitor for QT prolongation. Those with significant prolongation tend to have their sotalol dosage decreased or the drug discontinued altogether. This is evidenced by the fact that QT prolongation was noted to occur in approximately one-fifth of the patient population at some point during their hospital stay, but the average recorded QT interval following six oral sotalol doses was virtually unchanged from baseline.

An alternative explanation for the lack of QT prolongation may stem from issues with drug underdosing. Prior studies have shown a linear relationship between sotalol drug concentration and the extent of QTc prolongation, with the greatest QTc prolongation being achieved once the drug has reached a steady-state concentration. In the same way that sotalol underdosing might explain the higher rates of arrhythmia recurrence, drug underdosing could also explain the lack of any significant increase in QTc duration. Similarly, potential drug underdosing could also explain the lack of any ventricular arrhythmias during follow-up.

One prior study reported a 5.8% incidence of new or increased ventricular arrhythmias in response to sotalol initiation. In that study, the median initiation and discharge dose were both 160 mg. When compared to the results of our study, where only approximately 5% of patients received doses greater than 80 mg and none developed ventricular arrhythmias, this supports the hypothesis of underdosing.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^112Ajea4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Sotalol exhibits both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and antiarrhythmic properties through cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III). Intravenous sotalol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class III antiarrhythmic effects, whereas the l-isomer is primarily responsible for the beta-blocking activity. The beta-blocking effect is non-cardioselective, achieving half maximal at oral doses around 80 mg/day and maximal at doses between 320 and 640 mg/day. Significant beta-blockade can occur at oral doses as low as 25 mg. Notably, significant Class III effects can be observed following a single oral or IV dose of 80 mg or 75 mg, respectively.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^114cSkNu]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

There are limited comparative data on safety and efficacy within commonly used Vaughan-Williams (VW) class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that dronedarone and sotalol, two commonly prescribed VW class III AADs with class II properties, have different safety and efficacy effects in patients with nonpermanent AF.

A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE®, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to June 15, 2021 (NCT05279833). Clinical trials and observational studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of dronedarone or sotalol in adults with AF were included. Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to quantify comparative safety and efficacy. Where feasible, we performed sensitivity analyses by including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Of 3581 records identified through database searches, 37 unique studies (23 RCTs, 13 observational studies, and 1 nonrandomized trial) were included in the NMA. Dronedarone was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of all-cause death versus sotalol (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38 [95% credible interval, CrI: 0.19, 0.74]). The association was numerically similar in the sensitivity analysis (HR = 0.46 [95% CrI: 0.21, 1.02]). AF recurrence and cardiovascular death results were not significantly different between dronedarone and sotalol in all-studies and sensitivity analyses.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of sotalol versus dronedarone after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^114WHSM3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Among the propensity score-matched groups, patients were older, with the median age for dronedarone being 63 years and for sotalol 62 years. The groups were predominantly men, with 67% for both dronedarone and sotalol. There was a high prevalence of comorbid illnesses, including hypertension (71% for dronedarone, 73% for sotalol), chronic heart disease (42% for dronedarone, 39% for sotalol), heart failure (15% for dronedarone, 16% for sotalol), and diabetes (20% for dronedarone, 21% for sotalol).

The prevalence of comorbid disease resulted in a mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 2.26 ± 1.50 for dronedarone and 2.24 ± 1.52 for sotalol, along with a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0.94 ± 1.44 for both groups. Most patients, 97%, had at least one ECG during the preablation year. In both groups, about 45% had at least one cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF) within the preablation year, and 36% within 6 months before ablation.

Overall, 29% of dronedarone-treated patients and 33% of sotalol-treated patients experienced at least one AF-related hospitalization during the year before ablation. A pacemaker was present in 2.4% and 3.5% of patients treated with dronedarone or sotalol, respectively, after ablation, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was present in 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. Concomitant medication use was generally similar between the groups. After ablation, the median time to dronedarone treatment was 20 days, while the median time to sotalol treatment was 25 days.

### Meta-analysis of the risk of torsades de pointes in patients treated with intravenous racemic sotalol [^113pZiRa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) racemic sotalol is useful for the treatment of multiple tachydysrhythmias, and the authors hypothesized that the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) in patients treated with a single IV infusion of sotalol is lower than the 2–4% risk associated with chronic oral sotalol therapy.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE search under the subject heading "sotalol" was conducted on all publications involving humans, written in English or German from 1966 to October 1, 2000. A meta-analysis of all original reports, including patients who were given a single infusion of at least 1.5 mg/kg or 100 mg of IV sotalol over 30 minutes or less, was performed. Potential variables predictive of TdP were assessed. The primary outcome was the observation of TdP associated with IV sotalol infusion. Secondary measurements included hypotension, bradycardia, and worsening of congestive heart failure. All excluded studies and case reports were also examined for evidence of TdP associated with IV sotalol treatment.

- **Results**: The search included 1,005 publications. There were 37 reports in which 962 patients received IV sotalol and met the inclusion criteria. There was one report of self-terminating TdP lasting 10 seconds among the 962 patients included in the study. No report of TdP was associated with only IV racemic sotalol administration in any of the excluded studies. Assuming the risk of TdP is homogeneous in the population of patients treated with IV sotalol, based on the 962 included patients, the rate of TdP is 0.1% (95% CI = 0.003% to 0.6%).

The overall risk of TdP in patients treated with IV racemic sotalol appears to be low.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113q7uog]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

**Statistical analysis**: The χ² statistic, Fisher's exact test, Student's t-test, and analysis of variance were used to evaluate baseline and clinical characteristics among the patient groups. Initial evaluation to endpoints utilized the χ² statistic, the Fisher's exact test, the Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and the log-rank test. To confirm associations determined by univariable analysis, multivariable Cox hazard regression (SPSS, version 22.0) was performed to determine hazard ratios (HRs). Final models entered significant (p < .05) and confounding (10% change in HR) baseline covariables. Two-tailed p-values of ≤ .05 were designated to be nominally significant.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112aGPuc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Sotalol was dosed twice daily based on prescribing physician preferences, with ECGs performed routinely every 12 hours (1–2 hours after each dose of sotalol). Within the study population, 24 patients (18.1%) received only two doses, 53 (39.8%) received only three doses, 18 (13.5%) received only four doses, 13 (9.8%) received only five doses, and 25 (18.8%) received six doses or more. The mean QTc before sotalol initiation was 453.7 ± 37.6 ms. Following the first six doses of sotalol, the mean QTc of the population that remained on therapy was unchanged at 457.4 ± 37.6 ms.

- **Days spent in the hospital based on twice daily in-patient dosing**:
	- **1 day**: 42.1%
	- **2 days**: 17.3%
	- **3 days**: 12.8%
	- **≥ 4 days**: 26.3%

On average, patients were in the hospital 3.9 ± 4.6 days (median: 2.2 days). In-hospital outcomes included:

- **Death**: 2 patients (1.5%)
- **Stroke**: 1 patient (0.8%)
- **VT/VF**: 0 patients (0%)
- **Bradycardia (< 50 bpm)**: 37 patients (27.8%)

### Rapid loading of sotalol or amiodarone for management of recent onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation: A randomized, digoxin-controlled trial [^1178XVrt]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Amiodarone and sotalol are commonly used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, but the efficacy of these agents administered as high-dose infusions for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation is unknown. Use in this context would facilitate drug initiation in patients in whom ongoing prophylactic therapy is indicated.

- **Methods**: We assessed the efficacy and safety of rapid high-dose intravenous infusions of amiodarone and sotalol for heart rate control and rapid reversion to sinus rhythm in patients who came to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Patients (n = 140) were randomized to receive 1.5 mg/kg of sotalol infused in 10 minutes, 10 mg/kg of amiodarone in 30 minutes, or 500 microg of digoxin in 20 minutes. Electrical cardioversion was attempted for patients not converting to sinus rhythm within 12 hours.

- **Results**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone resulted in more rapid rate control than digoxin. Each of the three trial strategies resulted in similar rates of pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm (amiodarone, 51%; sotalol, 44%; digoxin, 50%; P = not significant). The overall rates of cardioversion after trial drug infusion and defibrillation were high for all groups (amiodarone, 94%; sotalol, 95%; digoxin, 98%; P = not significant), but there was a trend toward a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions in the amiodarone group.

- **Conclusion**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone in patients with symptomatic recent-onset atrial fibrillation results in rapid control of ventricular rate.

### Sotalol testing unmasks altered repolarization in patients with suspected acquired long-QT-syndrome — a case-control pilot study using i.v. sotalol [^111xd4X7]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate provocative sotalol testing to unmask abnormal repolarization due to altered myocardial electrical properties as the key feature in acquired Long-QT-Syndrome. Reliable diagnosis and risk stratification for the individual patient are complicated by the multitude of mechanisms involved in acquired QT-prolongation. The combined influence of all components determines susceptibility to arrhythmias related to QT-prolongation.

Twenty consecutive patients who had experienced torsades de pointes in association with QT-prolonging drugs were tested with i.v. D, L-sotalol (2mg/kg) with 24-hour intensive care monitoring to evaluate the repolarization process by determining QT- and QTc-prolongations. Results were compared to age and sex-matched controls.

At baseline, no differences between control and study population with regard to QT and QTc were detected. After sotalol infusion, QTc increased from 422 ± 17 to 450 ± 22ms in controls and from 434 ± 20 to 541 ± 37ms in the study population. Torsades de pointes occurred in three out of 20 patients (15%) in the study population but in none of the control patients following i.v. sotalol testing.

Controlled exposure to sotalol successfully identifies patients with normal QTc intervals but altered myocardial repolarization. This may be useful for clarifying diagnosis and pathogenesis of acquired Long-QT-Syndrome.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1161FR4q]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

In addition to the many benefits conferred by a decreased hospitalization time, IV sotalol loading may offer additional benefits over oral loading. Oral sotalol is often underdosed, as observed in our study, where approximately one-quarter of patients were discharged on doses of sotalol below the minimum dosage recommended by the FDA. IV administration of sotalol may improve the ability to achieve therapeutic steady-state drug concentration, thereby increasing the drug's ability to exert its therapeutic effect in maintaining sinus rhythm. This IV dosing protocol allows for quicker and more precise selection of the optimal therapeutic dose, which translates into improved drug efficacy. Improved drug efficacy carries the potential for additional cost savings, as more effective maintenance of sinus rhythm may help prevent the recurrence of atrial arrhythmias and subsequently decrease hospital readmission rates and the need for additional expensive interventions, such as cardioversion, ablation, and repeat hospitalizations for AAD re-loading. Additionally, there exists a potential for additional opportunity cost savings that comes from freeing up hospital beds and facilitating additional admissions. In the healthcare climate, where hospitals are met with increasingly large patient volumes and limited availability of hospital beds, potential opportunity cost savings could be very significant.

- **Study limitations**: The superior cost economics of IV sotalol over oral sotalol should be considered hypothesis-generating, as they are based on projected costs.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112D2ZLR]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, with a lifetime incidence estimated at approximately 20%. The total number of AF cases in the United States is expected to exceed 2.5 million by 2030 and 7.5 million by 2050. AF carries significant morbidity and is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the United States, with annual AF admissions exceeding 450,000 cases per year since 2010. The cost burden of AF on the U.S. healthcare system is substantial, with an estimated $10 billion spent managing AF in 2014. With increasing numbers of new AF cases each year, the financial burden continues to grow.

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) remain vital in the rhythm-based management of AF; however, there is a persisting need for a better understanding of protocols to administer these medications safely and effectively while monitoring for side effects. The class III AAD sotalol is often initiated in the in-patient setting, necessitating several days of hospitalization for monitoring until a steady state is reached. In-patient initiation of AAD therapy has been identified as a high-cost burden aspect of AF-related care. The cost associated with sotalol is particularly concerning, as it has risen considerably over the years and is expected to continue increasing. A 3-day hospitalization for sotalol initiation cost approximately $3,500 in 2009, which increased to $10,000–$12,000 in 2019. The single greatest expense incurred during a patient's admission for sotalol initiation is room and board, costing approximately $2,000–$3,000 per night. Strategies aimed at reducing this cost burden are essential.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^117QVNhd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular outcomes are shown and compared based upon the time of index in-patient sotalol initiation. There were no significant differences in outcomes observed when comparing time-based loading strategies. AF signifies atrial fibrillation; Aflutter, atrial flutter; VF, ventricular fibrillation; and VT, ventricular tachycardia.

The rate of QTc prolongation (> 500 ms) observed during follow-up differed significantly based on the length of initial hospitalization. Postdischarge QTc prolongation occurred in 17.9% and 21.7% of patients initially admitted for 1 and 2 days, respectively, while it occurred in 52.9% of patients admitted for 3 days and 40.5% of patients who spent 4 or more days in the hospital during their index hospitalization for sotalol initiation, prompting dose titration.

Death rates during follow-up based on time of hospitalization were 3.6% for 1-day, 17.4% for 2-day, 5.9% for 3-day, and 17.1% for 4 or more days hospitalizations. These differences in death rates between groups did not achieve statistical significance (p = .08). The remaining posthospitalization outcomes, including recurrence of AF and AFL, bradycardia, stroke, and readmission rates, were similar regardless of the length of stay during index admission for sotalol initiation.

The percentage of patients who developed QT prolongation is shown and stratified by the number of doses of sotalol received during the index hospitalization. Patients with longer stays had higher rates of QT prolongation, which may be related to the stay and the additional need for drug titration.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^115s7eXr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

Oral sotalol initiation requires a multiple-day inpatient admission to monitor for QT prolongation during loading. A one-day intravenous (IV) sotalol loading protocol was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in March 2020, but limited data on clinical use and administration currently exists. This study describes the implementation of an IV sotalol protocol within an integrated health system, provides initial efficacy and safety outcomes, and examines length of stay (LOS) compared with oral sotalol initiation.

- **Methods**: IV sotalol was administered according to a prespecified initiation protocol to adult patients with refractory atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. Baseline characteristics, safety and feasibility outcomes, and LOS were compared with patients receiving oral sotalol over a similar time period.

- **Results**: From January 2021 to June 2022, a total of 29 patients (average age 66.0 ± 8.6 years, 27.6% women) underwent IV sotalol load and 20 patients (average age 60.4 ± 13.9 years, 65.0% women) underwent oral sotalol load. The load was successfully completed in 22/29 (75.9%) patients receiving IV sotalol and 20/20 (100%) of patients receiving oral sotalol, although 7/20 of the oral sotalol patients (35.0%) required dose reduction. Adverse events interrupting IV sotalol infusion included bradycardia (seven patients, 24.1%) and QT prolongation (three patients, 10.3%). No patients receiving IV or oral sotalol developed sustained ventricular arrhythmias before discharge. LOS for patients completing IV load was 2.6 days shorter (mean 1.0 vs. 3.6 days) compared to those who received oral loading.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^1136UnVe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

For either indication, intravenous sotalol can substitute for oral sotalol in patients unable to take oral drugs or be used to achieve steady state concentration faster compared to the conventional oral dosing.

Intravenous sotalol must be diluted for infusion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dilute intravenous sotalol in saline, 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or Ringer's lactate. Choose a volume convenient for administration and consistent with fluid restriction. Use a volumetric infusion pump.

- **Use for substitution of oral sotalol**: To match the exposure to oral sotalol, use the same dosing frequency with intravenous administration and infuse the adjusted dose over 5 hours.

- **Use for loading dose**: Initiate or uptitrate intravenous sotalol in a facility that can provide continuous ECG monitoring and cardiac resuscitation. Personnel should be trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Withdraw other antiarrhythmic therapy before starting sotalol hydrochloride. Measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiation. If the baseline QTc is > 450 ms (JT > 330 ms if QRS over 100 ms), sotalol is not recommended.

Infuse the loading dose over one hour. Monitor QTc interval every 15 minutes during infusion. Continue to monitor QTc around Tmax (2 to 4 hours post-dose) following the first oral dose in all patients and the second oral dose in patients with CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^114sEtbC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Results**: From January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022, 29 patients underwent intravenous (IV) sotalol initiation, while 20 patients underwent oral sotalol initiation. The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics for both groups are detailed.

- **Demographics and clinical characteristics**: The average age in the IV sotalol initiation group was 66.0 years, with 27.6% of participants being female. Atrial arrhythmias were the primary indication for IV loading in 75.9% of cases, with 24.1% for ventricular arrhythmias. The average creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 90.6 ml/min. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ranged from 31% to 69%, with an average of 52.8%. In the oral sotalol initiation group, the average age was 60.4 years, with 65.0% of participants being female. Atrial arrhythmias were the primary indication for oral loading in 55.0% of cases, with 45.0% for ventricular arrhythmias. The average CrCl was 99.5 ml/min, and LVEF ranged from 26% to 75%, with an average of 54.8%.

	- Almost all patients undergoing IV and oral sotalol initiation were on AV nodal blocking agents before presentation, with 96.6% in the IV group and 95.0% in the oral group. The distribution of specific classes of agents is listed in Table 1. The total daily metoprolol milligram equivalent dose averaged 80 mg in the IV sotalol group and 76 mg in the oral sotalol group. The total daily diltiazem milligram equivalent dose averaged 135 mg in the IV sotalol group and 240 mg in the oral sotalol group. Only 6 of 29 patients (20.7%) in the IV sotalol group and 7 of 20 patients (35.0%) in the oral sotalol group had these agents held or reduced immediately before sotalol initiation.

### A multicentre, double-blind randomized crossover comparative study on the efficacy and safety of dofetilide vs sotalol in patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia and ischaemic heart disease [^1156GvKE]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drugs are still used for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, in combination with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or without them.

- **Aim of the study**: In a double-blind randomized crossover design, the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of oral dofetilide or oral sotalol were compared in 135 patients with ischaemic heart disease and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia.

- **Methods**: The inducibility of ventricular tachycardia was determined by programmed electrophysiological stimulation at baseline. Patients were then blindly randomized to receive either oral dofetilide 500 microg twice daily or oral sotalol 160 mg twice daily, for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia on the drug was then assessed by programmed electrophysiological stimulation. After a wash-out period of at least 2.5 days, the patients received the alternative treatment for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia on the alternate drug was again determined by programmed electrophysiological stimulation. Selection of long-term treatment was allocated blindly according to programmed electrophysiological stimulation results.

- **Results**: During the acute phase, 128 patients received both dofetilide and sotalol. Sixty-seven patients were responders to either drug. Forty-six patients (35.9%) were responders to dofetilide compared with 43 (33.6%) to sotalol (P = ns). Only 23 patients responded to both dofetilide and sotalol. Adverse events, deemed to be treatment-related, were seen in 2.3% of patients receiving dofetilide.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^114QvFPG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Sotalol has been studied in life-threatening and less severe arrhythmias. In patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (VPC), orally administered sotalol was significantly superior to placebo in reducing VPCs, paired VPCs, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT); the response was dose-related through 640 mg/day, with 80–85% of patients having at least a 75% reduction of VPCs. Sotalol was also superior, at the doses evaluated, to propranolol (40–80 mg TID) and similar to quinidine (200–400 mg QID) in reducing VPCs. In patients with life-threatening arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF), sotalol was studied acutely by suppression of programmed electrical stimulation (PES)-induced VT and by suppression of Holter monitor evidence of sustained VT, and, in acute responders, chronically.

In a double-blind, randomized comparison of oral sotalol and procainamide given intravenously (total of 2 mg/kg sotalol vs. 19 mg/kg of procainamide over 90 minutes), sotalol suppressed PES induction in 30% of patients vs. 20% for procainamide (p = 0.2).

### Chads2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score to assess risk of stroke and death in patients paced for sick sinus syndrome [^116vtv1z]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

The hypotheses of the study were established prior to the time of writing the analysis. Time to first stroke and time to death were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Following the primary DANPACE publication, a univariate analysis of each prespecified variable was performed. Furthermore, a multivariate analysis including all significant univariate variables was conducted.

When oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment was used as a time-dependent covariate, the latest known value for a given patient (OAC or no OAC) at a given time (as opposed to the baseline value) was used in the Cox calculations to determine the model coefficients. C statistics were calculated using Harrell's C of concordance. Relative risk was expressed as HR with 95% CI. Statistical tests were two-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata V.11 (StataCorp. 2009, College Station, Texas, USA) and BMDP release V.8.1 (Statistical Solutions Ltd, Ireland).

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115iWvSe]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

In 2019, Dahmane et al. conducted a cost-minimization analysis from the health sector perspective using Monte Carlo simulations to assess the cost savings for accelerated IV sotalol loading compared with a typical 3-day oral sotalol loading protocol. They found cost savings of $3,123 with IV sotalol when administered over the course of a 2-day hospitalization and $4,820 when completed over the course of a single overnight stay, with the majority of their cost savings coming from room and board expenses and hospital supplies. They noted that some of their projected savings with the accelerated IV loading protocol were offset by the costs of IV sotalol, which is much more expensive than the oral formulation at their institution ($1,400–$2,264 per 150 mg vial of IV sotalol vs. $0.10 per 80 mg tablet of per os sotalol). Despite the high cost of IV sotalol, the potential cost savings from reducing admission time compared to prior studies with IV sotalol initiation has been estimated between $3,000 and $4,000 when compared with a 3-day oral load.

### Expedited loading with intravenous sotalol is safe and feasible-primary results of the Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry [^1145hRHb]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Low credibility.

Loading of oral sotalol for atrial fibrillation typically requires 3 days, often requiring hospitalization to achieve a steady state. The Food and Drug Administration approved loading with intravenous (IV) sotalol through model-informed development, without patient data.

We present results of the first multicenter evaluation of this recent labeling for IV sotalol. The Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry was a multicenter observational registry of patients undergoing elective IV sotalol load for atrial arrhythmias. Outcomes measured from hospital admission until the first outpatient follow-up included adverse arrhythmia events, efficacy, and length of stay.

Of 167 consecutively enrolled patients, 23% were female; the median age was 68 (interquartile range, 61–74) years, and the median CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 3 (interquartile range, 2–4). Overall, 99% were admitted for sotalol initiation (1% for dose escalation). The target oral sotalol dose was either 80 mg twice daily (85 patients, 51%) or 120 mg twice daily (78 patients, 47%); 62 patients (37%) had an estimated creatinine clearance ≤ 90 mL/min. Upon presentation, 40% of patients were in sinus rhythm, whereas 26% underwent cardioversion before sotalol infusion.

In two patients, sotalol infusion was stopped due to bradycardia or hypotension. In six patients, sotalol was discontinued before discharge because of QTc prolongation (3 patients), bradycardia (1 patient), or recurrent atrial arrhythmia (2 patients). The mean length of stay was 1.1 days, and 95% (n = 159) were discharged within 1 night.

### Amiodarone versus sotalol for atrial fibrillation [^111CTYsf]. The New England journal of medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The optimal pharmacologic means to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation remains controversial.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 665 patients who were receiving anticoagulants and had persistent atrial fibrillation to receive amiodarone (267 patients), sotalol (261 patients), or placebo (137 patients) and monitored them for 1 to 4.5 years. The primary end point was the time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation beginning on day 28, determined by means of weekly transtelephonic monitoring.

Results

Spontaneous conversion occurred in 27.1 percent of the amiodarone group, 24.2 percent of the sotalol group, and 0.8 percent of the placebo group, and direct-Cardioversion failed in 27.7 percent, 26.5 percent, and 32.1 percent, respectively. The median times to a recurrence of atrial fibrillation were 487 days in the amiodarone group, 74 days in the sotalol group, and 6 days in the placebo group according to intention to treat and 809, 209, and 13 days, respectively, according to treatment received. Amiodarone was superior to sotalol (P < 0.001) and to placebo (P < 0.001), and sotalol was superior to placebo (P < 0.001). In patients with ischemic heart disease, the median time to a recurrence of atrial fibrillation was 569 days with amiodarone therapy and 428 days with sotalol therapy (P = 0.53). Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm significantly improved the quality of life and exercise capacity. There were no significant differences in major adverse events among the three groups.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias-a PEAKS registry substudy [^113rwzdV]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Sotalol has been shown to have dose-dependent toxicity, namely bradycardia and QTc prolongation. These risks are the primary motivation for inpatient monitoring during loading and may lead clinicians to modify the dosing. However, in our analysis of those undergoing intravenous loading, we did not find an excess of adverse effects when comparing a 120 mg targeted dose with 80 mg (though events were rare), either during infusion or after. There may be a few explanations for this lack of difference, including:

- **Variability in QTc measurement**: Relatively small effect on QTc (see separate pharmacodynamic analysis).
- **Inter-patient variability**: May overwhelm dose-dependent variation.

The package insert for IV sotalol recommends an infusion dose of 60 mg for an oral target dose of 80 mg, compared with 90 mg for a 120 mg target oral dose (among patients with preserved renal function). This has raised the possibility of an increased rate of cardioversion during infusion among patients at the higher dose. However, we did not observe this in our data, likely due to high rates of pre-infusion cardioversion — a standard practice among patients undergoing sotalol loading. The drug is indicated for maintenance of sinus rhythm among patients with AF, suggesting patients should undergo cardioversion before load initiation.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^117MdPj4]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Low credibility.

In this study, IV sotalol was found to be a safe and well-tolerated method for initiating sotalol in both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Almost one in four patients undergoing IV sotalol initiation experienced serious bradycardia; however, six out of seven of these patients were on AV nodal blocking agents at the time of initiation. Discontinuing or reducing the dose of these agents before IV sotalol initiation may help mitigate these effects. QT prolongation was noted only in the context of serious bradycardia in the IV sotalol cohort, with a rate of approximately 10%, which matches rates found in other real-world data. No patients undergoing oral sotalol initiation had the drug discontinued due to bradycardia or QT prolongation, but 35% of the patients required dose reductions to less efficacious levels. No patients in either group experienced life-threatening sustained ventricular arrhythmias during their hospitalization. Notably, patients undergoing IV sotalol initiation had a significantly shorter hospital length of stay than those undergoing oral sotalol initiation, with a mean difference of 2.6 days. Based on cost estimates by Varela et al, this represents potential savings of more than $4,000 per patient.

Additional analysis evaluated changes in the QT/QTc interval during IV sotalol infusion and after the first and second oral doses. The increase in the QT/QTc interval by the end of the IV infusion approximates that seen at discharge. These findings provide preliminary clinical corroboration for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models that simulate peak serum concentration of sotalol immediately after administration.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias-a PEAKS registry substudy [^112rdy25]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board. Each participating center obtained approval from their respective IRB, pursuant to local regulations. All patients enrolled prospectively provided written, informed consent. The PEAKS Registry was a multicenter, observational study of patients undergoing elective loading of sotalol for the treatment of atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF), using a new intravenous loading protocol. Details and primary results, which have been described previously, demonstrated acceptable feasibility and safety.

Overall, 167 patients were tracked from 10 sites. The study included both retrospective data collection for some patients and prospective enrollment for more than half. Patients admitted only for intravenous sotalol loading, without other active arrhythmias and without standard exclusions for class III antiarrhythmic drugs, were included. While the protocol included the package labeling for intravenous sotalol loading, adherence to this was not mandatory. Care was provided at the treating physician's discretion and according to local practices and standards. However, patients were generally treated consistently with the package insert regarding loading logistics: they were observed in-hospital during the infusion of IV sotalol and for two oral doses thereafter, and the QTc interval was monitored with regular 12-lead ECGs.

The target oral sotalol dose was determined by the treating clinician. According to the package insert, the intravenous loading infusion dosages were adjusted as necessary.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116oUX3t]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Costs associated with the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) continue to rise as treatment options for this condition become increasingly complex. The costs incurred during in-patient admission for antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) loading have rapidly increased over the years, representing a significant financial burden to our healthcare system. Meanwhile, the costs of AADs themselves have remained fairly stable. Intravenous (IV) sotalol offers an opportunity to mitigate some of these costs by expediting the drug initiation process and facilitating a faster time to hospital discharge.

In addition to the financial benefits of reducing hospitalization time, a shorter hospital stay may also decrease the risk of iatrogenic complications associated with hospitalization, improve patient satisfaction, and increase willingness to initiate AAD therapy. When introduced with a pharmacokinetic-guided protocol for administration, IV sotalol may also reduce variability in dosing and the potential for inadvertent under- or overdosing.

### Comparison of beta-blockers, amiodarone plus beta-blockers, or sotalol for prevention of shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators: The OPTIC study: A randomized trial [^111Yv6QN]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is effective but is associated with high-voltage shocks that are painful. The objective is to determine whether amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol are better than beta-blocker alone for prevention of ICD shocks.

A randomized controlled trial with blinded adjudication was conducted with 412 patients from 39 outpatient ICD clinical centers in Canada, Germany, the United States, England, Sweden, and Austria. The study was conducted from January 13, 2001, to September 28, 2004. Patients were eligible if they had received an ICD within 21 days for inducible or spontaneously occurring ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

Patients were randomized to treatment for 1 year with amiodarone plus beta-blocker, sotalol alone, or beta-blocker alone. The primary outcome was ICD shock for any reason.

Shocks occurred in 41 patients (38.5%) assigned to beta-blocker alone, 26 (24.3%) assigned to sotalol, and 12 (10.3%) assigned to amiodarone plus beta-blocker. A reduction in the risk of shock was observed with the use of either amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol versus beta-blocker alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.68; p < 0.001). Amiodarone plus beta-blocker significantly reduced the risk of shock compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14–0.52; p < 0.001) and sotalol (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22–0.85; p = 0.02). There was a trend for sotalol to reduce shocks compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–1.01; p = 0.055).

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1174KfVf]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Bradycardia and QTc prolongation were the most common in-patient side effects associated with sotalol initiation, occurring in approximately 20%–30% of patients during the index hospitalization. Despite the high rates of bradycardia and QTc prolongation, no ventricular arrhythmias occurred during hospitalization.

Postdischarge bradycardia and QTc prolongation were also common, occurring in 30%–40% of patients at 12-month follow-up. Long-term treatment failure (reAF or AFL) was also common, occurring in roughly one-third of patients. This high rate of treatment failure may have been due to the fact that approximately one-third of all patients were discharged on less than the minimum recommended dosage of sotalol. Serious adverse events were more common during the follow-up period, with death occurring in 10% of patients and stroke occurring in 3%, which reflects in part the inherent cardiovascular risk factors in many patients for whom sotalol is used for AF.

The economics behind hospital length of stay and its effects on costs to the healthcare system have been well studied, with many strategies having been employed to shorten patients' length of stay and thereby reduce hospitalization costs. These strategies have been implemented across a spectrum of medical specialties, including cardiology. Elective cardiac procedures could benefit immensely from interventions that facilitate same-day or short-stay hospital discharge. In 2018, Amin et al. assessed the costs associated with same-day discharge following elective percutaneous coronary interventions.

### Idiopathic premature ventricular complexes treatment: Comparison of flecainide, propafenone, and sotalol [^116kRpNY]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Propafenone, flecainide, and sotalol are generally safe, though they demonstrate only modest efficacy in the treatment of idiopathic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Among these, flecainide proves to be the most effective antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) in achieving complete, near-complete, or significant reduction in PVC burden when compared to propafenone or sotalol. Further research should focus on comparing specific agents within the antiarrhythmic drug classes, including intergroup comparisons.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^115VXAJG]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

There are limited comparative data on safety and efficacy within commonly used Vaughan-Williams (VW) class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF).

We hypothesized that dronedarone and sotalol, two commonly prescribed VW class III AADs with class II properties, have different safety and efficacy effects in patients with nonpermanent AF.

A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE®, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to June 15, 2021 (NCT05279833). Clinical trials and observational studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of dronedarone or sotalol in adults with AF were included. Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to quantify comparative safety and efficacy. Where feasible, sensitivity analyses by including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed.

Of 3,581 records identified through database searches, 37 unique studies (23 RCTs, 13 observational studies, and 1 nonrandomized trial) were included in the NMA. Dronedarone was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of all-cause death compared to sotalol (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38 [95% credible interval, CrI: 0.19, 0.74]). The association was numerically similar in the sensitivity analysis (HR = 0.46 [95% CrI: 0.21, 1.02]). AF recurrence and cardiovascular death results were not significantly different between dronedarone and sotalol in all-studies and sensitivity analyses.

The NMA findings indicate that, according to the data reviewed, dronedarone may offer a safety benefit over sotalol in terms of all-cause mortality when used in patients with AF.

This study was performed to evaluate, using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol, the long-term efficacy and safety of propafenone and sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion of recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). The maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent AF has several potential benefits, the most important being a reduced risk of thromboembolic events. Three hundred patients with recurrent AF (≥ 4 episodes in the last year) and AF at enrollment lasting < 48 hours were randomized to receive either propafenone (mean daily dose 13 ± 1.5 mg/kg; 102 patients), sotalol (mean daily dose 3 ± 0.4 mg/kg; 106 patients), or placebo (92 patients).

After 1-year follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm were comparable between propafenone (63%) and sotalol (73%), both of which were superior to placebo (35%; p = 0.001 vs. both drugs). Symptomatic recurrences occurred later with propafenone and sotalol than with placebo. Nine patients (9%) in the propafenone group, 11 (10%) in the sotalol group, and 3 (3%) in the placebo group discontinued therapy due to adverse effects. Malignant nonfatal arrhythmias due to proarrhythmic effects were documented with sotalol only and occurred < 72 hours from the beginning of therapy in 4 patients (4%). During recurrences, the ventricular rate was significantly reduced in patients taking propafenone and sotalol (p = 0.001 for both drugs vs. placebo). The likelihood of remaining in sinus rhythm during follow-up was higher in younger patients with smaller left atrial size.

### Sotalol versus propafenone for long-term maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation [^113LjJMt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study compared the efficacy and safety of sotalol and propafenone when used for the long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation. For the long-term maintenance of normal sinus rhythm, propafenone seems to be more effective than sotalol.

### Iv sotalol use in pediatric and congenital heart patients: A multicenter registry study [^114sUF3X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

**Postinfusion outcomes**: After a single dose of IV sotalol, successful arrhythmia termination occurred in 31 patients (49%, 95% CI [37%–62%]), and an improvement in rhythm control occurred, defined as rate reduction permitting overdrive pacing based on patient age and hemodynamic tolerance in an additional 18 patients (30%, 95% CI [19%–41%]). Patients with reentrant SVT and ectopic atrial tachycardia had high conversion rates. Patients who were not in an active arrhythmia at the time of administration were not included. The median time to arrhythmia termination was 44 minutes after IV sotalol initiation when specified (29 patients). Recurrences occurred in 25 patients (35%, 95% CI [24%–46%]), with time to recurrence ranging from 30 minutes up to 2 weeks, with a median of 10 hours.

### Effect of amiodarone and sotalol on ventricular defibrillation threshold: The optimal pharmacological therapy in cardioverter defibrillator patients (OPTIC) trial [^111XG5UU]. Circulation (2006). High credibility.

Many patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) receive adjunctive antiarrhythmic drug therapy, most commonly amiodarone or sotalol. The effects of these drugs on defibrillation energy requirements have not been previously assessed in a randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods and results**: The Optimal Pharmacological Therapy in Cardioverter Defibrillator Patients (OPTIC) trial was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of amiodarone plus beta-blocker and sotalol versus beta-blocker alone for the reduction of ICD shocks. Within OPTIC, a prospectively designed substudy evaluated the effects of the three treatment arms on defibrillation energy requirements. Defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) were measured using a binary step-down protocol at baseline and again after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy in 94 patients. These patients were randomized as follows: 29 to receive beta-blocker therapy (control group), 35 to amiodarone plus beta-blocker, and 30 to sotalol. In the control group, the mean DFT decreased from 8.77 ± 5.15 J at baseline to 7.13 ± 3.43 J (P = 0.027); in the amiodarone group, DFT increased from 8.53 ± 4.29 to 9.82 ± 5.84 J (P = 0.091). In the sotalol group, DFT decreased from 8.09 ± 4.81 to 7.20 ± 5.30 J (P = 0.21). DFT changes in the beta-blocker and the amiodarone group were significantly different (P = 0.006). In all patients, adequate safety margins for defibrillation were maintained. No clinical variable predicted baseline DFT or changes in DFT on therapy.

- **Conclusions**: Although amiodarone increased DFT, the effect size with modern ICD systems is very small. Therefore, D

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of sotalol versus dronedarone after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^112rEQFS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

As mentioned, the dominant driving factor for the difference in the proarrhythmia composite at 3, 6, and 12 months was the increased risk of bradyarrhythmias with sotalol. The composite proarrhythmia curve diverged mostly during the recovery phase after ablation, probably attributable to the higher use of AADs within that phase. Of interest, the pacemaker insertion curves for dronedarone and sotalol diverged continuously during the follow-up period out to 1 year, becoming significant only at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.

The higher incidence of significant bradycardia and pacemaker implantation in the recovery phase with sotalol compared with dronedarone in our study raises concern that acute changes after ablation may alter the safety profile of a drug. Antral or wide circumferential ablations of the pulmonary veins cause autonomic dysfunction, resulting in higher resting and exercise heart rates in the first few months after ablation. This may provide some protection from the bradycardic effects of sotalol in the recovery phase after ablation. Once this attenuates, the bradycardic effects of sotalol may become more pronounced, necessitating pacemaker implantation.

However, other confounding factors such as a higher incidence of sinus node dysfunction after superior vena cava isolation or ablation of foci along the superior crista terminalis cannot be excluded. Direct injury during the ablation procedure, however, would be expected to increase the need for pacemaker implantation shortly after the ablation procedure during the recovery phase.

### Pediatric dosing of intravenous sotalol based on body surface area in patients with arrhythmia [^1139JW9P]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sotalol is a potent antiarrhythmic agent with class III antiarrhythmic and beta-blocking properties. It is often used in the treatment of pediatric arrhythmias with good results. Until recently, the efficacy of sotalol in pediatric patients has been predominantly described in the English literature for the oral formulation. However, oral sotalol has a slow onset and is not practical for use in urgent or emergency situations for the termination of hemodynamically compromising or life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. Intravenous sotalol is available in the United States and is advisable in emergency situations because therapeutic blood levels can be achieved faster. Additionally, intravenous administration overcomes the uncertainty of variable oral absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.

In a recently published study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous sotalol in pediatric patients with incessant tachyarrhythmias and found it to be effective and safe. To our knowledge, this is the first and only publication regarding the intravenous use of sotalol in a pediatric population in the English literature. We employed a dosing regimen based on the body weight of the patients. In the United States, the recommendation for intravenous sotalol dosing in pediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The purpose of this paper is to compare the body weight-based dosing regimen to sotalol dosing expressed in terms of BSA as mg/m². This may aid physicians.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias-a PEAKS registry substudy [^111BJv9C]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Sotalol is used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm among patients with atrial fibrillation. However, there is discretion regarding the dosing of chronic therapy, and the target oral dose dictates infusion doses for intravenous sotalol loading. At the time of writing, use and outcomes by dose are not well-described.

- **Methods**: In the Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry, we analyzed outcomes among patients undergoing elective IV sotalol load for atrial arrhythmias (AT/AF). Baseline characteristics, changes in ECG parameters, in-hospital adverse events, and arrhythmia outcomes were compared based on the target oral dose (80 mg vs. 120 mg).

- **Results**: Among 163 total patients, 85 (52%) of patients underwent loading anticipating a target oral dose of 80 mg, compared with 78 (48%) for 120 mg. Those targeting 80 mg were older (median age 70 vs. 66, p < 0.001), with a similar proportion being female (24% vs. 21%, p = 0.71), and without significant differences in comorbidities or renal function. Patients targeted for 80 mg were less frequently kept in-hospital for 2 oral doses after intravenous infusion (45% vs. 89%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of sinus rhythm or adverse events during loading.

- **Conclusions**: Selection of target oral sotalol dose (120 vs. 80 mg) does not appear to be driven by patient characteristics, and may represent an opportunity for improved treatment. In-hospital adverse events are low overall without differences between doses.

Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT05247320.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^1139fhFr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Clinical and safety outcomes**: Changes in heart rate and QT/QTc interval over the course of IV sotalol initiation are described in Table 2. At the end of the 60-minute IV sotalol infusion, the mean QT/QTc interval had increased from baseline by 29.7 ms; at discharge, after two additional oral doses, the QT/QTc interval had increased from baseline by 29.8 ms [Figure 1].

	- Of the 29 patients undergoing IV sotalol initiation, 7 had discontinuation of the infusion due to significant bradycardia [Table 3]. Six out of seven of these patients were on AV nodal blocking agents (five on metoprolol and one on diltiazem) that were not discontinued or dose reduced before the start of IV sotalol. None of the patients who developed significant bradycardia required transcutaneous pacing or IV chronotropic support. Conversion to oral sotalol load was attempted for two of these patients but ultimately aborted due to persistent bradycardia. One patient received 45 minutes of the IV sotalol infusion before discontinuation for bradycardia and was discharged after two additional oral doses. The other four patients were discharged off sotalol without attempts at further oral loading.

	- Of the seven patients who developed significant bradycardia, three also had prolongation of the QT interval that would have required discontinuation. A total of 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%) underwent successful IV sotalol initiation. Of these, 10 of 22 patients (45.5%) were discharged on the 80 mg dose of sotalol, and 12 of 22 patients (54.5%) were discharged on the 120 mg dose of sotalol.

### Sotalol and a broken heart [^112UT4Lm]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

An 82-year-old woman with persistent atrial fibrillation underwent successful electrical cardioversion and was begun on sotalol. After 3 days of in-hospital observation, she had only mild lengthening of the QT interval. Two weeks later in clinic, the day after her husband's unexpected death, she was noted to have profound QT interval prolongation. Although she was asymptomatic and echocardiography did not disclose regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, she probably had a forme fruste of stress cardiomyopathy. Following emotional trauma, a period of heightened vigilance for ventricular proarrhythmia is probably warranted in women treated with antiarrhythmic drugs that lengthen repolarization.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112C2iQr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

There exists variability in the administration of in-patient sotalol therapy for symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). The impact of this variability on patient in-hospital and 30-day post-hospitalization costs and outcomes is not known. Also, the cost impact of intravenous sotalol, which can accelerate drug loading to therapeutic levels, is unknown.

- **Methods**: One hundred and thirty-three AF patients admitted for oral sotalol initiation at an Intermountain Healthcare Hospital from January 2017 to December 2018 were included. Patient and dosing characteristics were described descriptively, and the impact of dosing schedule was correlated with daily hospital costs and clinical outcomes during the index hospitalization and for 30 days. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement for 3-day sotalol initiation is $9,263.51. Projections of cost savings were made considering a 1-day load using intravenous sotalol that costs $2,500.00 to administer.

- **Results**: The average age was 70.3 ± 12.3 years, and 60.2% were male with comorbidities of hypertension (83%), diabetes (36%), and coronary artery disease (53%). The mean ejection fraction was 59.9 ± 7.8%, and the median corrected QT interval was 453.7 ± 37.6 ms before sotalol dosing. No ventricular arrhythmias developed, but bradycardia (< 60 bpm) was observed in 37.6% of patients. The average length of stay was 3.9 ± 4.6 (median: 2.2) days. Postdischarge outcomes and rehospitalization rates stratified by length of stay were similar. The cost per day was estimated at $2,931.55.

### Defining cardiomyocyte repolarization response to pharmacotherapy in long-QT syndrome type 3 [^115ZMQYD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We investigated the effects of sotalol, a mixed class II and class III antiarrhythmic drug, which is strongly contraindicated due to its high risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmia in patients with long-QT syndrome (LQTS).

Sotalol demonstrated a dose-dependent prolongation of the field potential duration corrected (FPDc) from 0.1 to 30 μmol across all clones when compared with the baseline (P < 0.05), even with low concentrations (0.1 and 0.3 μmol) showing significantly increased FPDc (P < 0.01) on control human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Normalization of FPDc values to their baseline indicated relatively minimal proportional change with escalating sotalol doses up to 3 μmol in any tested clone, suggesting a negligible genetic background modifying effect.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^116qkyD4]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Demographics and clinical assessment**: Patient demographics and clinical characteristics included age, sex, indication for sotalol initiation, prescription of atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents before sotalol initiation, creatinine clearance (CrCl), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patient clinical data were manually extracted via chart review. Heart rates and QT/QTc intervals by ECG were obtained every 15 minutes during sotalol infusion and 2–4 hours after each oral sotalol dose. The QT interval was used for decision-making when the heart rate was below 60 b.p.m. Abnormal QT/QTc intervals during sotalol loading were verified with manual calculation using the Bazett formula by the inpatient electrophysiology team. Heart rates and QT/QTc intervals were subsequently adjudicated by a study investigator.

- **Safety endpoints and outcome measures**: Outcomes related to sotalol dosing, changes in heart rate, and QT/QTc interval in response to sotalol infusion and oral sotalol doses, and length of stay (LOS) were assessed. Safety outcomes included the development of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and bradycardia. QT/QTc prolongation was defined as an absolute QT/QTc interval greater than 500 ms (or 550 ms for those with paced QRS or bundle branch block). All events were determined by review of electronic medical records, with heart rates and QT/QTc intervals evaluated by ECGs obtained during clinical care.

- **Statistical analysis**: Baseline characteristics and outcome comparisons between oral and IV sotalol initiation cohorts were performed using the Student's t-test.

### IV sotalol use in pediatric and congenital heart patients: A multicenter registry study [^112MjXPh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The preferred method of initiating IV sotalol remains unclear at present. Valdes et al. used 1 mg/kg over an hour for their acute arrhythmia termination group and 80% to 90% of the patient's prior daily oral maintenance dosage of sotalol, divided every 8 to 12 hours over 5 hours in those receiving IV maintenance therapy. Perry et al. reported a standardized target dose of 30 to 40 mg/m² over 15 minutes for the acute arrhythmia termination group, with maintenance dosing based on a 1:1 ratio of the recommended oral dose. This involved intermittent doses every 8 to 12 hours to reach a daily dose of 50 mg/m² per day or 3 mg/kg per day infused over 2 hours.

Our data show that, for both acute and maintenance dosing, the mean administration of IV sotalol across multiple centers was 1 mg/kg over a median of 60 minutes. Some centers in this study used an IV sotalol infusion duration of ≤ 30 minutes without complications, consistent with published experience from Perry et al. The median time to arrhythmia termination was 44 minutes, which was longer compared to previous studies, reflecting variable dosing regimens among participating centers.

The most common arrhythmia substrates were ectopic atrial tachycardia (31%), reentrant SVT (30%), and atrial flutter/fibrillation (17%). Patients with ectopic atrial tachycardia comprised a larger portion of recipients in our study compared with those of Valdes et al. (17%) and a smaller portion compared to Li et al. (43%). Notably, since the start of this study in March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration indications…

### Aim-AF: A physician survey in the United States and Europe [^111ReZpC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Initiation of AAD therapy

A notable number of respondents indicated they initiated sotalol therapy outside a hospital setting (53%). While this does not directly contradict recommendations, the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines state that hospital initiation of sotalol should be considered. As such, these responses suggest deviation from guidelines.

A number of respondents (United States only) initiated dofetilide outside a hospital setting (16%). This does not follow the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines or the US Food and Drug Administration labeling for this agent, which recommend inpatient initiation of dofetilide because of QT prolongation and risk of torsades de pointes.

- **Monitoring of patients receiving AADs**: Guidelines recommend close monitoring of proarrhythmic risk factors in individuals using AADs. In general, respondents requested routine investigations (at least annually) most often with amiodarone (Figure 3). ECGs were routinely requested by 80% of respondents with amiodarone, sotalol, and class Ic drugs. Routine requests for electrolyte monitoring were similar between all AADs but notably low for sotalol (52%) and class Ic drugs (50%). Renal function monitoring was also notably low with sotalol (57%) and dofetilide (US respondents only; 62%), despite both guidelines recommending electrolyte and renal function monitoring for all patients receiving sotalol. Respiratory function monitoring was requested by 64% of respondents with amiodarone and 14% with dronedarone. Monitoring of hepatic function with amiodarone, dronedarone, and class Ic drugs was requested by 84%, 57%, and

### Mortality and ventricular arrhythmias in patients on d, l-sotalol for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation: A nationwide cohort study [^111TToV6]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Use of d, l-sotalol for rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has raised safety concerns. Previous randomized studies are few and not designed for mortality outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidences of mortality and ventricular arrhythmias in AF patients treated with d, l-sotalol for rhythm control versus matched control patients treated with cardioselective beta-blockers.

- **Methods**: This population-based cohort study included AF patients from the Swedish National Patient Registry (2006–2017) who underwent rhythm control following a second cardioversion. Incidence rates (IRs) and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for mortality and a composite endpoint of cardiac arrest/death and ventricular arrhythmias were calculated for the overall cohort and a 1:1 propensity score matched cohort of d, l-sotalol versus beta-blocker treatment.

- **Results**: Among patients treated with d, l-sotalol (n = 4987) and beta-blockers (n = 27,078) (mean follow-up 458 days), all-cause mortality was lower in patients treated with d, l-sotalol: IR 1.21; 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.52 versus 2.42 (2.26–2.60) deaths per 100 patient-years; aHR 0.66 (0.52–0.83). The difference in mortality persisted in the propensity score matched comparison (n = 4953 in each group): aHR 0.63 (0.48–0.86). No differences were observed in the composite outcome: IR in propensity cohorts 2.13 (1.78–2.52) versus 2.07 (1.73–2.53) events per 100 years; aHR 1.01 (0.78–1.29).

In conclusion, there was no excess mortality with d, l-sotalol compared with cardioselective beta-blockers in patients undergoing rhythm control therapy.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^116nswoy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Sotalol prolongs the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential in the isolated myocyte as well as in isolated tissue preparations of ventricular or atrial muscle, showing Class III activity. In intact animals, it slows the heart rate, decreases AV nodal conduction, and increases the refractory periods of atrial and ventricular muscle and conduction tissue.

In humans, the Class II (beta-blockade) electrophysiological effects of sotalol include increased sinus cycle length (slowed heart rate), decreased AV nodal conduction, and increased AV nodal refractoriness. The Class III electrophysiological effects include prolongation of atrial and ventricular monophasic action potentials and effective refractory period prolongation of atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and atrio-ventricular accessory pathways (when present) in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. With oral doses of 160 to 640 mg/day, the surface ECG shows dose-related mean increases of 40–100 ms in QT and 10–40 ms in QTc.

In an unblinded, multicenter trial, twenty-five children with supraventricular (SVT) and/or ventricular (VT) tachyarrhythmias, aged between 3 days and 12 years (mostly neonates and infants), received an ascending titration regimen with daily doses of 30, 90, and 210 mg/m², with dosing every 8 hours for a total of 9 doses. During the steady-state, the respective average increases above baseline of the QTc interval were 2, 14, and 29 ms at the three dose levels. The respective mean maximum increases in QTc above baseline were 23, 36, and 55 ms.
