B. genetic drift
C. random mating
D. absence of selection

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is NOT an assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among: a large population, genetic drift, random mating, and absence of selection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the canonical assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Then, I should verify how each answer choice maps to those assumptions. Next, I will check for any nuances that might confuse the issue, like whether "large population" is strictly required or just helps approximate the ideal. Finally, I will confirm which option is the exception and why the others are indeed assumptions.

> Let me first confirm the core assumptions. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium rests on several conditions: random mating, absence of natural selection, absence of mutation, absence of migration, and a sufficiently large population so that genetic drift is negligible; these are standard in textbooks and methodological discussions of Hardy-Weinberg testing in population genetics studies [^330ecdfd] [^f14be8f2].

> Wait, let me verify the role of population size and drift. The "large population" assumption is there to ensure that sampling error (genetic drift) does not materially alter allele frequencies from one generation to the next; in small populations, drift can cause systematic deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions even when the other assumptions hold, so drift is something the model assumes away rather than assumes to be present [^330ecdfd] [^f14be8f2].

> I will now examine each option against these assumptions. Option A, a large population, is indeed an assumption because it keeps drift negligible; Option C, random mating, is a core assumption; Option D, absence of selection, is also a core assumption. Option B, genetic drift, is the opposite of an assumption — drift is a force that violates Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium when it is non-negligible, not something the model presumes to exist [^330ecdfd] [^f14be8f2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any source frames drift as an implicit assumption. I need to ensure I'm not conflating "assuming drift is negligible" with "assuming drift occurs". The correct reading is that Hardy-Weinberg assumes drift is negligible (via large population size), which is not the same as assuming drift itself; thus, genetic drift is the exception among the choices provided [^330ecdfd] [^f14be8f2].

> Conclusion: The correct answer is B, genetic drift, because Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes the absence of significant genetic drift (among other forces), whereas it explicitly assumes a large population, random mating, and no selection. Drift is a violation of the model when present, not an assumption of it [^330ecdfd] [^f14be8f2].

---

The correct answer is **B. genetic drift**. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes a large population, random mating, and no selection, mutation, or migration; it does not assume genetic drift, which is a violation of equilibrium and can cause allele frequencies to change by chance in small populations [^330ecdfd] [^f14be8f2].

---

## Assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium relies on the following **core assumptions**:

- **Large population**: The population is sufficiently large to minimize the effects of genetic drift [^330ecdfd].
- **Random mating**: Individuals mate randomly with respect to genotype [^f14be8f2].
- **Absence of selection**: No natural selection occurs, so all genotypes have equal fitness [^7e9487db].
- **Absence of mutation**: No new mutations arise [^330ecdfd].
- **Absence of migration**: No gene flow occurs between populations [^f14be8f2].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Assumption of hardy-weinberg equilibrium?** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. a large population | Yes | A large population minimizes genetic drift, ensuring allele frequencies remain stable [^330ecdfd]. |
| B. genetic drift | No | Genetic drift is a violation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, causing random fluctuations in allele frequencies, especially in small populations [^notfound]. |
| C. random mating | Yes | Random mating ensures genotype frequencies remain in equilibrium [^f14be8f2]. |
| D. absence of selection | Yes | Selection would alter allele frequencies, violating equilibrium [^7e9487db]. |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B. genetic drift** because Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes a large population to minimize genetic drift, and drift itself is a violation of equilibrium, not an assumption.

### Evolutionary genetics of the human Rh blood group system [^932afdd7]. Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

The evolutionary history of variation in the human Rh blood group system, determined by variants in the RHD and RHCE genes, has long been an unresolved puzzle in human genetics. Prior to medical treatments and interventions developed in the last century, the D-positive (RhD positive) children of D-negative (RhD negative) women were at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn, if the mother produced anti-D antibodies following sensitization to the blood of a previous D-positive child. Given the deleterious fitness consequences of this disease, the appreciable frequencies in European populations of the responsible RHD gene deletion variant (for example, 0.43 in our study) seem surprising. In this study, we used new molecular and genomic data generated from four HapMap population samples to test the idea that positive selection for an as-of-yet unknown fitness benefit of the RHD deletion may have offset the otherwise negative fitness effects of hemolytic disease of the newborn. We found no evidence that positive natural selection affected the frequency of the RHD deletion. Thus, the initial rise to intermediate frequency of the RHD deletion in European populations may simply be explained by genetic drift/founder effect, or by an older or more complex sweep that we are insufficiently powered to detect. However, our simulations recapitulate previous findings that selection on the RHD deletion is frequency dependent and weak or absent near 0.5. Therefore, once such a frequency was achieved, it could have been maintained by a relatively small amount of genetic drift. We unexpectedly observed evidence for positive selection on the C allele of RHCE in non-African populations (on chromosomes with intact copies of the RHD gene) in the form of an unusually high F(ST) value and the high frequency of a single haplotype carrying the C allele. RhCE function is not well understood, but the C/c antigenic variant is clinically relevant and can result in hemolytic disease of the newborn, albeit much less commonly and severely than that related to the D-negative blood type. Therefore, the potential fitness benefits of the RHCE C allele are currently unknown but merit further exploration.

### Contingent convergence: the ability to detect convergent genomic evolution is dependent on population size and migration [^6e0bf19e]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Outlier scans, in which the genome is scanned for signatures of selection, have become a prominent tool in studies of local adaptation, and more recently studies of genetic convergence in natural populations. However, such methods have the potential to be confounded by features of demographic history, such as population size and migration, which are considerably varied across natural populations. In this study, we use forward-simulations to investigate and illustrate how several measures of genetic differentiation commonly used in outlier scans (F ST, D XY and Δπ) are influenced by demographic variation across multiple sampling generations. In a factorial design with 16 treatments, we manipulate the presence/absence of founding bottlenecks (N of founding individuals), prolonged bottlenecks (proportional size of diverging population) and migration rate between two populations with ancestral and diverged phenotypic optima. Our results illustrate known constraints of individual measures associated with reduced population size and a lack of migration; but notably we demonstrate how relationships between measures are similarly dependent on these features of demography. We find that false-positive signals of convergent evolution (the same simulated outliers detected in independent treatments) are attainable as a product of similar population size and migration treatments (particularly for D XY), and that outliers across different measures (for e.g. F ST and D XY) can occur with little influence of selection. Taken together, we show how underappreciated, yet quantifiable measures of demographic history can influence commonly employed methods for detecting selection.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) prophylaxis — In the absence of reliable evidence comparing other antibiotics and antibiotic combinations, including those listed in the guideline, it is the opinion of this work group that perioperative antibiotics should be selected based on principles of responsible stewardship, balancing the risk of PJI and antibiotic resistance. Selection should reflect the antibiogram of the individual institution, the individual risk factors of the patient, and multidisciplinary support of institutional infection control experts; there is no current reliable evidence to support one antibiotic versus the other. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus.

### Positive and strongly relaxed purifying selection drive the evolution of repeats in proteins [^e9b3735c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To further characterize the horizontal evolution of repeats, we directly assess the protein-level selection (d N/ d S) of all repeat pairs within each protein, as in Fig. 2, in all proteins. The distributions of d N/ d S values in human protein repeats, compared with randomized repeats, are shown in Fig. 3d–f. About a third of the pairs were discarded from the analysis because the respective repeats were too short and/or too far diverged, such that either d N or d S could not be measured (Methods). The distribution of d N/ d S values for all valid pair comparisons within proteins across the proteome shows that, for an overwhelming majority of the comparisons, d N/ d S < 1 and is substantially smaller compared with the d N/ d S values for the respective randomized repeats that were generated by shuffling the coding DNA sequences of the real repeats (Fig. 3d). This observation holds also for the mean d N/ d S over all pairwise comparisons within a protein (< d N /d S >; Fig. 3e). The small relative errors of < d N/ d S > indicate that it is a fairly stable estimate, despite the short lengths of the repeats (Fig. 3f).

### Cathepsin L-dependent positive selection shapes clonal composition and functional fitness of CD4T cells [^067f5b85]. Nature Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Given the aberrant 'tuning' of multiple basal metabolic programs when Lm54 CD4 + T cells were selected in the absence of CTSL, we next examined additional hallmarks associated with CD4 + T cell survivability. Flow cytometric analysis showed that, across all maturation stages downstream of positive selection, expression of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and BCL-2 (both key orchestrators of CD4 + T cell survival) was reduced in Ctsl ΔTEC Lm54 Tg mice compared to Ctsl +/+ Lm54 Tg mice (Fig. 7g).

We therefore next assessed whether M2 CD4SP cells from these two genotypes differed in their homeostatic properties. Following 24-h in vitro culture without added growth factors or TCR stimulation, cells selected in the absence of CTSL exhibited substantially higher apoptosis (Fig. 7h). Administration of high-dose IL-7 rescued this in vitro survival defect (Fig. 7i). To address whether selection in the absence of CTSL impaired homeostasis in vivo, we conducted competitive co-transfer experiments using M2 CD4SP cells from Ctsl ΔTEC Lm54 Tg and Ctsl +/+ Lm54 Tg mice. Two weeks after co-transfer at a 1:1 ratio into sublethally irradiated wild-type recipients, the donor cell ratio had markedly shifted in disfavor of cells selected in the absence of CTSL (Fig. 7j). Analogous co-transfers of polyclonal M2 CD4SP cells from Ctsl ΔTEC and Ctsl +/+ donors to wild-type recipients recapitulated these observations and revealed a tendency toward diminished homeostatic proliferation of Ctsl ΔTEC cells (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f).

### Genealogical relationship among members of selection and production populations of yellow cedar (callitropsis nootkatensis [D. don] oerst.) in the absence of parental information [^95cb7854]. The Journal of Heredity (2009). Low credibility.

We used DNA fingerprinting and pedigree reconstruction to determine the genetic relationship among members of 3 yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis [D. Don] Oerst.) selection populations in the absence of their parental genotypes. Selection population members consisted of the tallest individuals within seedling crops originated from natural stand seed collected from multiple seed donors covering wide areas within 3 distinct locations (phenotypic mass selection). Pairwise relative kinship estimates indicated the presence of extensive coancestry among the selected seedlings, and pedigree reconstruction grouped each selection members into multiple full-sib families of different sizes (1–10) nested within several half-sib families (19–21). The "STRUCTURE" program (Pritchard JK, Stephens M, Donnelly P. 2000. "Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data". Genetics. 155:945–959.) provided a pictorial classification of the 3 selection populations and grouped their individuals into multiple cohorts (9–10). The STRUCTURE program's results corresponded with that of the pedigree reconstruction, indicating that members of the selection populations originated from a subset of the seed donors forming the natural stand seed collections. The species' silvics, reproductive biology, methods of natural stand seed collection and seedling production, and the high selection intensity applied to form the selection populations contributed to limiting the selection to a subset of the original donor trees. The associated buildup of coancestry in selection and production populations is expected to result in inaccurate estimation of genetic parameters and an unintentional reduction in genetic diversity in reforestation stocks.

Phase diagrams of the system behavior with pool punishment are qualitatively similar under non-marginal and weak selection strength.

a and c (the data are in agreement with those published in Figs. 5 and 10 from ref.), Numerical simulations under non-marginal selection (δ = 2). The phases are defined as follows: D –only D exists; O –only O exists; (D + C + O) C –cyclic dominance among D, C, and O; F O ⇔ D –fixation of either O or D; D O – D and O coexist; (D + C + D O) C –cyclic dominance among D, C, and D O. b and d, The phase diagram is divided by analytical β 0 and β ⋆ under weak selection (δ → 0 +). Here, β 0 divides the D and D O ⇔ D phases, while β ⋆ separates the D O ⇔ D and (D + C + O) C phases. Specifically, in b, β 0 = 81/134 + (135/134) α (red), β ⋆ = 3/2 + (5/2) α (blue); in d, β 0 = 81/268 + (135/134) α, β ⋆ = 3/4 + (5/2) α.

### Committee opinion no. 697: planned home birth [^77a9e925]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Planned home birth candidate selection and contraindications — Recent cohort studies reporting comparable perinatal mortality rates among planned home and hospital births describe the use of strict selection criteria for appropriate candidates; these criteria include the absence of any preexisting maternal disease, the absence of significant disease arising during the pregnancy, a singleton fetus, a cephalic presentation, gestational age greater than 36–37 completed weeks and less than 41–42 completed weeks of pregnancy, labor that is spontaneous or induced as an outpatient, and that the patient has not been transferred from another referring hospital. In the absence of such criteria, planned home birth is clearly associated with a higher risk of perinatal death, and the Committee on Obstetric Practice considers fetal malpresentation, multiple gestation, or prior cesarean delivery to be an absolute contraindication to planned home birth.

### Cathepsin L-dependent positive selection shapes clonal composition and functional fitness of CD4T cells [^7ed7b284]. Nature Immunology (2025). High credibility.

To disentangle the complex interplay between tonic TCR–pMHCII interactions and competition for soluble cues such as IL-7, which together sustain naive CD4 + T cell maintenance and may also drive homeostatic proliferation, we repeated the co-transfer of M2 CD4SP cells from Ctsl ΔTEC Lm54 Tg and Ctsl +/+ Lm54 Tg mice using MHCII −/− or Rag1 −/− recipients. In MHCII −/− hosts (where homeostatic MHCII contacts are abolished but survival factors such as IL-7 are readily available due to the absence of endogenous CD4 + T cells), cells selected in the absence of CTSL again exhibited a competitive disadvantage, although neither donor population showed evidence of proliferation (Fig. 7k). This indicated a diminished survivability of cells selected in the absence of CTSL that was not explained by altered responsiveness to tonic TCR signaling and/or reduced homeostatic proliferation. In Rag1 −/− recipients, which similarly provide ample access to soluble survival factors owing to their lack of an endogenous CD4 + T cell compartment but, in contrast to MHCII −/− recipients, permit homeostatic TCR–pMHCII contacts, the donor cell ratio once more shifted in disfavor of cells selected in the absence of CTSL (Fig. 7l). However, unlike in MHCII −/− recipients (Fig. 7k), a significantly smaller proportion of these cells underwent at least one cell division (Fig. 7m), revealing defective homeostatic proliferation as an additional layer of impaired functional fitness. Thus, CD4 + T cells selected in Ctsl ΔTEC mice in a seemingly CTSL-independent manner (based on their progression to the mature CD4SP stage) retained a lasting functional imprint of their selection history, manifesting as a metabolically less poised state and diminished homeostatic responsiveness to both 'tonic' TCR signals and TCR-independent survival cues.

### Competition between conjugation and M13 phage infection in Escherichia coli in the absence of selection pressure: a kinetic study [^44d33be5]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We demonstrated an experimental assay to measure the growth and competition kinetics between phage infection and conjugation between their bacterial hosts. Simulations of the mathematical model allow us to extract a number of fundamental parameters governing the infection process as well as its inhibitory effect on growth and conjugation. Although conjugation in the environment is frequently under the force of positive selection, we have shown that even in the absence of selective pressure, there is a regime where conjugation can persist despite phage inhibition.

Table 2
Treatment effect of nivolumab compared with ipilimumab in the presence and absence of select TRAEs

Coordinating analyses were performed for ipilimumab. As expected, treatment with ipilimumab led to greater toxicity than nivolumab (online supplemental appendix figure A3, tables A7–A11). In ipilimumab-treated patients, median time to both onset of select TRAEs and resolution of most select TRAEs was less than 12 weeks (online supplemental appendix figure A4). There was no clear association between RFS and a select TRAE occurring in the first 3 months of ipilimumab treatment (online supplemental appendix figure A5), or with the various other select TRAE categories analyzed (online supplemental appendix figure A6). Moreover, as with nivolumab treatment, the presence or absence of select TRAEs reported between first study dose and 100 days after last study dose (time-varying covariate) was not associated with RFS in the ipilimumab group (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.96; p = 0.0301 (to account for multiple comparisons, p ≤ 0.01 is considered significant, although, descriptive); online supplemental appendix table A12).

### Positive and strongly relaxed purifying selection drive the evolution of repeats in proteins [^0b9f660f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The comparison of these d N/ d S distributions (Fig. 5b, c) shows that horizontal evolution of paralogous repeats is substantially accelerated compared with the vertical evolution of the respective orthologous repeats. In accordance with their likely origin by duplication, adjacent repeats show slightly but significantly lower d N/ d S values than the mean for all repeats. This accelerated horizontal evolution of repeats is independent of the selection acting on the entire protein or its non-repetitive part (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting effects of evolutionary forces acting horizontally on repeats beyond the dominant purifying selection acting vertically on proteins. Vertically, repeats are at least as conserved as the proteins in which they reside. Often, the mean d N/ d S of repeats is lower than that of the respective complete proteins, indicative of strong purifying selection on orthologous repeat units. Moreover, as shown by the measurements of the average strength of selection affecting each unit of orthologous repeats, each individual copy of a repeat is highly conserved across species. These findings reveal a dramatic difference between the selection regimes of horizontal and vertical evolution indicating that, although in most of the comparisons d N/ d S < 1, horizontal evolution of repeats seems to drive them apart, leading to substantial divergence of repeat copies within individual proteins. This divergence contrasts the strong vertical conservation across species, suggesting that not only is purifying selection strongly relaxed once new repeats are generated, but that many repeats are positively selected during evolution following their generation, presumably with functional consequences (Discussion). After a period of strongly relaxed purifying selection (and/or positive selection), the unique functions of the individual repeats appear to be fixed causing a substantial slowdown of vertical evolution.

### Effective fitness under fluctuating selection with genetic drift [^cf523263]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Geometric mean fitness is a biased measure of selection in the presence of drift

In a haploid population, in generation i, let the frequency of a mutant be q i and the relative fitness of the mutant be. In the absence of genetic drift (e.g. when N e approaches infinity), the initial mutant frequency q 0 and the mutant frequency after n generations of selection satisfy the equation q n /(1 − q n) = [q 0 /(1 − q 0)] = [q 0 /(1 − q 0)], whereis the geometric mean of the mutant fitness across n generations. This is why, in the absence of drift, fluctuating selection is equivalent to a constant selection with the mutant fitness equal to f G, as indicated by the equal sign at the bottom of Fig. 2.

Fig. 2.
Relationships among different selection scenarios (constant vs. fluctuating selection) with and without genetic drift. The equal sign at the bottom of the figure represents the well-known conclusion that the allele frequency change under fluctuating selection without drift equals that under constant selection with the geometric mean fitness (f G) without drift, or the multiplicability of relative fitness. We examine in this study whether the expected allele frequency change under fluctuating selection with drift equals that under constant selection with f G, either with (indicated by question II) or without (indicated by question I) genetic drift. Because of the multiplicability of relative fitness, answering question I is equivalent to answering question III.

However, when genetic drift occurs, it is unclear whether the expected mutant frequency change under fluctuating selection equals that caused by a constant selection with f G in the presence (denoted by question II in Fig. 2) or absence (question I in Fig. 2) of genetic drift. As is clear from Fig. 2, by transitivity, evaluating question I is equivalent to evaluating whether the expected mutant frequency change under fluctuating selection with genetic drift equals that without genetic drift (question III in Fig. 2). Below, we demonstrate that the answer to question III is "no" and, thereby, the answer to question I is also "no".

MDR1 Inhibitors Release the Selection Inhibition of Immature Cells

LTGCPU7 transduced CB CD34 + cells were treated with puromycin, in the presence or absence of MDR1 inhibitors. Mean VCN was determined in pooled cells from methylcellulose and in human cells recovered from mouse bone marrow. In this experiment, selection level in erythroid progenitors was unexpectedly lower in the absence than in the presence of MDR1 inhibitors (Figure 4 A). We hypothesize that CB progenitors with variable levels of MDR1 expression may have variable susceptibility to puromycin selection, depending on the sample considered. In the absence of MDR1 inhibitor, no selection of transduced SRCs was observed (Figure 4 B). By contrast, in the presence of inhibitors, puromycin was able to select vector-bearing cells (Figure 4 B). As expected, the selection of transduced SRCs and their concomitant decreased number was associated with lower proportions of human cells in mice receiving selected HSCs than in mice receiving cells treated with puromycin only (Figure 4 C). The lower rate of human cell reconstitution in the group of mice receiving cells treated with puromycin only than in animals receiving untreated cells, in the absence of selection at the SRC level, may be explained by the influence of supporting cells on SRC homing, proliferation, and/or differentiation.

### Illness absence patterns among employees in a petrochemical facility: impact of selected health risk factors [^2914f52e]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Illness absence in a working population is a complex phenomenon and can be influenced by many factors, such as age, gender, and personal health risk factors. The current study used prospectively collected employee health risk and morbidity data to examine illness absence patterns for a working population and to quantify the impact of selected health risk factors on employee illness absence.

Methods

The study population consisted of 2550 regular employees working at a Texas petrochemical facility. Morbidity data were extracted from the company's Health Surveillance System, and records of absences were derived from personnel and payroll systems. The morbidity frequency rate and average duration of absence per employee per year were calculated by age, gender, and selected health risk factors, including smoking, body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, and fasting glucose.

Results

Morbidity frequency rates and average duration of absence increased with age and with the presence of health risk factors. The absence frequency rate increased with an increase in the number of risk factors present from no risk factors (11.8 per 100 employees) to four or more risk factors (32.3 per 100 employees). The number of workdays lost also increased with the number of risk factors present, with the least number of workdays lost by employees with zero risk factors (4.1 day), followed by one (6.4 days), two (8.8 days), three (9.3 days), and four or more risk factors (12.6 days).

Conclusions

The impact of employee health risk factors has been shown in this study to be associated with absence frequency and duration of absence. Reduction in employee health risk factors can be an effective means of improving employees' health and increasing a company's productivity.

### Selective interference and the evolution of sex [^802aee26]. The Journal of Heredity (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection acts upon genes linked together on chromosomes. This physical connection reduces the efficiency by which selection can act because, in the absence of sex, alleles must rise and fall together in frequency with the genome in which they are found. This selective interference underlies such phenomena as clonal interference and Muller's Ratchet and is broadly termed Hill-Robertson interference. In this review, I examine the potential for selective interference to account for the evolution and maintenance of sex, discussing the positive and negative evidence from both theoretical and empirical studies, and highlight the gaps that remain.

### Impact of CYP2C19 variant genotypes on clinical efficacy of antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel: systematic review and meta-analysis [^0666ea17]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Methods for assessing the risk of bias in individual studies

To explore the risk of bias in individual studies, we investigated indicators general to the quality of epidemiological studies and specific to the quality of genetic association studies. We extracted quality information on loss to follow-up, funding sources, comparability of groups (demographic and clinical homogeneity between groups with and without outcome, demographic and clinical homogeneity between carriers and non-carriers of the allele of interest, absence of population stratification (ethnic homogeneity)), reliability and validity of phenotype assessment (use of standardised definitions of disease phenotypes, blinding of clinical outcome assessors to patients' genetic information), and reliability and validity of genotype assessment (consistency of observed genotype frequencies with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, use of an appropriate genotyping method, high call rate, blinding of investigators who performed genotyping to clinical outcome).

Additionally, in adopting the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, we graded the methodological quality of the selected studies with a summary score using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. We applied a modified scale (adapted for genetic association studies), awarding a maximum score of 8, with one point each for representativeness of the exposed group (carriers of the genotype of interest) for the underlying population; selection of the unexposed group (non-carriers) from the same population as the exposed individuals; adequate measurement of exposure; adequate ascertainment of the absence of the outcome of interest at begin of the study; demographic and clinical comparability between groups (carriers and non-carriers of the genotype); appropriate measurement of outcome; adequate length of follow-up; and completeness of follow-up. Study quality was considered to be good when the score was ≥ 6 and poor to moderate when the score was < 6. Two investigators independently scored quality, and the inter-rater agreement was determined by the κ statistic.

Consistency of the observed genotyping frequencies with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium provides an overall (albeit insensitive and non-specific) indication for the absence of any strong bias by the selection of patient groups, population stratification, or genotyping errors. We checked departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using Fisher's exact testinstead of the χ 2 test reported in the individual studies as it yields increased statistical power. For the cohort studies and the genetic subgroup analyses, testing on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was performed in the whole population, and for the case-control study in the control group. We considered that significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.05) necessitated a correction of individual risk estimates.

### Cathepsin L-dependent positive selection shapes clonal composition and functional fitness of CD4T cells [^97822f58]. Nature Immunology (2025). High credibility.

The physiological significance of thymic positive selection and its reliance on a single stromal cell type, cortical thymic epithelial cells, remain incompletely understood. The lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL) has been implicated in generating major histocompatibility complex class II-bound peptides in cortical thymic epithelial cells for efficient CD4 + T cell differentiation. Here, we addressed the extent and nature of the CD4 + T cell repertoire changes associated with CTSL deficiency. In the absence of CTSL, a highly selective loss of T cell receptors resulted in a markedly reduced repertoire diversity. However, a similarly large proportion of nominally 'CTSL-independent' T cell receptors were retained. Clones representative of the second category experienced weaker positive selection signals in the absence of CTSL, which were sufficient for further maturation yet imprinted aberrant responsiveness to agonist stimulation and impaired homeostatic behavior. Together, these findings demonstrate that CTSL is crucial for both shaping full repertoire diversity and optimizing CD4 + T cell functionality.

The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2021). High credibility.

CYP2D6*5 — The no-function CYP2D6*5 allele is characterized by a full gene deletion with absence of CYP2D6 protein and loss of enzyme function, and its allele frequency is approximately 3% to 5% in African, Asian (Central/South and East Asian), and European populations.

### Contingent convergence: the ability to detect convergent genomic evolution is dependent on population size and migration [^f587086b]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Selection was the most important fixed effect for Δπ regardless of migration (Table 3), however both models explained minimal variance (8.27% with migration, 0.59% without migration). This is consistent with the previous demonstration of the erosion of Δπ over time (Figure 1).

Removing divergent selection (i.e. in Pheno Null simulations) modified models for F ST and D XY for treatments with migration. Selection and selection target remained the most important model effects, but had more similar sized effects, and ultimately variance explained dropped from 48.96 to 3.60%. Conversely, the model for Pheno Null D XY with migration increased variance explained from 9.53 to 13.10% compared with Pheno Div D XY. Selection target had a strongly significant negative association alongside strength of selection in this model. Δπ models were largely unchanged. Together, these results confirm that divergent selection, and not stabilizing selection within DP, drive F ST and D XY variation in Pheno Div simulations.

### Effective fitness under fluctuating selection with genetic drift [^28e70165]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

A better solution: effective fitness (f E)

Given the problem with f G, we propose a more accurate measure of the overall effect of fluctuating selection on a mutant. The idea originates from the constant effect of a given allele frequency change on fixation probability under neutrality. That is, if a neutral allele's frequency is raised from q to, the probability of fixation of the allele always increases by, regardless of q. This insensitivity to the initial allele frequency inspired us to use the mean allele frequency change per generation driven by selection as a measure of the per generation effect of selection. Specifically, at any generation i, whereis the mutant fitness in generation i andis the mutant frequency at the end of generation i − 1. We can then average the allele frequency change caused by selection over generations of interest (from the emergence of the allele to its fixation or loss, or any period of time in between), or, where n is the number of generations involved. We then define the effective fitness (f E) of the mutant to be the fitness with which a mutant of frequency 0.5 will have an expected frequency change of, driven by selection, in one generation. That is, which means that.

Note that, in addition to the relative fitness of the mutant at each generation, the mutant allele frequency at each generation is also used in calculating, which should makeperform better than. Specifically, in the presence of drift, given f E and the number of generations, we expect the same effect of selection on the allele frequency change (i.e. the evolutionary outcome) regardless of the specific temporal variation of fitness, which is not true for f G. Below, we show thatprovides a virtually unbiased measure of the effect of fluctuating selection in the presence of drift.

Following the logic in proving the inaccuracy of f G, let us first consider 2 generations. Instead of specifying the relative fitness (and), we now specify the expected allele frequency changes caused by selection in 2 generations (and). We will investigate whether the expected mutant frequency after 2 generations of fluctuating selection, with or without genetic drift, is equivalent to the mutant frequency resulting from 2 generations of selection with a constant per generation allele frequency change specified by. The derivation of mutant frequency in the absence of drift is similar to the derivation of the expected mutant frequency in the presence of drift; so only the latter will be presented below.

### The magnitude ofStress-induced genome instability results from an interaction between ploidy and antifungal drugs [^8f617382]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

While it is likely that the changes to total tetraploid DNA content are specifically associated with LOH events, these changes may be a general response to antifungal drugs. Therefore, we measured total DNA content of single colony isolates obtained in the absence of LOH selection (Figure S4). In the no-drug treatment, there were only a few minor deviations from tetraploidy, and a similar fraction detected in caspofungin, although these were mostly losses (Figure 4B). For fluconazole, 20–30% of isolates had aneuploid genome content and a small fraction had converged to diploidy. This supports the premise that fluconazole promotes ploidy instability, given that we also observed changes to DNA content in diploids. Interestingly, in calcofluor white, there were ∼40% of isolates with ∼2C DNA content. This rapid convergence to diploidy was notable given the short exposure time and absence of LOH selection. Furthermore, this was specific to calcofluor white and not a general response to cell wall perturbations, as we did not observe similar changes in caspofungin.

For each drug treatment, we plotted the total fraction of isolates displaying changes to total DNA content (gains + losses) with LOH selection (Figure 4C, filled circles) and without LOH selection (Figure 4C, open circles) by the rate of LOH. Deviations to total tetraploid DNA content were frequently (10–62%) detected in the absence of LOH selection across all treatments (Figure 4C), and is in contrast to diploids (Figure 3D). Furthermore, tetraploid instability was substantially elevated in isolates selected for LOH events. For no-drug and low caspofungin treatments, we saw a strong relationship between devations to total DNA content and selection for LOH; for fluconazole and high caspofungin treatments there was a moderate relationship; and for calcofluor white there was no relationship. This was due, in part, to the high ploidy instability observed in the absence of LOH selection and may also reflect LOH events that are not due to chromosome mis-segregation.

### Upper-limb prosthetics: critical factors in device abandonment [^d4d8863a]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the roles of predisposing characteristics, established need, and enabling resources in upper-limb prosthesis use and abandonment.

Design

A self-administered, anonymous survey was designed to explore these factors. The questionnaire was available online and in paper format and was distributed through healthcare providers, community support groups, and one prosthesis manufacturer. Two hundred forty-two participants of all ages and levels of upper-limb absence completed the survey.

Results

Of participants, 20% had abandoned prosthesis use. Predisposing factors, namely, origin of limb absence, gender, bilateral limb absence, and, most importantly, level of limb absence, proved influential in the decision not to wear prostheses. Enabling resources such as the availability of health care, cost, and quality of training did not weigh heavily on prosthesis rejection, with the exception of the fitting time frame and the involvement of clients in the prosthesis selection. Conversely, the state of available technology was a highly censured factor in abandonment, specifically in the areas of comfort and function. Perceived need emerged as a predominant factor in prosthesis use.

Conclusions

Future research should focus on continued development of more comfortable and functional prostheses, particularly for individuals with high-level or bilateral limb absence. Improved follow-up, repair, and information services, together with active involvement of clients in the selection of prostheses meeting their specific goals and needs, is recommended.

### Dominant resistance and negative epistasis can limit the co-selection of de novo resistance mutations and antibiotic resistance genes [^776b5ccf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

ARGs tend to dominate mutants within their resistance range

The initial results suggested that the selection of mutants in the presence of a given ARG would depend largely on the ARGs ability to confer resistance to the presented drug challenge (Fig. 2). The selection patterns observed suggests that ARGs dominate the resistance phenotype of the mutants and that, accordingly, the selection of mutants would depend on their fitness in the condition without antibiotics (Supplementary Fig. 2).

To investigate this phenomenon further, we determined mutant selection patterns in the presence or absence of the ARGs bla TEM-219, floR, and qnrS1 at concentrations ranging from sub-MIC levels to 256 times the WT MIC of cefepime, chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin, respectively. When no antibiotic was present, the fittest mutants (LB, CIP, and TMP evolved) were selected, as highlighted also in Fig. 2. From the selection patterns observed at the different drug concentrations, it is clear that mutants were selected for at very low (sub-MIC) drug concentrations in the absence of a protective ARG (Fig. 3). A pattern of concentration-dependent mutant selection was observed, which corresponded well with the relative fitness cost of each mutant in the absence of antibiotics, as well as the respective antibiotic resistance profile (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). Mostly, the mutants were selected at a respective concentration where they had the highest fitness in LB combined with a MIC above the drug exposure level. For example, above the MIC of chloramphenicol the mutants evolved to Doxycycline are dominating (Fig. 3b) as observed previously (Fig. 2).

### Management of glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis [^9dfef084]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Shoulder arthroplasty discharge — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that same-day discharge is an option after shoulder arthroplasty in select patients, with Strength of Recommendation: Consensus and Strength of Evidence: No reliable evidence. Same day discharge following shoulder arthroplasty, either from the PACU of an inpatient facility or from an ambulatory surgical center, is a viable option for select patients following surgery, and there is no convincing evidence to suggest that same day discharge following shoulder arthroplasty is not a safe option. Fournier et al. developed a validated patient selection algorithm with stratification based on age and cardiopulmonary comorbidities; using this selection algorithm there were no hospital readmissions for cardiopulmonary events within 90 days, and the authors noted a 5% acute complication rate. Multiple studies reported outpatient shoulder arthroplasty demonstrating no significant difference with regards to major or minor complication rates and readmission rates when compared to the inpatient setting. Patient selection is key, and patients most at risk for dissatisfaction with pain control postoperatively are those who have been taking chronic narcotic pain medication preoperatively. It is possible that same day discharge in patients who are not good candidates could result in increased risk of uncontrolled postoperative pain or medical complications, with important considerations including concern for cardiopulmonary or thromboembolic events requiring intervention and or readmission, postoperative wound problems, increased need for reoperation, and increased rates of return to the emergency department or hospital re-admission.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^ecd1bba6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study D2d was published by Anastassios G Pittas and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements. In the D2d study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency? In the D2d study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D2d study, the population was: 2423 patients (1086 female, 1337 male). The inclusion criteria were adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency. The key exclusion criteria were any glycemic criterion in the diabetes range affecting the glycated hemoglobin level; use of diabetes or weight-loss medications; use of supplements containing vitamin D at a dose > 1,000 IU/day or calcium at a dose > 600 mg/day. In the D2d study, the interventions were: n = 1211 vitamin D supplementation (at a dose of 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplementation) n = 1212 placebo (matching placebo). In the D2d study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of new-onset diabetes (9.39 events /100 py vs. 10.66 events /100 py; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.04). In the D2d study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypercalcemia, fasting urine calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.375, low eGFR, nephrolithiasis. In the D2d study, the conclusion was: in adults at high risk for T2DM not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of new-onset diabetes.

### Positive and strongly relaxed purifying selection drive the evolution of repeats in proteins [^f43c237f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Repeats in protein-coding genes are often viewed as a major source of new raw genetic material, which rapidly evolves and facilitates the acquisition of new functions and complex phenotypic traits. Under this view, a new copy is assumed to be free of selective constraints, such that a new function can emerge rapidly, minimizing the risk of deleterious effects. However, the global conservation of repeats across speciesputs into question the concept of rapid evolution and the above neofunctionalization scenario. In other words, analogously to the fate of duplicated genes, these observations reflect Ohno's dilemma, which projects here to paralogous elements within proteins: if repeats are subject to strong purifying selection to maintain a function, how can they rapidly diverge?

For duplicated genes, it has been shown that, although subject to purifying selection (d N/ d S < < 1), they evolve slightly but significantly faster than orthologous genes of similar divergence. Thus, the paralogues experience a phase of relaxed purifying selection shortly after duplication. Similarly, here we show that orthologous repeats evolve under selection that is, on average, at least as strong as the selection on the non-repetitive parts of protein sequences if not somewhat stronger, in agreement with previous studies. Importantly, we show that this selection acts on each copy, clearly indicating that individual repeats possess unique functions maintained by selection. However, within a protein, paralogous repeats diverge from each other substantially (typically, by an order of magnitude) faster than orthologous repeats as indicated by high d N/ d S values characteristic of the horizontal evolution of repeats. On average, the horizontal d N/ d S values, although much higher than the vertical values, are below unity, suggestive of strongly relaxed purifying selection. Nonetheless, the presence of long tails in the d N/ d S distributions and especially the homogenization of repeats in some proteins that is apparently caused by selective drive suggest that positive selection also is involved in the horizontal evolution of repeats. Taken together, these observations translate into a general scenario for the evolution of repetitive regions in proteins that involves an initial phase of rapid sequence and functional diversification, driven in part by positive selection, following a burst of duplication, which leads to the emergence of a repetitive region, with subsequent fixation of the sequences of individual repeats and their ensuing slow evolution under purifying selection (Fig. 6).

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary of surgical management of osteoarthritis of the knee [^db5f12be]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty vs. staged — workgroup opinion and strength: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) could be performed vs. staged (> 90 days) bilateral TKA in appropriately selected patients but should be performed with caution and should be avoided with patients who are at high risk of cardiopulmonary complications. Quality of evidence is Low and the strength of option is Consensus (downgraded), and in the absence of reliable evidence, the guideline work group is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. This recommendation has been downgraded due to the potential harms to the patient.

### Positive and strongly relaxed purifying selection drive the evolution of repeats in proteins [^83784e3e]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Protein repeats are considered hotspots of protein evolution, associated with acquisition of new functions and novel phenotypic traits, including disease. Paradoxically, however, repeats are often strongly conserved through long spans of evolution. To resolve this conundrum, it is necessary to directly compare paralogous (horizontal) evolution of repeats within proteins with their orthologous (vertical) evolution through speciation. Here we develop a rigorous methodology to identify highly periodic repeats with significant sequence similarity, for which evolutionary rates and selection (d N/ d S) can be estimated, and systematically characterize their evolution. We show that horizontal evolution of repeats is markedly accelerated compared with their divergence from orthologues in closely related species. This observation is universal across the diversity of life forms and implies a biphasic evolutionary regime whereby new copies experience rapid functional divergence under combined effects of strongly relaxed purifying selection and positive selection, followed by fixation and conservation of each individual repeat.

### Evolutionary genomics: detecting selection needs comparative data [^afbb56e5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Positive selection at the molecular level is usually indicated by an increase in the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) in comparative data. However, Plotkin et al. describe a new method for detecting positive selection based on a single nucleotide sequence. We show here that this method is particularly sensitive to assumptions regarding the underlying mutational processes and does not provide a reliable way to identify positive selection.

### Stirring competes with chemical induction in chiral selection of soft matter aggregates [^31cc5f3c]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Chirality, the absence of mirror symmetry, can be equally invoked in relation to physical forces and chemical induction processes, yet a competition between these two types of influence is rarely reported. Here we present a self-assembled soft matter system in which chiral selection is controlled by the combined independent action of a chiral dopant and vortical stirring, which are arbitrarily coupled, either constructively or destructively. In the latter case, perfect compensation, that is, absence of a net chiral effect, is realized. The induced enantiomorphic excess is measured in terms of the statistical imbalance of an ensemble of submillimetre domains, where achiral molecules self-assemble with a well-defined orientational chirality that is unambiguously resolved using optical microscopy. The possibility of combining top-down and bottom-up strategies to induce a chiral predominance in a supramolecular system of achiral components should be recognized as a new twist in the process of chiral recognition, selection and control.

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

### Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage at outpatient testing site, Berlin, Germany, January-March 2021 [^40192af1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, we explored which combination of variables in our dataset best described B.1.1.7 in a logistic regression applying a backward stepwise selection on the basis of the Akaike information criterion (Appendix). This work identified the best set of associated factors as the absence of anosmia or ageusia (p = 0.01), longer symptom duration (p = 0.02), sore throat (p = 0.05), lower C t value (p = 0.07), travel in the previous 14 days (p = 0.08), lower age (p = 0.09), and absence of rhinorrhea (p = 0.12). We then used the bootstrap technique to repeat the variable selection in 1,000 replicated datasets and evaluated how often these variables were selected with the backward selection. This analysis resulted in anosmia or ageusia, 89%; symptom duration, 78%; travel, 73%; sore throat, 68%; C t value, 66%; age, 56%; and rhinorrhea, 51%. Absence of anosmia or ageusia, longer symptom duration, and travel were selected most often, indicating their association with B.1.1.7 infection. We performed all analyses in R version 3.6.3.

Sex ratio selection in diploids with female hibernation

Now the overlapping-generation parameter O m is given by equation (30). Qualitatively, the same results hold as for haplodiploids: in the absence of help (h = 0) and with non-overlapping generations of males, the equilibrium sex ratios are unbiased. If male generations overlap, the equilibrium spring sex ratio is male-biased and the summer sex ratio is female-biased. However, again, a sufficiently large benefit from help favours female-biased sex ratios in the spring.

The overlapping generation parameters O f and O m are given by equations (34a) and (34b), respectively. In the absence of help (h = 0), and with non-overlapping generations of males, clearly the equilibrium sex ratios are again unbiased: Without help but with overlapping male generations, the equilibrium spring sex ratio is female-biased, that is, while the equilibrium summer sex ratio is male-biased, in contrast to the results for the FH life cycle. With help, a female-biased spring sex ratio is favoured regardless of generation overlap.

### Positive and strongly relaxed purifying selection drive the evolution of repeats in proteins [^46789b12]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

This scenario resembles existing models for the evolution of duplicated genes, but with important quantitative differences, which seem to translate into a qualitative distinction. The early acceleration of evolution in duplicated genes is relatively small and takes advanced analysis to be demonstrated convincingly. Primarily, this acceleration among newly duplicated gene copies is attributed to subfunctionalization whereby duplicates quickly diverge under relaxed purifying selection, while losing some of the multiple functions of the ancestral gene. The present analysis demonstrates a much greater difference in the divergence rates during horizontal versus vertical evolution of repeats. This finding implies a different regime for the evolution of repetitive regions in proteins where subfunctionalization could make some contribution but neofunctionalization and positive selection appear to be important, if not key factors. This distinction between the evolutionary regimes of paralogous genes and within-gene repeats could have to do with the small size of the latter whereby even a single amino-acid substitution would often cause a functional change of sufficient consequences to drive purifying or positive selection. After the initial accelerated evolution phase, the evolutionary trajectories of duplicated genes and protein repeats appear to be similar, that is, dominated by (often strong) purifying selection. Extending this analogy, our results indicate that evolution of most repetitive regions in proteins occurs via the straightforward birth-and-death (duplication and loss) route. However, we also found evidence of some concerted evolution, apparently via propagation and homogenization of the duplicated elements driven by positive selection. Although concerted evolution mostly occurs through DNA repair and replication mechanisms, such as unequal crossing over and (biased) gene conversion, the role of strong positive selection, allowing beneficial mutations to propagate, has been noticed as a contributing factor as well. The existence of this form of drive implies that the observed high d N/ d S values for the horizontal comparisons of repeats at least in part reflect positive selection that drives propagation of beneficial mutations across a repeat array.

### Heritable epigenetic variation facilitates long-term maintenance of epigenetic and genetic variation [^c4a7271e]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Epialleles under strong selection cause deviations from EBE

We next asked how population dynamics are affected when a single epiallele yields a selective advantage relative to other alleles that are neutral with respect to each other, rather than compensating for a deleterious allele. While advantageous genetic alleles would be expected to be maintained at high frequency in a population, the high reversibility of epialleles makes it difficult to know how selection affects their long-term persistence. In our model, we consider when the a 4 epiallele has both a recessive and dominant fitness advantage relative to all other alleles. In the absence of any selective advantage, epialleles within a genotype will be in EBE, and by incorporating a selection coefficient of 0.01, our results show only mild deviations from EBE (Fig. 5a–c). Throughout most of the parameter space, a single equilibrium exists, although in the recessive case there are sometimes 2 stable equilibria (Fig. 5b). In the symmetric case when A 3 has a selective advantage, we find that due to the asymmetry in the genetic mutation rate, it is possible for simultaneous maintenance of A 1 and a 2 to occur at low epimutation rates (Supplementary Fig. 1), but for higher rates, patterns are consistent with results seen when a 4 has a selective advantage. Notably, when s 44 = 0 but all other s nk = 0.2, a 4 is maintained at high frequency even when the back-epimutation rate is high, highlighting the opportunity for an advantageous epiallele to significantly alter the dynamics of EBE. To systematically assess the role of selection coefficient on the dynamics of EBE, we randomly selected selection coefficients between 0 and 1 and allowed a 4 to have a dominant or recessive selective advantage relative to all other alleles for specific epimutation and back-epimutation rates. In all cases, EBE is a good approximation for the equilibrium as long as the selection coefficient is small (< 0.01), but it becomes an underestimate as the selection coefficient increases (> 0.1). EBE also is more likely to yield an accurate estimate if. Thus, population dynamics of small-effect variants that are inherited a limited number of generations — likely the dominant class of epigenetic variants in nature — are dominated by epimutation and back-epimutation rates and are well estimated by EBE. Nonetheless, large-effect epigenetic variants that are less readily reversible, if they arise, can significantly alter these dynamics.

Crohn's disease — lay-open fistulotomy for simple low fistulas: Symptomatic, simple, low anal fistulas in carefully selected patients with Crohn's disease may be treated by lay-open fistulotomy. Grade of recommendation: weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. Fistulotomy may be safely performed in appropriately selected patients with an uncomplicated low fistula (ie, less than 30% involvement of the external anal sphincter) in the absence of proctitis. Healing rates after fistulotomy range from 62% to 100%, and 6% to 12% of patients report mild incontinence, however, some studies report higher rates of postoperative incontinence (up to 50%), especially in patients with active proctitis, underscoring the importance of patient selection. Recognizing the benefits and risks associated with fistulotomy in the setting of Crohn's disease, the grade of this recommendation has been changed from a 1C grade in the 2016 clinical practice guidelines to a 2C grade.

### Notch signaling is required for proliferation but not for differentiation at a well-defined β-selection checkpoint during human T-cell development [^c59badd1]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Notch signaling is absolutely required for beta-selection during mouse T-cell development, both for differentiation and proliferation. In this report, we investigated whether Notch has an equally important role during human T-cell development. We show that human CD34(+) thymocytes can differentiate into CD4(+)CD8beta(+) double positive (DP) thymocytes in the absence of Notch signaling. While these DP cells phenotypically resemble human beta-selected cells, they lack a T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain. Therefore, we characterized the beta-selection checkpoint in human T-cell development, using CD28 as a differential marker at the immature single positive CD4(+)CD3(-)CD8alpha(-) stage. Through intracellular TCR-beta staining and gene expression analysis, we show that CD4(+)CD3(-)CD8alpha(-)CD28(+) thymocytes have passed the beta-selection checkpoint, in contrast to CD4(+)CD3(-)CD8alpha(-)CD28(-) cells. These CD4(+)CD3(-)CD8alpha(-)CD28(+) thymocytes can efficiently differentiate into CD3(+)TCRalphabeta(+) human T cells in the absence of Notch signaling. Importantly, preselection CD4(+)CD3(-)CD8alpha(-)CD28(-) thymocytes can also differentiate into CD3(+)TCRalphabeta(+) human T cells without Notch activation when provided with a rearranged TCR-beta chain. Proliferation of human thymocytes, however, is clearly Notch-dependent. Thus, we have characterized the beta-selection checkpoint during human T-cell development and show that human thymocytes require Notch signaling for proliferation but not for differentiation at this stage of development.

### Polymorphism and the red queen: the selective maintenance of allelic variation in a deteriorating environment [^61e5f753]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

When α = ⅓, this correlation is ⅓.

Following the generation of the new mutant, we iterated allele frequencies according to Equation (1). A new mutation, A n + 1, will invade an infinite population when its marginal fitness is greater than the population's mean fitness (i.e.).

In versions of the model with genetic drift, we took a sample of size 2 N with replacement (a multinomial sampling process with the allele frequencies as the probabilities), thus producing the next generation's allele frequencies. At this point, we checked for the extinction of alleles, removing them from the system. In finite populations, extinction occurred when an allele's frequency after genetic drift fell to zero. In the infinite-population simulations, we rounded any frequency below 5 × 10 −5 down to zero.

We incorporated the deteriorating fitnesses of the Red Queen into our simulations in 1 of the 2 ways. First, we assumed a constant multiplicative decrease in fitnesses, d ∈ {0.995, 0.999, 0.9999}, each generation, so that

We also used d = 1 to replicate the results of previous workers using the constant viability model. In the simulations of generalized dominance, we also reduced the primary effects for each allele in each generation in the same way:

In a second series of simulations, the decay in fitness was a random variable, d ij, sampled from a normal distribution, Norm(µ, σ 2), with 15.87% of its values > 1 [e.g. Norm(0.999, 0.001 2)]:

Within-family selection

One of the main benefits of genomic selection in forest tree breeding is selecting superior trees in large full-sib families. In tree breeding, mid-parental values are used for selecting top-ranking families in the absence of performance data from progeny trials. While better-performing families can be selected based on mid-parental values, these methods cannot be used for selecting superior genotypes within the selected families unless they are progeny tested. Genomic selection is ideally suited for making within family selections in the absence of performance data as markers can be used to capture the Mendelian segregation term. High within-family accuracies observed with family folding in this study indicate that it may be possible to select superior individuals in untested families derived from parents with a similar background to the training population. While predicting genetic values is more important in CP families than OP families, the selected trees with high genetic values may be used for establishing clonal trials from OP breeding programs.

### Quantitative constraints on the scope of negative selection [^09aa71b5]. Trends in Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Maturing T cells with a high affinity for self-antigens presented in the thymus are deleted in the process of negative selection. Although the expression of various "tissue-specific" antigens has been described in the thymus, it is still controversial what fraction of all self-antigens induces tolerance by this mechanism. We demonstrate that the limited duration of the negative selection phase imposes a constraint on the number of self-peptides that can be reliably selected against. The analysis supports the theory that negative selection is confined to the subset of peptides produced by dendritic cells.

A comparison of haplotype frequencies between unrelated cases and controls from population isolates identifies a strong signal for the presence/absence of the discrete phenotype in an interval on chromosome 6 bounded by markers 34 and 35.

We describe two statistical methods to utilize D: a method appropriate for a single moderately sized sample and a sequential approach appropriate for multiple small independent samples.

### Purifying selection enduringly acts on the sequence evolution of highly expressed proteins in Escherichia coli [^d727f655]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

Purifying selection on codon usage in de novo evolution was less sensitive to expression level

The expression level dependency of d S reflects the purifying selection of codon usage of highly expressed proteins, which is a frequently suggested explanation for the E–R anticorrelation in d N. Highly expressed proteins tend to use optimal codons that enable fast and accurate translation and protein stability. The use of other unfavorable codons has detrimental effects on cellular growth and is thought to be evolutionarily constrained. However, the small anticorrelation between d S novo and expression levels obscures the expected expression dependency of the purifying selection on codon usage in de novo evolution. To clarify this, we explored the relationship between the degree of codon optimization of each protein and the evolutionary speed of synonymous BPSs. Since this relationship is expected to be weak, it is important to evaluate the evolutionary speed of a small number of synonymous BPSs. To this end, we used a normalized version of the G score, hereinafter referred to as the G score, as an alternative to d N novo and d S novo, as detailed in the Materials and Methods. The G score is useful for screening genes with a small number of substitutions relative to neutral expectations. First, we reconfirmed the E–R anticorrelation between expression level and G score in nonsynonymous substitutions (G N, ρ = −0.15, P < 0.05) and that there was no correlation in synonymous substitutions (G S), which was consistent with the relationship between expression level and d N novo or d S novo. Next, we employed the CAI as a standard measure of the degree of codon optimization and explored the relationship between CAI and G scores. As a result, a negative correlation was found between the CAI and G score for nonsynonymous (ρ = −0.24, Fig. 4a) and synonymous (ρ = −0.11, Fig. 4b) BPSs; however, the correlation coefficient for synonymous BPSs was not strong. To confirm the looseness of the purifying selection on codon-optimized proteins in de novo evolution, we classified 10% of mutated proteins with the lowest CAI as unoptimized, 10% of mutated proteins with the highest CAI as optimized, and the remaining mutated proteins as having moderate optimality in terms of codon usage for nonsynonymous and synonymous BPSs. As expected, unoptimized proteins showed higher G S than the optimized and moderately optimized proteins (Fig. 4d). In contrast, there was no significant difference between optimized and moderately optimized proteins, indicating that the purifying selection on codon usage only weakly depends on expression levels in de novo evolution. This tendency remained even if the classification criteria for CAI changed from 10% to 5%. To confirm the looseness of the purifying selection on codon usage more directly, we focused on individual synonymous BPSs and explored codon bias. To this end, we calculated the C score for synonymous BPSs, whereby the C score represents the difference in preference of the mutant synonymous codon from neutral expectation, as detailed in the Materials and Methods. In short, the C score takes positive values if the mutant synonymous codons are used more frequently in highly expressed proteins than in neutral expectations, while it takes negative values if the mutant synonymous codons are used less frequently in highly expressed proteins than in neutral expectations. Contrary to the statistics, such as G scores or CAI, characterizing each gene, C scores are assigned to each synonymous BPS, not to each gene. In other words, each gene had as many C scores as the number of synonymous BPSs in each gene. We found that unoptimized proteins allowed for more mutant synonymous codons, which are infrequently used in highly expressed proteins than moderately optimized codons (Fig. 4e). In contrast to the other categories, the mutant synonymous codons of the optimized proteins were not able to obtain high C scores because the wild-type codons of the optimized proteins are likely to be the most frequent among the highly expressed proteins. Therefore, it is reasonable that there were no significant differences in C scores between optimized and unoptimized proteins, even though the former had a relatively larger score than the latter. Altogether, these results support that the detected purifying selection on codon usage is active but less sensitive to expression levels.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^c4817c07]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated glomerular disease — biopsy, antiretroviral therapy, adjuncts, and transplantation are summarized as follows: up to 50% of HIV-infected patients with glomerular disease may have a lesion other than classic HIVAN, and renal biopsy is recommended unless there is strong suspicion of a nonglomerular etiology of renal dysfunction, such as nephrotoxic combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) medications, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or other comorbid conditions. cART is recommended as definitive treatment for all forms of HIV-associated GN, and the rapidly progressive nature of classic HIVAN may warrant temporizing measures, such as the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and perhaps corticosteroids; observational studies suggest that a limited course of corticosteroid therapy in selected patients with rapid progression of azotemia due to HIVAN (and absence of other active infections) may help limit proteinuria and reduce the rate of progression to ESRD. Renal transplantation is feasible in selected HIV-infected patients, with selection criteria including absence of AIDS-defining diseases, CD4 count > 200 cells/µL, and undetectable viral load; patient survival and renal allograft survival are similar to non–HIV-infected patients, though there appear to be higher rejection rates, and optimal immunosuppression regimens have not yet been established.

### Adaptation is maintained by the parliament of genes [^7e9487db]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Equilibrium models

We assessed, given the potential for suppression, the extent to which a trait distorter will distort an organism trait away from the optimum for individuals. In order to elucidate the selective forces, we ask four questions in a step-wise manner, with increasing complexity:
In the absence of a suppressor, when can a trait distorter invade?
When can a costly suppressor of the trait distorter invade?
What are the overall consequences of trait distorter-suppressor dynamics for trait values, at the individual and population level, at evolutionary equilibrium and before equilibrium has been reached?
If the extent to which the trait distorter manipulates the organism trait can evolve, how will this influence the likelihood that it is suppressed, and hence the individual and population trait values?

We assume an arbitrary trait that influences organism fitness. In the absence of trait distorters, all individuals have the trait value that maximises their individual fitness. The trait distorter manipulates the trait away from the individual optimum, to increase their own transmission to offspring. We assume a large population of diploid, randomly mating individuals. The aim of this model is to establish key aspects of the population genetics governing trait distorters and their suppressors, in an abstract setting. In Supplementary Notes 3, 4 and 5, we address the same issues in three specific biological scenarios.

### Molecular evolution and the decline of purifying selection with age [^df4b1eca]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A model of gene lifespan

We are interested in how the intensity of purifying selection affects the lifespan of a gene. Here, we present a highly simplified model for how a gene's lifespan is determined. The model is not intended to capture all the biological complexities, or to represent the only plausible factor that determines a gene's lifespan. The goal here is simply to show it is plausible that genes that are expressed later in life, and so are under weaker purifying selection, will tend to have shorter lifespans than genes expressed early.

When a gene originates, it is assigned a fitness of 1. We assume that a gene is lost when the fixation of deleterious mutations by drift causes its fitness to decline below a threshold that is less than 1. The loss of fitness by deleterious mutations is partly offset by the fixation of beneficial mutations. Homozygotes for a beneficial mutation have relative fitness (1 + s), homozygotes for deleterious mutations have relative fitness (1 − s), and heterozygotes have fitness intermediate between the homozygotes. We assume that mutations have additive effects, so the fixation of a mutation simply causes the gene's fitness to increase or decrease by an increment s, depending on whether the mutation is beneficial or deleterious. A fraction α of mutations that become fixed are beneficial. The gene is lost when its fitness decreases to 1 – k s, i.e. when k more deleterious mutations than beneficial mutations have become fixed. The expected time to a gene's extinction, is related to the expected total number of substitutions, bywhereand r D are the fixation rates for beneficial and deleterious mutations.

To find, we model the evolution of fitness as a random walk. From Eq. XIV.4.12 in ref. the generating function for the probability that the gene becomes extinct after a total of n T substitutions is

We find the expected total number of substitutions before the gene becomes extinct by taking the derivative of V (s) with respect to s and then setting s = 1, which gives

When very few of the substitutions are beneficial, we see that

Substituting this result into Eq. (3) and rearranging then gives the expected time to a gene's extinction:

If we assume that the stronger purifying selection decreases the rate that deleterious mutations become fixed (r D) but has no effect on the rate that beneficial mutations become fixed (r B), then Eq. (7) shows that genes under weaker purifying selection (and therefore larger r D) will become extinct at a younger age.

CYP2C19 panel design considerations — The AMP PGx Working Group notes that allele function derived from in vitro models may not directly translate to a clinical phenotype or metabolizer status and that allele function can be substrate and/or drug concentration dependent. Because an allele may be extremely rare in the general population but more frequent in a specific ethnic population or in a phenotypically selected patient group, the inclusion of rare, but potentially clinically significant, alleles in recommended panels needs to be considered. For CYP2C19 reporting, variants are typically conveyed as star (*) allele inferred haplotypes and diplotypes.

### Effective fitness under fluctuating selection with genetic drift [^6670db2a]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of neutrality and the relative effect of selection

With the introduction ofand, we may evaluate the (effective) neutrality of a mutant subject to fluctuating selection. One simple way is to apply the classic selection coefficient cutoff offor diploids andfor haploids to | f E − 1|. However, f E is defined under a mutant frequency of 0.5 when the impact of selection on the mutant frequency is maximized. Thus, applying the same selection coefficient cutoff toand f G would have different consequences.

Another way is to define neutrality in a process-specific manner. That is, from the emergence of an allele to its fixation or loss, or any period of time in between, one can calculate the total allele frequency change caused by selection and that caused by drift (the subscript "d" stands for drift). We can estimateby subtractingfrom the total allele frequency change observed over n generations. To quantify the effect of selection on the allele frequency relative to the sum of the absolute effects of selection and drift, we define. C is positive when the selection increases the allele frequency, and negative, when it reduces the frequency. Note that C will be undefined when the denominator is 0, meaning that the relative effect of selection cannot be determined if the frequency change by selection and drift are both 0. We can set an arbitrary maximally allowed value of| such as 0.05 to call the overall behavior of the allele effectively neutral. Note that, under this definition, the samemay be classified as neutral or nonneutral, depending on the actual evolutionary process.

### Recommendations for clinical CYP2C9 genotyping allele selection: a joint recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology and college of American pathologists [^23b32a89]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2019). High credibility.

CYP2C9 genotyping approaches in United States clinical laboratories vary widely, ranging from a few targeted alleles to interrogation of the entire coding region using techniques that include targeted genotyping, bidirectional Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing, whole genome sequencing, or whole exome sequencing with or without deletion or duplication analysis. Inconsistent clinical results across laboratories may be attributed to the selection of tested CYP2C9 alleles, targeted testing of populations with varying ethnic backgrounds, and technical performance of the testing platforms, and differences can also occur postanalytically during PGx interpretation and/or reporting; addressing these issues is considered outside the scope of this series of AMP PGx recommendation documents.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

Methods

Recombination recursion

The eight haplotype frequencies following recombination are:and

Stability analysis

We first analyze this model in the infinite-population limit, neglecting both genetic drift and mutation. To do so, we numerically evolve the discrete-time frequency equations to identify each equilibrium that is polymorphic at both the plasticity and target locus (defined here as the case when minor allele frequency does not fall below 0.01), irrespective of the frequency of alleles at the recombination locus. We focus on such polymorphic equilibria because, in the absence of steady influx of mutation, recombination evolves only if balanced polymorphism is present at the two loci (i.e. LD is maintained by selection). Next, for each such equilibrium identified numerically we compute the Jacobean matrix of the deterministic system over a full period of fitness oscillations and the corresponding leading eigenvalue to determine if the equilibrium is locally stable or not.

### On the testing of Hardy-Weinberg proportions and equality of allele frequencies in males and females at biallelic genetic markers [^f14be8f2]. Genetic Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

6 DISCUSSION

It is very well‐known that an autosomal marker is expected to reach HWP in one single generation of random mating to the point that most genetic textbooks state this. We stress that this is contingent upon EAF in the sexes, and if these are different, then it does not take one but two generations to reach Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium. In the first generation, the new A allele frequency is the average of the male and female allele frequencies of the previous generation, but genotype frequencies are not in HWP. The allele frequency in the second generation will now remain unaltered, and this generation will have its genotype frequencies in the HWP. Supposing that the other usual assumptions (absence of migration, mutation, selection, etc.) are met, it may thus be more adequate to state that it will take at most two generations to reach Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium.

These alleles were not included in tier 1 because of low minor allele frequency, less well-characterized functional impact, or lack of reference materials (RMs); specifically, *4, *4B, *5, *6, *7, and *8 have frequencies < 0.5% in major ethnic groups, *9 and *10 are decreased function alleles with uncertain clinical significance, and RMs are not available for *5, *7, and *35. Because *35 was only recently characterized, there is no known RM available, it is not included among the majority of available commercial platforms, and as further information is gained and RM becomes available, it may be promoted to a tier 1 allele.

### Rh (D) incompatibility: screening [^8f079191]. USPSTF (2004). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation grades and evidence strength — the Task Force grades its recommendations according to one of 5 classifications (A, B, C, D, I) reflecting the strength of evidence and magnitude of net benefit (benefits minus harms). Grade A: The USPSTF strongly recommends that clinicians provide [the service] to eligible patients. The USPSTF found good evidence that [the service] improves important health outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harms. Grade B: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide [the service] to eligible patients. The USPSTF found at least fair evidence that [the service] improves important health outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harms. Grade C: The USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against routine provision of [the service]. The USPSTF found at least fair evidence that [the service] can improve health outcomes but concludes that the balance of benefits and harms is too close to justify a general recommendation. Grade D: The USPSTF recommends against routinely providing [the service] to asymptomatic patients. The USPSTF found at least fair evidence that [the service] is ineffective or that harms outweigh benefits. Grade I: The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routinely providing [the service]. Evidence that [the service] is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Strength of overall evidence — The USPSTF grades the quality of the overall evidence for a service on a 3-point scale (good, fair, poor): Good: Evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations that directly assess effects on health outcomes. Fair: Evidence is sufficient to determine effects on health outcomes, but the strength of the evidence is limited by the number, quality, or consistency of the individual studies, generalizability to routine practice, or indirect nature of the evidence on health outcomes. Poor: Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes because of limited number or power of studies, important flaws in their design or conduct, gaps in the chain of evidence, or lack of information on important health outcomes.

### Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology using mendelian randomisation (STROBE-MR): explanation and elaboration [^9fffaa8f]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

Providing information on the ascertainment of genotypes and their quality control will enable readers to assess the quality of the genetic variants used in the study. For two sample MR, this information will often require referring to supplementary material presented in previously published articles.

The methods section should provide a clear explanation of the selection and inclusion of specific genetic variants in the analysis. This information would include a description of genetic variants allocated to the exposure of interest and in the case of reverse MR, the genetic variants allocated to the outcome. For each variant, the rsID or base position and chromosome should be disclosed, along with clear reasoning for the variant choice and the reference panel used. The reasoning could include the evidence of association with the exposure or outcome of interest or the characteristics that qualify the specific variant to be used, such as linkage disequilibrium in the case of proxy use. The inclusion of variants in high linkage disequilibrium might not contribute additional information in estimating the causal effect, and could even lead to biased estimates of standard errors if this correlation structure is not accounted for. Authors should define the threshold used to select independent variants (eg, r 2), the reference panel, and the population under investigation. However, there are cases in which variants (although in linkage disequilibrium) from a specific gene region with biological relevance regarding the exposure of interest can also be included. In this situation, authors should describe the biological pathways in which these variants are implicated, the r 2 threshold for inclusion, and which method was used to model the correlation structure.

Studies should also provide estimates of the quality control parameters for the SNPs used in analyses. This information includes the info score (metric of imputation quality), call rate (percentage of individuals with called alleles at a particular SNP), and P value from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test (which could indicate imputation or genotyping problems, population stratification, or non-random mating).

Further information is required to chart the management of genetic variants and harmonisation of datasets in two sample MR analysis. This information includes the conditions used to identify proxy variants in the absence of the same variant being available in both datasets (eg, linkage disequilibrium threshold), the presence or absence and handling of strand alignment, and orientation of effect and non-effect alleles. Other aspects, such as temporal stability of association, population specificity, or biological plausability, could help understand the selected genetic variants' validity to be used as instrumental variables.

### Methenamine hippurate [^80365d41]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS

Methenamine hippurate tablets USP are indicated for prophylactic or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring urinary tract infections when long-term therapy is considered necessary. This drug should only be used after eradication of the infection by other appropriate antimicrobial agents.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate and other antibacterial drugs, methenamine hippurate should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Rifampin [^1913b10f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Meningococcal Carriers

Rifampin is indicated for the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. Rifampin is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection because of the possibility of the rapid emergence of resistant organisms (See WARNINGS).

Rifampin should not be used indiscriminately, and, therefore, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed for establishment of the carrier state and the correct treatment. So that the usefulness of rifampin in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers is preserved, the drug should be used only when the risk of meningococcal disease is high.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of rifampin and other antibacterial drugs, rifampin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Selection on a modifier of recombination rate due to linked deleterious mutations [^d7bf461f]. The Journal of Heredity (2002). Low credibility.

Several models have been suggested to explain the origin and maintenance of recombination. Here I present the results from computer simulations of multilocus haploid and diploid genotypes in small populations. Each chromosome consisted of 1001 loci where deleterious mutations occurred. At "equilibrium" for mutation-selection-genetic drift balance a single recombination variant was introduced to the population in the middle of a chromosome. On average 75,000 replicates for each combination of parameters were followed to fixation or loss of the modifier allele. The results show that, in a small population, increased recombination can be selected, even in the absence of epistasis or beneficial mutations. The effect of the mutation rate for deleterious mutations depends on the ploidy level and the recessiveness of deleterious mutations. A higher deleterious mutation rate is required for an increase in recombination rate to be favored in haploid populations. Increased recombination could not evolve in the case of strong associative overdominance.

### Inferring demographic and selective histories from population genomic data using a 2-step approach in species with coding-sparse genomes: an application to human data [^f99b61f7]. G3 (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Genetic variation is a fundamental concern of population genetics. Prior to the advent of next-generation sequencing, a dominant debate within the field was centered on whether levels of genetic variation were expected to be minimal or substantial (known as the classical / balanced debate; see;). Selection was assumed as the dominant process in both cases, be it purifying selection depressing levels of variation or balancing selection maintaining polymorphism. Despite molecular evidence confirming plentiful levels of genetic variation, Motoo Kimura's The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution instead posited that observed variation was largely a consequence of genetic drift, that is, of neutral alleles segregating in the process of drifting toward fixation or loss. This hypothesis — that neutral rather than selective processes can explain the majority of observed variation — has since been largely corroborated (as reviewed in).

However, quantifying the precise roles of selective and neutral processes in shaping observed levels of variation — and disentangling their individual effects — remains an ongoing challenge due to the similar manners in which multiple evolutionary processes affect patterns of variation. One notable example is the extent to which neutral population growth, background selection (BGS;), and recurrent selective sweeps can all skew the site frequency spectrum (SFS, the distribution of allele frequencies) toward rare alleles (and see review of). The effects of these processes are further modified by genomic heterogeneity in mutation and recombination rates in often complex ways. Therefore, if one wishes to quantify the strength and frequency of rare and episodic processes such as positive selection, one must first construct an evolutionarily appropriate baseline model that accounts for the effects of constantly occurring processes including genetic drift as modulated by historical population size changes, as well as the effects of purifying selection and BGS resulting from the removal of deleterious mutations, all while accounting for underlying mutation and recombination rate variation. Failure to account for these processes is likely to lead to misinference, particularly in light of the fact that many commonly studied populations and species are thought to have experienced not only population growth but also recent and severe population bottlenecks [e.g. humans, nonhuman primates, and Drosophila melanogaster, as well as a variety of human pathogens], a demographic history that is itself often strongly confounded with selective sweeps.

### New insights on the evolution of the SMN1 and SMN2 region: simulation and meta-analysis for allele and haplotype frequency calculations [^26fa3017]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

Most spinal muscular atrophy patients lack both copies of SMN1. Loss of SMN1 ('0-copy alleles') can occur by gene deletion or SMN1-to-SMN2 gene conversion. Despite worldwide efforts to map the segmental duplications within the SMN region, most assemblies do not correctly delineate these genes. A near pericentromeric location provides impetus for the strong evidence that SMN1 and SMN2 arose from a primate-specific paralogous gene duplication. Here we meta-analyzed our recent laboratory results together with available published data, in order to calculate new mutation rates and allele/haplotype frequencies in this recalcitrant and highly unstable region of the human genome. Based on our tested assumption of compliance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we conclude that the SMN1 allele frequencies are: '0-copy disease alleles', 0.013; '1-copy normal alleles', 0.95; '2-copy normal alleles (ie, two copies of SMN1 on one chromosome)', 0.038; and '1(D) disease alleles (SMN1 with a small intragenic mutation)', 0.00024. The SMN1 haplotype ['(SMN1 copy number)-(SMN2 copy number)'] frequencies are: '0–0', 0.00048; '0–1', 0.0086; '0–2', 0.0042; '1–0', 0.27; '1–1', 0.66; '1–2', 0.015; '2–0', 0.027; and '2–1', 0.012. Paternal and maternal de novo mutation rates are 2.1 x 10(-4) and 4.2 x 10(-5), respectively. Our data provide the basis for the most accurate genetic risk calculations, as well as new insights on the evolution of the SMN region, with evidence that nucleotide position 840 (where a transition 840C > T functionally distinguishes SMN2 from SMN1) constitutes a mutation hotspot. Our data also suggest selection of the 1–1 haplotype and the presence of rare chromosomes with three copies of SMN1.

### Estimating the strength of selection for new SARS-CoV-2 variants [^9bb6cec1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic becomes increasingly challenging as the virus adapts to human hosts through the continual emergence of more transmissible variants. Simply observing that a variant is increasing in frequency is relatively straightforward, but more sophisticated methodology is needed to determine whether a new variant is a global threat and the magnitude of its selective advantage. We present two models for quantifying the strength of selection for new and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the background of contemporaneous variants. These methods range from a detailed model of dynamics within one country to a broad analysis across all countries, and they include alternative explanations such as migration and drift. We find evidence for strong selection favoring the D614G spike mutation and B.1.1.7 (Alpha), weaker selection favoring B.1.351 (Beta), and no advantage of R.1 after it spreads beyond Japan. Cutting back data to earlier time horizons reveals that uncertainty is large very soon after emergence, but that estimates of selection stabilize after several weeks. Our results also show substantial heterogeneity among countries, demonstrating the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

### Recommendations for clinical CYP2C19 genotyping allele selection: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^3ffa8d4d]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2018). Medium credibility.

Standardized clinical PGx panels — Defining key attributes of PGx alleles for clinical testing and a minimum set of variants for PGx genotyping is described as analogous to cystic fibrosis carrier screening by professional societies using a panel of 25 CFTR pathogenic variants, later revised to 23. The document states there is a practical need for standardizing clinical PGx assays, proposes that variants and alleles for each gene could be selected using criteria such as population frequency, level of supporting evidence for phenotypic outcome, clinical utility, and severity of adverse drug reaction or loss of efficacy, and notes that standardized panels could enable stakeholders to understand results and assure a minimum set of clinically relevant PGx variant alleles. It adds that laboratories could add additional variants while commercial assays and laboratory-developed tests would theoretically contain a consistent minimum set of variants, and that evidence-based recommendations developed by professional organizations often form the basis for future laboratory accreditation requirements.

### A genome-wide study of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with next generation sequence data [^330ecdfd]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Hardy–Weinberg law is a fundamental population-genetic principle expressing that the genotypes AA, AB and BB of a bi-allelic genetic marker are expected to occur with relative frequencies, 2 pq and, p and q being the A and B allele frequencies, respectively. The law rests on many assumptions including sexual reproduction with random mating, non-overlapping generations, negligible mutation and migration rates, equality of allele frequencies in the sexes, absence of natural selection and absence of genotyping errors, which are usually discussed at length in genetic textbooks (Crow and Kimura; Hartl). In this paper, we tacitly assume that most assumptions are at least approximately met, and mainly focus on genotyping problems as a potential source for deviation from equilibrium.

In modern large-scale genotyping studies, genetic markers are typically tested for Hardy–Weinberg proportions (HWP) by using exact test procedures (Wigginton et al.). Next generation sequencing (NGS) data are especially prone to genotyping error when relying on low-coverage sequencing (Nielsen et al.). Genotyping error is a common cause for disequilibrium, and by testing markers for HWP, problematic markers can be identified (Gomes et al; Hosking et al; Leal; Teo et al.). In many genotyping studies, markers are filtered on the basis of their p value in a HW test prior to subsequent analysis, with the idea to create high-quality data-sets from which (hopefully) most genotyping error has been removed. We think it is important to understand and identify the causes of disequilibrium, rather than merely discarding the significant results. Hence, we evaluated variants by also taking into account their genomic context, position, pertinence to a region with repetitive DNA, read depth and other factors. Plotting HW test results against the chromosomal position helped us identify genomic regions where variants with significant disequilibrium were clustered and thus enabled us to systematically investigate the cause(s) of disequilibrium. The structure of this article is as follows. First, we give a brief description of the database used and summarize exact tests for HWP for the autosomes and the sex chromosomes. Second, the Results section reports on global results, and contains subsections that focus on particular areas with an exceptional rate of HWD. Finally, discussion and conclusions complete the paper.

### Consideration of disease penetrance in the selection of secondary findings gene-disease pairs: a policy statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^32c522e2]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Genetic terminology — definitions and evolving usage of penetrance and expressivity note that Genetics in Medicine defines penetrance as "the probability that an allele or alleles will have any phenotypic expression at all" and expressivity as "the severity of expression of that phenotype among individuals with the same disease-causing genotype", yet their understanding and use are described as inconsistent and sometimes interchangeable; historically, "Penetrance" and "expressivity" were originally coined by Oskar Vogt in 1926, and Ott later defined penetrance as "the conditional probability R(x) that an individual with a given genotype x expresses the phenotype x as measured within a pedigree; this definition remains the standard"; the page adds that rapid accumulation of sequencing data "has even further blurred these definitions", enabling genotype-first cohorts and calculation of "population-based" penetrance, while the same term is used for both gene-disease relationships and individual variants, leaving a tension between allele-level concepts in family data and gene-level properties in population data.

### Temporal challenges in detecting balancing selection from population genomic data [^25bd7e61]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

A number of caveats are worth mentioning. Given that the strength of selection acting upon the balanced mutation was logically modeled as depending on its frequency in the population, the initial partial sweep phase of the trajectory was characterized by extremely strong selection, which naturally will only improve identifiability. Secondly, we generally assumed an equilibrium balanced mutation frequency of f eq = 0.5. However, we observed that inference power was affected when this assumption was relaxed (Supplementary Figs. 28 and 29), and that the effect on inference power was dependent on the extent to which the equilibrium frequency deviated from 0.5. Thus, as with the above, this assumption likely only serves to maximize statistical power. Furthermore, we maintained the common assumption of h = 0.5, though the selective sweep dynamics of recessive and dominant mutations, and the impact on identifiability, have been well explored. Finally, negative frequency-dependent selection was chosen in this study as an illustrative example, though one might also have chosen to model heterozygote advantage as others have done (e.g.), or a model in which two balanced alleles interact in an additive manner (e.g.). Here the focus was centered upon inference conditional on the balanced mutation establishing and reaching equilibrium frequency, with the stochastic loss simulations presented to emphasize that such establishment is naturally a low probability event.

Thus, at present, it remains difficult to clearly answer the central question of the classical / balanced debate: How much genetic variation is being maintained by balancing selection in natural populations? This study illustrates many of the challenges of balancing selection inference in humans, in many ways the most well-characterized study system in this debate. Specifically, by modeling an evolutionary baseline model consisting of a realistic distribution of fitness effects, population history, and underlying mutation and recombination rate variation — as has been recommended when performing such genomic scans — we primarily found power to detect relatively ancient, stably, and strongly balanced variants. Crucially however, even though we may not have the desirable level of resolution to address this important evolutionary question, this type of modeling and performance analysis at least quantifies identifiability and enables a reasonable description of expected false-positive rates, thereby reducing the risk of unfounded claims.

### Dynamical trade-offs arise from antagonistic coevolution and decrease intraspecific diversity [^b4bf64d0]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Modeling prey and predator coevolution

We implement a minimal representation of the prey type X i by a growth-defense trade-off. The prey trait is defined by a variable g i ∈ (0, 1). A prey with g i = 1 has a maximal growth rate and minimal defense. Similarly, g i = 0 corresponds to a prey type with minimal growth rate and maximal defense. New prey types with different g i are introduced by de novo mutations. Without predator, the prey dynamics is captured by birth without (Eq. (3a)) or with mutation (Eq. (3b)), death arising from resource competition (Eq. (3c)), and intrinsic death (Eq. (3d)). Each event occurs with a type-specific rate indicated by the symbols above the arrows, Here, i, l = 1, 2. n, denote different prey types and n is the total number of prey types. In our model, n is not fixed. It increases by new prey types (arising from de novo mutation) and decreases by the loss of prey types (extinction). The parameters b x, d x, r c and μ x are kept constant and are identical for all prey types. The reproduction rate of a prey type X i is its individual growth-defense trade-off parameter g i multiplied by the common prey birth rate b x. Thus, a larger g i implies a higher reproduction rate. A new random type X j occurs with a (small) probability μ x during the reproduction of a type X i. This new type is defined by its own growth-defense trade-off parameter g j, which is drawn from a uniform distribution with values between 0 and 1 (see a discussion of normally distributed mutations in Supplementary Note 2). Prey individuals compete for a common resource, and the strength of resource competition is indicated by r c. Note that X l refers to any prey type currently present in the population, thus here the resource competition of prey within and between types is the same. A homogenous prey population without predation grows logistically in our model. The prey population persists and fluctuates around its carrying capacity if its population size is large enough to avoid extinction due to stochastic effects. A large r c refers to stronger resource competition and a lower carrying capacity. Furthermore, in the absence of predation pressure, prey types with higher reproduction rates have a fitness advantage. Consequently, in isolation, the prey population evolves towards g = 1, where also the equilibrium population size is largest.

### Is thrombectomy indicated in all ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion? [^bec7996c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Purpose of this topical review is to examine the current randomized and nonrandomized evidence evaluating endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in selected patient populations with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusions.

Recent Findings

After establishing EVT as the first-line treatment in patients with large vessel occlusions and limited ischemic changes on neuroimaging, recent trials successfully demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with large core strokes and those with basilar occlusions up to 24h of last known well. Nonrandomized evidence in patients with mild stroke severity, baseline disability, medium and distal vessel occlusions and time from last known well > 24h also suggested potential benefit of EVT in selected patients. Further randomized evidence will help establish EVT efficacy and safety in these populations.

Summary

EVT is established as the de-facto treatment of choice in a significant proportion of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion and has shown potential benefits in additional patient subgroups. A rigorous risk-benefit assessment and discussions with patients and their families in the absence of randomized evidence should help facilitate an informed, individualized decision-making process for this revolutionary treatment in peripheral patient subgroups with limited evidence.

### Llevofloxacin (levofloxacin) [^07b7b3ab]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.15 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of levofloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, levofloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Culture and Susceptibility Testing

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therapy with levofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be selected.

As with other drugs in this class, some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with levofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information about the continued susceptibility of the pathogens to the antimicrobial agent and also the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.

### Recommendations for clinical warfarin genotyping allele selection: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology and the college of American pathologists [^519218fa]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2020). High credibility.

Materials and methods for allele selection — The AMP PGx Working Group evaluated genes that have previously been reported to impact warfarin sensitivity and/or response and considered genes known to be clinically tested and those described in the literature. Variants/alleles within selected genes were categorized using three equally weighted criteria: i) the allele/variant is well characterized and known to be functionally significant, leading to an alteration in a drug response phenotype, ii) presence at an appreciable allele frequency in at least one population, and iii) reference materials are publicly available; variants/alleles meeting all three criteria were included in tier 1, whereas those meeting at least one but not all three were considered for inclusion in tier 2. Allele function information was derived from literature searches and the CPIC/PharmGKB Allele Function Tables, population frequency information was cited from the 1000 Genomes Project, Genome Aggregation Database, and the CPIC/PharmGKB Frequency Tables, and data from the Get-RM project were queried to identify reference materials. To identify alleles that may be commonly tested, a list from commercially available platforms was generated using data from manufacturer websites (Table 2).

### Recommendations for clinical CYP2C9 genotyping allele selection: a joint recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology and college of American pathologists [^0f70b901]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2019). High credibility.

CYP2C9 genotyping — Tier 1 alleles and ancestry-specific coverage: The AMP PGx Working Group includes CYP2C9 *2, *3, *5, *6, *8, and *11 as Tier 1 alleles, and the two most common variants *2 and *3 account for 98% to 100% of currently defined decreased-function variation in European, Middle Eastern, and Asian populations but only approximately 25% in populations with African ancestry; therefore, testing only *2 and *3 will not detect most decreased-activity variation in African ancestry, where *5, *6, *8, and *11 have a combined frequency of approximately 10% and account for approximately 75% of currently defined variation, while in European and Asian populations these alleles have frequencies < 0.4% and account for < 3% of currently defined variation.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in obesity without diabetes [^bc3f58bf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SELECT was published by A Michael Lincoff and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SELECT study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with preexisting CVD and overweight or obesity but without diabetes? In the SELECT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SELECT study, the population was: 17604 patients (4872 female, 12732 male). The inclusion criteria were patients, aged ≥ 45 years, with preexisting CVD and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² but no history of diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris; TIA within the past 60 days prior to the day of screening; history of T1DM or T2DM; history or presence of chronic pancreatitis. In the SELECT study, the interventions were: n = 8803 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly, then titrated every 4 weeks (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg, and 2.4 mg) to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16) n = 8801 placebo (matching placebo once weekly). In the SELECT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.5% vs. 8%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9). In the SELECT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (2.5% vs. 3%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01) Significant decrease in first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization or an urgent medical visit for HF (3.4% vs. 4.1%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96) Significant decrease in death from any cause (4.3% vs. 5.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93). In the SELECT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious gastrointestinal disorders. significant differences in serious adverse events (33.4% vs. 36.4%), adverse event leading to discontinuation of trial drug (16.6% vs. 8.2%). In the SELECT study, the conclusion was: in patients, aged ≥ 45 years, with preexisting CVD and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² but no history of diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Recommendations for clinical CYP2C19 genotyping allele selection: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^ed708603]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2018). Medium credibility.

CYP2C19 genotyping allele selection — Association for Molecular Pathology Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Working Group outlines recommendations for clinical cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genotyping panels, stating the aim is to recommend variants for inclusion in clinical pharmacogenomic testing panels and to define key attributes of alleles and a minimum set of variants for clinical PGx genotyping assays. The recommendations include a minimum panel of variant alleles (tier 1) and an extended panel (tier 2) to aid clinical laboratories when designing PGx assays, developed with consideration of variant allele frequencies across populations and ethnicities, availability of reference materials, and other technical factors. The document notes these CYP2C19 recommendations are the first in a series for PGx testing, are intended to inform clinical laboratory professionals when designing and validating clinical panels, and are not to be interpreted as restrictive but as a helpful guide.

### Polymorphism and the red queen: the selective maintenance of allelic variation in a deteriorating environment [^cab9e3af]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

A consideration of the requirement for a new mutation to invade an existing n -allele polymorphism explains this prediction. Invasion requires that the marginal fitness of the new mutation be greater than the population's mean fitness, and the former is most dependent on the n viabilities of the heterozygotes containing the mutation. The viability of the homozygous mutation is almost irrelevant due to the rarity of this phenogenotype. Mutations that have higher heterozygous viabilities are more likely to invade, thereby generating populations exhibiting heterozygote advantage. Hence, the paucity of good examples of heterozygote advantage in real populations is surprising and is poorly explained by our (and others') models. We take from this mismatch that the phenomenon of heterozygote advantage cannot arise at all easily in natural populations. It is so readily conserved by selection that any de novo cases must be exceptionally rare.
