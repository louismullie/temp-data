## Question

What causes pernicious anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes pernicious anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition of pernicious anemia and its immediate mechanism of B12 malabsorption. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology, particularly the role of autoimmune gastritis and loss of intrinsic factor. Next, I will review the genetic and autoimmune associations that corroborate an autoimmune etiology. After that, I need to consider other, less common pathways that can mimic the same biochemical picture. Finally, I should integrate epidemiology and malignant risk to ensure the causal framework is clinically complete and reference-supported.

> Let me first confirm the definition so we don't build on a shaky premise. Pernicious anemia is a megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency that results from impaired absorption because the stomach lacks intrinsic factor, the glycoprotein secreted by parietal cells that binds B12 and enables ileal uptake; in other words, the proximate cause is intrinsic factor deficiency leading to B12 malabsorption, not dietary lack per se [^116Gk4ut] [^115vZGKK].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate mechanistic step. The critical failure is the absence or severe reduction of intrinsic factor, so ingested cobalamin cannot form the IF–B12 complex and cannot be reclaimed in the terminal ileum; this is why bypassing the gut with parenteral or high-dose oral therapy works despite the absorption defect [^114kxGmb] [^117GNVxZ].

> Now, what drives the loss of intrinsic factor? I need to ensure we emphasize the primary pathophysiology. The overwhelming cause is autoimmune gastritis with immune-mediated destruction of oxyntic (parietal) cells and autoantibodies directed at the parietal cell H+/K+-ATPase and, in many cases, at intrinsic factor; this produces achlorhydria, hypergastrinemia, and loss of intrinsic factor, culminating in pernicious anemia [^114kxGmb] [^116jrUaY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without corroborating autoimmune evidence. I will now examine serologic and clinical association data. Intrinsic factor antibodies are highly specific though not very sensitive, while parietal cell antibodies are more sensitive but less specific; in biopsy-proven autoimmune body gastritis, IF antibodies were 100% specific but detected in only about a quarter to a third of cases, whereas parietal cell antibodies were present in roughly four-fifths of cases; combining them improves sensitivity, which supports an autoimmune mechanism in pernicious anemia cohorts [^112dcQUW]. I should also confirm that pernicious anemia commonly coexists with other autoimmune diseases, reinforcing a shared autoimmunity substrate; large biobank analyses show a markedly higher prevalence of other autoimmune diagnoses in pernicious anemia compared with controls, again supporting autoimmune causation [^112SeAVh].

> Wait, I need to check guideline nuances on antibody testing because I almost overstated the role of parietal cell antibodies in diagnosing pernicious anemia. Initially, I was going to say PCAs should be sent routinely for diagnosing pernicious anemia, but the BSH guidance specifically recommends obtaining anti–intrinsic factor antibodies when evaluating B12 deficiency for pernicious anemia, and cautions that a negative IFA does not exclude antibody-negative pernicious anemia; at the same time, it advises against using anti–gastric parietal cell antibodies for the diagnosis of pernicious anemia per se, even though they may suggest autoimmune gastritis in the right context; so I should correct that and center diagnostic inference on IFA plus the clinical picture and, when needed, gastric evaluation [^112yFs6M] [^115GowHv] [^1173YVWV]. Separately, when histology is compatible with autoimmune gastritis, the AGA suggests considering both anti-parietal cell and anti–intrinsic factor antibodies to support the autoimmune gastritis diagnosis, which aligns with using PCA to support AIG rather than to define PA itself [^116jrUaY].

> Let me consider genetic predisposition to ensure the causal chain is biologically plausible. GWAS meta-analyses identify several risk loci for pernicious anemia in immune-regulatory regions, including HLA, PTPN22, CTLA4, and others, consistent with an autoimmune pathogenesis and with the observed clustering of autoimmune diagnoses in cases across biobanks; this genomic signal strengthens the inference that pernicious anemia is primarily an autoimmune disease targeting the oxyntic mucosa and intrinsic factor pathway [^116XtvBV] [^112SeAVh].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture looks the same without autoimmunity? I should review alternative mechanisms that can produce B12 malabsorption with absent or ineffective intrinsic factor. Rarely, congenital intrinsic factor deficiency causes the same absorption failure, and surgical loss of parietal cell mass, as with partial or total gastrectomy, can do the same; additionally, chronic Helicobacter pylori–related corpus atrophy or post-infectious autoimmunity may converge on a similar phenotype, although by convention many clinicians reserve the term pernicious anemia for autoimmune intrinsic factor deficiency; I need to emphasize that these conditions are important differentials in B12 deficiency but are etiologically distinct unless an autoimmune IF mechanism is demonstrated [^115kgtQA] [^116Gk4ut] [^1169fcVD] [^115vZGKK].

> I should double-check epidemiology and associated autoimmune conditions to ensure clinical context is accurate. Prevalence estimates suggest roughly 0.1% in the general population, rising to over 2% in older adults, with frequent co-occurrence of autoimmune thyroid disease, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetes; large-scale biobank data confirm that pernicious anemia cases have substantially higher rates of other autoimmune diagnoses than controls, consistent with a shared autoimmune diathesis [^113Jo9HV] [^112SeAVh].

> Next, I should review downstream implications that circle back to the pathogenesis. Autoimmune oxyntic loss leads to achlorhydria and hypergastrinemia, which drive enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increase the risk of type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors, and there is also an elevated risk of noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma; these malignant risks derive from the same autoimmune gastritis that causes intrinsic factor loss, which is why guidelines recommend targeted endoscopic assessment in pernicious anemia, particularly in older patients or those with confirmed atrophic gastritis and positive antibodies [^112cHKpE] [^117GnWEH] [^112HwH2U] [^1165B7au].

> Let me synthesize the cause hierarchy clearly, and I need to ensure I am not oversimplifying. The primary cause in the vast majority of cases is autoimmune gastritis with immune-mediated destruction of parietal cells and autoantibodies to intrinsic factor and the parietal cell proton pump; this causes intrinsic factor deficiency, impairs ileal cobalamin absorption, and culminates in megaloblastic anemia and neurologic sequelae; less commonly, congenital IF deficiency, postsurgical loss of parietal cells, or severe corpus-predominant atrophy from infectious or post-infectious pathways can produce the same absorption defect, though the label "pernicious anemia" is most appropriately applied to the autoimmune IF-deficient form [^114kxGmb] [^112dcQUW] [^115kgtQA] [^116Gk4ut].

> Bottom line, after checking each link in the chain: pernicious anemia is caused by autoimmune gastritis leading to loss of intrinsic factor and consequent failure of vitamin B12 absorption; genetic and clinical co-associations corroborate autoimmunity as the core driver, with rare non-autoimmune scenarios mimicking the phenotype but differing in etiology unless intrinsic factor autoimmunity is shown [^114kxGmb] [^116XtvBV] [^112SeAVh] [^115vZGKK].

Pernicious anemia is caused by **autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells** [^114kxGmb], leading to intrinsic factor deficiency and impaired vitamin B12 absorption [^116jrUaY]. The autoimmune process involves **autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cell H+/K+ ATPase** [^112UVeuk] [^114kxGmb], resulting in chronic atrophic gastritis, hypochlorhydria, and B12 malabsorption [^115vZGKK]. Genetic predisposition (HLA-DR, PTPN22, IL2RA, AIRE) and association with other autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo) are common [^116XtvBV] [^112SeAVh]. Rarely, congenital intrinsic factor deficiency [^115kgtQA] or gastric surgery can cause similar B12 malabsorption [^116Gk4ut].

---

## Autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells

Autoimmune gastritis causes **parietal cell destruction**, leading to atrophy and loss of intrinsic factor [^115vZGKK] [^116jrUaY]. The resulting **intrinsic factor deficiency** prevents B12 absorption in the terminal ileum, leading to deficiency and megaloblastic anemia [^114kxGmb] [^111vhXmQ].

---

## Autoantibodies involved in pernicious anemia

**Intrinsic factor antibodies** are highly specific for pernicious anemia and directly impair B12 absorption [^112dcQUW] [^112yFs6M], whereas **parietal cell antibodies** target the H+/K+ ATPase and are common but less specific, reflecting autoimmune gastritis [^112UVeuk] [^116jrUaY].

---

## Genetic predisposition and autoimmune associations

Genetic factors such as **HLA-DR, PTPN22, IL2RA, and AIRE** variants increase risk [^116XtvBV] [^112SeAVh]. Autoimmune associations include frequent coexistence with **autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo** [^112SeAVh] [^113U32Pd].

---

## Rare non-autoimmune causes

**Congenital intrinsic factor deficiency** is a rare genetic cause of B12 malabsorption [^115kgtQA]. **Gastric surgery** (gastrectomy or bypass) can reduce intrinsic factor and cause B12 deficiency [^116Gk4ut].

---

Pernicious anemia is primarily due to **autoimmune destruction of parietal cells** [^114kxGmb], causing intrinsic factor deficiency and B12 malabsorption, with contributions from autoantibodies, genetic predisposition, and associated autoimmune diseases; rare non-autoimmune causes include congenital intrinsic factor deficiency and gastric surgery [^116nPgmK] [^114J8Dw3].

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^114J8Dw3]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

B12 deficiency anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency, also known as pernicious anemia, is characterized by impaired B12 uptake caused by lack of intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein produced by epithelial cells of the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor normally binds B12 and facilitates absorption in the intestinal tract. Pernicious anemia is often caused by autoimmune damage to the stomach lining (autoimmune gastritis), in which case the gastric epithelial lining is damaged or destroyed. The prevalence of pernicious anemia is around 0.1% in populations of European ancestry; however, it is more common in older people (approximately 2% in individuals over 60 years old) and is believed to be less prevalent in Asian populations. Symptoms of pernicious anemia range from fatigue to megaloblastic anemia and neurological abnormalities such as peripheral numbness, paresthesia, and ataxia in more serious cases.

Pernicious anemia is a complex disease with familial clustering, a clear autoimmune basis, and a higher incidence of other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid conditions, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetes in both patients with pernicious anemia and their relatives. Previous studies have identified genetic variants affecting vitamin B12 levels in the general population or associated with gastric parietal cell autoantibody positivity in type 1 diabetes patients, but it is not known whether these associate with pernicious anemia as well. Although studies focusing on HLA serotypes have been conducted for pernicious anemia, the results have been conflicting, and currently there is no clear consensus.

### Cyanocobalamin [^116Gk4ut]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to malabsorption, which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian (pernicious) anemia, gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery (including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and total or partial gastrectomy), fish tapeworm infestation, malignancy of the pancreas or bowel, and folic acid deficiency.

It may be possible to treat the underlying conditions through surgical correction of anatomical lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of a fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption [see Drug Interactions], adherence to a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue cases, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue cases. These measures may eliminate the necessity for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

- **Requirements of vitamin B12 in excess of normal**: Conditions such as pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, and hepatic and renal diseases can usually be managed with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP, is also suitable for the vitamin B12 absorption test (Schilling test).

### Autoimmune atrophic gastritis: Pathogenesis, pathology and management [^114kxGmb]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis is a chronic, progressive inflammatory condition that leads to the replacement of the parietal cell mass with atrophic and metaplastic mucosa. A complex interaction of autoantibodies against the parietal cell proton pump and sensitized T cells progressively destroy the parietal cells, inducing hypochlorhydria and then achlorhydria. Additionally, autoantibodies against the intrinsic factor impair the absorption of vitamin B₁₂. The resulting cobalamin deficiency manifests with megaloblastic anemia and neurological and systemic signs and symptoms collectively known as pernicious anemia.

Previously believed to predominantly affect elderly women of Northern European ancestry, autoimmune gastritis is now recognized in all populations and ethnic groups. However, because of the complexity of the diagnosis, no reliable prevalence data are available. For similar reasons, combined with the frequent and often unknown overlap with Helicobacter pylori infection, the risk of gastric cancer has not been adequately assessed in these patients.

This review summarizes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathological aspects of autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis. We also provide practical advice for the diagnosis and management of patients with this disease.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^116dgyWd]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

In our genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, we identified five genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸) associations on 1p13.2 (lead signal rs6679677, p = 1.91 × 10⁻²⁴), 2p16.1 (rs12616502, p = 3.14 × 10⁻⁸), 6p21.32 (rs28414666, p = 1.40 × 10⁻¹⁶), 10p15.1 (rs2476491, p = 1.90 × 10⁻⁸), and 21q22.3 (rs74203920, p = 2.33 × 10⁻⁹). These associations had similar effect estimates across all analyzed cohorts, with effect heterogeneity measured using Cochran's test (p values ranging from 0.05 to 0.83), except for the lead variant on chromosome 2, which was absent in the Finnish data.

- **GWAS and candidate gene mapping**: The study presented key findings including the summary of GWAS meta-analysis results for pernicious anemia, with positions according to GRCh37. Results included a Manhattan and QQ plot where p values from inverse variance fixed effect meta-analysis were displayed, and a gray dashed line represented the genome-wide significance threshold to account for multiple testing (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸). Additionally, a forest plot of effect estimates for lead variants associated with pernicious anemia was provided. Data were presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (error bars) for all included cohorts and meta-analysis where the sample sizes included N meta = 661,682, N EstBB = 138,585, N UKBB = 390,780, and N FinnGen = 132,317. The size of the dot in the forest plot is proportional to the effective sample size, calculated as 4/((1/N cases)+(1/N controls)). Pernicious anemia is defined as ICD10 code D51.0 in EstBB and UKBB, and as D51 (vitamin B12 deficiency anemia) in FinnGen.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations in primary immune disorders [^115TfvfB]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The gastrointestinal tract is the largest lymphoid organ in the body, containing T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Despite the fact that these cells are constantly confronted with antigens, primarily in the form of food and bacteria, immune responses in the gut are tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis. Without this balance of active immunity and tolerance, mucosal inflammation may ensue and manifest as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pernicious anemia, or celiac sprue. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that inflammatory diseases of the gut are commonly encountered in patients with primary immune deficiencies.

The exact pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases in the setting of primary immunodeficiency remains unknown. However, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity appear to play a role in preventing intestinal inflammation. Patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal disease and/or failure to respond to conventional therapy should be evaluated for an underlying primary immune disorder. This evaluation is crucial to initiate appropriate treatment, such as immunoglobulin or, in more severe cases, bone marrow transplantation, to prevent long-term complications.

### Cancer risk after pernicious anemia in the US elderly population [^117GnWEH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Pernicious anemia, resulting from autoimmune gastritis, is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, affecting 2% to 5% of the elderly population. While treatment with vitamin B12 cures the anemia, it does not address the underlying gastritis. Findings from smaller studies have indicated that patients with pernicious anemia may have an increased risk of cancer.

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based, case-control study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. This involved comparing 1,138,390 cancer cases (ages 66–99 years) with 100,000 matched controls without cancer. Individuals with pernicious anemia were identified based on their medical claims within the year before they were selected for the study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression, with models adjusted for sex, age, and calendar year of diagnosis and selection.

- **Results**: Compared to controls, individuals with pernicious anemia were found to have an increased risk for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.94–2.45) and gastric carcinoid tumors (OR, 11.43; 95% CI, 8.90–14.69). Additionally, there was an increased risk for developing tonsillar cancer (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.40–2.85), hypopharyngeal cancer (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.35–2.73), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.76–2.55), small intestinal cancer (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.32–2.02), liver cancer (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.28–1.73), myeloma (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.37–1.75), and acute myeloid leukemia (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.46–1).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^115GowHv]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically in the evaluation for pernicious anemia, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining anti-intrinsic factor antibodies to identify the probable concurrence of pernicious anemia in patients with T2DM and low serum cobalamin. However, a negative antibody test does not exclude the presence of antibody-negative pernicious anemia.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112yFs6M]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in evaluating pernicious anemia, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. This is to identify early or latent presentations of pernicious anemia in patients with a low serum cobalamin level, in the absence of anemia and food malabsorption or other causes of deficiency.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency — an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We present an update on diagnosing and treating vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency, such as the elderly and those with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis, followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons of the different tests, mainly aiming at the evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa, are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed, efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 months or by a daily dose of 1 mg of vitamin B12.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^1174Phx4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is an important condition with both benign and malignant complications. Unfortunately, delays in diagnosis are common due to its indolent course and often subtle clinical presentation, particularly in the early stages. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of optimal practices related to diagnosis and management to reduce the likelihood of poor outcomes.

### The frequency of gallbladder stones in patients with pernicious anemia [^115GXNS6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Ineffective erythropoiesis and intramedullary hemolysis are two important results of pernicious anemia. Hemolysis is one of the risk factors in the formation of gallbladder stones.

- **Patients and methods**: The frequency of gallstones was investigated in 59 patients with pernicious anemia and in 54 healthy subjects.

- **Results**: Nineteen (32.2%) patients in the pernicious anemia group and three (5.5%) patients in the control group were found to have gallstones. Pernicious anemia patients with and without gallbladder stones were also compared for mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase, and vitamin B12 levels, but no statistically significant difference was encountered.

- **Conclusion**: Apart from other risk factors, pernicious anemia itself increases the frequency of gallbladder stones. If patients with pernicious anemia develop upper-abdominal pain or other symptoms related to biliary tract disease, a high index of suspicion for gallstone-related disease should be maintained.

### Pernicious anemia presenting as catatonia: Correlating vitamin B12 levels and catatonic symptoms [^111YFxQM]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Pernicious anemia has been associated with various psychiatric manifestations, such as depression, mania, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms can sometimes occur without hematological and neurological abnormalities and can be prodromal indicators of vitamin B12 deficiency. We report a case of autoimmune B12 deficiency presenting as catatonia without signs of anemia or macrocytosis, in which a correlation was found between the patient's B12 blood levels and catatonic symptoms over time. This catatonic episode was successfully treated with only lorazepam and adequate doses of cyanocobalamin.

### Autoimmune gastritis [^115vZGKK]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AG) is a corpus-restricted chronic atrophic gastritis associated with intrinsic factor deficiency, either with or without pernicious anemia. Autoimmune gastritis is a microscopic disease because patients present with no or vague symptoms, and clinicians rarely find endoscopic changes. It only becomes a clinical disease when pathologists diagnose it in gastric biopsies performed for a variety of clinical indications. Unfamiliarity with this disease can result in the misdiagnosis of patients, leading to inadequate patient management.

- **Objective**: To review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, sequelae, and surveillance recommendations for AG.

- **Data sources**: The sources of the study include a review of the pertinent literature for AG.

- **Conclusions**: Autoimmune gastritis is an important disease characterized by a loss of oxyntic mucosa and the presence of metaplastic epithelium and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. Awareness and proper diagnosis are critical to prevent mismanagement of patients.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^112QpDbi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

There are no randomized controlled studies evaluating the benefit of endoscopic surveillance or the ideal surveillance intervals/methods in autoimmune gastritis (AIG) for the purpose of earlier detection of neoplasia, such as dysplasia and cancer. Instead, observational data demonstrating a significantly increased risk of gastric neoplasia associated with AIG and pernicious anemia (PA) provide the clinical rationale for performing endoscopic surveillance. Several international societies provide clinical guidance on screening, diagnosis, and management of chronic atrophic gastritis, often within guidelines for other gastric (pre)neoplasia.

- **Endoscopy**: Because of the malignancy risk, endoscopic surveillance should be considered or is recommended according to international society guidelines — namely, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), a consensus statement by multiple Italian societies for gastroenterology, endoscopy, and internal medicine, and the Kyoto Consensus Report. However, the optimal interval for surveillance is not established, with most generally recommending every 3–5 years and potentially shorter intervals depending on additional risk factors for gastric cancer, including family history. Guidance varies with respect to surveillance in patients with AG/GIM due to AIG specifically, with some suggesting surveillance every 3–5 years and others, namely US societies, advocating determination of intervals according to individual risk factors.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115fQhob]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The anemia of AIG (with or without PA) may be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, with macrocytic being the classic association (Figure 3). Anemia is common in AIG, with a prevalence around 50% depending on the study, with the most frequent etiologies being iron and vitamin B12 deficiency. Gastric acid is important for enzyme activation and the liberation of micronutrients from dietary sources. It also plays a crucial role in the reduction and absorption of iron. As previously described, vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with AIG may be attributed to parietal cell loss and autoantibodies targeting intrinsic factor (IF). IF is responsible for binding vitamin B12 and facilitating its uptake in the terminal ileum. Iron stores are depleted more quickly than vitamin B12 stores, thus iron deficiency anemia is often an early manifestation of AIG.

While the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia often prompts an AIG workup, it should be equally appreciated that vitamin B12 deficiency has a broad differential, and more common causes should be evaluated in patients. The diagnosis of anemia may also be confounded by other underlying diseases, such as hypothyroidism. One multi-center study of 654 consecutive AIG patients, nearly 50% of whom had anemia, demonstrated that certain patient characteristics were associated with patterns of anemia. PA was more common in males and older patients, whereas iron deficiency anemia was more common in females and younger patients. Iron deficiency was present in those both with and without anemia. These findings were similar to another cohort study.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115vqjmX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is most often asymptomatic. When present, symptoms are usually nonspecific, with patients most commonly reporting dyspepsia, especially post-prandial distress. One retrospective cohort analysis of 379 consecutive patients with AIG, whose symptoms were scored using the Rome IV criteria, found that 56.7% had gastrointestinal symptoms, with dyspepsia being the most common. On multivariable analysis, younger age and non-smoking status were more commonly associated with dyspepsia. Other cohort studies have demonstrated similar associations between younger age and dyspepsia. Another study of 41 patients with AIG who underwent pH impedance suggested that acid reflux rarely occurred, thus indicating that it is likely not a common mechanism underlying symptoms in patients with AIG. Notably, patients with AIG are frequently treated with anti-acid therapy, which is likely to worsen hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria.

Extra-gastrointestinal symptoms include involvement of several other organ systems. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration, a peripheral neuropathy and myelopathy of the posterior and lateral columns that can become irreversible if treatment is delayed. In severe cases, this deficiency can also cause optic neuropathy and encephalopathy. One retrospective study of 65 patients with both neuropathy and vitamin B12 deficiency reported that low serum PG-1 levels (PG 1 < 70 ng/mL) and serum PG 1:2 ratios (< 3.0) correlated with more severe anemia and more severe neurologic symptoms. Lower PG-1 levels (22.4 ng/mL or less) were a more specific measure.

### 100-year-old haematologica images: Bothriocephalus and pernicious anemia [^113Bt12i]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

For over 50 years from the description of the first patients in 1887, pernicious anemia was one of the most mysterious and feared hematologic diseases. Patients almost always died following a long disease course characterized by a variable and complex clinical profile. Various treatment approaches, including drugs such as arsenic preparations, radiotherapy, and even splenectomy, had all proven unsuccessful. It was only in 1926 that a study by Minot and Murphy radically changed the prognosis of this disease. In a study of 45 pernicious anemia patients, Minot and Murphy reported that a diet rich in liver, muscle meat, eggs, and milk had cured all 45 of them. This discovery not only changed patients' prognosis but also paved the way for a long series of research initiatives to define the etiopathogenesis of pernicious anemia, ultimately leading (in 1948) to the identification and purification of vitamin B12.

- **Figure 1**: Bone marrow (BM) smear from a dog with an experimental infestation with Bothriocephalus. Two of the three animals used in the experiment developed severe macrocytic anemia with an abundance of BM erythroblasts. This beautiful hand-drawn color plate depicts the BM characteristics of one of them.

In 1931, the etiology of pernicious anemia had still not been identified, although it was known that it frequently affected subjects with Bothriocephalus infestation. Some authors suggested a cause-and-effect relationship between these two conditions, but the observation that most patients with this infestation do not develop the disease argued against this hypothesis.

### Leucovorin calcium [^111smUWL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Leucovorin is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias secondary to the lack of vitamin B12. A hematologic remission may occur while neurologic manifestations continue to progress.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: A systematic review [^112rx8LK]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Although we did not find an association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people, this does not imply that patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption (with tissue depletion of vitamin B12 and very low vitamin B12 concentrations) will not benefit from vitamin B12 administration, especially since non-placebo-controlled studies showed large increases in haemoglobin concentrations or haematocrit after intramuscular or oral vitamin B12 administration in patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption. However, apart from the undisputed reality of pernicious anaemia, the clinical impact of a subnormal vitamin B12 level in older people is unclear, especially since several observational studies and randomized controlled trials also showed no effect of vitamin B12 administration on cognitive function.

Diagnosis

Diagnostic delay is not uncommon for AIG, particularly because the condition is often asymptomatic or associated with mild nonspecific symptoms. Often, it is incidental laboratory findings such as anemia, which may occur in later stages, that prompt diagnostic workup. One study of consecutive patients with AIG at an Italian center found that the median diagnostic delay was 14 months. Factors associated with diagnostic delay included female sex, previous misdiagnosis, history of infertility or miscarriages, as well as initial evaluation by a gastroenterologist (vs. hematologist or internist). One study of patients who had been referred to a center in Japan for H. pylori eradication found that a significant proportion (19.5%, n = 43/220) of patients met the criteria for AIG. A majority of these patients (76.7%) had been previously treated twice for H. pylori, even though they were colonized with non-H. pylori urease-producing bacteria. In a study of 99 consecutive patients with AIG based on histology and positive PCA serology, the features which were associated with the diagnosis and may have prompted further evaluation were concomitant autoimmune disorders, neurologic symptoms, family history, vitamin B12 deficiency, and abnormal findings on gastric biopsies.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^114eM2Dw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory condition that involves the destruction of the gastric oxyntic mucosa through the autoimmune-mediated loss of parietal cells, with replacement by atrophic and metaplastic tissue. Histologically, AIG is characterized by atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa, known as corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis, with or without replacement by metaplastic mucosa. Classically, antral mucosa architecture is preserved, but this might not be the case in more advanced stages or if there is concomitant infection with *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*).

Histologically, AIG falls under the umbrella of "atrophic gastritis", which comprises several conditions where the downstream histologic consequence of chronic environmental (e.g. *H. pylori*) or non-environmental triggers is gastric atrophy — that is, the disappearance of the native gastric glands and thinning of the mucosa. There is abundant literature on chronic *H. pylori* gastritis leading to progression to multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) and, in a small minority, neoplastic transformation and progression to adenocarcinoma; however, the literature on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management of AIG is sparse in comparison. Moreover, the heterogeneity across the literature with respect to criteria used to diagnose AIG further contributes to our incomplete understanding of this condition, as well as practice pattern variability. For example, pernicious anemia (PA), which is a late-stage manifestation of AIG characterized by megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, is not uniformly present in all cases.

### Vitamin B [^117Np1Dp]. BMJ (2023). Low credibility.

Symptomatic deficiency in people with B12 malabsorption presents challenges due to varying treatment recommendations across countries. For instance, the British National Formulary (BNF) prescribes hydroxocobalamin based on presenting symptoms. It recommends "for neurological involvement, administering hydroxocobalamin by intramuscular injection, initially 1 mg once daily on alternate days until no further improvement, then 1 mg every 2 months". Conversely, in the Netherlands, pharmacotherapeutic guidelines suggest administering 1000 mcg once or twice weekly for up to two years for similar neurological symptoms or abnormalities.

Little robust evidence supports recommended dosing schedules. No clinical studies evaluate the effectiveness and optimal dosing of intramuscular cobalamin preparations for symptom relief, except those assessing attained serum B12 concentrations and sometimes hematological response. Studies since the 1960s have reported substantial differences between individuals regarding pharmacodynamics and dose requirements. Some patients, particularly those with neurological symptoms, may require more frequent injections, varying from twice weekly to every 2–4 weeks, to achieve and maintain symptom-free status. A potential explanation could be the significant inter-individual difference in biliary B12 excretion. More than two-thirds of the B12 excreted in bile is reabsorbed in the small intestine; however, this reabsorption is decreased in individuals with pernicious anemia or other causes of B12 malabsorption.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^114dBnM6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria may lead to other micronutrient deficiencies, in addition to iron and vitamin B12. A single-center study of 122 patients with autoimmune gastritis (AIG) on endoscopic biopsy found that 76 had at least one nutritional deficiency (vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, and folic acid) and 52 had more than one. The progression of vitamin deficiencies occurs over a long period of time due to natural reserves in the body and can present with vague, non-localizing symptoms. Thus, providers should be attuned to other nutritional deficiencies in patients with AIG and manage these appropriately.

- **Concomitant autoimmune diseases**: As noted, AIG not uncommonly coexists with other autoimmune conditions, some of which have gastrointestinal manifestations. Concomitant thyroid disease is most common; two recent retrospective cohort studies of AIG patients showed 36–44% of these patients had autoimmune thyroiditis. Conversely, among patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, approximately 40% had atrophic body gastritis and 16% had pernicious anemia (PA). Among patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the risk of AIG is elevated 3–5 times that of the general population. Similarly, another study highlighted autoimmune diseases such as Addison's disease (4.8% of Addison's patients also had PA), T1DM (5–10% with AIG, 2–4% with PA), vitiligo, chronic spontaneous urticaria, myasthenia gravis, and perioral cutaneous autoimmune conditions. Indeed, in patients with an autoimmune disease who present with anemia, a diagnosis of AIG should be considered.

### Reassessment of intrinsic factor and parietal cell autoantibodies in atrophic gastritis with respect to cobalamin deficiency [^112dcQUW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Atrophic body gastritis (ABG) is an autoimmune condition that eventually manifests as pernicious anemia (PA). Parietal cell autoantibodies (PCAs) and intrinsic factor autoantibodies (IFAs) are considered characteristics of these conditions. Recent studies on the frequency of IFAs and PCAs concerning cobalamin deficiency in biopsy-proven ABG patients are lacking. This issue was addressed using new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assays.

Sera from 165 patients with histologically diagnosed ABG and 113 controls were tested for IFAs and PCAs using ELISA. A total of 81 ABG patients had cobalamin deficiency and macrocytic anemia (Group 1-PA), 36 had cobalamin deficiency without macrocytic anemia (Group 2), and 48 had normal cobalamin levels (Group 3).

- **Results**: IFAs were detected in 44 out of 165 ABG patients (27% sensitivity) and in 0 out of 113 controls (100% specificity). PCAs were detected in 134 ABG patients (81% sensitivity) and in 11 controls (90% specificity). In Group 1, IFAs showed a 37% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas PCAs showed an 81% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Combining IFA and PCA testing increased the sensitivity to 61% in all ABG patients and to 73% in Group 1, while maintaining 100% specificity.

- **Conclusions**: IFAs are 100% specific for biopsy-proven ABG and occurred in 27% of patients. PCAs occurred in 81% of ABG patients and in 10% of controls. Combining IFA and PCA testing significantly increases their diagnostic performance for ABG and PA, yielding a 73% sensitivity for PA. The non-invasive combined PCA and IFA assessment may be beneficial in diagnosing ABG and PA more effectively.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified [^115crKmA]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism could be explained by the presence of antibodies to the gastric parietal cells and intrinsic factor, reduced oral intake, dyserythropoiesis due to thyroid hormone deficiency, and defective absorption due to reduced bowel motility, bowel wall edema, and bacterial overgrowth.

Celiac disease, a highly prevalent autoimmune-mediated gastrointestinal condition, occurs in 1–16% of T1DM patients compared to 0.3–1% in the general population. Ingestion of wheat gluten and other related proteins has been documented as trigger factors for this condition in genetically susceptible individuals. Due to the associated enteropathy, patients often present with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, and anemia due to micronutrient (mainly folate and vitamin B12) malabsorption.

- **Screening approach for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM**: Currently, there are no published guidelines advocating for routine screening for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM. However, among type 2 diabetic patients, it is clinically plausible to screen for vitamin B12 deficiency prior to the initiation of metformin and later annually among elderly patients with a history of long-term use of metformin (≥ 3–4 years), use of high doses of metformin (≥ 2 g/day), and clinically worsening diabetic distal polyneuropathy in the presence or absence of the discussed hematological abnormalities.

The screening approach for vitamin B12 deficiency among diabetic patients and the general population is similar. Measurement of the serum vitamin…

### Low serum vitamin B12 is common in coeliac disease and is not due to autoimmune gastritis [^1133FWyU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the relationship between low serum vitamin B12 levels and coeliac disease, while investigating whether autoimmune gastritis is a contributing factor. Although coeliac disease primarily affects the proximal small bowel, instances of vitamin B12 deficiency have been noted. The research aimed to assess the prevalence of B12 deficiency among a large cohort of coeliac patients and to rule out the influence of autoimmune gastritis.

The study was conducted prospectively, measuring serum B12 levels in coeliac patients. Investigations targeted pernicious anaemia and autoimmune gastritis in B12-deficient individuals. The research took place in the gastroenterology department of a significant district general hospital.

Patients who had not been supplementing with vitamin B12 prior to the study had their serum B12 levels assessed before beginning a gluten-free diet. Those identified with low B12 levels underwent further testing, including gastric biopsies and measurements of plasma gastrin and serum gastric parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies.

The primary outcomes measured were the prevalence of low serum B12 and the detection of indicators of pernicious anaemia or autoimmune gastritis in those with low B12 levels. Results revealed that out of 159 patients, 13 had low serum B12 at diagnosis. An additional six patients had a history of B12 replacement therapy for periods ranging from 3 to 37 years prior to diagnosis. This resulted in an overall prevalence of 12% (19 patients).

Among these 19 patients, only two exhibited gastric corpus atrophy – one tested positive for intrinsic factor antibodies, and the other demonstrated hypergastrinaemia. Importantly, no correlation was found between low B12 levels and clinical characteristics. The study concludes that low B12 is frequently observed in coeliac disease without the presence of pernicious anaemia and may be an initial presenting symptom. It is crucial to ascertain B12 status before commencing folic acid replacement therapy.

### Primary neurologic symptoms: Have you considered pernicious anemia [^115NAKWf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is a nutrient vital for metabolic function. Absorption of ingested B12 depends on intrinsic factor, which is secreted by parietal cells within the stomach. Pernicious anemia is caused by an intrinsic factor deficiency or autoantibodies against intrinsic factor. The presence of parietal cell antibodies can destroy parietal cells, leading to a deficiency in intrinsic factor. Both conditions lead to megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. The typical presentation of pernicious anemia includes fatigue, pale appearance, tingling sensation, depression, alterations to vision and smell, urinary incontinence, psychotic episodes, and weakness. The most effective treatment for pernicious anemia is intramuscular B12.

- **Case report**: A 27-year-old woman with a history of vitiligo presented to the emergency department (ED) with bilateral lower extremity weakness, clumsiness, numbness, and tingling. Physical examination revealed ataxia, no sensation below her umbilicus, decreased strength, and hyperreflexia in both lower extremities. A complete blood count in the ED revealed low hemoglobin and hematocrit and elevated mean corpuscular volume, raising concern for pernicious anemia. Further laboratory testing upon inpatient admission revealed a low vitamin B12 level and parietal cell antibodies in the blood. The patient's pernicious anemia was treated with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections, leading to a near complete resolution of her symptoms.

Emergency physicians should be aware that early suspicion and detection of pernicious anemia can significantly affect patient outcomes.

### Conclusion that autoimmune gastritis does not predispose to gastric cancer is unproven [^115rkn8v]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

I read with great interest the paper by Rugge et al. with the commentary by Goldenring, challenging an old, established fact that autoimmune gastritis (AIG) (pernicious anemia) predisposes to gastric adenocarcinoma. The study, authored by researchers from three different countries, hypothesized that AIG induces gastric adenocarcinoma only in individuals who had an initial but transient Helicobacter pylori infection, which is undetectable at the time of cancer diagnosis.

They examined patients with presumed AIG (gastritis restricted to the oxyntic mucosa and negative for H. pylori) via endoscopy with biopsies conducted twice, with an average interval of 7.5 years between the initial and follow-up endoscopy. Atrophy was evaluated using histological methods. Notably, they did not conduct serological assessments of oxyntic atrophy, such as pepsinogen I, vitamin B12, or gastrin levels. The quantification of oxyntic atrophy by histology, which relies on a few biopsies, is naturally inferior to serological methods that reflect the function of the entire oxyntic mucosa.

At the second and final endoscopy, 109 out of 211 subjects showed no oxyntic atrophy, while the remaining had only mild atrophy. It is thus not surprising that they did not detect any adenocarcinomas or intraepithelial precancerous lesions. In a German study, where one author of the present study was the last author, 4.9% of gastric cancer patients had AIG, and many displayed pernicious anemia as a significant clinical sign. The mean age of patients with AIG and gastric cancer was 67 years, compared to an age of 55.7 years in the Rugge et al. study. Reduced vitamin B12, as well as per…

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^116XtvBV]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For additional analyses requiring individual-level data, including cohort descriptive statistics, sex-stratified analysis of lead signals, and look-up of additional autoimmune diseases in pernicious anemia cases, we used data under the application 17085. No additional ethics approvals were needed for this dataset, as the UK Biobank's Ethics and Governance Council provides guidelines for conducting studies with this dataset. We focused on samples of genetically confirmed British European ancestry. We excluded individuals who had withdrawn their consent, were labeled with poor heterozygosity or missingness as defined by the UK Biobank, had excess (> 10) relatives, were not included in autosome phasing, had putative sex chromosome aneuploidy, or had a sex mismatch between self-reported and genotype data.

Pernicious anemia cases were extracted using the ICD10 D51.0 code in HES (Hospital Episodes and Spells) data (downloaded on July 11, 2020). Since the phenotype data were extracted at different time points and using slightly different exclusion criteria, the follow-up analyses included a larger number of pernicious anemia cases (n = 1192) compared to the original GWAS analysis (n = 754). The descriptive characteristics of the follow-up dataset in the UKBB were as follows: cases — 384 men (age 61.9 ± 15.7 years) and 808 women (age 59.1 ± 7.7 years); controls — 187,056 men (age 57.1 ± 8.1 years) and 219,756 women (age 56.7 ± 7.9 years).

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^116nPgmK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory condition characterized by the destruction of the gastric oxyntic mucosa due to the autoimmune-mediated loss of parietal cells, which are replaced by atrophic and metaplastic tissue. Diagnosing AIG is crucial given the need for ongoing clinical management and vigilance regarding downstream complications, the most serious of which include gastric adenocarcinoma. Other clinical consequences encompass gastric neuroendocrine tumors and issues related to decreased gastric acid and intrinsic factor due to parietal cell destruction and antibodies against intrinsic factor, such as micronutrient deficiencies. Additionally, concomitant autoimmune disorders may arise. Given the prevalence of AIG and the potential for severe clinical outcomes, it is important to engage in efforts to reduce practice pattern variability related to diagnosis and management. Accordingly, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation of AIG, including both gastric and extragastric manifestations, and provide an overview of clinical management.

### Limited value of testing for intrinsic factor antibodies with negative gastric parietal cell antibodies in pernicious anaemia [^115h6jbn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The appropriate testing strategy for diagnosing pernicious anaemia using gastric parietal cell (GPC) and/or intrinsic factor antibodies (IFA) is controversial. Intrinsic factor antibodies are found in only about 70% of cases. Indirect immunofluorescence screening for gastric parietal cell antibodies is more sensitive, labor-intensive, and less specific.

- **Methods**: The frequency of antibody positivity (IFA and/or GPC) was retrospectively examined in patients tested for both autoantibodies over a three-year period. It was investigated whether B12 levels were related to antibody status. These findings were validated in a prospective study of IFA in 91 GPC negative patients with low B12 levels.

- **Results**: Of 847 samples identified in the retrospective study, 4 (0.47%) were positive for only intrinsic factor antibodies, 731 (86.3%) positive for GPC alone, and 112 (13.2%) for both. A Student's t-test on log-transformed data showed B12 levels had no bearing on autoantibody status. In a group of 91 consecutive patients with low B12 levels, all were tested for both autoantibodies; all were negative for gastric parietal cell antibodies. Only one sample was positive for intrinsic factor antibody using the porcine intrinsic factor assay, but it was negative by a human recombinant intrinsic factor-based ELISA.

- **Conclusions**: This study provides evidence that testing for gastric parietal cell antibodies is an appropriate screening test for pernicious anaemia, with intrinsic factor antibodies reserved for confirmatory testing or in patients with other autoantibodies that mask the GPC pattern.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^112SeAVh]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The association plot for ICD10 codes associated with pernicious anemia diagnosis in the Estonian Biobank is depicted in Figure 3. Each triangle in the plot represents one ICD10 main code, and the direction of the triangle represents the direction of effect. Upward-pointing triangles indicate an increased prevalence of the diagnosis code among pernicious anemia cases. The red line indicates the Bonferroni-corrected significance level (2.5 × 10⁻⁵).

We also tested the prevalence of other autoimmune diseases among the cases compared to controls. In the Estonian Biobank, 55.8% of all pernicious anemia cases have at least one other autoimmune diagnosis (compared to 23.9% in the controls). For comparison, we examined other common autoimmune diseases as well: type 1 diabetes (35.9% vs. 22.8%), vitiligo (37.9% vs. 23.5%), rheumatoid arthritis (39.3% vs. 19.2%), and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (33.7% vs. 18.6%). This confirmed the higher incidence of autoimmune diseases in pernicious anemia as well as in other autoimmune diseases. A similar analysis in the UK Biobank data showed that 35% of pernicious anemia cases and 9% of controls had at least one other autoimmune disease from our tested list (Methods).

To determine whether the pernicious anemia associations were driven by concomitant autoimmune diseases (predominantly vitiligo and thyroid problems, which were also highlighted as significant in the associated diagnoses analysis), we conducted a look-up for vitiligo, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune thyroid disease associations in our meta-analysis summary statistics (Supplementary Data 5). Since autoimmune diseases can share pathogenic mechanisms, we focused on loci that, according to Kn:

### Chronicles of a cancer foretold: 35 years of gastric cancer risk assessment [^1169fcVD]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

There is statistical and histological evidence that patients with pernicious anaemia are at increased risk of stomach cancer. True adenomatous polyps and carcinoma of the stomach have been reported to be three to four times more common in patients with pernicious anaemia than in the general population, although a recent study suggests this may be an underestimate since some patients with carcinoma but without overt pernicious anaemia are in a "pre-pernicious anaemia" stage.

Pernicious anaemia results from a long-standing cobalamin deficiency caused by advanced oxyntic mucosal atrophy. In its original description, this corpus-restricted atrophic gastritis was assumed to be primarily due to an autoimmune attack directed at parietal cells. In the last decades, however, atrophy has been most consistently associated with long-standing H. pylori infection. Additionally, it has been suggested that H. pylori infection might also trigger and sustain an immune-mediated attack against the proton pump, resulting in organic lesions (i.e. corpus-restricted atrophic gastritis) identical to those of primary gastric autoimmunity.

This widened pathogenetic spectrum of oxyntic atrophy should also include the overlap of primary and secondary (post-infectious) autoimmune conditions. Because it is difficult to reliably discriminate between primary and secondary autoimmune corpus atrophy in epidemiological studies, the impact and magnitude of the cancer risk associated with each of its variants remain unknown. A study based on the OLGA staging suggests that the risk…

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: A position paper by the ESPGHAN Gastroenterology Committee [^112B13wS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Gastritis caused by H. pylori

H. pylori infections affect more than half of the world population, but the severity and phenotype of gastric pathology depend on a complex interplay between various factors of the bacteria itself, the host, and the environment. Although it is well documented that persistent H. pylori infection in the gastric mucosa in children can lead to iron deficiency anemia (IDA), the pathogenesis and specific risk factors remain poorly understood. Most children with H. pylori-associated anemia do not show evidence of overt blood loss due to gastrointestinal hemorrhagic lesions. Unlike adults, in H. pylori-infected children, gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia are rarely found, suggesting that impaired gastric acid secretion may not be a primary or direct cause of H. pylori-associated IDA. Therefore, some other possible mechanisms have been proposed such as competition for iron availability, the role of hepcidin, the role of outer membrane proteins (some encoding genes are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms), the VacA and sabA gene, concomitant diseases such as coeliac disease (CD), parasitic infection, and poor iron intake.

H. pylori-negative chronic gastritis

Apart from H. pylori gastritis, other forms of gastritis, such as eosinophilic gastritis and autoimmune atrophic gastritis, may present with anemia. The clinical presentation of eosinophilic gastritis is variable, with abdominal pain as the most common symptom, followed by vomiting and other symptoms including anemia, melaena, food aversions, failure to thrive, edema, and ascites.

Autoimmune atrophic gastritis is an inflammatory condition characterized by…

### Gastric carcinoids in patients with hypergastrinemia [^112cHKpE]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Hypergastrinemia in patients with pernicious anemia is a major regulator contributing to enterochromaffin-cell hyperplasia and, ultimately, to gastric carcinoids.

- **Study design**: Between 1990 and 2003, we studied 8 women and 10 men with pernicious anemia and gastric carcinoids; their mean age was 50 years. Serum gastrin levels ranged from 740 to 4,000 pg/mL (mean 1,000 pg/mL). Six patients underwent antrectomy, four total gastrectomy, and eight endoscopic resection or biopsy. During the same period, 22 patients with Zollinger-Ellison tumors and hypergastrinemia (20 men and 2 women, mean age 49 years) had no gastric carcinoids, but 1 of 7 patients with Zollinger-Ellison and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1) tumors had hypergastrinemia and gastric carcinoids.

- **Results**: The mean follow-up for pernicious anemia patients was 6 years after antrectomy and 1 to 10 years after endoscopic resection or biopsy. Tumor regression was observed in one patient after antrectomy and one patient after biopsy. There were no deaths in this group in spite of lymph node metastasis in two patients. The patient with Zollinger-Ellison and MEN1 syndrome has been followed for 3 years after diagnosis and 2 years after total gastrectomy.

- **Conclusions**: Gastric carcinoids are indolent tumors occurring with increasing frequency in patients with pernicious anemia. Antrectomy or biopsy and observation are preferred methods of treatment. Total gastrectomy is reserved for patients with extensive tumor involvement of the gastric wall or for emergency bleeding.

### ATPase4A autoreactivity and its association with autoimmune phenotypes in the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium study [^112UVeuk]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies targeting the H+/K+-ATPase proton pump of the gastric parietal cell (parietal cell antibodies [PCA]) are diagnostic of atrophic body gastritis (ABG), leading to pernicious anemia (PA). PCA, ABG, and PA occur with increased frequency in patients with type 1 diabetes and their relatives and are considered "minor" components of forms of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS). A customized radioimmunoprecipitation assay was applied to 6,749 samples from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium to measure ATP4A autoreactivity. Autoantibody prevalence was correlated with variants in HLA class II, PTPN22, and CTLA4 genes.

With an ATP4A radioimmunoprecipitation assay, PCA were detected in sera from 20.9% of affected individuals. PCA prevalence increased with age and was greater in females (25.3%) than males (16.5%) and among Hispanics (36.3%) and blacks (26.2%) compared with non-Hispanic whites (20.8%) and Asians (16.7%). PCA and other organ-specific autoantibodies — GAD65, IA-2, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), and transglutaminase (TG) — clustered within families, with heritability estimates from 71 to 95%.

- **Clustering and genetic associations**: PCA clustered with TPO, 21-OH, and persistent GAD65 autoantibodies but not with celiac (TG) or IA-2 autoantibodies. PCA-positive subjects showed an increased frequency of DRB1*0404, DPB1*0201, and PTPN22 R620W (rs2476601-T) and a decreased frequency of DRB1*0101, DPB1*0301, and CTLA4 CT60 (rs3087243-T). Genetic variants accounted for 4–5% of the heritable risk for PCA. The same alleles were associated with other autoantibody phenotypes in a consistent pattern.

### Oral vitamin B12 supplementation in pernicious anemia: a prospective cohort study [^111A3cQx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

The absorption of vitamin B12 is hindered in pernicious anemia (PA) owing to intrinsic factor deficiency. Traditionally, intramuscular vitamin B12 injections were the standard treatment, bypassing the impaired absorption. Although there is potential for oral vitamin B12 supplementation through passive enteral absorption, it is not commonly prescribed in PA owing to limited studies assessing its efficacy.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to assess the efficacy of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in PA.

- **Methods**: We enrolled participants diagnosed with incident vitamin B12 deficiency related to PA. The diagnosis of PA was based on the presence of classical immune gastritis and of anti-intrinsic factor and/or antiparietal cell antibodies. To evaluate the vitamin B12 status, we measured total plasma vitamin B12, plasma homocysteine, and plasma methylmalonic acid (pMMA) concentration and urinary methylmalonic acid-to-creatinine ratio. Participants were treated with oral cyanocobalamin at a dosage of 1000 μg/d throughout the study duration. Clinical and biological vitamin B12 deficiency-related features were prospectively and systematically assessed over the 1-year study duration.

- **Results**: We included 26 patients with vitamin B12 deficiency revealing PA. Following 1 month of oral vitamin B12 supplementation, 88.5% of patients were no longer deficient in vitamin B12, with significant improvement of plasma vitamin B12 [407 (297–485) compared with 148 (116–213) pmol/L; P < 0.0001], plasma homocysteine [13.5 (10.9–29.8) compared with 18.6 (13.7–46.8) μmol/L; P < 0.0001], and pMMA.

### Macro-bmasking bdeficiency [^117DLJf7]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The cause of B12 deficiency in this patient was not established. It has long been known that only half of people of Western European descent with demonstrated pernicious anaemia have anti-IF antibodies. In such situations, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be helpful in demonstrating a possible diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis, and measuring fecal calprotectin may be helpful in excluding inflammatory bowel disease.

- **Patient's perspective**: After re-starting vitamin B12 injections, almost all my complaints have disappeared. I only have a slight tremor, which is much less than before.

- **Learning points**:

	- Elevated serum B12 is often a result of supplementation with B12 in oral form or injections.

	- In addition, elevated serum B12 concentrations can also be associated with underlying disorders, such as liver diseases or a (haematologic) malignancy. Furthermore, it can also be the consequence of complex formation of B12-vitamin binding proteins with immunoglobulins, the so-called macro-B12.

	- In this specific patient, the development of macro-B12 resulted in erroneous and longstanding elevated serum B12, which masked her underlying B12 deficiency, as evident by low serum B12 post-polyethylene glycol precipitation and resolution of symptoms related to B12 deficiency post-treatment.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^1115SbK6]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

To clarify the overlap between the genetic regulation of pernicious anemia and natural B12 levels, we conducted a look-up of eleven variants associated with vitamin B12 levels in a large Icelandic whole genome sequence dataset combined with Danish exome sequencing data (Supplementary Data 5). None of these variants were genome-wide significant in our data, but 8 out of 11 showed nominally significant association p-values, with the allele decreasing serum B12 levels consistently also increasing the risk of pernicious anemia (Supplementary Data 5).

Finally, parietal cell antibody positivity (a biomarker for autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia) has been associated with the ABO locus at 9q34 and T1D risk loci. The lowest p-value (p = 0.005) for the ABO region in our meta-analysis was for rs8176760. Six of the nine T1D risk loci showing significant PCA associations were at least nominally significant in our meta-analysis (Supplementary Data 5), including rs2476601 (PTPN22), which is one of our top associated variants.

- **Associated phenotypes**: We used the individual-level data in EstBB to evaluate the association between pernicious anemia and other diseases (defined by ICD-10 codes). According to our analysis, individuals with pernicious anemia have more diagnoses of other anemias and vitamin deficiencies (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 6), thyroid problems (thyroiditis and hypothyroidism), and gastrointestinal tract diagnoses (gastritis, malignant neoplasm of the stomach, intestinal malabsorption, irritable bowel syndrome). Additionally, they have more diagnoses of vitiligo, dermatitis, osteoporosis, and spontaneous abortion.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^115Wa5GA]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to patients with pernicious anemia, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend initiating lifelong cobalamin replacement in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency and negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, where no other causes of deficiency have been identified, as these patients may have anti-intrinsic factor-negative pernicious anemia.

### Pernicious anemia and widespread absence of gastrointestinal endocrine cells in a patient with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type I and malabsorption [^115bbghd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type I (APS I) is characterized by multiple endocrine gland failures, with other manifestations such as gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The objective of the study was to examine the histopathological and immunological findings in the GI mucosa of a patient with typical features of APS I, malabsorption, and pernicious anemia.

Biopsies from the GI tract of a patient with APS I were immunostained with chromogranin for GI endocrine cells (GIECs). Blinded slides were graded for numbers of endocrine cells. Normal gastric mucosa was exposed to the patient's serum to test for circulating anti-GIEC and antiparietal cell antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence. The study was conducted at the Departments of Pediatrics and Medical Gastroenterology in an academic medical center.

The patient's GI mucosa demonstrated an absence of GIECs throughout, including gastric gastrin-secreting cells, and her laboratory tests for serum gastrin levels were low normal. Both GIECs and parietal cells were absent in her gastric corpus. The patient's serum contained anti-GIEC antibody but no antiparietal cell antibody.

These observations suggest that GIECs in APS I are subject to autoimmune destruction, which can cause widespread GIEC loss. This could explain the GI dysfunctions often noted in the syndrome, including malabsorption and atrophic gastric changes with pernicious anemia. We also hypothesize that the absence of gastric parietal cells may result mainly from hypogastrinemia.

### Variable hematologic presentation of autoimmune gastritis: Age-related progression from iron deficiency to cobalamin depletion [^115J1t7W]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a known complication of achlorhydria and may precede the development of pernicious anemia. Among 160 patients with autoimmune gastritis identified by hypergastrinemia and strongly positive antiparietal antibodies, we explored the overlap between 83 subjects presenting with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), 48 with normocytic indices, and 29 with macrocytic anemia. Compared with macrocytic patients, patients with IDA were 21 years younger (41 ± 15 years versus 62 ± 15 years) and mostly women. All groups had a high prevalence of thyroid disease (20%) and diabetes (8%), which is suggestive of the autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome.

Stratification by age cohorts from younger than 20 years to older than 60 years showed a regular and progressive increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) from 68 ± 9 to 95 ± 16 fl, serum ferritin levels from 4 ± 2 to 37 ± 41 microg/L, gastrin level from 166 ± 118 to 382 ± 299 pM/L (349 ± 247 to 800 ± 627 pg/mL), and a decrease in cobalamin level from 392 ± 179 to 108 ± 65 pg/mL. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection was 87.5% at age younger than 20 years, 47% at age 20 to 40 years, 37.5% at 41 to 60 years, and 12.5% at age older than 60 years. These findings challenge the common notion that pernicious anemia is a disease of the elderly and imply a disease starting many years before the establishment of clinical cobalamin deficiency, by an autoimmune process likely triggered by H pylori.

### Pernicious anaemia presenting as hyperpigmentation [^115FpysJ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

An adult East Asian woman presented with a sudden onset of hyperpigmented macules on her oral mucosal surfaces, palms, and soles, accompanied by hypogeusia and weight loss. This condition was found to be associated with an underlying severe vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to pernicious anaemia.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^113Jo9HV]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

In our analysis, cases were identified from population-based biobank data using the ICD-10 code for pernicious anemia (D51.0 or D51 in the FinnGen data). This approach was selected to simplify data analysis, but we acknowledge this approach may have some shortcomings. First, the summary statistics used for the FinnGen cohort are for a broader vitamin B12 deficiency phenotype definition compared to the other two cohorts, so it likely includes other cases of B12 deficiency. Second, the use of the code may vary in different healthcare systems, increasing the heterogeneity of the phenotype. However, we see no significant differences in effect estimates for the reported lead variants, and the identified loci and candidate genes have a clear role in autoimmune regulation, suggesting the vast majority of cases in this study have autoimmune B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia).

The potential misclassification of our control subjects as not having pernicious anemia can increase the heterogeneity in the analyzed data and attenuate the results towards the null. This implies that either larger datasets with the phenotype definition or further refinement of the phenotype definition is needed to increase the number of identified loci. At the same time, the prevalence of pernicious anemia in our studied datasets ranged from 0.2–0.8%, which is roughly in line with the expected prevalence of pernicious anemia (0.1% in the general population and > 2% in individuals over 60 years old).

Pernicious anemia is often accompanied by other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid conditions, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetes.

### Insights into pediatric autoimmune gastritis: Is there a role for Helicobacter pylori infection [^113Mawg5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastric mucosa, mainly described in adults presenting with pernicious anemia. It results from antibody-mediated destruction of parietal cells, but the precise initiating event is unknown. The pathogenicity of Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) has been suggested but not established. This study aimed to better characterize AIG in pediatric patients and to address the possible role of H pylori infection.

- **Methods**: Descriptive single-center study, retrospectively describing 20 patients with a diagnosis of AIG based on positivity for anti-parietal cell autoantibodies, in addition to analytical and/or histological findings of oxyntic mucosa atrophy.

- **Results**: In the majority (18/20), AIG diagnosis was suggested during the investigation of refractory iron-deficient anemia. One patient had dyspepsia, and none of the others had gastrointestinal symptoms. Fifty-five percent (11/20) were H pylori positive, but there were no significant differences regarding mean hemoglobin values at presentation (10.6 ± 2.5 vs 9.5 ± 1.0 g/dL, P > 0.05), analytical indicators of gastric atrophy (gastrin, 564.4 ± 184 vs 721.2 ± 220.6 pg/mL, P > 0.05), or in the presence or the grade of oxyntic mucosa atrophy.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings highlight that AIG may have an age-dependent presentation; thus, we can consider a pediatric phenotype that, in contrast to adults, is manifested by refractory iron-deficient anemia and associated with parietal cell autoantibody positivity, but not intrinsic factor autoantibodies. A correlation between H pylori and this phenotype remains an area of further investigation.

### Cyanocobalamin [^117GNVxZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosage and administration:

- **Avoid intravenous route**: Use of this product intravenously will result in almost all of the vitamin being lost in the urine.

- **Pernicious anemia**: Parenteral vitamin B12 is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life, as the oral form is not dependable. Administer a dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If clinical improvement and a reticulocyte response are observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time, hematologic values should have normalized. Follow this regimen with 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concurrently if needed.

- **Patients with normal intestinal absorption**: Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated, depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should involve an oral B12 preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated accordingly.

- **Schilling test**: The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### High-risk gastric pathology and prevalent autoimmune diseases in patients with pernicious anemia [^115Hy2GP]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Pernicious anemia (PA) develops from atrophic gastritis due to autoimmune destruction of parietal cells and results in achlorhydria, vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies, anemia, neurologic deficits, and premalignant and malignant stomach lesions. We report the presentation, diagnosis, and gastric complications of PA in patients from an endocrinology practice.

- **Methods**: Thirty-four patients (31 female, 3 male) with PA who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or gastrectomy were identified. Pertinent clinical, laboratory, and pathology findings were reviewed and summarized.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients was 58.6 ± 14.2 years; the onset of PA was at age 50.2 ± 15.3 years. Anemia reflected vitamin B12 and/or iron deficiencies. Parietal cell antibodies (PCA) were detected in 97% of patients, and intrinsic factor blocking antibody (IFBA) was found in 52%. Fasting gastrin and chromogranin A levels were elevated (1,518.0 ± 1,588.3 pg/mL and 504.9 ± 1,524.9 ng/mL respectively). Autoimmune or immunologic diseases (AIDs) were present in 32 of 34 patients. Stomach pathology showed premalignant or malignant lesions in 26 patients, including gastric neuroendocrine tumors (GNETs) in 6 and adenocarcinoma in 1. One patient presented with neurologic symptoms and subacute combined degeneration of the posterior column of the spinal cord.

- **Conclusion**: PA should be suspected in patients with unexplained anemia or neurologic symptoms. The diagnosis of PA relies on fasting gastrin and gastric auto-antibody testing, in addition to hematologic evaluation. EGD with measurement of gastric pathology is essential for assessing premalignant or malignant lesions.

### Autoimmune gastritis in type 1 diabetes: A clinically oriented review [^113U32Pd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia are common autoimmune disorders, present in up to 2% of the general population. In patients with type 1 diabetes or autoimmune thyroid disease, the prevalence increases three- to five-fold. This review addresses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical consequences, and management of autoimmune gastritis in type 1 diabetic patients.

- **Synthesis**: Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by: 1) atrophy of the corpus and fundus; 2) autoantibodies to the parietal cell and to intrinsic factor; 3) achlorhydria; 4) iron deficiency anemia; 5) hypergastrinemia; 6) pernicious anemia may result from vitamin B12 deficiency; and 7) in up to 10% of patients, autoimmune gastritis may predispose to gastric carcinoid tumors or adenocarcinomas. This provides a strong rationale for screening, early diagnosis, and treatment.

The management of patients with autoimmune gastritis involves yearly determinations of gastrin, iron, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. Iron or vitamin B12 should be supplemented in patients with iron deficiency or pernicious anemia. Whether regular gastroscopic surveillance, including biopsies, is needed in patients with autoimmune gastritis or pernicious anemia is controversial. Although the gastric carcinoids occurring in these patients generally do not pose a great threat to life, the risk of developing carcinoma is debatable. Nevertheless, pending a consensus statement, we suggest performing gastroscopy and biopsy at least once in patients with autoantibodies to the parietal cell, iron deficiency, or pernicious anemia.

### Nascobal [^1117PB5K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). High credibility.

Nascobal is indicated for vitamin B12 maintenance therapy in adult patients with pernicious anemia who are in remission following intramuscular vitamin B12 therapy and who have no nervous system involvement. It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with dietary, drug-induced, or malabsorption-related vitamin B12 deficiency not due to pernicious anemia, as well as for the prevention of vitamin B12 deficiency in adult patients with vitamin B12 requirements in excess of normal.

- **Limitations of use**: Should not be used for the vitamin B12 absorption test (Schilling test). In patients with correctible or temporary causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, the benefit of continued long-term use of Nascobal following adequate correction of vitamin B12 deficiency and underlying disease has not been established. The effectiveness of Nascobal in patients with active symptoms of nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infection has not been determined. Treatment with Nascobal should be deferred until symptoms have subsided.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^114CAqgs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Estimates of autoimmune gastritis (AIG) prevalence vary depending on the study and rigor of the diagnostic criteria. This criteria can include whether the diagnosis was based on serology, medical coding, or endoscopy with biopsy confirmation. Some studies have classified patients as having AIG based solely on the presence of low serum vitamin B12, which has a broad differential diagnosis, without confirming the diagnosis on gastric histopathology. Other studies base the diagnosis on the presence of parietal cell antibodies (PCAs) or anti-intrinsic factor (IF) antibodies, which is also incorrect, given that these lack specificity (PCA) and sensitivity (IF), and patients may have seronegative AIG.

With these considerations in mind, the prevalence of AIG is estimated to range from 0.1% to 1–2% in the general population, but it is higher in certain populations, including women and those over 60 years old (estimated 2–3%). There is at least a 2:1 female-to-male predominance of AIG, and some data suggest that non-white individuals might have an earlier onset of AIG compared to white individuals.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115rXeCJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Histopathological features of autoimmune gastritis, as observed with H&E stain at 100× magnification in the oxyntic mucosa, show an absence of parietal and chief cells. These cells are replaced by intestinal metaplasia and pseudopyloric metaplasia, with background chronic inflammation. In contrast, the histopathologic image of a type-I gastric neuroendocrine tumor reveals well-differentiated tumor cells with monomorphic round nuclei forming "nests" that infiltrate the lamina propria. Chromogranin A stain, although not shown, could confirm neuroendocrine differentiation. Images are courtesy of Dr. M Blanca Piazuelo.

The severity and extent of gastric atrophy based on histopathology are critical risk factors for subsequent gastric neoplasia. Both the OLGA and OLGIM systems evaluate this extent and severity, with OLGIM offering improved interobserver agreement compared to OLGA. Notably, stages III and IV in OLGA/OLGIM are consistently linked to a significantly higher risk of gastric cancer compared to stages 0–II. Despite international society guidelines promoting OLGA/OLGIM for risk prognostication and endoscopic surveillance, these systems have not been widely adopted in the United States, though there is advocacy for a change in practice.

Serologic autoimmune markers, namely PCA and IF, are relevant for AIG diagnosis. However, they are neither necessary nor sufficient for diagnosis due to their imperfect accuracy.

### Genome-wide association study identifies five risk loci for pernicious anemia [^112DALzk]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Look-up of genetic variants associated with vitamin B12 levels in our data showed that, in general, the allele which decreases serum B12 levels increases the risk of pernicious anemia, although none of these variants was genome-wide significant in our analysis. It cannot be ruled out that, in addition to the autoimmune component, pernicious anemia has some of its origins in the biological regulation of vitamin B12 levels, or alternatively, people with naturally lower B12 levels are diagnosed earlier. This could also mean our dataset of supposedly pernicious anemia cases includes individuals with other causes of B12 deficiency, or alternatively, the datasets used in the Grarup et al. study of B12 levels in the general population included cases of pernicious anemia. However, as pointed out before, the loci identified in this study and mapped candidate genes have a clear role in autoimmune regulation, suggesting most of our analyzed cases have autoimmune B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia).

A similar look-up of variants associated with parietal cell autoantibodies (a biomarker of autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia) in T1D patients showed that many of these loci are nominally associated with our analyzed phenotype as well. The associated loci have a central role in immune regulation, including PTPN22, CTLA4, IFIH1, HLA region, and SH2B3. Notably, we did not see an association with the parietal cell autoantibody-associated INS locus, which again suggests that the genome-wide significant loci we report are not confounded by accompanying autoimmune disease, such as T1D.

### Autoimmune gastropathy in type 1 diabetic patients with parietal cell antibodies: Histological and clinical findings [^11433RyX]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Approximately 15–20% of type 1 diabetic patients exhibit parietal cell antibodies (PCAs) targeting gastric H+/K+ ATPase. We examined whether iron deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia, and autoimmune gastritis, which may predispose individuals to gastric tumors, were more frequent in PCA-positive than in PCA-negative patients.

- **Research design and methods**: Gastric biopsies from 88 consecutively recruited type 1 diabetic patients (51 men and 37 women, 47 PCA-positive and 41 PCA-negative, aged 42 ± 13 years) were evaluated using the updated Sydney system. Immunostaining was conducted for parietal cells, B- and T-cells, enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and Helicobacter pylori (HP). PCAs were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence, H+/K+ ATPase antibodies by enzyme immunoassay, and HP by serology, urea breath test, and histology. Pentagastrin tests were performed in 42 subjects.

- **Results**: Autoimmune gastritis (AG) was present in 57% of PCA-positive and 10% of PCA-negative cases (OR 12.5, P < 0.0001). PCA positivity (beta = 1.44; P = 0.04) and hypergastrinemia (beta = 0.01; P = 0.026), but not HP, age, diabetes duration, sex, and HLA-DQ type were risk factors for AG. Iron deficiency anemia (OR 3.9, P = 0.015), pernicious anemia (OR = 4.6, P = 0.022), and hypochlorhydria (OR = 20.0, P = 0.0002) were more frequent in AG-positive individuals. HP infection was present in 47 patients but did not influence corpus histology or gastrinemia. Premalignant lesions were found in 26% of PCA-positive subjects: ECL cell hyperplasia in 7 AG-positive patients, comprising 1 with a gastric carcinoid tumor, and corpus intestinal metaplasia in 11 AG-positive patients, including 1 individual with additional complications.
