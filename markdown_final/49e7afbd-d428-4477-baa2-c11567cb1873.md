## Question

Optimum lithium level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the optimal lithium serum level and how to apply it across phases of treatment and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context and phase of treatment. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines define as the optimal maintenance range. Next, I will review FDA labeling for acute mania targets and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to check special populations such as older adults, those with renal impairment, and pregnancy. Finally, I should confirm monitoring logistics, drug interactions, and toxicity thresholds to synthesize a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the "optimal" level depends on whether we are treating acute mania, maintaining euthymia, or augmenting antidepressants in unipolar depression, and I need to ensure I'm not mixing these scenarios. The VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline emphasizes phase-specific pharmacotherapy and uses serum levels to guide dosing, particularly in maintenance, which frames the question of an "optimal" level most clearly for prophylaxis rather than acute control [^111ZH6WS] [^1176Lmg5].

> Now, I should verify the contemporary maintenance target. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly recommends maintaining lithium plasma levels in the 0.6–0.8 mEq/L range as the optimal balance of efficacy and side effects, and it advises avoiding levels above 1.0 mEq/L when possible due to higher risk of eventual kidney harm, which aligns with a kidney-sparing strategy in long-term care [^114bTgzQ] [^1176Lmg5]. Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence and timing; they also specify obtaining trough levels 11–14 hours after the last dose during maintenance, which is a key operational detail I should not overlook [^1176Lmg5].

> Hold on, I should reconcile this with FDA labeling because older or different labels sometimes cite a broader "desirable" maintenance range. Several FDA sources list 0.6–1.2 mEq/L as acceptable for long-term control, but they also caution that toxicity can occur near therapeutic levels and that older adults may show toxicity at concentrations ordinarily tolerated by others, reinforcing the rationale to favor the lower end in routine practice [^113yhvMv] [^113cD9cb]. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing; the 0.6–1.2 mEq/L window reflects historical practice, whereas modern guideline consensus prioritizes 0.6–0.8 mEq/L to mitigate renal risk while preserving efficacy [^114bTgzQ] [^1176Lmg5].

> Next, I should review acute mania targets. For acute episodes, FDA labeling commonly targets higher serum levels, typically around 1.0–1.5 mEq/L, recognizing that short-term exposure at these levels may be necessary for stabilization, but I should confirm that this is not the maintenance goal and that duration at higher levels should be minimized to protect the kidneys [^114YLU5S] [^115awaZn] [^1176Lmg5]. Let me reconsider the transition plan; once acute control is achieved, dose reduction toward the 0.6–0.8 mEq/L maintenance range is prudent to align long-term safety with ongoing prophylaxis [^1176Lmg5].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with older adults. I should double-check that geriatric patients often require lower doses and may manifest toxicity at levels tolerated by younger adults, so a "start low, go slow" approach with tighter monitoring is warranted, and many clinicians aim for the low end of 0.6–0.8 mEq/L or even slightly below when clinically feasible [^113yhvMv] [^112TbVPg]. But wait, what if renal function is reduced; I need to ensure dosing is conservative and that levels are checked more frequently because lithium is renally cleared and accumulation risk rises as GFR falls [^116DjTe8].

> For renal impairment, I should confirm the thresholds. Lithium is not recommended in severe renal insufficiency with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, and for mild to moderate impairment (CrCl 30–89 mL/min), start low, titrate slowly, and monitor levels frequently to avoid toxicity, which practically pushes the maintenance target toward the lower bound of 0.6–0.8 mEq/L or even below when necessary [^116DjTe8] [^1176Lmg5]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with kidney-safety guidance; yes, both the VA/DoD and nephrology sources emphasize minimizing exposure and intensifying monitoring in CKD to reduce nephrotoxic risk [^1129aVZc].

> Pregnancy requires special caution, so I need to check the perinatal strategy. If lithium is continued, use the lowest effective dose with more frequent level monitoring, and consider temporarily reducing or holding lithium 48–72 hours before delivery to mitigate maternal and neonatal toxicity, then restart postpartum with close monitoring as physiology normalizes [^112sR4tr] [^1127tZq9]. Let me verify that this balances maternal relapse risk against neonatal safety; the guideline supports continuation at the lowest effective dose with shared decision-making given the risk of recurrence if lithium is withdrawn [^116XF95g].

> I should confirm practical monitoring logistics. Serum lithium should be measured as a trough 11–14 hours after the last dose during maintenance, with more frequent checks after dose changes, initiation of interacting drugs, illness, or dehydration, and at least every 2–3 months once stable, while remembering that toxicity can occur even near therapeutic levels and that clinical assessment must accompany lab values [^1176Lmg5] [^113yhvMv]. Wait, I almost said 8–12 hours; that timing appears in some older FDA materials, but the VA/DoD specifies 11–14 hours for maintenance troughs, so I should stick with the guideline timing to avoid misinterpretation [^1176Lmg5] [^113cD9cb].

> Next, I should review toxicity thresholds and drug interactions to contextualize the upper bound. Mild to moderate adverse effects may begin around 1.5 mEq/L, and levels above 2.0–3.0 mEq/L carry risk of severe toxicity; importantly, neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity have been reported even within the 0.6–1.2 mEq/L range in susceptible patients, reinforcing the preference for 0.6–0.8 mEq/L in maintenance care [^113gg5wL] [^115WWKxG]. I need to ensure I flag key interactions that raise lithium levels or toxicity risk: thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, and metronidazole warrant closer level monitoring and dose adjustment, whereas SGLT2 inhibitors may lower lithium concentrations and also require monitoring during initiation and titration [^116bx16Z] [^115qDx8g] [^1118sa6L].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. For maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, the optimal lithium serum level is 0.6–0.8 mEq/L, balancing efficacy with renal and systemic safety, with trough sampling 11–14 hours after the last dose and avoidance of levels above 1.0 mEq/L when possible to reduce kidney injury risk [^114bTgzQ] [^1176Lmg5]. For acute mania, short-term targets of 1.0–1.5 mEq/L may be necessary, but I should confirm a plan to taper back to 0.6–0.8 mEq/L once stabilized to protect long-term renal function [^114YLU5S] [^115awaZn] [^1176Lmg5]. In older adults, those with renal impairment, or during pregnancy, I need to ensure lower starting doses, more frequent monitoring, and individualized targets at the low end of or just below the usual maintenance range to mitigate toxicity while preserving mood stability [^113yhvMv] [^116DjTe8].

---

The optimal lithium level for maintenance therapy is **0.6–0.8 mEq/L** [^114bTgzQ], balancing efficacy and tolerability while minimizing renal risk [^1176Lmg5]. For acute mania, **1.0–1.5 mEq/L** is typical [^114YLU5S], but levels above 1.2 mEq/L increase toxicity risk and should be used cautiously and only short term [^113gg5wL] [^114YLU5S]. Levels above 1.5 mEq/L are toxic [^113gg5wL] and require urgent management. Always individualize dosing and monitor serum lithium every 3–6 months in stable patients, more frequently during changes or in special populations [^1176Lmg5] [^1129aVZc].

## Therapeutic ranges

### Maintenance therapy

For maintenance therapy, the **optimal range** is 0.6–0.8 mEq/L [^114bTgzQ], which provides an optimal balance of efficacy and tolerability while minimizing renal risk [^114bTgzQ]. The **acceptable range** is 0.6–1.2 mEq/L [^113yhvMv], though levels above 1.0 mEq/L increase toxicity risk and should be avoided when possible [^1176Lmg5].

---

### Acute mania

For acute mania, the **typical range** is 1.0–1.5 mEq/L [^114YLU5S], with higher levels often needed short term for acute control [^115awaZn]. The **risk threshold** is above 1.2 mEq/L, where toxicity risk rises and close monitoring is essential [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of lithium levels

| **Lithium level (meq/l)** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|
| 0.6–0.8 | Optimal maintenance range; balanced efficacy and safety [^114bTgzQ] |
| 0.8–1.0 | Effective but higher risk of adverse effects; monitor closely [^113MwTPG] |
| 1.0–1.2 | Higher risk of toxicity; use cautiously, monitor frequently [^115awaZn] |
| 1.2–1.5 | Toxicity risk increases; monitor closely, adjust dose as needed [^113gg5wL] |
| > 1.5 | Toxic; urgent intervention required [^113zCJ65] |

---

## Factors influencing optimal lithium levels

Several factors influence the **optimal lithium level**:

- **Age**: Older adults often require lower doses and may show toxicity at lower levels [^114Dyu5n].
- **Renal function**: Impaired renal function increases lithium levels and toxicity risk; monitor closely and adjust dose [^116DjTe8].
- **Drug interactions**: NSAIDs, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs can raise lithium levels; monitor and adjust as needed [^116bx16Z].
- **Patient sensitivity**: Some patients exhibit toxicity at levels within the therapeutic range [^113yhvMv].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Frequency**: Monitor serum lithium every 3–6 months in stable patients; more frequently during dose changes, illness, or medication changes [^114Dyu5n].
- **Timing**: Draw trough levels 11–14 hours after the last dose [^1176Lmg5].
- **Adjustment**: Titrate to the lowest effective dose within the therapeutic range, considering clinical response and side effects [^114Dyu5n].

---

## Risks associated with suboptimal levels

Subtherapeutic levels (** < 0.6 mEq/L**) increase the risk of relapse and recurrence of manic or depressive episodes, whereas **supratherapeutic levels (> 1.2 mEq/L)** heighten toxicity risk — including renal impairment, neurotoxicity, and cardiovascular effects — and require prompt intervention [^113gg5wL] [^115WWKxG].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring; adjust dose as renal clearance changes [^112sR4tr].
- **Elderly**: Start low, go slow; monitor renal function and lithium levels frequently [^112TbVPg].
- **Renal impairment**: Avoid use if CrCl < 30 mL/min; use lower doses and monitor closely if CrCl 30–60 mL/min [^116DjTe8].

---

The optimal lithium level for maintenance therapy is **0.6–0.8 mEq/L** [^114bTgzQ], with higher levels (1.0–1.5 mEq/L) reserved for short-term acute mania management [^114YLU5S]. Individualize dosing, monitor closely, and adjust for age, renal function, and drug interactions to balance efficacy and safety [^1176Lmg5].

In geriatrics, refer to adult dosing and usually require lower doses because of age-related reduction in GFR. Renal guidance states no adjustment for CrCl ≥ 60 ml/min, initiate lower dose for CrCl 30– < 60 ml/min, and avoid for CrCl < 30 ml/min. Clinically, lithium is beneficial in preventing recurrence of manic and depressed episodes; use serum levels to guide dosing with an optimal maintenance dose of 0.6–0.8 mEq/L, avoid levels over 1.0 mEq/L if possible due to higher risk of eventual kidney harm, and obtain serum levels 11–14 hours after the last dose.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute Mania

Optimal patient response to lithium carbonate usually can be established and maintained with 600 mg t.i.d. Such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium level ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq./l. Dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and of serum lithium levels is necessary. Serum levels should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

Long term Control

The desirable lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq./l. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 300 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months.

Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels of 1.0 to 1.5 mEq./l. Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by other patients.

N.B.

Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8–12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.

Long-Term Control

The desirable serum lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 900 mg to 1200 mg per day in divided doses will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months.

Patients unusually sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels below 1 mEq/L.

Important Considerations

Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8 to 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.
Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by younger patients.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Doses of controlled-release tablets are usually given b.i.d. (approximately 12-hour intervals). When initiating therapy with controlled-release lithium, dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response.

When switching a patient from immediate-release capsules to Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets, give the same total daily dose when possible. Most patients on maintenance therapy are stabilized on 900 mg daily, e.g. Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets, 450 mg b.i.d. When the previous dosage of immediate-release lithium is not a multiple of 450 mg, e.g., 1,500 mg, initiate Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets at the multiple of 450 mg nearest to, but below, the original daily dose, i.e., 1,350 mg. When the 2 doses are unequal, give the larger dose in the evening. In the above example, with a total daily dose of 1,350 mg, generally 450 mg of Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets should be given in the morning and 900 mg of Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets in the evening. If desired, the total daily dose of 1,350 mg can be given in three equal 450 mg doses of Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets. These patients should be monitored at 1- to 2-week intervals, and dosage adjusted if necessary, until stable and satisfactory serum levels and clinical state are achieved.

When patients require closer titration than that available with doses of Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets in increments of 450 mg, immediate-release capsules should be used.

Acute Mania

Optimal patient response to Lithium Carbonate Extended-Release Tablets can usually be established and maintained with 1800 mg per day in divided doses. Such doses will normally produce the desired serum lithium level ranging between 1 and 1.5 mEq/L.

Dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and serum lithium levels is necessary. Serum levels should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

### Lithium carbonate (Lithobid) [^115awaZn]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute Mania

Optimal patient response can usually be established with 1800 mg/day in the following dosages:

Such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium concentration ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq/L. Dosage must be individualized according to serum concentrations and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and of serum lithium concentrations is necessary. Serum concentrations should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum concentrations and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

Long-Term Control

Desirable serum lithium concentrations are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L which can usually be achieved with 900 to 1200 mg/day. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but generally the following dosages will maintain this concentration:

Serum lithium concentrations in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months. Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations of 1.0 to 1.5 mEq/L. Geriatric patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum concentrations ordinarily tolerated by other patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Important Considerations

Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8 to 12 hours after previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.

VA/DoD 2022 MDD guideline — lithium augmentation: An SR by Nelson et al. (2014) evaluated nine RCTs of lithium augmentation of antidepressants for the treatment of MDD. Dosing of lithium in the selected trials ranged from 600 mg to 900 mg per day, and lithium augmentation resulted in a reduction in depressive symptoms with a clinically meaningful NNT of five patients, although Papadimitropoulou et al. (2017) found no difference in symptom improvement and remission in patients who received lithium augmentation versus placebo augmentation. Lithium usage requires monitoring of lithium blood levels (therapeutic blood level is between 0.6 – < 1.0 milliequivalents per liter [meq/L] while potentially toxic blood levels are > 1.5 mEq/L), and monitoring of thyroid function.

VA/DoD Suicide Risk CPG — lithium for mood disorders states: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against lithium to reduce the risk of suicide or suicide attempts for patients with mood disorders. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence cited includes an SR by Huang et al. (2022) of five RCTs reporting (OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.06–0.97), while an SR by Nabi et al. (2022) found the pooled suicide rate with lithium (0.2%) versus placebo or TAU (0.4%) with no difference (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.03–2.49; p = 0.45); for suicide attempts, Nabi et al. reported a lack of benefit (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.6–2.1) and Huang et al. found similar effects (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.37–1.73). The 2019 VA/DoD Suicide Risk CPGm provided a Weak for recommendation for lithium to decrease risk of death by suicide, but a larger, more contemporary analysis failed to find a difference in suicide rate for lithium compared with placebo or TAU. Safety and feasibility notes include large variation in patient preferences with potential side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal upset, tremor, polyuria, polydipsia, weight gain, hypothyroidism, leukocytosis), that lithium has a narrow therapeutic window requiring blood level monitoring, that caution should be used with medical comorbidities and lower dosages are generally required in elderly populations, and that blood level monitoring might negatively impact adherence.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The occurrence and severity of adverse reactions are generally directly related to serum lithium concentrations as well as to individual patient sensitivity to lithium, and generally occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher concentrations.

Adverse reactions may be encountered at serum lithium levels below 1.5 mEq/L. Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at levels from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L, and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at levels of 2 mEq/L and above.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase, and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, cessation of lithium therapy may be required.

Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium levels below 2 mEq/L. At higher levels, ataxia, giddiness, tinnitus, blurred vision and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium levels above 3 mEq/L may produce a complex clinical picture, involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium levels should not be permitted to exceed 2 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of lithium as a treatment for acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients (ages 7 to ≤ 18 years) was demonstrated in an 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study (NCT01166425). In this study, 81 patients with a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of 20 or more were randomized to receive lithium or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Patients weighing more than 30 kg started lithium at 300 mg three times daily (900 mg/day) and could increase their dose by 300 mg every 3 days. Patients weighing 20 to 30 kg started lithium at 300 mg twice daily (600 mg/day) and could increase their dose by 300 mg weekly. No patients weighing less than 20 kg were enrolled. Lithium (mean serum level 0.98 ± 0.47 mEq/L) was statistically significantly superior to placebo in decreasing acute mania or mixed states as measured by the YMRS (see Table 5).

In a 28-week randomized withdrawal analysis, 31 pediatric patients stabilized on lithium were assigned to either continue lithium or switch to placebo. The group receiving lithium demonstrated superiority to those receiving placebo in all-cause discontinuation (see Table 5).

2.1 Pre-treatment Screening

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concurrent medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

See Table 1 for dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years).

Obtain serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose and regularly until patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage.

Each 5 mL of Lithium Oral Solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+) which is equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate. See Table 2 for lithium carbonate and lithium oral solution dose conversion.

Table 2. Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Oral Solution Dose Conversion

2.3 Serum Lithium Monitoring

Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.

In addition to regular monitoring of serum lithium concentrations for patients on maintenance treatment, serum lithium concentrations should be monitored after any change in dosage, concurrent medication (e.g., diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, renin-angiotensin system antagonists, or metronidazole), marked increase or decrease in routinely performed strenuous physical activity (such as an exercise program) and in the event of a concomitant disease [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations that are within what is considered the therapeutic range. Geriatric patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum concentrations ordinarily tolerated by other patients [see Specific Populations (8.5)].

VA/DoD suicide risk guideline — lithium in mood disorders: Lithium might be particularly useful for the management of bipolar disorder, but providers should consider the use of lithium on an individualized basis using shared decision making with careful consideration of potential alternative treatment options. The Work Group notes this is a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation and that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The benefits of lithium for decreasing the risk of suicide or suicide attempts were balanced with the potential harm of adverse events. Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against lithium to reduce the risk of suicide or suicide attempts for patients with mood disorders.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions are seldom encountered at serum lithium levels below 1.5 mEq./l., except in the occasional patient sensitive to lithium. Mild to moderate toxic reactions may occur at levels from 1.5–2.5 mEq./l., and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at levels from 2.0–2.5 mEq./l., depending upon individual response to the drug.

Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase, and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration.

These side effects are an inconvenience rather than a disabling condition, and usually subside with continued treatment or a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of dosage is indicated.

Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium levels below 2.0 mEq./l. At higher levels, giddiness, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus, and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium levels above 3.0 mEq./l. may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium levels should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq./l. during the acute treatment phase.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^115Gz5wo]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — implementation considerations for lithium and quetiapine: Explaining use of lithium to patients can be time intensive, and the prescribing process and monitoring of lithium might take more time than with quetiapine and most other bipolar mania medications. Therefore, providers might be reluctant to prescribe lithium and might prefer simpler medications to administer even if they are less evidence based, and more resources are needed to complete the required monitoring, laboratory testing, and education for the proper use of lithium to maximize effectiveness and safety; however, both lithium and quetiapine are available as inexpensive generic products. Neither lithium nor quetiapine has long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations, so if that kind of formulation is needed for adherence, other options must be considered, and in some prison settings, the use of quetiapine might be restricted or prohibited because of the reputation for its being subject to diversion and nonmedical use. Large observational studies from U.S. and European sites found that in community samples of individuals with BD (bipolar disorder) individuals receiving lithium as monotherapy were less likely to need additions to their drug regimens in a one-year follow-up than individuals on other bipolar medications; these studies were outside the scope of the systematic evidence review and were not considered in developing this recommendation, but they add support for the use of lithium as a maintenance treatment.

2.4 Dosage Adjustments during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period

If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed in a pregnant woman because renal lithium clearance increases during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or diuretic administration. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, decrease or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date to reduce neonatal concentrations and reduce the risk of maternal lithium intoxication due to the change in vascular volume which occurs during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases and the renal clearance of lithium may decrease to pre-pregnancy concentrations. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments for Patients with Renal Impairment

Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with dosages less than those for patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

The evidence for this was "categorized as Reviewed, New-added", and "The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low". In weighing benefits and harms, "The benefits of olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone LAI slightly outweighed the potential harms, which mostly include adverse effects (especially for olanzapine) and potential failure to prevent episodes of depression (especially for oral paliperidone, or risperidone LAI)". Safety and practicality notes include that "A small but significant risk of tardive dyskinesia occurs with SGAs", "Risperidone LAI was associated with a higher incidence of prolactin level elevation than placebo", and "prolactin elevation is greater with risperidone and paliperidone than with olanzapine", as well as costs: "Added costs of the product itself and administrative requirements to have appointments and staff to administer the injections will be associated with risperidone LAI. The two oral medications are generic products of much lower cost".

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Dosage and Administration:

Advise patients that lithium is a mood stabilizer, and should only be taken as directed. Emphasize the importance of compliance with the prescribed treatment and to not adjust the dose of lithium without first consulting their healthcare provider. Inform patients that they will need to have regular blood draws to determine if their dose of lithium is appropriate.

Instruct patients not to double the dose if a dose is missed, due to the complexity of individualized dosing and potential for lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Lithium Toxicity:

Inform patients on adverse reactions related to lithium toxicity that require medical attention. Advise patients to discontinue lithium treatment and contact their healthcare provider if clinical signs of lithium toxicity such as diarrhea, vomiting, tremor, lack of muscle coordination, drowsiness, abnormal heart rhythm or muscular weakness occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Lithium-Induced Polyuria:

Counsel patients on the adverse reactions related to lithium-induced polyuria, when to seek medical attention, and the importance of maintaining normal diet with salt and staying hydrated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary:

Limited published data reports the presence of lithium carbonate in human milk with breast milk levels measured at 0.12 to 0.7 mEq or 40 to 45% of maternal plasma levels. Infants exposed to lithium during breastfeeding may have plasma levels that are 30 to 40% of maternal plasma levels. Signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity such as hypertonia, hypothermia, cyanosis, and ECG changes have been reported in some breastfed neonates and infants. Increased prolactin levels have been measured in lactating women, but the effects on milk production are not known. Breastfeeding is not recommended with maternal lithium use; however, if a woman chooses to breastfeed, the infant should be closely monitored for signs of lithium toxicity. Discontinue breastfeeding if a breastfed infant develops lithium toxicity.

Clinical Considerations:

Consider regular monitoring of lithium levels and thyroid function in a breastfed infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of lithium for monotherapy treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder and maintenance monotherapy of bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients ages 7 to 17 years of age have been established in an acute-phase clinical trial of 8 weeks in duration followed by a 28-week randomized withdrawal phase [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety and effectiveness of lithium has not been established in pediatric patients less than 7 years of age with bipolar I disorder.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of lithium carbonate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other treatment.

Lithium is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

As lithium is eliminated primarily through the kidney, lithium renal clearance is decreased in patients with abnormal renal function, and the risk of lithium intoxication increases considerably in this setting. Lithium should not be used in severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault), especially if the condition requires adherence to a low-sodium diet [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with lower doses of lithium and titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and for signs of lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Acute mania — We suggest lithium or quetiapine as monotherapy for acute mania (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). Planning for the pharmacologic treatment of acute mania should always consider that the treatments effective acutely will most often be continued after the resolution of mania and will form the basis of maintenance treatment for BD to prevent the recurrence of mania. For most individuals receiving treatment for BD, prevention of depressive episodes should be considered when formulating any treatment plan. Because lithium and quetiapine have demonstrated efficacy for acute mania, prevention of recurrence of episodes of mania, and prevention of recurrence of depression (with quetiapine additionally having efficacy for acute depression), the Work Group suggested their use as preferred or first line monotherapies for the treatment of acute mania. The Work Group acknowledged that lithium is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as maintenance monotherapy for BD; however, quetiapine is FDA-approved for maintenance treatment only as an adjunct to lithium or valproate.

In general, lamotrigine is well tolerated, but its use is associated with the rare occurrence of a serious and potentially fatal dermatological condition, SJS/TEN, and based on guidance from FDA approved product labeling, minimizing this risk requires that lamotrigine treatment starts at low, subtherapeutic doses with slow titration over 6 weeks to effective target doses. Overall, though, the Work Group concluded that, the benefits of adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine for individuals with bipolar depression outweigh the harms and burdens. In addition to its effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment of acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine has also demonstrated effectiveness as a monotherapy for the prevention of recurrent episodes of bipolar depression in BD 1 but not for mania, and early use during an acute episode might simplify long-term management by establishing a treatment regimen effective for maintenance as well as acute treatment.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action of lithium as a mood stabilizing agent is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

After oral administration, lithium is reported to be completely absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations (Tmax) occur 0.25 to 3 hours after oral administration of immediate release preparations and 2 to 6 hours after sustained-release preparations.

Distribution:

The distribution space of lithium approximates that of total body water, and the plasma protein binding is negligible. After equilibrium, the apparent volume of distribution is 0.7 to 1 L/kg.

Metabolism:

Lithium is not metabolized.

Excretion:

Lithium is primarily excreted in urine, proportionally to its serum concentration. Lithium is filtered by the glomerulus, and 80% is reabsorbed by passive diffusion in the proximal tubule. The elimination half-life of lithium is approximately 18 to 36 hours. Lithium excretion in feces is insignificant.

Specific Populations:

Pediatric Use: A pharmacokinetic study of lithium was performed in 39 subjects with bipolar I disorder. Both apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution increase as body weight increases. A lower dose in patients < 30 kg is necessary to achieve lithium exposures in pediatric patients similar to those observed in adults treated at recommended doses of lithium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The estimated plasma clearance was 0.59 L/h, 0.79 L/h and 1.17 L/h for pediatric patients weighing 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively.

Bipolar disorder — prevention of recurrence of bipolar depression: We recommend lamotrigine for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes (Strong for | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence suggests that treatment with lamotrigine can help prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes in individuals with BD, with trials reporting efficacy for preventing not just mood episodes in general, but depressive episodes in particular; limited comparative evidence found no difference when comparing lamotrigine to lithium, and studies included both BD 1 and BD 2 without distinguishing between groups. As lamotrigine monotherapy has demonstrated effectiveness for prevention of depression but not mania, the Work Group acknowledged that it should be of value specifically in individuals with BD 2. Patient-centered considerations include that the medication is in general well tolerated though a risk of serious side effects (e.g. SJS/TEN) exists, many individuals prefer not to take maintenance medication, and titration can be cumbersome because it requires slow titration over the course of many weeks.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline — monotherapy to prevent recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes: The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to these recommendations and categorized them as Reviewed, New-added, with confidence low for Recommendation 24 and moderate for Recommendation 25. The body of evidence had limitations because no studies directly compared the effectiveness of these medications against each other. Regarding Recommendation 24, the benefits of using lithium or quetiapine to prevent depressive episodes and for their effects on other outcomes (e.g., to decrease the risk of suicide, hospitalization) outweighed the potential harm of medication side effects, and regarding Recommendation 25, the benefits of using olanzapine to prevent depressive episodes and other outcomes slightly outweighed the potential harm of medication side effects. Patient values and preferences varied due to potential side effects, the need for occasional laboratory monitoring, and some individuals' preference against maintenance treatment. Thus, the Work Group made the following recommendations: We suggest lithium or quetiapine as monotherapy for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes; and if lithium or quetiapine is not selected based on patient preferences and characteristics, we suggest olanzapine as monotherapy for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes.

### Ziprasidone mesylate (Geodon) [^112EyUPr]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

2.1	Schizophrenia

Dose Selection

GEODON Capsules should be administered at an initial daily dose of 20 mg twice daily with food. In some patients, daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status up to 80 mg twice daily. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steady-state is achieved within 1 to 3 days. In order to ensure use of the lowest effective dose, patients should ordinarily be observed for improvement for several weeks before upward dosage adjustment.

Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 20 mg to 100 mg twice daily in short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials. There were trends toward dose response within the range of 20 mg to 80 mg twice daily, but results were not consistent. An increase to a dose greater than 80 mg twice daily is not generally recommended. The safety of doses above 100 mg twice daily has not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials. see Clinical Studies (14.1)

Maintenance Treatment

While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with ziprasidone should remain on it, a maintenance study in patients who had been symptomatically stable and then randomized to continue ziprasidone or switch to placebo demonstrated a delay in time to relapse for patients receiving Geodon. No additional benefit was demonstrated for doses above 20 mg twice daily. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. see Clinical Studies (14.1)

2.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Acute Mixed or Manic Episodes and Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate)

Acute Treatment of Manic or Mixed Episodes

Dose Selection — Oral ziprasidone should be administered at an initial daily dose of 40 mg twice daily with food. The dose may then be increased to 60 mg or 80 mg twice daily on the second day of treatment and subsequently adjusted on the basis of tolerance and efficacy within the range 40 mg–80 mg twice daily. In the flexible-dose clinical trials, the mean daily dose administered was approximately 120 mg. see Clinical Studies (14.2)

Maintenance Treatment (as an adjunct to lithium or valproate)

Continue treatment at the same dose on which the patient was initially stabilized, within the range of 40 mg–80 mg twice daily with food. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment see Clinical Studies (14.2).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^115wscg4]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) maintenance — evidence and adverse effects for lithium, quetiapine, and olanzapine: Evidence suggests that treatment with lithium, quetiapine, or olanzapine can help prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes in individuals with BD. Evidence regarding which of the three medications is the most efficacious is mixed, though there is some evidence that quetiapine and olanzapine performed better than other SGAs in the prevention of depression. Of note, the studies referenced above included individuals with BD 1 and BD 2 and did not distinguish between the groups when presenting the results. These medications have side effect profiles that include sedation, risk of prolonged QTc intervals, and metabolic syndrome; however, olanzapine carries a much higher metabolic risk than quetiapine or lithium, and the metabolic effects of olanzapine are a strong counterbalance to its efficacy as monotherapy and are ultimately the reason why the Work Group decided to suggest this drug as a less favorable alternative than lithium and quetiapine.

### Treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112XAxU7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) in adults — We suggest that clinicians use lithium (vs no treatment) for the treatment of Kleine-Levin syndrome in adults. (CONDITIONAL) This medication has a black box warning stating that lithium toxicity is closely related to serum lithium concentrations and can occur at doses close to therapeutic concentrations; the accessibility of facilities to conduct prompt and accurate serum lithium determinations should be determined before initiating therapy. Based on animal studies, lithium may cause fetal harm, and human studies suggest fetal harm but are insufficient to determine risk. The TF identified 1 prospective, open-label, single-center study that demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in disease severity, with no serious adverse events reported and most common adverse effects being tremor, polyuria-polydipsia, diarrhea, and subclinical hypothyroidism; there was no report of lithium toxicity in this study. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and of serum lithium concentrations is necessary, and serum concentrations should be determined twice per week during the acute phase and until the serum concentrations and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized. The overall quality of evidence was very low, the balance of risks and harms is likely different for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and while costs may vary, the majority of patients would most likely use lithium compared to no treatment for their KLS.

7.5	Lithium

Ziprasidone at a dose of 40 mg twice daily administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450 mg twice daily for 7 days did not affect the steady-state level or renal clearance of lithium. Ziprasidone dosed adjunctively to lithium in a maintenance trial of bipolar patients did not affect mean therapeutic lithium levels.

7.6	Oral Contraceptives

studies have revealed no effect of ziprasidone on the pharmacokinetics of estrogen or progesterone components.

### Practice parameter for the psychiatric assessment and management of physically ill children and adolescents [^116m1aqj]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medication selection and pharmacokinetics in physically ill children and adolescents emphasize that "psychotropic medication levels are not consistent indicators of either efficacy or toxicity in physically ill patients" and "it is generally preferable to choose a medication with a short half-life and attempt to avoid introducing more than one medication at a time". When possible, medications "should be selected that can be administered in a single or divided dose, are easily titrated to an ideal dose, and do not require frequent laboratory monitoring", and "Multiple medications and demanding treatment regimens threaten adherence". It is helpful to follow the maxim "start low, go slow" when initiating medication in children with "hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiac diseases", and to consider routes and side effects; medications can be given by "oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, transdermal, and sublingual" routes. Most psychoactive drugs are "80% to 95% bound to protein" "with the exception of lithium, methylphenidate, venlafaxine, divalproex sodium, gabapentin, and topiramate"; "The unbound drug is typically pharmacologically active" and reduced "albumin binding… necessitating adjustments to medication dosages". Medications are "absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and excreted through the kidneys", and clinicians should be aware of effects on hepatic metabolism, renal excretion, and discontinuation effects such as "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome". For interactions, "The hepatic CYP450 system is responsible for most metabolic drug interactions", uridine glucuronosyltransferase enzymes generally play "a minor metabolic role" though lamotrigine, morphine, and lorazepam are primarily metabolized by them, and "P-glycoproteins… function as 'gatekeepers' for CYP3A4 metabolism".

### Lithium carbonate [^116bx16Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Caution should be used when lithium and diuretics are used concomitantly because diuretic-induced sodium loss may reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase serum lithium levels with risk of lithium toxicity. Patients receiving such combined therapy should have serum lithium levels monitored closely and the lithium dosage adjusted if necessary.

Lithium levels should be closely monitored when patients initiate or discontinue NSAID use. In some cases, lithium toxicity has resulted from interactions between an NSAID and lithium. Indomethacin and piroxicam have been reported to increase significantly steady-state plasma lithium concentrations. There is also evidence that other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, have the same effect. In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg b.i.d. with celecoxib 200 mg b.i.d. as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.

Concomitant use of lithium with a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and dosage changes.

Concurrent use of metronidazole with lithium may provoke lithium toxicity due to reduced renal clearance. Patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely.

There is evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as enalapril and captopril, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, such as losartan, may substantially increase steady-state plasma lithium levels, sometimes resulting in lithium toxicity. When such combinations are used, lithium dosage may need to be decreased, and plasma lithium levels should be measured more often.

Concurrent use of calcium channel blocking agents with lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxicity in the form of ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or tinnitus. Caution is recommended. Concomitant administration of lithium with serotonergic drugs can precipitate serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during lithium initiation. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of lithium and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs. Examples of serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).

The following drugs can lower serum lithium concentrations by increasing urinary lithium excretion: acetazolamide, urea, xanthine preparations and alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate.

Concomitant administration of methyldopa, phenytoin, or carbamazepine with lithium may increase the risk of toxic effects of these drugs.

Concomitant extended use of iodide preparations, especially potassium iodide, with lithium may produce hypothyroidism.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^115rGAQZ]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder — Alternate monotherapies for acute mania: If lithium, quetiapine, olanzapine, paliperidone, or risperidone is not selected based on patient preferences and characteristics, we suggest aripiprazole, asenapine, carbamazepine, cariprazine, haloperidol, valproate, or ziprasidone as monotherapy for acute mania (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). The discussion notes that aripiprazole, asenapine, carbamazepine, cariprazine, haloperidol, valproate, and ziprasidone each have evidence to support their use for the treatment of acute mania, and because of lack of evidence from the systematic evidence review supporting the use of these drugs as maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder (BD), the Work Group decided to suggest these drugs as monotherapies if lithium, quetiapine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone are not selected.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^111ZH6WS]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder (BD) pharmacotherapy — treatment phases and maintenance-oriented selection are outlined as follows: There are three distinct phases of the pharmacological management for BD, including (1) treatment for acute mania, (2) treatment for acute depression, and (3) maintenance treatment to prevent recurrences of both mania or depression. To characterize breadth of effectiveness, the Work Group first examined the evidence for the effectiveness of medications used in the maintenance phase of treatment, considering prevention of mania and of bipolar depression as separate outcomes, and after identifying those that were effective for maintenance, examined the evidence for treatment of acute phases. The principle informing the recommendations was that treatments demonstrated to be effective for acute phases should be selected in accordance with their demonstrated effectiveness for the maintenance phase to improve long-term outcomes and to minimize the risk of harm (including side effect burdens) to individuals over the lifelong course of their illness. Evidence summarized indicates that some agents (quetiapine, lithium, and olanzapine) are effective for preventing both manic and depressive episodes, others (risperidone and paliperidone) are effective for preventing mania but not depression, and another (lamotrigine) is effective for preventing depression but not mania. The text notes that most individuals with BD spend more time in the maintenance and prevention phases than in periods of acute illness and warns that adding medications with recurrences can lead to unnecessary polypharmacy and an increase in the burden of side effects.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^111rejDc]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder maintenance — olanzapine is provided "some support" for preventing recurrence of mania but this is "weaker than that for lithium and quetiapine", and it "seemed as or more effective in preventing mania (RR for mania: 0.35) when compared with lithium (RR: 0.54) and quetiapine (RR: 0.56)". For bipolar depression, "the effect size for olanzapine is smaller than for quetiapine", and it "is not FDA-approved as a monotherapy for this indication". The Work Group found "more severe weight gain and related metabolic side effects than quetiapine or lithium", with studies showing "significantly greater weight gain with olanzapine than with lithium" and "substantially more weight gain and metabolic side effects" versus lithium or quetiapine; therefore, its metabolic effects were "the reason why the Work Group decided to suggest this drug alongside (and not higher than) the other medications in this recommendation".

### Lithium carbonate (lithane) [^116c8V4w]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Lithium should generally not be given to patients with significant renal or cardiovascular disease, severe debilitation or dehydration, or sodium depletion, and to patients receiving diuretics, since the risk of lithium toxicity is very high in such patients. If the psychiatric indication is life-threatening, and if such a patient fails to respond to other measures, lithium treatment may be undertaken with extreme caution, including daily serum lithium determinations and adjustment to the usually low doses ordinarily tolerated by these individuals. In such instances, hospitalization is a necessity.

Chronic lithium therapy may be associated with diminution of renal concentrating ability, occasionally presenting as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, with polyuria and polydipsia. Such patients should be carefully managed to avoid dehydration with resulting lithium retention and toxicity. This condition is usually reversible when lithium is discontinued.

Morphologic changes with glomerular and interstitial fibrosis and nephron atrophy have been reported in patients on chronic lithium therapy. Morphologic changes have also been seen in manic-depressive patients never exposed to lithium. The relationship between renal functional and morphologic changes and their association with lithium therapy have not been established.

When kidney function is assessed, for baseline data prior to starting lithium therapy or thereafter, routine urinalysis and other tests may be used to evaluate tubular function (e.g., urine specific gravity or osmolality following a period of water deprivation, or 24 hour urine volume) and glomerular function (e.g., serum creatinine or creatinine clearance). During lithium therapy, progressive or sudden changes in renal function, even within the normal range, indicate the need for reevaluation of treatment.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^114XnN4k]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — maintenance pharmacotherapy to prevent recurrence of mania: The Work Group suggests that prescribers refer to the options presented in Recommendation 18 (lithium and quetiapine) and Recommendation 19 (olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone LAI) for medications determined to be effective for the prevention of recurrence of mania and also to have other advantages. Asenapine ranked highest for relapse prevention versus placebo (RR: 0.21) based on only one 26-week trial, and the authors also noted that this study might be subject to performance and detection biases because of asenapine's distinctive side effect of oral hypoesthesia, which made the study difficult to blind. Aripiprazole monthly LAI also ranked high (RR: 0.30) but this was based on only one study in which more than half the patients on aripiprazole dropped out, and similarly to the other medications in this recommendation, it showed no efficacy for preventing depression. Oral aripiprazole was slightly lower in efficacy for mania maintenance, also based on only one study. Valproate ranked lowest for mania prevention (RR: 0.64) with the estimate based on only one placebo-controlled study; the use of valproate is off-label and evidence supporting its use was marginal, therefore other options with greater efficacy should be considered instead. Carbamazepine has not been studied as a maintenance monotherapy versus placebo, but in a comparison trial with lithium both appeared equally effective, and lurasidone had no demonstrated efficacy for maintenance.

### Diflunisal [^113jE8zD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.

Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

NSAIDs

The administration of diflunisal to normal volunteers receiving indomethacin decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin. In some patients the combined use of indomethacin and diflunisal has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Therefore, indomethacin and diflunisal tablets should not be used concomitantly.

The concomitant use of diflunisal tablets and other NSAIDs is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy. The following information was obtained from studies in normal volunteers.

Sulindac

The concomitant administration of diflunisal and sulindac in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.

Naproxen

The concomitant administration of diflunisal and naproxen in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide metabolite. Naproxen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal.

Oral Anticoagulants

In some normal volunteers, the concomitant administration of diflunisal and warfarin, acenocoumarol, or phenprocoumon resulted in prolongation of prothrombin time. This may occur because diflunisal competitively displaces coumarins from protein binding sites. Accordingly, when diflunisal tablets are administered with oral anticoagulants, the prothrombin time should be closely monitored during and for several days after concomitant drug administration. Adjustment of dosage of oral anticoagulants may be required. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.

Tolbutamide

In diabetic patients receiving diflunisal and tolbutamide, no significant effects were seen on tolbutamide plasma levels or fasting blood glucose.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

Bipolar disorder — efficacy and harms of antipsychotics added to lithium or valproate for preventing recurrence of mania: Aripiprazole had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 for reducing rates of mania in three pooled studies (n = 771) and also decreased relapses to depression (HR: 0.46). Olanzapine increased the time to recurrence of any mood episode but had considerable metabolic side effects with 35% of participants gaining significant weight. Quetiapine had the strongest evidence for preventing mania (HR: 0.27) and depression (HR: 0.29) in the studies (n = 1,246), but caused weight gain. Only one study investigated ziprasidone and found prevention of mania (HR: 0.46) with no effect on depression. Haloperidol and asenapine have not been studied in combination with lithium or valproate for prevention, and risperidone and paliperidone added no benefit for the prevention of mania. Patient preferences vary regarding adding another medication; generally, there are more side effects when a second medication is added, and some second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) cause weight gain and metabolic side effects, whereas others might cause unwanted stimulation or akathisia.

### Screening for depression and suicide risk in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114CJBNu]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF depression and suicide risk — harms of pharmacotherapy and suicide-related interventions are summarized as follows: Twenty-two systematic reviews and 1 cohort study addressed harms of pharmacotherapy in adults and perinatal persons, evaluating selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other second-generation antidepressants with outcomes including adverse events and suicidality. SSRIs compared with placebo were associated with increased serious adverse events (OR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.12–1.72]; 44 RCTs; I2 = 0%). Evidence also reported a small absolute increase in risk of suicide attempts with second-generation antidepressant use among adults up to 24 years (OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.09–2.15] [n = 41 861]). Short-term harms of suicide risk screening in primary care showed no statistically significant differences over 2 weeks' follow-up among patients who screened positive for depression (n = 443), despite higher absolute scores on 2 of 3 suicidal ideation measures compared with no screening. In suicide prevention RCTs, lithium had higher rates of nonserious adverse events (75.7% with lithium, 69% with placebo) and serious adverse events (38.8% with lithium, 34.1% with placebo), with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (1.2% with lithium, 1.5% with placebo). In a large trial (n = 1882), a care management intervention had no impact on suicide attempts (hazard ratio, 1.07 [97.5% CI, 0.84 to 1.37]; p = 0.52), whereas a low-intensity online skills training intervention was associated with increased suicide attempts (hazard ratio, 1.29 [97.5% CI, 1.02 to 1.64]; p = 0.02).

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113ftRYb]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are outlined across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects with mitigation where stated. Thiazide-type diuretics with cholestyramine produce decreased absorption leading to reduced BP lowering, and methyldopa with iron salts decreases absorption leading to reduced BP lowering. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of several antihypertensives; to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. With potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), furosemide has increased absorption with increased clinical effects and the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. CYP2D6 inhibitors with bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol cause increased BB concentration leading to enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia). CYP3A4 inhibitors with diltiazem or verapamil increase nondihydropyridine concentration, whereas CYP3A4 inducers decrease nondihydropyridine CCB concentration leading to reduced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases tacrolimus or cyclosporine concentrations with increased risk for side effects. Lithium with thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reduces lithium clearance leading to increased lithium toxicity risk. Via P-gp inhibition, verapamil increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil and carvedilol increase digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### Sotagliflozin (Inpefa) [^1118sa6L]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Digoxin: Monitor digoxin levels. (7.1)

Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase Inducers (e.g., rifampin): Sotagliflozin exposure is reduced. Consider monitoring of clinical status. (7.2)

Lithium: Monitor serum lithium concentrations. (7.3)

7.1 Digoxin

There is an increase in the exposure of digoxin when coadministered with INPEFA 400 mg. Patients taking INPEFA with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Inducer

Glucuronidation by UGT1A9, to form the 3-O-glucuronide, was identified as a major metabolic pathway for sotagliflozin. The coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of UGTs, with a single dose of 400 mg sotagliflozin resulted in a decrease in the exposure to sotagliflozin. This decrease in exposure to sotagliflozin may decrease efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Lithium

Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during INPEFA initiation and dosage changes.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^114aFHnt]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Drug–drug interactions that may limit effectiveness and safety — concurrent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use has been thought to potentially diminish psilocybin's effects, but current evidence is mixed; escitalopram pretreatment for two weeks showed no reduction in positive mood yet a significant decrease in anxiety versus placebo, and in 19 patients on chronic SSRIs psilocybin treatment produced a 42% reduction in depression severity at week 3; washouts may not be practical or safe, so planning any tapering or discontinuation beforehand whenever possible is a critical safety concern; additionally, internet self-reports suggest psilocybin co-administration with lithium, but not lamotrigine, may increase seizure risk.

### Dextrose and sodium chloride [^113Uj84r]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Other Products that Affect Glycemic Control, Vasopressin or Fluid and/or Electrolyte Balance: Monitor blood glucose concentrations, fluid balance serum electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance. (7.1)
Lithium: Decreased lithium concentrations with concomitant use; monitor serum lithium concentrations. (7.2)

7.1 Other Products that Affect Glycemic Control, Vasopressin or Fluid and/or Electrolyte Balance

Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection can affect glycemic control, vasopressin and fluid and/or electrolyte balance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6)]. Monitor blood glucose concentrations, fluid balance, serum electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance when using Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients treated with other substances that affect glycemic control, vasopressin or fluid and/or electrolyte balance.

7.2 Lithium

Renal sodium and lithium clearance may be increased during administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection resulting in decreased serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentrations during concomitant use.

### Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^115eppWT]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Antidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin): since thiazides may elevate blood glucose levels, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be necessary.

Calcium Salts: Increased serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion may occur. If calcium must be prescribed, monitor serum calcium levels and adjust calcium dosage accordingly.

Cardiac Glycosides: enhanced possibility of digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia. Monitor potassium levels (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Captopril).

Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.

Diazoxide: enhanced hyperglycemic, hyperuricemic, and antihypertensive effects. Be cognizant of possible interaction; monitor blood glucose and serum uric acid levels.

Lithium: diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Captopril: Lithium).

MAO Inhibitors: dosage adjustments of one or both agents may be necessary since hypotensive effects are enhanced.

### Lithium carbonate (Lithobid) [^116bJN8R]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Diuretic-, ACE-, and ARB-induced sodium loss may increase serum lithium concentrations. Start with lower doses of lithium or reduce dosage, while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and signs of lithium toxicity. See WARNINGS for additional caution information.

Concomitant administration of lithium with serotonergic drugs can precipitate serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during lithium initiation. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of lithium and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs. Examples of serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).

Concomitant administration of methyldopa, phenytoin, or carbamazepine with lithium may increase the risk of adverse reactions with these drugs.

The following drugs can lower serum lithium concentrations by increasing urinary lithium excretion: acetazolamide, urea, xanthine preparations, and alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate.

Concomitant extended use of iodide preparations, especially potassium iodide, with lithium may produce hypothyroidism.

Concurrent use of calcium channel blocking agents with lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxicity in the form of ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or tinnitus.

Concurrent use of metronidazole with lithium may provoke lithium toxicity due to reduced renal clearance. Patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely.

Concurrent use of fluoxetine with lithium has resulted in both increased and decreased serum lithium concentrations. Patients receiving such combined therapy should be monitored closely.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Lithium levels should be closely monitored when patients initiate or discontinue NSAID use. In some cases, lithium toxicity has resulted from interactions between a NSAID and lithium. Indomethacin and piroxicam have been reported to increase significantly steady-state plasma lithium concentrations. There is also evidence that other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, have the same effect. In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg BID with celecoxib 200 mg BID as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.

Concomitant use of lithium with a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and dosage changes.

Lithium may impair mental and/or physical abilities. Patients should be cautioned about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery).

### Diclofenac sodium delayed release tablets, capsaicin cream (dermasilkRx dicloPak) [^115MytSA]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that diclofenac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, RENAL EFFECTS), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

Lithium: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.

Warfarin: The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.

CYP2C9 Inhibitors or Inducers: Diclofenac is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, predominantly by CYP2C9. Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. voriconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of diclofenac whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g. rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of diclofenac. Use caution when dosing diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers; a dosage adjustment may be warranted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Drug Interactions).

### Quinapril hydrochloride / hydrochlorothiazide [^113TqftF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Lithium

Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS.

### Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (Lotensin HCT) [^113uqud7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Neprilysin Inhibitors:

Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema.

Interactions Common for Both Benazepril and Hydrochlorothiazide

Potassium Supplements and Potassium -Sparing Diuretics: Concomitant use with Lotensin HCT may effect potassium levels. Monitor potassium periodically.

mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor s: Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS).

Lithium: Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Monitor lithium levels when used concomitantly with Lotensin HCT.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual Blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypertension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on Lotensin HCT and other agents that affect the RAS.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^113F8pN3]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar depression — lurasidone efficacy: An SR by Bahji et al. (2020) evaluated two RCTs providing moderate quality evidence for effectiveness for acute bipolar depression, with SMD for improvement in depressive symptoms over 2–36 weeks of 1.15 (95% CI: 0.37–1.92); other findings included an OR of 2.53 (95% CI 1.88–3.39) for response and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.04–3.03) for remission, and findings for studies limited to BD 1 were similar. Another SR by Wang et al. (2020) identified seven randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in BD 1 with six weeks follow-up, providing low quality evidence for effect on acute bipolar depression and moderate quality for other outcomes, with significant improvements in provider-rated depressive symptoms; relative risks were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.46–2.05) for treatment responses and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.38–1.79) for remission. These findings were strengthened by an additional moderate quality RCT reporting significant benefits for provider-rated depressive symptoms at six weeks follow-up, and none of the available studies evaluated efficacy specifically in individuals with BD 2.

### Sulindac [^116xAJGs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that sulindac tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

DMSO

DMSO should not be used with sulindac. Concomitant administration has been reported to reduce the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite and potentially reduce efficacy. In addition, this combination has been reported to cause peripheral neuropathy.

Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.

Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

NSAIDs

The concomitant use of sulindac tablets with other NSAIDs is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy.

Oral anticoagulants

Although sulindac and its sulfide metabolite are highly bound to protein, studies in which sulindac tablets were given at a dose of 400 mg daily have shown no clinically significant interaction with oral anticoagulants. However, patients should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required. Special attention should be paid to patients taking higher doses than those recommended and to patients with renal impairment or other metabolic defects that might increase sulindac blood levels. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.

Oral hypoglycemic agents

Although sulindac and its sulfide metabolite are highly bound to protein, studies in which sulindac tablets were given at a dose of 400 mg daily, have shown no clinically significant interaction with oral hypoglycemic agents. However, patients should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no change in their hypoglycemic dosage is required. Special attention should be paid to patients taking higher doses than those recommended and to patients with renal impairment or other metabolic defects that might increase sulindac blood levels.

### Quinapril hcl and hydrochlorothiazide [^115ArXPE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

The hydrochlorothiazide component of Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets may decrease serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.

Therapy with Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be interrupted for a few days before carrying out tests of parathyroid function.

Drug Interactions

Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Coadministration of Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor.
