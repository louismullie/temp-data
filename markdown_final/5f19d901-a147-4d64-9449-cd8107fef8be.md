## Question

how to determine whether tremor is caused by an emergency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine whether a tremor represents a medical emergency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the time course and acuity of onset. Then, I should verify the presence of red flags indicating systemic toxicity or structural brain disease. Next, I will examine the tremor phenomenology and associated neurological signs to classify the syndrome. After that, I need to check for medication and metabolic causes. Finally, I will synthesize urgency levels and outline immediate actions, including when to image, when to treat in place, and when to transfer or consult urgently.

> Let me first confirm the time course because acuity is the primary determinant of urgency. Tremor evolving over hours to days is a movement disorder emergency until proven otherwise, whereas chronic or slowly progressive tremor is typically nonurgent outpatient care, and sudden onset in a child warrants expedited neurologic evaluation given the higher likelihood of serious pathology in pediatrics [^1145Pgxs] [^113vFfAo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to screen for systemic toxicity red flags that make tremor an emergency, including fever, autonomic instability, altered mental status, severe hyperthermia, rigidity, or seizures, which raise concern for serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or alcohol withdrawal, all of which require immediate intervention and often ICU-level care [^117MAoeh] [^116ajpGY] [^111Ygb8S] [^1145Pgxs].

> I will now examine the tremor phenomenology and associated signs to classify the syndrome. Rest tremor with bradykinesia and rigidity suggests parkinsonism and may be urgent if there is acute decompensation or DBS malfunction, whereas isolated bilateral postural/kinetic tremor without other signs favors essential tremor and is not an emergency, and high-frequency leg tremor on standing relieved by walking points to orthostatic tremor, which is distressing but not life-threatening [^114VhKUh] [^111Jf5Ls] [^111A1EvV].

> Wait, let me verify medication and metabolic contributors because these are common, reversible, and sometimes urgent. I should obtain a meticulous medication history including SSRIs/SNRIs, lithium, valproate, amiodarone, beta-agonists, dopamine antagonists, and stimulants, and I should order thyroid function, glucose, renal and hepatic panels, and electrolytes, adding catecholamines if pheochromocytoma is suspected and copper studies if dystonia or young age suggests Wilson disease, since correcting these can rapidly resolve tremor and prevent harm [^115dxVpp] [^111mEC1V] [^113y4zUM].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In children, any new tremor should prompt expedited neurologic referral, in pregnancy or postpartum I should consider eclampsia or drug withdrawal, in older adults I must avoid anchoring on "benign" ET because misdiagnosis is common and subtle bradykinesia may be missed, and in patients with DBS I should immediately suspect hardware failure or stimulation issues if there is abrupt worsening of tremor or parkinsonism [^113vFfAo] [^114iHP59] [^111A1EvV].

> I should double-check for functional or psychogenic tremor features when the story is atypical. Distractibility, entrainment, variability, and incongruence with organic disease support functional tremor, which is not an emergency but still warrants careful neurologic assessment and often targeted rehabilitation pathways rather than acute disease-directed interventions [^113XqbAf].

> Next, I should review imaging indications. Acute focal deficits, thunderclap headache, head trauma, or sudden severe tremor with encephalopathy justify urgent brain imaging to exclude stroke, hemorrhage, mass effect, or infection, whereas isolated chronic tremor without red flags does not require emergent imaging and can proceed with outpatient evaluation [^1145Pgxs].

> Let me synthesize urgency levels pragmatically. Immediate emergency care is required for tremor with features of serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, alcohol withdrawal delirium tremens, encephalopathy, status epilepticus, or acute focal deficits, urgent same-day evaluation is appropriate for abrupt severe tremor with autonomic changes, new rest tremor with bradykinesia, or suspected DBS malfunction, and routine outpatient care is appropriate for chronic isolated action tremor without systemic signs or progressive disability [^117MAoeh] [^116ajpGY] [^111A1EvV].

> But wait, what if the tremor is "just anxiety"? I need to ensure I do not dismiss a toxic or structural cause by attributing symptoms to anxiety alone, especially if there are autonomic changes, fever, rigidity, or altered cognition, because misclassification delays life-saving treatment for serotonin syndrome, NMS, or withdrawal states [^117MAoeh] [^116ajpGY] [^111Ygb8S].

> I will now outline immediate actions by scenario. For suspected serotonin syndrome or NMS I should stop offending agents, provide aggressive supportive care with temperature control, autonomic monitoring, and benzodiazepines, and admit to a monitored setting, for alcohol withdrawal I should use benzodiazepine protocols and escalate care if tremor and agitation persist despite treatment, for suspected DBS issues I should contact the implanting team urgently and obtain plain films to assess hardware, and for suspected Wilson disease I should order copper studies and arrange urgent hepatology and neurology input while initiating chelation if confirmed [^117MAoeh] [^116ajpGY] [^111A1EvV] [^113y4zUM].

> Hold on, I should verify that my diagnostic approach aligns with consensus. Using the MDS two-axis framework to classify tremor syndrome first and then pursue etiology helps avoid premature closure, and in diagnostically uncertain parkinsonian tremor, DAT-SPECT can be considered to distinguish PD from ET when management hinges on the result, though this is not an emergency test and should follow stabilization [^114id34R] [^1147YBZD].

> Finally, I need to ensure disposition is safe. Any patient with ongoing autonomic instability, inability to protect airway due to severe tremor or dysphagia, or unreliable follow-up should be admitted, whereas stable patients with clear nonemergent diagnoses can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up and explicit return precautions for worsening tremor, new neurological signs, fever, confusion, or autonomic symptoms [^116ajpGY] [^111A1EvV].

Tremor is an emergency when it is **new-onset, severe, or rapidly progressive** [^1145Pgxs], especially with **red flags** such as altered mental status, fever, rigidity, autonomic instability, focal deficits, or seizures [^117MAoeh]. Emergencies include serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, alcohol withdrawal, encephalitis, stroke, and structural lesions [^117MAoeh] [^116ajpGY] [^111Ygb8S]. Immediate evaluation is required for **acute severe tremor with systemic features**, **focal neurological signs**, or **recent medication changes** [^1145Pgxs]. Routine tremor without red flags is not urgent; urgent care is appropriate if disability is severe or diagnosis is uncertain [^1145Pgxs].

---

## Clinical features indicating tremor emergency

Certain features indicate a **tremor emergency** and require immediate medical attention:

- **New-onset, severe, or rapidly progressive tremor**: Especially if accompanied by systemic symptoms or neurological deficits [^1145Pgxs].

- **Altered mental status**: Confusion, delirium, or coma accompanying tremor [^117MAoeh].

- **Autonomic instability**: Hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, or hypotension [^117MAoeh].

- **Rigidity or muscle stiffness**: Particularly if associated with fever or autonomic instability [^notfound].

- **Seizures or convulsions**: Concurrent with tremor [^113y9TAq].

- **Focal neurological deficits**: Sudden onset of weakness, speech difficulties, or visual disturbances [^notfound].

- **Recent medication changes**: Initiation or adjustment of serotonergic, dopaminergic, or neuroleptic medications [^111pJBEm].

## Differential diagnosis of tremor emergencies

Several conditions can present with tremor and require **urgent evaluation and management**:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Urgency level** |
|-|-|-|
| Serotonin syndrome | - Tremor <br/> - Hyperreflexia <br/> - Clonus <br/> - Autonomic instability <br/> - Altered mental status | Emergency [^117MAoeh] |
| Neuroleptic malignant syndrome | - Tremor <br/> - Rigidity <br/> - Hyperthermia <br/> - Autonomic instability <br/> - Altered mental status | Emergency [^111Ygb8S] |
| Alcohol withdrawal delirium tremens | - Severe tremor <br/> - Agitation <br/> - Hallucinations <br/> - Autonomic instability | Emergency [^116ajpGY] |
| Encephalitis or meningitis | - Tremor <br/> - Fever <br/> - Altered mental status <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Focal deficits | Emergency [^113y9TAq] |
| Stroke or structural brain lesions | - Sudden onset tremor <br/> - Focal deficits <br/> - Headache <br/> - Altered consciousness | Emergency [^notfound] |
| Drug-induced tremor | - Tremor <br/> - Recent medication initiation or dose change <br/> - May have autonomic features | Urgent [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach to tremor emergencies

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause of tremor emergencies:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history of onset, progression, medication use, substance use, and associated symptoms. Physical examination should assess tremor characteristics, neurological deficits, autonomic instability, and signs of systemic illness [^115FZayg].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, thyroid function tests, glucose levels, toxicology screen, and medication levels if applicable [^111mEC1V].

- **Imaging studies**: Brain MRI or CT scan to exclude structural lesions, stroke, or mass effect [^114id34R].

- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: If seizures or encephalopathy are suspected [^113y9TAq].

- **Lumbar puncture**: If central nervous system infection is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies for tremor emergencies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: Immediate discontinuation of offending agents, aggressive supportive care, benzodiazepines for agitation, antipyretics for hyperthermia, and specific antidotes such as cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome or dantrolene for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^117MAoeh].

- **Alcohol withdrawal delirium tremens**: Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy, with close monitoring of vital signs and supportive care [^notfound].

- **Encephalitis or meningitis**: Empiric antibiotics and antiviral therapy, supportive care, and management of seizures if present [^notfound].

- **Stroke or structural lesions**: Immediate neurological consultation, possible thrombolysis or surgical intervention depending on the etiology [^notfound].

- **Drug-induced tremor**: Discontinuation or adjustment of the offending medication, supportive care, and monitoring for withdrawal symptoms [^111pJBEm].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis of tremor emergencies varies with the **underlying cause**, the **timeliness of intervention**, and the patient's **comorbidities**. Prompt recognition and management of conditions such as serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and alcohol withdrawal significantly improve outcomes. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to significant morbidity and mortality [^1145Pgxs].

Introduction

The cardinal motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are bradykinesia (slowness characterized by decreased velocity and amplitude of repetitive movements), rigidity (velocity-independent increased resistance to passive movement about a joint), and tremor (characteristically a resting tremor of 4–6 Hz frequency). These features, with the variable exception of tremor, are typically improved by treatment with levodopa, and in early disease, this beneficial response is well-maintained by intermittent dosing during waking hours. Over time, however, the duration and reliability of symptomatic benefit declines, leading to waking time being divided into time during which levodopa is providing good benefit, when responsive parkinsonian signs and symptoms are reduced and functional status is improved (ON), and time during which levodopa is not providing good benefit, when parkinsonian signs or symptoms re-emerge and functional status declines (OFF). Transitions between ON and OFF states are referred to as motor fluctuations.

There are several characteristic types of OFF. Gradual deterioration in the symptomatic response to a dose of levodopa prior to the next dose is commonly termed "wearing off" or "end-of-dose deterioration". In more advanced disease, the duration of the levodopa response can be significantly shortened and patients may experience very rapid transitions between ON and OFF, termed "ON-OFF fluctuations". Some patients can unexpectedly and suddenly transition from an ON state to an OFF state, unrelated to the timing of levodopa intake, and these OFF states are termed "sudden" or "random" OFFs. A "delayed ON" is said to occur when the time-to-ON following a levodopa dose is longer than usual, whereas a "dose failure" occurs when there is no benefit following a dose. A "partial ON" occurs when the benefit from a dose of levodopa is less robust than is typical for a given patient. The presence of OFF symptoms in the morning, prior to the first dose of levodopa, is commonly referred to as "early morning akinesia" or "early morning OFF" and is likely related to loss of benefit from the previous day's medication. For evaluations in clinical trials, patients may be seen in the so-called practically defined OFF state, in the morning after not having taken Parkinson's disease medications since the evening before, at least 12 h previously. Patients may also experience fluctuations in relation to other PD medications, especially apomorphine (as it also has robust efficacy) and less commonly in relation to other dopamine agonists.

### Essential tremor: a nuanced approach to the clinical features [^1126yXkc]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Click here to listen to the Podcast Essential tremor is the most common form of tremor in humans. Given neurologists' high exposure to this condition, and its seemingly straightforward phenotype, it might seem easy to diagnose. However, 30%-50% of patients labelled as having 'essential tremor' have other diagnoses, mostly Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The tremor of essential tremor is neither non-descript nor featureless but is multifaceted and highly patterned. This review focuses on its clinical features, beginning with a discussion of tremors and then briefly discussing its additional motor features, and presents several aids to help distinguish essential tremor from Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Careful attention to certain clinical nuances will aid the diagnosis and care of patients with essential tremor.

​Isolated tremor syndromes

In the left column of the algorithm, the isolated tremor syndromes are depicted.

The most likely diagnosis in a patient presenting with a bilateral upper limb action tremor is ET, as it has the highest prevalence, and the prevalence and severity increases with age. Bilateral action tremor is mandatory for this diagnosis. Formally, this tremor syndrome has at least 3 years of duration, (otherwise it ought to be called an isolated action tremor), without a sudden onset, stepwise deterioration or task or position specificity. The tremor can spread to other locations (eg, head, voice or lower limbs). It improves with the use of alcohol in 50% of the cases, although it should be noted that alcohol can also reduce other tremors due to its sedative effects. Furthermore, self-reported alcohol responsiveness correlates poorly with actual objectified responsiveness, so a history of alcohol sensitivity has limited value as a diagnostic tool. Half of the ET patients report a positive family history. Of the patients diagnosed with an ET syndrome at a tertiary referral centre, 42% had an intention tremor. In severe cases, a rest tremor can also be found (around 18%). In advanced disease, tandem gait abnormalities can be found.

### Deep brain stimulation for tremor [correction of trauma]: patient selection and evaluation [^1147QZ7p]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

The selection of patients with movement disorders for deep brain stimulation is becoming a common neurological and neurosurgical task. Deep brain stimulation is suitable for different forms of tremor, which can often not be treated with medication. This suitability applies for essential tremor, monosymptomatic tremor at rest, cerebellar or multiple sclerosis tremor, Holmes' tremor, primary writing tremor or tremor in neuropathies. The appropriate selection of patients is critical for the outcome of surgical relief of tremors. Considering the risks of any stereotactic intervention, the following must apply: (1) motor symptoms lead to a relevant disability in activities of daily living, despite optimal medical treatment; (2) biological age of the patient; (3) neurosurgical contraindications; (4) the patient is neither demented nor severely depressed. If these conditions are fulfilled, the individual chances of improvement of the target symptoms need to be checked, based on the following guidelines: (1) the kind of tremor, (2) the natural course of the tremor, (3) the chances for medical treatment in a particular patient, (4) the outcome of surgery in a specific condition, (5) the individual risks for a patient to suffer from complications. The outcome of surgery for tremor depends on the clinical type and distribution. Distal limb tremors are easier to treat than proximal limb tremors. Intention tremor is more difficult to treat than rest or postural tremor. The indication for surgical treatment depends on the analysis of the individual risk-benefit ratio, which also has to take into account the patients' social, professional, and familial background. The patient needs to be well informed about his individual risk-benefit ratio and of alternative treatments, before undergoing stereotactic surgery.

Syndromes attributable to monogenetic diseases or syndromes attributable to chromosomal aberrations are, with a few exceptions, not yet causally treatable.

If there are causal therapeutic approaches, i.e. if the etiology of the tremor is known (for example: side effect of a medication, concomitant symptom of another disease or syndrome, genetic cause, causal toxin), the tremor should be treated according to the needs of the condition and the individual suffering due to tremor.

Step 2: characterise the tremor clinically

The neurological examination is the key tool to establish a clinical tremor syndrome, that is, an axis 1 classification. This is of crucial importance, as the tremor syndrome is used in later steps to guide our choices for diagnostic tests to elucidate the underlying aetiology (ie, an axis 2 classification). In figure 2, we propose a practical clinical algorithm that helps to accurately diagnose a tremor syndrome. Before entering this algorithm, it is useful to characterise the tremor using the features outlined in box 1. The algorithm contains decision points in an order that facilitates 'short-cuts' to the diagnosis of a clinical tremor syndrome.

Functional tremor is depicted in green on the right side. *For example, mildly unsteady tandem gait, questionably abnormal posturing of a body part, mild cognitive impairment, questionable bradykinesia or rigidity and other mild neurological signs of unknown significance that do not suffice to make an additional syndrome classification or diagnosis. †For example, anxiety, fatigue, thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycaemia, pheochromocytoma, tremor-provoking medication (see table 1).

A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### New horizons in late-onset essential tremor: a pre-cognitive biomarker of dementia? [^113fBZAc]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Typical essential tremor

ET may start at any age from adolescence onwards and the prevalence increases from 0.04% in younger adults (20–40 years old), 3.1% in middle age (40–60 years), 5.5% in older adults aged above 65 and 22% in those aged above 95. Approximately 50% of people with ET have an autosomal-dominant family history of the disorder but despite this, the genetic causes remain somewhat elusive.

ET is characterised by a bilateral, symmetrical, upper limb kinetic and/or postural tremor of small amplitude (usually < 1 cm) and high frequency, in the range of 8–10 Hz. The amplitude of the kinetic tremor tends to be larger than the amplitude of postural tremor but the frequency is usually the same, suggesting a common central oscillatory circuit drives both tremors. ET may also cause a tremor in the neck, voice and legs, but the recent MDS consensus statement emphasises that the diagnosis of ET cannot be made when these tremors are present alone, without a bilateral upper limb tremor. Furthermore, it states at least a three year history of upper limb tremor is required for a confirmed ET diagnosis, and that when symptoms and signs compatible with ET are present but the duration is less than 3 years, the tremor diagnosis should be considered 'indeterminate'.

ET characteristically demonstrates alcohol sensitivity, with just a small amount of alcohol (usually 1–2 standard drinks) reducing tremor amplitude by 50–70%. The severity of typical ET progresses slowly over decades, with the amplitude slightly increasing and the frequency reducing, and, with ageing, there is a tendency for longstanding ET to also be present at rest.

As with other tremor disorders, the diagnosis of ET is made through clinical assessment — gathering evidence of key features such as family history of tremor, alcohol sensitivity and symmetrical upper limb tremor, as well as ascertaining that features of alternative diagnoses such as bradykinesia (Parkinson's disease), action-specific tremor during writing (dystonia) or ataxia (ET-Plus) are not present. Many clinicians supplement standard neurological examination with observation of handwriting, straight line and Archimedes spiral drawing tests to quantify and record aspects of tremor (Figure 1), looking for the typical unidirectional tremor of ET to support clinical acumen.

### Essential pitfalls in "essential" tremor [^116Cu73d]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although essential tremor has been considered the most common movement disorder, it has largely remained a diagnosis of exclusion: many tremor and nontremor features must be absent for the clinical diagnosis to stand. The clinical features of "essential tremor" overlap with or may be part of other tremor disorders and, not surprisingly, this prevalent familial disorder has remained without a gene identified, without a consistent natural history, and without an acceptable pathology or pathophysiologic underpinning. The collective evidence suggests that under the rubric of essential tremor there exists multiple unique diseases, some of which represent cerebellar dysfunction, but for which there is no intrinsic "essence" other than a common oscillatory behavior on posture and action. One approach may be to use the term essential tremor only as a transitional node in the deep phenotyping of tremor disorders based on historical, phenomenological, and neurophysiological features to facilitate its etiologic diagnosis or serve for future gene- and biomarker-discovery efforts. This approach deemphasizes essential tremor as a diagnostic entity and facilitates the understanding of the underlying disorders to develop biologically tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

Conclusions

We have proposed a stepwise diagnostic approach to patients presenting with upper limb tremor, to guide clinicians in establishing a clinical tremor syndrome and performing the relevant tests to determine its aetiology. The proposed diagnostic algorithm is in line with the latest Consensus Statementand encourages clinicians to make a distinction between isolated and combined tremor syndromes, based on clinical features. This is key, as this distinction subsequently informs our choices for diagnostic testing. We believe that our diagnostic algorithm will be useful to practising neurologists whether they have expertise in the field of movement disorders or not. The stepwise setup tapers diagnostic tests, starting with those tests that are easily available and indicated in most patients, and finishing with more specialised diagnostic procedures, including considerations for next-generation genetic testing. By following the presented steps, the long list of possible causes for tremor is reduced to manageable portions. We hope that the approach proposed in this article will decrease diagnostic uncertainty and increase the diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.

### Movement disorder emergencies [^113nzAMC]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Movement disorder emergencies include any movement disorder which evolves over hours to days, in which failure to appropriately diagnose and manage can result in patient morbidity or mortality. It is crucial that doctors recognize these emergencies with accuracy and speed by obtaining the proper history and by being familiar with the phenomenology of frequently encountered movements. These disorders will be discussed based on the most common associated involuntary movement, either parkinsonism, dystonia, chorea, tics or myoclonus, and, when available, review the workup and treatment options based on the current literature.

### Connecting tremors-a circuits perspective [^116HVcGW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Tremor is one of the most prevalent movement disorders in clinical practice. Here, we review new insights in the pathophysiology of tremor. We focus on the three most common tremor disorders: essential tremor (ET), dystonic tremor syndrome (DTS), and Parkinson's disease (PD) tremor.

Recent Findings

Converging evidence suggests that ET, DTS, and PD tremor are all associated with (partly) overlapping cerebral networks involving the basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Recent studies have assessed the role of these networks in tremor by measuring tremor-related activity and connectivity with electrophysiology and neuroimaging, and by perturbing network components using invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation. The cerebellum plays a more dominant and causal role in action tremors than in rest tremor, as exemplified by recent findings in ET, DTS, and re-emergent tremor in PD. Furthermore, the role of the cerebellum in DTS is related to clinical differences between patients, for example, whether or not the tremor occurs in a dystonic limb, and whether the tremor is jerky or sinusoidal.

Summary

Insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of tremor may provide a more direct window into mechanism-based treatment options than either the etiology or the clinical phenotype of a tremor syndrome.

ASTCT ICANS consensus grading for adults — grading is determined by the most severe domain finding and domain-specific criteria are defined. Depressed level of consciousness: grade 1 awakens spontaneously, grade 2 awakens to voice, grade 3 awakens only to tactile stimulus, and grade 4 patient is unarousable or requires vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli to arouse with stupor or coma. Seizures: grade 3 includes any clinical seizure (focal or generalized) that resolves rapidly or nonconvulsive seizures on EEG that resolve with intervention, and grade 4 includes life-threatening prolonged seizure (> 5 min) or repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without return to baseline in between; the text clarifies that a single clinical or subclinical electrographic seizure of any type is grade 3 and that prolonged or repetitive clinical or subclinical electrographic seizures without a return to baseline in between are grade 4. Motor findings contributing to grade 4 are deep focal motor weakness such as hemiparesis or paraparesis. Elevated ICP/cerebral edema: grade 3 is focal/local edema on neuroimaging and grade 4 is diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging; decerebrate or decorticate posturing; or cranial nerve VI palsy; or papilledema; or Cushing's triad. Notes specify that ICANS grade is determined by the most severe event, that a patient with an ICE score of 0 may be classified as grade 3 ICANS if awake with global aphasia or grade 4 ICANS if unarousable, and that tremor/myoclonus and intracranial hemorrhage are excluded from ICANS grading and may be graded by CTCAE v5.0.

### Differentiation and diagnosis of tremor [^112U7JpS]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Tremor, an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part, is the most common movement disorder encountered in clinical practice. Rest tremors occur in a body part that is relaxed and completely supported against gravity. Action tremors occur with voluntary contraction of a muscle and can be further subdivided into postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors. All persons have low-amplitude, high-frequency physiologic tremors at rest and during action that are not reported as symptomatic. The most common pathologic tremor is essential tremor. In one-half of cases, it is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and it affects 0.4 to 6 percent of the population. More than 70 percent of patients with Parkinson disease have tremor as the presenting feature. This tremor is typically asymmetric, occurs at rest, and becomes less prominent with voluntary movement. Features consistent with psychogenic tremor are abrupt onset, spontaneous remission, changing tremor characteristics, and extinction with distraction. Other types of tremor are cerebellar, dystonic, drug- or metabolic-induced, and orthostatic. The first step in the evaluation of a patient with tremor is to categorize the tremor based on its activation condition, topographic distribution, and frequency. The diagnosis of tremor is based on clinical information obtained from a thorough history and physical examination. For particularly difficult cases, single-photon emission computed tomography to visualize the integrity of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain may be useful to diagnose Parkinson disease.

### Clinical aspects of parkinson disease [^115WuvSp]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Parkinson disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a varied clinical picture and a variable rate of progression. Recently, there have been some studies conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy and other clinical aspects of the disease. In the absence of a biomarker the clinical diagnosis is imprecise. This leads to a significant number of misdiagnoses, especially in early disease. Assessment of the clinical features suggests that an accuracy of 90% may be the highest that can be expected using current diagnostic criteria. In addition to bradykinesia, which is a core symptom, different types of tremors occur. Whereas the rest tremor is characteristic, action tremor, re-emergent tremor and orthostatic tremor may occur in Parkinson disease. Symptomatic treatments are quite effective in early disease but clinical course is complicated by the appearance of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in more advanced disease. Non-motor complications, such as cognitive, psychiatric and autonomic problems, become bothersome and disabling in some patients.

### Rare tremors and tremors occurring in other neurological disorders [^113bDDY3]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Although tremor is deemed to be the commonest movement disorder, in adults the differential diagnosis usually boils down to whether the patient has Essential Tremor or Parkinson's Disease, which has likely led to an overdiagnosis of these conditions; yet, many important rare syndromes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with tremor. The aim of this review is to focus on rare forms of tremor, also in view of the new tremor classification, as well as on tremor occurring in other neurological disorders to aid their recognition. Some of the conditions reviewed here are treatable and therefore should not be missed. This review includes orthostatic tremor, focal and task-specific tremors, Holmes tremor, palatal and oculopalatal tremor, cortical tremor, some genetic forms of tremor including fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome as well as tremor associated with neuromuscular disorders, multiple sclerosis and Wilson's disease, providing an array of demonstrative videos. The recognition of these disorders should aid the physician to make a correct diagnosis and guide a prompt intervention. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### Essential tremor [^114Vn2eM]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological diseases; although it is a disease about which we are only beginning to develop an understanding. Effective treatment options for the disorder are severely limited. The traditional view of ET as a benign, familial, monosymptomatic disorder is being replaced by one of ET as a disease or family of diseases with aetiological, clinical, and pathological heterogeneity. Recent identification of putative environmental toxins linked to ET provide hope for disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to risk factors. Pathological and genetic studies will yield new insights into disease pathogenesis and mechanisms, which may result in the development of more effective symptomatic therapies developed with an understanding of the disease biology. These insights also have the potential to form the basis for neuroprotective therapies.

### Essential tremor: from bedside to bench and back to bedside [^115xQtVV]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The last several years have witnessed a remarkable increase in research on essential tremor, with consequent advances in our understanding of this entity. An attempt to both summarize and frame this work has not been undertaken.

Recent Findings

Here, I show that observations on essential tremor arising from clinical practice/clinical studies have guided scientific studies of this disorder. In turn, the results of scientific studies are beginning to be translated back to the bedside to improve treatment. Recent essential tremor research has given rise to several novel and intriguing ideas about the disease. These include the following: essential tremor may represent a family of diseases rather than a single disease; essential tremor seems to be a disease of the cerebellum or cerebellar system; essential tremor may be neurodegenerative; low gamma aminobutyric acid tone seems to be a central feature of essential tremor. As with many emerging ideas, there is significant discussion and debate over these emerging ideas, and this fuels additional scientific studies.

Summary

The flow of ideas from clinical observations about essential tremor, to their translation into scientific studies, and their translation back to the bedside, is expected to eventually lead to improvements at the patient interface.

Table 5
Aspects which might be considered for the treatment choice during the shared decision-making between patient and physician

The diagnosis is key for the selection of the target for intervention and one of the important differential diagnosis of essential tremor is dystonic tremor. The boarder between these two conditions is not very well defined. Tremors in the setting of indisputable dystonia are usually treated with interventions in the Gpi based on the lesson from published data on tremor improvement in focal, segmental, and generalized dystonia. On the other hand, essential tremor patients need Vim surgery. There is still uncertainty about the target for patients with the presenting symptom of tremor who have soft signs for dystonia. While several reports have shown good results for such patients with Vim surgery, there are patients who have no or no sufficient improvement. There is no scientific solution to this problem and most centers target the Vim and the neighboring zona incerta for these cases. DBS has the advantage that one contact of the electrode can be placed in the gray substance of the Vim and another just below in the zona incerta of which the radiation prelemniscalis is part.

The final decision for or against a specific intervention depends on many factors which do not necessarily apply for all patients but should be discussed with the patient. Table 3 summarizes aspects which we usually cover during shared decision-making between patient and physician, and the information we offer is naturally not always based on proven evidence. Some aspects like availability, experience with the method, choice for bilateral treatment, and exclusion because of multimorbidity are more or less defined by the circumstances other factors are specific for one or several of these interventions. A detailed explanation of the surgical risks is important. For focused ultrasound, the complete shave of the head is concerning for some. Some patients cannot receive the treatment because their skull is too dense. Focused ultrasound is an invasive treatment, but given the relatively short-term procedure in the MRI, it can also be offered to elderly patients which otherwise would not qualify for surgical interventions. This applies in principle also for radiosurgery. Patients living remote from an experienced team sometimes prefer interventions which do not need regular follow-up visits. For most patients, the expert experience of the center is key.

Introduction

Misdiagnosis in tremor syndromes is a common and often underestimated problem that can cause misleading results in clinical trials. At the clinical level misdiagnosis may lead to suboptimal treatment and incorrect prognosis. Central to this problem is the lack of accurate diagnostic tools that can distinguish different tremor aetiologies. Indeed, the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson's disease turns out to be only moderate when assessed against the gold standard of post-mortem histology. Overall, diagnostic accuracy has been estimated to be 80% amongst movement disorders experts, and 74% if the disease is diagnosed by a neurologist not expert in movement disorders. Thus, even using the UK Brain Bank criteria for Parkinson's disease as a proxy for post-mortem examination, about 2 in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease still receive a misdiagnosis, and this figure may be even higher in those presenting with Parkinson's disease tremor.

In essential tremor there is no gold standard diagnostic procedure, not even at post-mortem, and diagnosis is made purely on clinically-defined criteria. Thirty-seven per cent of essential tremor patients are misdiagnosed, with the most common misdiagnosis being Parkinson's disease tremor. The differential diagnosis of essential tremor and Parkinson's disease tremor is especially difficult early in the course of the disease when other parkinsonian signs may be absent and the clinician does not have the benefit of knowing the disease course. Moreover, patient age is not a discriminant factor, since early onset Parkinson's disease and late onset essential tremor are part of the spectrum of these two diseases, and this often underlies the cases in which differential diagnosis is most difficult.

Clinically, Parkinson's disease tremor is present at rest, while tremor in essential tremor is postural and/or kinetic. However, Parkinson's disease tremor may also manifest as a postural tremor, which generally appears a few seconds after assuming a posture — 're-emergent' tremor. Nevertheless, this tremor onset delay can be absent in some patients with Parkinson's disease, showing a pure postural tremor. Conversely, if patients with essential tremor are not fully relaxed during the muscular tone evaluation, tremor can lead to the false impression of a cogwheel phenomenon.

### Tremor [^116yt8io]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Tremor, a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of body parts, is the most common movement disorder. Tremors are classified as rest or action tremors. Rest tremor occurs when the affected body part is completely supported against gravity. Action tremors are produced by voluntary muscle contraction and are further divided into postural, isometric, or kinetic tremors. This article describes clinical signs and symptoms of six tremor syndromes, including physiologic tremor, essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, toxic and drug-induced tremor, cerebellar tremor, and psychogenic tremor, and presents a detailed diagnostic approach to tremor. Although new technologies such as positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography are under investigation for possible use in diagnosing specific tremor syndromes, they have no widespread applicability or use at this time. The history and physical examination remain the most important diagnostic tools available to clinicians in identifying and classifying tremor syndromes.

Differential Diagnostic Approaches for Tremor

Axis 1 includes tremor characteristics as the position most accentuating the tremor (rest, posture, action) which allows a syndromic approach for a precise classification (Table 2). The most common syndromes presenting with postural tremor are enhanced physiological tremor, essential tremor, and drug-induced tremor. The differential diagnosis must also include dystonic tremor and psychogenic tremor, while metabolic tremor caused by thyrotoxicosis should be considered in any recent-onset postural tremor.

Table 2
Combination of different activation conditions of tremor syndromes

+ +, typically present; +, may be present; +/−, occasionally present. ET: essential tremor; PD: Parkinson's disease

Between essential tremor, dystonic tremor, and PD tremor syndromes, there is gray area in terms of diagnostic as resting and postural tremor may coexist. PD tremor most commonly occurs at rest, when the body part is relaxed and not in use, but can also be seen in the postural position, often referred to as re-emergent tremor. A clinical test can distinguish PD tremor from ET tremor with a fairly high degree of reliability by assessing the suppression of rest tremor during movement.

Also distinguishing dystonic and essential tremor might be challenging in some patients. In the case of an accompanying vocal tremor, laryngoscopy accompanied by a speech specialist might be a useful diagnostic tool, to analyze tremorous vocalizations, to classify different tremors by vocal tremor patterns.

For only few cases, electrophysiological or nuclear medicine methods must be applied going beyond purely clinical diagnostics. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a presynaptic protein used as a biomarker for dopaminergic neurons. Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) with cocaine derivative tracers binding to DAT can be used as a measure of dopamine deficiency. DAT-SPECT shows high selectivity to distinguishing PD and ET.

Certain tremor etiologies allow specific therapeutic approaches. Due to the knowledge of specific pathomechanisms which promote tremor-related syndromes, disease/tremor-modifying approaches are available to treat several tremor etiologies. Examples are listed in Table 3.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^115Hd484]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

If there are additional signs 'of uncertain significance' in a patient who otherwise fulfils the criteria for ET, then the recent consensus classifies this as ET plus. This could be impaired tandem gait, questionable dystonic posturing, memory impairment or other mild neurological signs. Likewise, ET with tremor at rest should be classified here. Over the last few years, there has been considerable discussion over the term 'ET plus'. A recent study showed that, in ET patients with lower limb tremor, 110/133 (83%) were re-classified as ET plus, and these patients were older than the ET group. This shows that many patients with ET have additional symptoms, which may be integral to the disease, reflect comorbidity or it may be related to ageing. Another issue is that it is not easy to determine the clinical significance of additional symptoms. Specifically, two recent studies have shown that there is only fair agreement between movement disorders experts when assessing soft signs, and modest inter-rater agreement between axis 1 diagnoses (especially between ET plus and dystonic tremor). Neurophysiological measures, such as temporal discrimination thresholds, also cannot provide clear distinctions between ET and dystonic tremor, although this may be useful when classifying indeterminate tremors. These findings show that the borders between some clinical tremor syndromes are not fixed, which may indicate a shared pathophysiological basis. Accordingly, it has been argued that 'ET plus' may represent a state condition, such that additional signs emerge during certain stages of ET, or a temporary label, such that patients with ET plus transition to a more definite diagnosis. In the future, incorporation of pathophysiological information (a potential 'third axis') may help to better classify tremor syndromes, but this requires better biomarkers than are currently available. Until then, we recommend to not rest at a diagnosis of 'ET plus', and to explicitly note and follow the relevant 'plus symptom'. The general principle that axis 1 classifications may change over time is, however, not specific to ET plus.

### Unusual tremor syndromes: know in order to recognise [^111rebCD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Tremor is a common neurological condition in clinical practice; yet, few syndromes are widely recognised and discussed in the literature. As a result, there is an overdiagnosis of well-known causes, such as essential tremor. Many important unusual syndromes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with tremor. The objective of this review is to provide broad clinical information to aid in the recognition and treatment of various unusual tremor syndromes in the adult and paediatric populations. The review comprised of a comprehensive online search using PubMed, Ovid database and Google Scholar to identify the available literature for each unusual tremor syndrome. The review includes fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia type 12, tremors caused by autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias, myorhythmia, isolated tongue tremor, Wilson's disease, slow orthostatic tremor, peripheral trauma-induced tremor, tardive tremor and rabbit syndrome, paroxysmal tremors (hereditary chin tremor, bilateral high-frequency synchronous discharges, head tremor, limb-shaking transient ischaemic attack), bobble-head doll syndrome, spasmus nutans and shuddering attacks. Rare tremors generally present with an action tremor and a variable combination of postural and kinetic components with resting tremors less frequently seen. The phenomenology of myorhythmia is still vague and a clinical definition is proposed. The recognition of these entities should facilitate the correct diagnosis and guide the physician to a prompt intervention.

### Tremor [^114aYVCh]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Tremor, defined as a rhythmic and involuntary movement of any body part, is the most prevalent movement disorder, affecting millions of people in the United States. All adults have varying degrees of physiological tremor so it is imperative to distinguish physiological tremor from pathological tremor types. Tremor is not inherently dangerous, but it can cause significant disability at home and in the workplace. Common tremors like essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor can be recognized by most clinicians at the early stages for the initiation of disease-specific medical therapies. Less common tremors, such as those induced by drugs or brain lesions, are also important to recognize because they may be more refractory to medical therapies and may require earlier referral to a neurological specialist. In patients with the most progressive and severe tremors that are resistant to medical therapies, surgical interventions are available and typically target deep brain regions with stimulation or lesioning. This Grand Rounds review describes the evaluation and evidence-based management of the most common tremors, essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^1178BPMP]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

The distinction between these different tremors is not always visible to the naked eye. For example, resting tremor can re-emerge during postural holding, making it difficult to clinically distinguish it from essential tremor. This distinction can be made by focusing on the delay between adopting a posture and the emergence of tremor: in essential tremor there is no delay, while Parkinson's disease resting tremor re-emerges after a few seconds (on average ± 10 s). Since the frequency of re-emergent and resting tremor can be similar, it has been hypothesized that both tremors share a similar pathophysiological mechanism. One interesting patient with Parkinson's disease had no resting tremor, but a marked 3–6 Hz postural tremor that occurred after a delay of 2–4 s following postural holding, thus resembling re-emergent tremor. Such observations point to heterogeneity in the circumstances under which the classical Parkinson's disease 'resting' tremor occurs.

In the following sections, we will mainly focus on the classic resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. We will first describe the clinical and cerebral differences between patients with tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease. Then we will detail how these differences may inform us about the causes and consequences of Parkinson's disease resting tremor.

### Tremor: sorting through the differential diagnosis [^115FZayg]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part. It is the most common movement disorder encountered in primary care. The diagnosis of tremor is based on clinical information obtained from the history and physical examination. The most common tremors in patients presenting to primary care physicians are enhanced physiologic tremor, essential tremor, and parkinsonian tremor. All persons have low-amplitude, high-frequency physiologic tremors at rest and during action that are not reported as symptomatic, but can be enhanced by anxiety, medication use, caffeine intake, or fatigue. Features consistent with psychogenic tremor are abrupt onset, spontaneous remission, changing tremor characteristics, and extinction with distraction. Other types of tremor include cerebellar, dystonic, and drug- or metabolic-induced. The first step in evaluating a patient with tremor is to categorize the tremor based on its activation condition, topographic distribution, and frequency. Resting tremors occur in a body part that is relaxed and completely supported against gravity. Action tremors occur with voluntary contraction of a muscle and can be further subdivided into postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors. The most common pathologic tremor is essential tremor, which affects 0.4% to 6% of the population. In one-half of cases, it is transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion. More than 70% of patients with Parkinson disease have tremor as the presenting feature. This tremor is typically unilateral, occurs at rest, and becomes less prominent with voluntary movement. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, single-photon emission computed tomography can be used to visualize the integrity of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain, and transcranial ultrasonography may be useful to diagnose Parkinson disease.

### Quality improvement in neurology: essential tremor quality measurement set [^1128w36U]. Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) measurement development — medication thresholds, vocal tremor, cognitive assessment, and ultrasound were addressed as follows: the proposed measure on tremor medication initiation and discontinuation was subsequently dropped due to lack of evidence to support therapeutic blood ranges for current ET medications, and although such ranges exist for seizure control, it is not appropriate to apply these ranges to patients with ET. For vocal tremor, the group concluded that the current level of evidence and absence of guideline statements did not meet criteria for measurement development. For cognitive impairment, evidence was lacking to support assessment on all patients with ET and further research is needed regarding the association of ET and cognitive impairment. Regarding ultrasound, the US FDA has approved MRI-guided focused ultrasound, a noninvasive method to treat ET that is unresponsive to medical management, but current guideline statements do not address high-energy ultrasound use and it is anticipated that this will be addressed in future updates following guideline development.

### Movement disorders emergencies [^111Ygb8S]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although movement disorders are traditionally viewed as chronic diseases that are followed electively, a growing number of these patients present with acute, severe syndromes or complications of their underlying neurological problem. Identifying and managing movement disorders emergencies is challenging, even for the specialist. This review summarizes evidence outlining the clinical presentation of acute, life-threatening movement disorders.

Recent Findings

We review the most significant aspects in the most common movement disorders emergencies, including acute complications related to Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, serotonergic, and neuroleptic malignant syndromes, chorea, ballismus, dystonia, myoclonus, and tics.

Summary

The increasing amount of information delineating the descriptions of movement disorders emergencies provides means for more effective prevention, identification, and management for the nonspecialist. Although the commonest of these syndromes eventually have a good outcome, serious conditions such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and status dystonicus may induce substantial rates of morbidity and mortality. This review re-emphasizes the need for their prompt identification and management.

### The digital signature of emergent tremor in Parkinson's disease [^116BLBpE]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) are bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait impairment, and postural instability. Rest tremor is present in over 70% of people with PD (PWP)and occurs at frequencies between 4 and 7 Hz. Rest tremor is usually suppressed with the onset of action but can emerge during sustained movement (such as walking) and when a posture of the hand or limb is sustained –.

The emergence of tremor can confound the clinical assessment of bradykinesia using the Movement Disorders Society Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (MDS-UPDRS III). For instance, during the finger-tapping task, the thumb may be held in a fixed posture, and regular amplitude, high-frequency finger movement that is actually tremor can be interpreted as voluntary movement, leading to an underestimated bradykinesia score. Conversely, bradykinesia may be overestimated when intermittent tremor interrupts voluntary movement and cause irregularities in tapping, which may be interpreted as hesitations. On the clinical scale, there is no way to isolate involuntary emergent tremor from voluntary movements which is crucial to ensure a more accurate and dependable measurement of Parkinsonian symptom severity.

A potential solution to this dilemma is to utilize high-resolution sensors to quantify motor behavior. One example of this approach is quantitative digitography (QDG), which measures repetitive alternating finger tapping (RAFT) on adjacent tensioned levers, where the hand is held in a sustained posture. QDG provides objective and validated measures of the cardinal motor signs of PD, including rigidity, from a simple 30-s RAFT task performed on a digitography device –. QDG metrics for bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait impairment are significantly different in PWP compared to age-matched, healthy controls, are correlated with the UPDRS III, the MDS-UPDRS III, and respective upper and lower extremity sub-scores, and track the effect of medication, pallidotomy, and deep brain stimulation. Additionally, QDG is effective in tracking symptom progression over time. Critically, initial observations from QDG during periods of tremor suggested that it could capture the unique temporal characteristics of tremor. Therefore, QDG may offer a solution by accurately identifying emergent tremor that could occur in PWP whose hands are held in posture as they perform RAFT and measure bradykinesia and rigidity more reliably based on voluntary tapping only.

### New horizons in late-onset essential tremor: a pre-cognitive biomarker of dementia? [^114iHP59]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tremor is defined as an involuntary and rhythmic oscillatory movement of a body part, and may be categorised as rest, postural or kinetic, depending on when it manifests maximally (see Table 1 ;). Tremor disorders are increasingly common with age and reported to affect approximately 17% of adults ≥ 64 years; common causes include essential tremor (ET), Parkinson's disease, dystonia, metabolic disorders, drug-induced tremor and enhanced physiological tremor.

Table 1
Tremor classification (adapted from)

The most common cause of tremor in older adults is ET but, it is increasingly recognised that ET has a high misdiagnosis rate, especially in older adults. The accuracy of clinicians correctly diagnosing ET is only in the range of 50–70%, and it tends to be over-diagnosed rather than missed. Parkinson's disease and dystonic tremor are common causes of erroneous ET diagnoses. Acknowledging this, the 2018 International Movement Disorders Society (MDS) expert consensus statement paper on tremor introduced the term 'ET-Plus' to describe people with ET-like tremor plus additional atypical features such as dystonia, ataxia and cognitive decline. Gait ataxia was previously considered part of the 'typical' ET phenotype but now has been highlighted as an atypical clinical feature. Similarly, an association between cognitive decline and ET was reported in several studies previously, but is now considered an atypical feature in ET. The MDS recommends that clinicians carefully follow up people with ET-Plus as their diagnoses are particularly likely to be revised over time.

Overarching Aspects of the Treatment of Essential Tremor

If the etiology is unknown as for most of the patients only symptoms are treated, the threshold to treat should be based on patient-physician consensus. The decision on the extent for a symptomatic treatment should relate to the impairment subjectively felt by the patient due to both the motor symptoms and secondary impairment (psychosocial aspects). Not only objective tremor severity but also the patient subjective suffering and the related coping strategy are relevant. Important questions are the temporal development of tremor, facilitating and attenuating situations, topographic distribution of tremor, tremor components which are most disturbing, and the activities affected most by tremor. Complaints related to psychosocial aspects of the syndrome such as fear of stigmatization, social isolation, and depression due to tremor should impact the therapeutic decision-making. Some studies found an increased incidence of depression in ET while others found no differences but this leaves the clinician with the need of an individual assessment of such symptoms for each patient. For tremors, the subjective perception of impairment is extremely variable between individuals and does not correlate very well with the measurable amplitude of the tremor, nor with the duration of the tremor and therefore the coping strategies differ. Also, many patients, particularly those with mild symptoms, are mainly seeking advice on the etiology of the condition and want to have Parkinson's disease excluded.

### Drug-induced tremor, clinical features, diagnostic approach and management [^115dxVpp]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Tremor is the most common movement disorder and there are numerous causes of tremor. In many individuals, tremor can be due to drugs. The most common drugs associated with tremor include amiodarone, selective serotonin (and norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs/SNRIs), amitriptyline, lithium, valproate, β-adrenoceptor agonists, dopamine receptor antagonists, VMAT2 inhibitors, or drugs of abuse: ethanol, cocaine, etc. Drug-induced tremor usually resembles essential or parkinsonian tremor, depending on the offending drug; however, features such as unilateral, task-specific, position-dependent tremor or sudden onset, distractibility, entrainment and arrest with contralateral movements suggest etiologies such as dystonic or functional (psychogenic) tremor. Risk factors for drug-induced tremor include polypharmacy, male gender, older age, high doses and immediate-release preparations or reaching toxic levels of the offending drugs. Drug-induced tremor usually resolves once the offending medication is discontinued, however, persistent tremor may be observed in some cases (tardive tremor). In this manuscript, we discuss the most common causes of drug-induced tremor. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^114id34R]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Tremor is the most common movement disorder worldwide, but diagnosis is challenging. In 2018, the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published a consensus statement that proposes a tremor classification along two independent axes: a clinical tremor syndrome and its underlying aetiology. In line with this statement, we here propose a stepwise diagnostic approach that leads to the correct clinical and aetiological classification of upper limb tremor. We also describe the typical clinical signs of each clinical tremor syndrome. A key feature of our algorithm is the distinction between isolated and combined tremor syndromes, in which tremor is accompanied by bradykinesia, cerebellar signs, dystonia, peripheral neuropathy or brainstem signs. This distinction subsequently informs the selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, such as neurophysiology, laboratory testing, structural and dopaminergic imaging and genetic testing. We highlight treatable metabolic causes of tremor, as well as drugs and toxins that can provoke tremor. The stepwise approach facilitates appropriate diagnostic testing and avoids unnecessary investigations. We expect that the approach offered in this article will reduce diagnostic uncertainty and increase the diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.

### Managing functional neurological disorder: treatment recommendations for health professionals in Australia [^113XqbAf]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Prognosis

Untreated, the prognosis of FND is often poor, but it can be significantly improved with treatment. People with dissociative attacks achieve remission in 30%–50% of cases. In children, recovery rates are higher, with approximately 70% achieving seizure remission. Unfortunately, the lack of funding for treatment and skilled providers to deliver it means that the majority of people in Australia with FND are currently unable to access adequate evidence-based treatment.

Section 2: assessment and diagnosis

Recommendations

The diagnosis of FND should rely on positive signs demonstrating fluctuation of symptoms with changes in symptom-focussed attention and/or effort to overcome the symptoms, incongruence with key features of non-functional diseases or both.
FND is a clinical diagnosis based on history and examination. If positive features of FND are present on assessment, the diagnosis can be made with confidence and may not require further investigations.
Generally, a diagnosis of FND should be made by a neurologist, ideally with specific interest in this area.

In making a formulation of any given FND presentation for the purposes of treatment, a broad person-centred approach based on a biopsychosocial model is essential to understand the complexity and individual variability of FND. Several interacting biological, psychological and social factors can influence vulnerabilities, triggers and perpetuating factors that contribute to FND as outlined in table 1.

Table 1
The biopsychosocial model with potential factors that may contribute to FND (adapted from Nielsen et al)

Assessment

Clinicians should base the diagnosis of FND on positive signs demonstrating fluctuation of symptoms with changes in symptom-focussed attention or effort to overcome the symptoms, incongruence with key features of non-functional diseases, or both. Examples include:

Physical signs demonstrating inconsistency between impaired voluntary movement and intact automatic movement, for example, Hoover's sign in functional lower limb weakness or entrainment in functional tremor.
Attacks with an appearance typical for a dissociative attack which have no EEG correlation.
Memory difficulties which are much worse on direct testing of memory than when (automatically) recalling details in conversation.

Diagnostic approach

Neurologists, particularly those with relevant expertise, are ideally positioned to diagnose FND, although other specialists can also accurately diagnose the disorder. Misdiagnosis is rare when handled by skilled professionals, but it should be noted that FND can frequently coexist with non-functional disorders, and structural conditions often trigger FND. Clinicians should remain alert to features that would suggest a second, admixed, diagnosis (eg, epilepsy and dissociative attacks).

### The MDS consensus tremor classification: the best way to classify patients with tremor at present [^114ouQUz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2018, the new Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors, by the Task Force on Tremor of the International Parkinson Movement Disorder Society, was published. So far, the article has been cited more than 400 times in peer-reviewed international journals and commonly debated in conferences and meetings due to an enthusiastic welcome from the community. Compared to the previous Consensus Statement (1998), the main novelties are: 1) the classification of tremor according to clinical manifestation (Axis 1) and etiology (Axis 2), and therefore the use of a syndromic approach; 2) the definition of essential tremor as a syndrome; 3) the recognition of the new category essential tremor plus, that derives from the uncertain significance of the soft neurological signs often associated with essential tremor. In this paper, we summarise and explain the most important aspects of the new classification of tremors, highlighting the main novelties, their relevance, and application in clinical practice. Moreover, we discuss its possible weakness and reflect on the critical comments made so far. We believe that this new tremor classification is comprehensive, rigorous, and consistent and, considering our current knowledge of tremor syndromes, it is the best we can do at present. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### Abnormal movements in critical care patients with brain injury: a diagnostic approach [^113y9TAq]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Infectious brain injury

Various abnormal movements may be seen in the setting of infections as a result of direct central nervous system invasion by the pathogen or indirect toxin or autoimmune effects. Similar to other categories when presentation is acute, especially in comatose patients, we recommend serial brain imaging and EEG to investigate cerebral herniation and elevated ICP or seizures as the source of motor paroxysms (Fig. 1). However, after ruling out these emergencies or in awake patients, combining movement semiology with epidemiological factors may yield valuable information. Moreover, correct identification of the movement may point towards the etiological factor in certain scenarios. For example, opisthotonus posturing defined by severe muscle spasms causing backward arching of the head, neck and spine is typically seen in tetanus and seizures are a common phenomenon with encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. The presentation of complex partial seizures with encephalitic syndrome in a sporadic fashion suggests herpes simplex virus, which typically involves the temporal lobes, while encephalitis epidemic causing seizures suggests Japanese encephalitis, the most common epidemic viral cause of encephalitis. In contrast, West Nile encephalitis is less commonly associated with seizures but may present with frequent extrapyramidal movements such as coarse tremor, myoclonus and parkinsonism. Moreover, tuberculomas and tuberculosis meningitis are frequently associated with extrapyramidal movements, especially chorea and tremor. In addition, involuntary purposeless movement on one side of the body, known as hemichorea, is the most common extrapyramidal movement associated with AIDS. On the other hand, rapidly progressive dementia associated with multifocal myoclonus is pathognomonic for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In addition, knowledge of endemic diseases or travel history may point to the movement etiology, such as seizures, ataxia and tremor in cerebral malaria and seizures caused by neurocystcercosis. In difficult cases, expert neurological consultation may be warranted to correctly identify the movement.

### Essential tremor: emerging views of a common disorder [^113wfjm1]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent tremor disorder. ET has traditionally been viewed as a monosymptomatic disorder characterized by a kinetic arm tremor, but this definition is gradually being replaced. The clinical spectrum has come to include several motor features, including tremor and ataxia, and several non-motor features, including possible cognitive impairment and personality disturbances. Postmortem studies are revealing several different patterns of pathology. The emerging view is that ET might be a family of diseases, unified by the presence of kinetic tremor, but further characterized by etiological, clinical and pathological heterogeneity. Effective pharmacological treatments for the disorder remain limited, although new insights into disease mechanisms might result in more-effective therapies. In addition, recent investigations of environmental toxicants that might be linked to ET open the way towards primary disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to these factors.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^1164f9wq]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — adverse effects and initiation — are generally well tolerated, with most adverse effects emerging within the first few weeks and including dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, headache, somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, vivid dreams, changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, fatigue, nervousness, tremor, bruxism, and diaphoresis; potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior, behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome; it may be helpful when starting a new SSRI to begin with a sub-therapeutic dose to minimize adverse effects, and because early adverse effects and delayed efficacy can prompt discontinuation, it is important to provide education about the time-course of improvement and adverse effects; although SSRIs have a greater margin of safety in overdose than other antidepressants, deaths have been reported after very large ingestions.

### Managing essential tremor [^1121XPxW]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor is one of the most common tremor syndromes. According to the recent tremor classification, tremor as a symptom is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: axis 1 — defining syndromes based on the clinical features such as historical features, tremor characteristics, associated signs, and laboratory tests; and axis 2 — classifying the etiology (Bhatia et al. Mov Disord 33:75–87). The management of this condition has two major approaches. The first is to exclude treatable etiologies, as particularly during the onset of this condition the presentation of a variety of etiologies can be with monosymptomatic tremor. Once the few etiologies with causal treatments are excluded, all further treatment is symptomatic. Shared decision-making with enabling the patient to knowledgeably choose treatment options is needed to customize the management. Mild to moderate tremor severity can sometimes be controlled with occupational treatment, speech therapy of psychotherapy, or adaptation of coping strategy. First-line pharmacological treatments include symptomatic treatment with propranolol, primidone, and topiramate. Botulinum toxin is for selected cases. Invasive treatments for essential tremor should be considered for severe tremors. They are generally accepted as the most powerful interventions and provide not only improvement of tremor but also a significant improvement of life quality. The current standard is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic and subthalamic region. Focused ultrasound thalamotomy is a new therapy attracting increasing interest. Radiofrequency lesioning is only rarely done if DBS or focused ultrasound is not possible. Radiosurgery is not well established. We present our treatment algorithm.

### Emergencies and critical issues in Parkinson's disease [^111A1EvV]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Deep-brain stimulation

This comprises an implantable neurostimulation system that modulates a pathological brain network using a guided, non-ablative and reversible technique. After the surgery patients are invariably instructed to contact the implanting centre or a predetermined movement disorder team with experience in this technique in case of sudden unexplained re-emergence of parkinsonism, severe dyskinesias or appearance of unexpected abnormal behaviours.

Table 3 and figure 3 illustrate common complications related to surgery and the implanted material. Complications can also relate directly to the effects of stimulation on neural structures. Changes made in the stimulation parameters, for example, can lead to severe problems that take the patient to the emergency department. Most frequent of such problems are dyskinesias, sometimes ballistic, worsening of parkinsonism, gait problems, and behavioural changes such as disinhibition, depression and hypomania. Patients with postsurgical depression may have an increase suicide risk, especially during the first year after the surgery. Thus, clinicians need to be cautious with postoperative depression management and refer patients for psychiatric evaluation to achieve a better and close approach from the beginning.

Figure 3
Hardware complication of deep brain stimulation: skin lesion induced by electric current after break of extension cable connecting with the subcutaneous pacemaker.

The general neurologist attending an implanted patient with a subacute or sudden worsening of their clinical condition should rule out non-deep brain stimulation causes (as described earlier) and then refer the patient to an expert centre, where appropriate measures such as determining battery life or impedance of the implanted system can be implemented. If there is a suspicion that the cause of the motor aggravation relates to malfunctioning of the implanted material, then clinicians should obtain plain radiographs along the system to locate loss of integrity, such as electrode migration or lead fracture. In addition, oral levodopa may have to be increased while awaiting a more thorough evaluation (figure 4). Among other serious consequences, interruption of stimulation can lead to rhabdomyolysis due the recurrence of severe tremor or aspiration pneumonia because of dysphagia related to worsening of parkinsonism. Prolonged severe parkinsonism should at all costs be avoided or a parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia-like picture may ensue.

### Essential tremor: an overdiagnosed condition? [^116GC7zf]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of essential tremor (ET) and its differentiation from other types of tremor is often difficult. In 1994 Bain et al. defined a classical phenotype by studying 20 patients with pure essential tremor and similarly affected family members in at least three generations. We assessed how many of the patients diagnosed by different neurologists at our institution as having ET conformed to this defined phenotype. We randomly selected 50 patients who were diagnosed with ET by any neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery since the publication of the Bain et al. report, and determined the number of patients who had clinical features compatible with the phenotype that it had defined. Only 25 (50%) of these patients had ET so defined. Ten patients clearly had alternative diagnoses: four had clear additional dystonia, two neuropathic tremor, two had unilateral leg tremor, one drug-induced tremor, and one sudden onset after head trauma. The remaining 15 patients also had atypical features including myoclonus (one), onset in a body part other than the arms (six), sudden onset (two), rest tremor (seven), onset after the age of 65 years (four), a family member with an isolated head tremor (one), or reduced armswing (two). The diagnosis of ET is overused even among experienced neurologists, and other types of tremor should be considered in atypical patients before making this diagnosis.

### Temazepam [^113mtVjN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.

Because temazepam capsules can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.

Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions

Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including temazepam capsules. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with temazepam capsules should not be rechallenged with the drug.

Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of temazepam capsules late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to temazepam capsules during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to temazepam capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.

### Re-emergent tremor in Parkinson's disease: the effect of dopaminergic treatment [^115tXqJC]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with resting tremor may be affected by a tremor that appears after a varying latency while a posture is maintained, a phenomenon referred to as re-emergent tremor (RET). The aim of the study was to evaluate the occurrence and clinical features of RET in patients with PD tested off and on treatment, and to compare the effect of dopaminergic treatment on RET with the effect on resting and action tremor.

Methods

We consecutively enrolled 100 patients with PD. Patients were clinically evaluated 24 h after withdrawal of therapy (off-treatment phase) and 60 min after therapy administration (on-treatment phase). We collected the demographic and clinical data of patients with PD. The severity of the disease was assessed by means of the Hoehn and Yahr scale and Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III. We evaluated the latency, severity and body side affected both off and on treatment in patients with RET.

Results

Re-emergent tremor was present in 24% of the patients with PD off treatment and in 19% of the patients on treatment. Dopaminergic treatment reduced the clinical severity of RET. Dopaminergic treatment increased the number of patients with unilateral RET and reduced the number of those who had bilateral RET. RET and resting tremor responded similarly to dopaminergic treatment, whereas action tremor was less responsive. Patients with RET had milder motor symptoms than patients without RET both off and on treatment.

Conclusions

Dopaminergic treatment modified RET occurrence, severity and body distribution. Dopaminergic depletion plays a role in the pathophysiology of RET.

### Emergency presentations of movement disorders [^1145Pgxs]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Movement disorders are typically perceived as being gradually progressive conditions that are managed in outpatient settings. However, they may manifest de novo with an acute severe phenotype or an acute decompensation. A movement disorder becomes an emergency when it evolves acutely or subacutely over hours to days; delays in its diagnosis and treatment may cause significant morbidity and mortality. Here we address the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of those movement disorder emergencies that are principally encountered in emergency departments, in acute receiving units or in intensive care units. We provide practical guidance for management in the acute setting where there are several treatable causes not to be missed. The suggested medication doses are predominantly based on expert opinion due to limited higher-level evidence. In spite of the rarity of movement disorder emergencies, neurologists need to be familiar with the phenomenology, potential causes and treatments of these conditions. Movement disorder emergencies divide broadly into two groups: hypokinetic and hyperkinetic, categorised according to their phenomenology. Most acute presentations are hyperkinetic and some are mixed.

### Trick or treat? Showing patients with functional (psychogenic) motor symptoms their physical signs [^114C1KSD]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Functional (psychogenic) motor symptoms are diagnosed on the basis of positive signs of inconsistency or incongruity with known neurologic disease. These signs, such as Hoover sign or tremor entrainment, are often regarded by neurologists as 'tricks of the trade', to 'catch the patient out, ' and certainly not to be shared with them. In this reflective article, the authors suggest that showing the patient with functional motor symptoms their physical signs, if done in the right way, is actually one of the most useful things a neurologist can do for these patients in persuading them of the accuracy of their diagnosis and the potential reversibility of their symptoms.

### Managing essential tremor [^116K3DCs]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

If a patient is diagnosed with an ET− or ET+ syndrome, the next question is for a possible etiology. Etiologies might be hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and medication-induced tremors which have to be excluded with careful medical history and lab tests. Table 1 summarizes the etiologies which can on rare occasions be associated with tremor and can be rarely confused with ET. Certainly, the majority of them will only be addressed with further diagnostics if additional symptoms suggest one of these conditions. Most of the patients with the syndromes of ET or ET+, however, will have no identifiable cause. Certainly, causal treatments will be recommended if a treatable etiology is found.

Table 1
List of different tremor entities which can present with an ET− or ET+ syndrome. Untreatable causes include monogenetic causes, and chromosomal aberrations. Much of the following diseases are causally treatable: infectious and inflammatory diseases, autoimmune neuropathies and spinal muscular atrophies, paraneoplasias, endocrine or metabolic diseases, brain lesions of different etiologies, medications, toxins causing tremor, psychoactive drugs associated with tremor and affective changes, and consequences of physical exertion related with tremor

In ET, gender influences the topographic distribution of tremor. Female gender increases the likelihood of being (additionally to the hand tremor) affected from impairing head and/or voice tremor in ET. The association of hand tremor severity with midline tremor is stronger for males than for females.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^114naAFH]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

The tremors of Parkinson's disease

Tremor is characterized clinically by involuntary, rhythmic and alternating movements of one or more body parts. Parkinson's disease harbours many different tremors. These tremors can vary according to the circumstances under which they occur, the body part that is involved and the frequency at which the tremor occurs. For example, tremor may occur at rest, during postural holding or during voluntary movements; it can be seen in the hands, feet or other body parts; and tremor frequency can vary from low (4–5 Hz) to high (8–10 Hz). A consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society includes a parallel classification scheme that categorizes three tremor syndromes associated with Parkinson's disease. This classification is still used widely today. First, the most common or classical Parkinson's disease tremor is defined as a resting tremor, or rest and postural/kinetic tremor with the same frequency. This tremor is inhibited during movement and may reoccur with the same frequency when adopting a posture or even when moving. When recurring with posture, it has been called re-emergent tremor. Second, some patients with Parkinson's disease develop rest and postural/kinetic tremors of different frequencies, with the postural/kinetic tremor displaying a higher (> 1.5 Hz) and non-harmonically related frequency to the resting tremor. This form occurs in < 10% of patients with Parkinson's disease. Some consider it to be an incidental combination of an essential tremor with Parkinson's disease, but it appears more plausible that postural tremor is a manifestation of Parkinson's disease. Third, isolated postural and kinetic tremors do occur in Parkinson's disease. The frequency of these tremors may vary between 4 and 9 Hz. A specific form of (position-dependent) postural tremor is orthostatic tremor, which may occur in Parkinson's disease at different frequencies (4–6, 8–9 or 13–18 Hz), with or without co-existent resting tremor. Since this tremor type occurs at a higher age of onset than primary orthostatic tremor, and since it may respond to dopaminergic treatment, it has been argued that it is a manifestation of Parkinson's disease rather than a chance association of two tremor syndromes.

Step 5: are laboratory tests indicated aimed at an acquired cause or treatable metabolic disorder?

Tremor and myoclonus can be caused by forms of organ failure or homeostatic imbalance, such as renal failure, hepatic failure, hyperthyroidism and disturbed glucose metabolism. These causes are important to identify, as treatment leads to cessation of tremor. Basic laboratory testing is therefore advised, especially in patients with a bilateral isolated tremor syndrome, and this should include thyroid, liver and renal function, glucose and electrolytes. The exact yield of these tests is, however, unknown. Other tests should only be performed when they are specifically indicated, to minimise unsolicited findings. In isolated tremor, investigate serum catecholamines if there are other symptoms of pheochromocytoma (ie, episodes of headache, sweating and/or tachycardia). Test for toxins when there is a history of exposure. In tremor combined with dystonia or a family history of movement disorders and cognitive or psychiatric symptoms, consider testing copper and iron metabolism (serum copper, ceruloplasmin, iron, ferritin) as this can point to Wilson diseaseor neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation(particularly neuroferritinopathy). Apart from Wilson disease, there are other treatable metabolic diseases that typically present with dystonia or ataxia but in which patients are occasionally reported to have tremor. These include Niemann-Pick type C, glutaric aciduria type 1, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, Segawa disease and coenzyme Q10 deficiency (table 1). In case of a tremor associated with neuropathy, test for acquired causes, including paraproteinemia.

### The digital signature of emergent tremor in Parkinson's disease [^116PJL7D]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The current study demonstrated that QDG technology distinguished tremor from voluntary movement using only a 30 s task, and the percent time with tremor significantly correlated with the MDS-UPDRS tremor sub-scores. The short period of time to perform the RAFT task may improve compliance compared to passive monitoring devices, which is supported by a previous study showing a compliance rate of 91% when participants with early-stage untreated PD were asked to perform RAFT among other tasks once a week for six months. QDG serves as a platform to provide clinicians and patients with high-resolution quantitative evaluation of all cardinal motor signs in PD remotely that is delivered in real time and will be accessible in the patient's electronic health record. This may be useful in several clinical scenarios: (1) when therapy is initiated, it is very difficult to know whether and how the patient is responding to medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS): remote QDG testing will allow the clinician to monitor the effect of initiating therapy and make adjustments based on real-time data which can lead to faster optimization of therapy without adversely affecting the clinician's workflow. (2) Up to 50% of people with PD do not get access to neurological care due to the lack of proximity to a neurology clinic. The implementation of QDG can facilitate remote monitoring by neurologists, thereby enhancing access to specialized care in underserved regions. (3) Deep brain stimulation candidacy requires an on-and-off medication evaluation — a barrier to accessing DBS has been the difficulty for people to come to neurology centers off medication; QDG remote testing will enable neurologists to prescribe on and off testing from home as adjunctive testing to an in-person evaluation. In addition, the reliable distinction between voluntary movement and tremor, shown by the results of this study, can provide at a glance when the person may have medication refractory tremor but improvement of voluntary movement from medication. Such patients are excellent candidates for DBS as it will improve tremor (and voluntary movement); however, this is not separated in the MDS-UPDRS III scale and may appear as if there is little overall improvement from medication thus denying the patient a valuable therapy. Additionally, QDG's ability to measure rigidity, alongside each of the other cardinal signs of PD, could be utilized for evaluation of clinical trials, which often rely on blinded video assessments of MDS-UPDRS III, but must disregard items related to rigidity. Therefore, QDG can profoundly aid clinicians in making complex care management decisions through high-resolution, quantitative insights that would otherwise have to be made based on subjective descriptions of symptoms by patients or through clinical rating scales at in-frequent timepoints.

Bronchodilator administration is safe; treatment with albuterol/salbutamol causes no clinically significant change in heart rate, blood pressure, serum potassium, tremor, headache, nervousness, weakness, palpitation, or dry mouth. When used with a metered dose inhaler, spacer devices improve the delivery of bronchodilator medications to the lungs, and inhalers with spacer devices provide clinical effectiveness equal to that of nebulizer machines, including in community settings. Improvised spacers made with a 500-mL (~16 oz) plastic cold drink bottle or a 150-mL (~5 oz) disposable paper cup appear to provide drug delivery similar to that achieved with commercial spacer devices.

### Managing essential tremor [^112QbxCo]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of essential tremor covers two important aspects. The first is diagnostic with the main questions is for accuracy of diagnosis and not to overlook specifically treatable etiologies. A new tremor classification has laid new foundations for this. The second is to understand and interpret the needs of the patient. The spectrum of complaints varies considerably from patient to patient. Essential tremor (ET) is a lifelong lasting syndrome and young patients may have different demands than the elderly. Essential tremor is a progressive syndrome and patients early during the course of the disease may have different problems from those with advanced ET. Men and female can both have essential tremor but the complaints may differ for them. For all these aspects, it is important to know about the spectrum of manifestations of the condition but also about the ways to measure tremor severity and complaints. The selection of treatment is critically depending on the knowledge of these subjective complaints.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: serotonin syndrome [^117MAoeh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Serotonin syndrome is a rare, frequently misdiagnosed, serious condition with high morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of serotonin syndrome, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Serotonin syndrome is a potentially deadly toxidrome marked by excess serotonin receptor activity or neurotransmission. Features of serotonin syndrome include 1) neuromuscular excitation such as tremor, hyperreflexia, and clonus; 2) autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hypertension/hypotension, and hyperthermia; and 3) altered mental status such as agitation, delirium, and coma. Although serotonin syndrome may be more obvious in patients who have overdosed on serotonergic agents such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), multiple other medications may also cause serotonin syndrome. Alternative diagnoses such as sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and decompensated hyperthyroidism should be considered. The primary components of therapy include stopping the offending agent and supportive care, which focuses on agitation control, monitoring for and treating hyperthermia, and managing autonomic instability.

Conclusions

An understanding of serotonin syndrome can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

Evaluation, diagnosis and management II — process steps

Lauren Gibson-Oliver and Bill Ventres

Attending to patients is key to developing a cohesive and intuitive process. We present four clear steps that family medicine physicians can use to evaluate, diagnose and manage patients' presenting concerns.

Building on the factors that family physicians consider when creating a working diagnosis, what are the systematic steps they take to appropriately address patient's chief concerns? Experienced family physicians commonly integrate the following four steps into a cohesive and intuitive process of EDM (figure 2).

Figure 2
EDM II: process steps in family medicine. EDM, evaluation, diagnosis and management.

Step 1: Investigate the patient's presentation — Start by listening. Begin with the patient's chief concern, focusing on history of the present illness, as interpreted by the patient. Conduct a pertinent physical exam. Allow patients to elaborate, as appropriate, to explore information from the review of systems and other aspects of the illness history. Acknowledge that certain situations may arise when patients present with severe, potentially life-threatening emergencies. Be ready to handle unexpected emergencies when patients present in extremis. Patients can also present with conditions that, while not immediately life threatening, need immediate attention. Prepare for consultation, transport or admission.

### Essential tremor: tips and tricks [^112E58Dk]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tremors are a common reason for neurology consultations and can sometimes be a diagnostic challenge. One of the most common causes is essential tremor, which needs to be distinguished from other types of tremors, such as those found in Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease or dystonic tremor. This categorisation is important as their treatment and prognosis differ. This review focuses on two main characteristics of tremor to help with its differential diagnosis: 'The When', or conditions that enhance the tremor, which include action, postural, intentional components and resting tremor; and 'The Where' or the body location, which includes tremor in the upper limbs, head or voice.

​Combined tremor syndromes

In the right column of the algorithm, the combined tremor syndromes are depicted. In classifying a combined tremor syndrome, there are five prominent additional signs to look for.

Bradykinesia points to a parkinsonism-associated tremor syndrome, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or atypical parkinsonism (progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), vascular parkinsonism, dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal degeneration or medication-induced parkinsonism). Tremor in PD (Parkinson's tremor) is often distal, asymmetric, it occurs predominantly at rest and has a frequency of 4–7 Hz. The tremor can show a 'pill-rolling' aspect (eg, more flexion than extension of the thumb), often spontaneously waxes and wanes in amplitude and can improve on levodopa — although not necessarily. Parkinson's tremor typically increases in amplitude during cognitive co-activation (eg, serial sevens) or motor co-activation with another limb (eg, tapping with the contralateral hand, or walking). It classically occurs at rest, but a lot of patients also have postural tremor (46%–93%). In 81% of these patients, a transient (> 1–2 s) suppression of tremor amplitude is seen during a voluntary movement with the trembling arm, after which the tremor comes back (re-emergent tremor). Although resting tremor is a key feature of a Parkinson's tremor, 19% of the patients show an additional pure postural tremor that is independent from the resting tremor (unlike re-emergent tremor, which is a continuation of resting tremor during stable posturing). Tremor occurs less often in atypical parkinsonism than in PD, but it can nevertheless be a presenting sign. In comparison, tremor in MSA is often jerkier and lacks the classical 'pill-rolling' aspect of rest tremor in PD (12% in MSA vs 74% in PD), while postural, action and intention tremor are more frequently seen in MSA. Tremor in PSP is also more often present during actions than during rest and it is usually symmetrical as opposed to asymmetrical tremor PD, although a PD-like tremor has also been reported.

Neurologic Wilson disease — manifestations and evaluation: Neurological manifestations of WD are also extremely variable, and there is no clear correlation between specific ATP7B mutations and risk of neurological presentation; neurological symptoms of WD include dysarthria, dystonia, gait abnormalities, ataxia, tremor, parkinsonism, and chorea, and seizures occur rarely. A complete neurological examination should be performed by a neurologist or movement disorder specialist in all patients with WD with neurological signs or symptoms detected on examination by any healthcare provider. Imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are of limited value in determining the extent of clinical neurological disease but may help in excluding other neurological disorders, and evaluation of the extrapyramidal system should include observation for posturing of the extremities or torso, irregular dance-like movements (chorea), determination of tone, and evidence of tremor at rest, with posture or action, or as a rubral wing-beating tremor.

### Quality improvement in neurology: essential tremor quality measurement set [^112BVxyo]. Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) prevalence, clinical features, and patient-reported care needs for quality improvement are summarized, including that ET has prevalence rates "ranging from 0.4% to 4.6%" and "is estimated to affect as many as 7 to 10 million Americans", with "the average age at onset in mid-to-late 40s". Clinically, ET is "characterized by bilateral, symmetric, postural tremor in hands and forearms, with or without kinetic tremor, in the absence of abnormal posturing or task specificity", can "affect lower extremities, head, and voice", and symptoms may be "barely noticeable, or severe and disabling". In a patient survey, "only 1 in 10 patients with ET indicated they were satisfied in their current treatment situation", and requested services included "psychological services and support (33.9%)" and "physical or occupational therapy (28.6%)", as well as "hiding embarrassment and social effects of tremor (15.8%)", "feelings of not being in control (13.7%)", "better counseling about current treatment and medications (11.9%)", "discussion of more treatment options or alternative treatment options (8.7%)", and "support groups (4.9%)", with needs for "more quantitative ways of assessing ET (12.5%)" and "tracking progression of the condition (12.7%)". The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) "seated a multidisciplinary work group to evaluate evidence and identify areas where quality improvement efforts could be focused and harmonized to meet patient and provider needs", and the group "reviewed existing guideline statements and attempted to locate research data supporting guideline use in practice. It is hoped that by developing quality measures additional information can be ascertained on clinical performance of guideline recommendations".

### Emergencies and critical issues in Parkinson's disease [^11784jeB]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Complications from Parkinson's disease may develop over the disease course, sometimes unexpectedly, and require prompt or even urgent medical intervention. The most common are associated with aggravation of motor symptoms; serious non-motor complications, such as psychosis, orthostatic hypotension or sleep attacks, also occur. Here we review such complications, their clinical presentation, precipitating factors and management, including those related to using device-aided therapies. Early recognition and prompt attention to these critical situations is challenging, even for the Parkinson's disease specialist, but is essential to prevent serious problems.
