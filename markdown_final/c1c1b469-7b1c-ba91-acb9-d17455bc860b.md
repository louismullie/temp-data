## Question

which test do you order for genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which genetic test to order for familial hypercholesterolemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and when genetic testing is indicated. Then, I should verify which genes must be included in the panel. Next, I will compare testing methodologies and choose the most appropriate platform. After that, I need to consider special populations and ancestry-specific issues. Finally, I should confirm logistics, counseling, and cascade screening steps, and close with a concise, actionable recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications for ordering genetic testing in FH, because I need to ensure we are not over-ordering or under-ordering. Genetic testing is reasonable when heterozygous FH is suspected but not definitively diagnosed by clinical criteria alone, and it is recommended to enable cascade screening of relatives; it is also considered in children and adolescents with severe hypercholesterolemia or a suggestive family history, and in selected cases to refine risk stratification or when results may change management, so I should anchor on those scenarios before proceeding [^def644b0] [^504cab99] [^f89c6c00] [^f00d721a].

> Next, I should review which genes must be included in the test, and I need to be precise here. The core FH genes are LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9, and I should confirm that the panel covers these comprehensively; LDLRAP1 is a fourth gene that explains a recessive FH phenotype and should be included when homozygous FH is suspected or when the phenotype suggests it, so I should double-check that the lab's panel includes at least LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9, and ideally LDLRAP1 when appropriate [^8cf43587] [^6460eab9] [^c22c93aa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about methodology; I need to compare limited-variant genotyping arrays versus comprehensive next-generation sequencing because sensitivity and ancestry coverage differ substantially. Limited arrays that interrogate only a small set of known variants miss a large fraction of pathogenic carriers, especially in individuals of Black/African American and Hispanic ancestry, whereas comprehensive NGS panels detect hundreds to thousands of known and novel variants across the full coding regions and copy number variations, so I should preferentially order a comprehensive NGS panel rather than a limited-variant screen [^aa5394a2] [^44cc75b5] [^8fda1eff].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of that sensitivity difference so I don't overstate it. In head-to-head analyses, limited screens missed roughly 62% to 69% of individuals with pathogenic FH variants detected by comprehensive NGS, with particularly high miss rates in Black/African American and Hispanic individuals, which reinforces the need to order a full-gene NGS panel when genetic testing is pursued [^aa5394a2] [^44cc75b5].

> I should also confirm that the NGS panel includes copy number variation detection for LDLR deletions and duplications, because large rearrangements are a recognized cause of FH and can be missed by assays that only sequence exons without CNV calling. A robust panel should report CNVs in LDLR and, ideally, include methods to distinguish APOB variants that cause FH from those causing familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, which have different clinical implications [^7ee2ebe7] [^4ee8d812].

> Let me consider special populations and ancestry-specific issues, and I need to ensure the test I order is fit for purpose. In individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, founder variants may be captured by targeted panels, but even there, comprehensive NGS outperforms limited screens; in Black/African American and Hispanic individuals, limited arrays are especially insensitive due to population-specific variant distributions, so I should default to comprehensive NGS unless there is a compelling, ancestry-matched targeted indication and counseling about limitations is provided [^aa5394a2] [^44cc75b5].

> Next, I should review logistics and pre-test counseling, and I need to check that I am not missing key steps. Testing should be ordered through a CLIA-certified laboratory with appropriate FH gene coverage, pre-test counseling should explain possible outcomes including variants of uncertain significance and the implications for relatives, and post-test counseling should guide interpretation and cascade screening; many labs offer reduced-cost family testing within a window after a positive index result, which I should leverage to facilitate cascade screening [^35a848b5] [^bc264df3] [^c82cac57].

> I will now examine cascade screening implications, because the test choice affects relatives. Once a pathogenic variant is identified in the proband, first-degree relatives should be offered cascade screening with either lipid profiling or targeted genetic testing for the familial variant; direct contact strategies and extending beyond first-degree relatives can increase yield, and I should coordinate this proactively with the family and, when needed, a genetic counselor to overcome communication barriers [^c82cac57] [^71cb8ca2] [^6effb6a6].

> But wait, what if the genetic test is negative despite strong clinical suspicion; I should prepare for that scenario. A negative genetic test does not exclude FH because current assays fail to detect a substantial fraction of cases, often due to polygenic hypercholesterolemia or variants in untested regions; in such cases, management should continue based on LDL-C and clinical risk, and I should avoid false reassurance while still considering cascade screening by lipids if the phenotype is compelling [^5f135e09] [^156b28d6] [^ccfd900b].

> Let me synthesize a concise, actionable recommendation, and I should double-check that it aligns with guidelines and evidence. Order a comprehensive, CLIA-certified NGS panel that includes full sequencing and CNV analysis of LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9, with inclusion of LDLRAP1 when homozygous FH is suspected, and ensure pre- and post-test genetic counseling to support result interpretation and family cascade screening; avoid limited-variant arrays unless there is a specific, ancestry-matched indication and the patient understands the risk of false negatives [^35a848b5] [^8cf43587] [^aa5394a2] [^44cc75b5].

Order a **comprehensive FH panel** (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDLRAP1) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) [^aa5394a2] to detect pathogenic variants and copy number changes, as this approach maximizes diagnostic yield and enables cascade screening [^c82cac57]. Limited-variant arrays are **not recommended** because they miss a substantial proportion of pathogenic variants, especially in diverse ancestries [^aa5394a2] [^44cc75b5]. Genetic testing is indicated for patients with suspected FH (e.g. LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL in adults, ≥ 155 mg/dL in children, or premature ASCVD) [^98075dec] and for cascade screening of first-degree relatives [^def644b0] [^c82cac57]. Pre- and post-test genetic counseling is essential to interpret results, discuss implications, and coordinate family screening [^bc264df3] [^1c013365].

---

## Recommended genetic test for FH

The **recommended genetic test** for FH is a comprehensive panel that includes:

- **LDLR**: low-density lipoprotein receptor gene.
- **APOB**: apolipoprotein B gene.
- **PCSK9**: proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene.
- **LDLRAP1**: LDL receptor adaptor protein 1 gene (especially relevant for homozygous FH or when consanguinity is suspected).

This panel should utilize **next-generation sequencing (NGS)** technology to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and copy number variations (CNVs) within these genes [^aa5394a2] [^7ee2ebe7]. NGS provides comprehensive coverage, identifying both known and novel pathogenic variants, and is superior to limited-variant arrays that screen only a subset of common variants [^aa5394a2] [^44cc75b5].

---

## Clinical indications for genetic testing

Genetic testing for FH is **recommended** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for genetic testing** |
|-|-|
| Suspected heterozygous FH (HeFH) | - LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL in adults [^98075dec] <br/> - Premature ASCVD <br/> - Family history of FH or premature ASCVD [^def644b0] |
| Suspected homozygous FH (HoFH) | - LDL-C > 400 mg/dL [^6ca3e52f] <br/> - Tendon xanthomas <br/> - Corneal arcus <br/> - Family history of HoFH |
| Cascade screening | First-degree relatives of individuals with genetically confirmed FH [^def644b0] [^c82cac57] |
| Pediatric patients | - LDL-C ≥ 155 mg/dL [^98075dec] <br/> - Family history of FH or premature ASCVD [^f0cf6887] |

---

## Limitations of genetic testing

While genetic testing is highly informative, it has **important limitations**:

- **Negative results**: A negative genetic test does not exclude FH, as some cases may be due to polygenic hypercholesterolemia or variants in untested regions [^5f135e09] [^156b28d6].
- **Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)**: Some variants may have unclear clinical significance, requiring careful interpretation and follow-up [^51dfcb10].
- **Access and cost**: Genetic testing may not be universally available or covered by insurance, limiting accessibility [^32e8dec2].

---

## Role of genetic counseling

Genetic counseling is **essential** in the FH testing process:

- **Pre-test counseling**: Informs patients about the benefits, limitations, and potential outcomes of genetic testing [^bc264df3].
- **Post-test counseling**: Interprets results, discusses implications for family members, and coordinates cascade screening [^c82cac57].
- **Psychosocial support**: Addresses emotional and ethical considerations, including privacy and insurance concerns [^c510f655].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Test selection**: Order a comprehensive FH panel (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, LDLRAP1) using NGS technology [^aa5394a2] [^7ee2ebe7].
- **Clinical indications**: Test patients with suspected FH, including those with elevated LDL-C, premature ASCVD, or family history of FH [^98075dec] [^def644b0].
- **Cascade screening**: Offer genetic testing to first-degree relatives of genetically confirmed FH patients [^def644b0] [^c82cac57].
- **Genetic counseling**: Provide pre- and post-test counseling to interpret results and coordinate family screening [^bc264df3] [^1c013365].

---

The recommended genetic test for FH is a **comprehensive NGS panel** covering LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDLRAP1, which maximizes diagnostic yield and enables cascade screening. Genetic testing is indicated for patients with suspected FH and their relatives, and should be accompanied by genetic counseling to interpret results and coordinate family screening.

### Clinical genetic testing for familial Hypercholesterolemia: JACC scientific expert panel [^8cf43587]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Although awareness of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is increasing, this common, potentially fatal, treatable condition remains underdiagnosed. Despite FH being a genetic disorder, genetic testing is rarely used. The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation convened an international expert panel to assess the utility of FH genetic testing. The rationale includes the following: 1) facilitation of definitive diagnosis; 2) pathogenic variants indicate higher cardiovascular risk, which indicates the potential need for more aggressive lipid lowering; 3) increase in initiation of and adherence to therapy; and 4) cascade testing of at-risk relatives. The Expert Consensus Panel recommends that FH genetic testing become the standard of care for patients with definite or probable FH, as well as for their at-risk relatives. Testing should include the genes encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9); other genes may also need to be considered for analysis based on patient phenotype. Expected outcomes include greater diagnoses, more effective cascade testing, initiation of therapies at earlier ages, and more accurate risk stratification.

### Integrated guidance on the care of familial hypercholesterolemia from the international FH foundation [^9d249a82]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a dominantly inherited disorder present from birth that markedly elevates plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and causes premature coronary heart disease. There are at least 20 million people with FH worldwide, but the majority remains undetected, and current treatment is often suboptimal. To address this major gap in coronary prevention we present, from an international perspective, consensus-based guidance on the care of FH. The guidance was generated from seminars and workshops held at an international symposium. The recommendations focus on the detection, diagnosis, assessment, and management of FH in adults and children and set guidelines for clinical purposes. They also refer to best practice for cascade screening and risk notifying and testing families for FH, including use of genetic testing. Guidance on treatment is based on risk stratification, management of noncholesterol risk factors, and the safe and effective use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapies. Recommendations are given on lipoprotein apheresis. The use of emerging therapies for FH is also foreshadowed. This international guidance acknowledges evidence gaps but aims to make the best use of contemporary practice and technology to achieve the best outcomes for the care of FH. It should accordingly be used to inform clinical judgment and be adjusted for country-specific and local healthcare needs and resources.

### International atherosclerosis society guidance for implementing best practice in the care of familial hypercholesterolaemia [^a704a5f7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

This contemporary, international, evidence-informed guidance aims to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) across different countries. FH, a family of monogenic defects in the hepatic LDL clearance pathway, is a preventable cause of premature coronary artery disease and death. Worldwide, 35 million people have FH, but most remain undiagnosed or undertreated. Current FH care is guided by a useful and diverse group of evidence-based guidelines, with some primarily directed at cholesterol management and some that are country-specific. However, none of these guidelines provides a comprehensive overview of FH care that includes both the lifelong components of clinical practice and strategies for implementation. Therefore, a group of international experts systematically developed this guidance to compile clinical strategies from existing evidence-based guidelines for the detection (screening, diagnosis, genetic testing and counselling) and management (risk stratification, treatment of adults or children with heterozygous or homozygous FH, therapy during pregnancy and use of apheresis) of patients with FH, update evidence-informed clinical recommendations, and develop and integrate consensus-based implementation strategies at the patient, provider and health-care system levels, with the aim of maximizing the potential benefit for at-risk patients and their families worldwide.

### Genetic testing for a patient with suspected familial hypercholesterolaemia [^fef4d7e9]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic condition that results in elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with consequent increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease events. Although it is considered an autosomal-dominant genetic condition, the underlying genetic causes of FH can be complex. Currently most guidelines rely on clinical criteria to diagnose FH. But this approach has some pitfalls. We present a patient who was not formally diagnosed with FH using commonly used and well-accepted clinical criteria but via genetic testing was found to have a mutation for this disorder. This case brings to fore the challenges clinicians face in diagnosing and managing such unusual cases optimally. Through this case report, we hope to stimulate a debate among clinicians as well as other stakeholders regarding the need to develop more efficient ways of selecting patients for genetic testing in response to elevated LDL levels.

Hereditary dyslipidemias are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, yet with significant health implications, most importantly causing preventable premature cardiovascular diseases. The commonly used clinical criteria to diagnose hereditary lipid disorders are specific but are not very sensitive. Genetic testing may be of value in making accurate diagnosis and improving cascade screening of family members, and potentially, in risk assessment and choice of therapy. This review focuses on using genetic testing in the clinical setting for lipid disorders, particularly familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Genetic testing in familial hypercholesterolemia: strengthening the tools, reinforcing efforts, and diagnosis [^72a567b0]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Fighting familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is mobilizing more and more health care professionals and scientists worldwide to better diagnose, treat, and prevent cardiovascular complications of the disease. Genetic research has repeatedly broadened the horizon and leads to effective treatments that significantly lower cholesterol to reach the recommendation levels.

FH is 1 of the most frequent genetic disorders with a prevalence of 1:200 to 1:250 for heterozygous FH. This prevalence is higher in several regions of the world due to founder effects. Despite the important risk of premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications, FH is largely underdiagnosed, with no more than 10% of FH patients aware of their genetic disease. Thus, increasing awareness, improving diagnosis and prevention, providing counseling to a larger number of patients, and adapting treatment could lower the burden of the disease, reduce its cardiovascular events, and save lives.

Autosomal dominant FH is mainly caused by mutations in 4 genes: the gene encoding the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the APOB gene encoding apolipoprotein B, the LDL receptor’s ligand. The third gene PCSK9 encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9, and the fourth is APOE. We identified the latter 2 by a pedigree-based genetic approach, and, in the case of PCSK9, this led to the new therapeutic class of anti-PCSK9 antibodies decreasing LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to unprecedentedly low levels. LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 have been included by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) among the 59 “medically actionable” genes. Genetic testing in FH is recommended worldwide and notably by the International and European Societies of Atherosclerosis through their joint FH Studies Collaboration (that includes over 56 countries), the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology, and institutions in the United Kingdom (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the United States (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FH Foundation).

### Developing and optimizing innovative tools to address familial hypercholesterolemia underdiagnosis: identification methods, patient activation, and cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia [^f95b8b50]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common cardiovascular genetic disorder and, if left untreated, is associated with increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of preventable death in the United States).Because of lifelong exposure to elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, individuals with FH are at very high risk of premature ASCVD without early and aggressive lipid lowering therapy.Indeed, 17 500 deaths annually and a significant percentage of heart attacks in people under 45 are attributable to FH. – Individuals with FH have up to a 20-fold increased risk of ASCVD relative to non-FH individuals with normal LDL-C.Importantly, when FH is diagnosed and treated early in life, the risk of ASCVD is greatly reduced.

Individuals with FH can be identified via clinical criteria and/or genetic testing. Because FH is an autosomal dominant genetic condition, screening at-risk relatives of individuals with FH (cascade testing) is highly effective in identifying additional individuals with FH who require treatment. However, in the United States, neither FH identification nor cascade testing is systematically performed. When index patient identification and cascade testing are routinely performed, ascertainment is vastly improved, preventive interventions begin at a younger age, and outcomes improve.Although FH is common, fatal, and treatable, estimates show 90% or 1.1 million people in the United States with FH are undiagnosed.

### Are genetic tests for atherosclerosis ready for routine clinical use? [^b70a0aeb]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

In this review, we lay out 3 areas currently being evaluated for incorporation of genetic information into clinical practice related to atherosclerosis. The first, familial hypercholesterolemia, is the clearest case for utility of genetic testing in diagnosis and potentially guiding treatment. Already in use for confirmatory testing of familial hypercholesterolemia and for cascade screening of relatives, genetic testing is likely to expand to help establish diagnoses and facilitate research related to most effective therapies, including new agents, such as PCSK9 inhibitors. The second area, adding genetic information to cardiovascular risk prediction for primary prevention, is not currently recommended. Although identification of additional variants may add substantially to prediction in the future, combining known variants has not yet demonstrated sufficient improvement in prediction for incorporation into commonly used risk scores. The third area, pharmacogenetics, has utility for some therapies today. Future utility for pharmacogenetics will wax or wane depending on the nature of available drugs and therapeutic strategies.

### Genetic testing in familial hypercholesterolemia: strengthening the tools, reinforcing efforts, and diagnosis [^51dfcb10]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing in FH aims at providing precise molecular diagnosis and important prognostic information and improving atherosclerosis risk stratification. This guides optimal management, prevention, and recruitment of affected relatives through cascade screening and family studies. It helps in rapidly implementing adequate treatment and offering optimal disease management knowing that an informative genetic test may boost patient motivation and compliance but also underscores the existence of a lifelong cholesterol burden, requiring effective and sustained cholesterol lowering. Furthermore, genetic testing has the potential to properly tailor treatment and confirm which patients will need more aggressive LDL-C lowering, such as compound heterozygotes. Indeed, homozygous patients for null alleles will not profit from any PCSK9 monoclonal antibody, whereas evolocumab causes a significant LDL-C reduction (by 30.9%) in patients with LDLR gene mutations in both alleles of which at least 1 is defective. It is noteworthy that compared with patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia or of unknown genetic cause, monogenic FH patients display reduced responsiveness to standard LDL-C lowering treatments, increased preclinical coronary atherosclerosis, and increased risk of atherosclerotic-related events.

DNA sequencing tools have become more powerful, rapid, and available at affordable prices. Next-generation sequencing with a gene panel specific for FH-associated genes as well as polymorphisms (used to establish the polygenic risk score) help detect both rare and common DNA variations underlying clinical hypercholesterolemia with a single laboratory method. The use of whole exome and genome sequencing is also increasing for FH diagnosis. These technical developments improve turnaround time for diagnosis, reduce cost, and increase chances in identifying the genetic cause of FH, whether monogenic, oligogenic, or polygenic. It should be noted that Sanger sequencing, the historic gold standard method, is still useful for confirmation and family cascade screening once the pathogenic variant (ie, the mutation) is known.

As the molecular methods have improved, the rate of data generated has increased and the interpretation of nucleotide events (missense, nonsense, and copy number variation) has become a bottleneck. Indeed, it is not always easy to interpret the clinical significance of genetic variants and to prove that novel LDLR sequence variations are pathogenic, especially for synonymous and missense variants. Furthermore, to standardize the interpretation of sequencing data, the Association for Clinical Genetic Science issued criteria for classifying variants in 2013, which were followed in 2015 by the ACMG/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines that aim to implement a very rigorous variant classification strategy valid for all genetic diseases, including FH. The guidelines include the use of computational analysis and modeling algorithms implemented in bioinformatics prediction tools.

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^2a75f98f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and severe primary hypercholesterolemia—patients are at high risk and genotype is not individually predictive, as stated: “Patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia, and suspected to have FH, are at high risk of ASCVD; the precise genotype is not predictive in an individual patient.” Treatment intensity follows lipid levels, not genotype: “Intensity of treatment should be guided by LDL-C elevation rather than the underlying genotype.” Evidence gaps remain: “Prospective studies are needed to determine whether genetic testing for FH in addition to routine lipid profile testing will alter cardiovascular outcomes by identifying the appropriate LDL-C–lowering therapy based on a patient’s gene mutations.”

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^def644b0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Genetic testing for monogenic lipid disorders—familial hypercholesterolemia and others: Genetic testing is reasonable when heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is suspected but not definitively diagnosed based on clinical criteria alone (IIa, B-NR). Cascade screening for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) either by lipid profile or genetic testing is recommended in all first-degree relatives (children and siblings) of an individual who has tested genetically positive for FH (I, C-EO). Genetic testing for other monogenic lipid disorders is reasonable when an accurate diagnosis may affect treatment choice or outcomes (IIa, C-LD).

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^908e0bb3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

National Lipid Association scientific statement—genetic testing in dyslipidemia notes that “the genetic basis for more than 2 dozen monogenic dyslipidemias has largely been defined,” and that “Genetic technologies, such as DNA sequencing, can detect both rare and common DNA variants underlying dyslipidemias, and these methods are increasingly available.” Although “patients with extreme abnormalities in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be considered for genetic testing, it is only in a minority of patients that the results will alter treatment or outcomes.” “Currently, there is potential clinical utility of genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, familial chylomicronemia syndrome, sitosterolemia, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, and a few other rare disorders.” However, “Clinical indications for genetic testing for most dyslipidemias are not clearly established and currently no guidelines exist,” and “A shared decision-making model between the patient and the provider is essential as patient values and preferences play a very strong role.” Stated benefits are that “genetic testing include providing a firm diagnosis in many cases, guiding optimal management and prevention strategies, advancing care strategies beyond currently available treatments, and contributing to overall scientific progress,” while “Understanding the limitations and risks of genetic testing techniques is also important, as careful interpretation of genetic test results to achieve the greatest benefit.”

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^836e888c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) genetic testing—risk stratification and treatment implications include that among individuals with elevated LDL-C (ie, ≥190 mg/dL), a heterozygous pathogenic FH-causing mutation is associated with a 22-fold increased risk of ASCVD compared with a normolipidemic individual, whereas among those with elevated LDL-C but no FH-causing mutation the risk is 6-fold increased; among clinically diagnosed heterozygous FH, a monogenic FH-causing mutation is associated with doubling of ASCVD risk compared with polygenic or no identified genetic cause; and individuals with a monogenic causative variant plus high polygenic score have 3-fold increased risk compared with clinically diagnosed FH with no identifiable genetic cause. Despite genetic heterogeneity, individuals with elevated LDL-C or clinically suspected FH are at very high risk of ASCVD (between 6- and 22-fold), and management should be based on their LDL-C elevation and not their genotype. In homozygous FH, genetic results may predict LDL-C response to PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, which is absent with receptor-null mutations, somewhat better with receptor-defective mutations, and may be best with a gain-of-function mutation in the PCSK9 gene; identification of homozygous or compound heterozygous LDLR mutations may guide gene therapy in the future.

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^16879485]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Genetic testing in dyslipidemia—candidate disorders and clinical features—dyslipidemias for which genetic testing could be clinically useful include familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), sitosterolemia, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, and other disorders, yet clinical indications for genetic testing for most dyslipidemias are not clearly established. The molecular genetic basis is well established for 25 monogenic dyslipidemias that are characterized by extreme blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and/or other lipids, and pathognomonic clinical features are variably present when there is a definite DNA lesion; when present they can facilitate diagnosis and trigger the consideration of genetic testing, with some systemic complications requiring subspecialist assessment and follow-up. The prototypical condition for which genetic testing is ordered is FH, a common co-dominant disorder.

### Defining the challenges of familial hypercholesterolemia screening: introduction [^d7941cae]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2010). Low credibility.

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common serious genetic conditions known. Appropriate treatment is clearly cost-effective, yet public health efforts are minimal in most countries. Despite remarkable progress in understanding of the genetic basis of cardiovascular disease and much talk about personalized medicine, we are still missing huge opportunities to find and help people with FH. Indeed, FH is the only genetic cause of premature CAD for which a systematic, population-based approach to find affected individuals and screen their families is clearly warranted at this time. Finding and helping persons with FH is the mission of the MEDPED program.

Genetic Testing

Diagnosis of FH may be confirmed with positive pathogenic genetic testing, 25 but cannot be excluded in the absence of a causative mutation. Genetic diagnosis of FH may involve testing for either known pathogenic variants in the genes for LDL‐R, ApoB, and PCSK9 or whole‐gene sequencing. 30 Depending on the setting, a substantial percentage of patients with a definitive clinical diagnosis of FH may not have an identifiable mutation, even with next‐generation whole‐gene sequencing. 18 In mutation‐negative patients, hypercholesterolemia may be secondary to an unidentified mutation or may be polygenic in nature. However, polygenic hypercholesterolemia would not typically be associated with the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance seen in many families with a clinical diagnosis of FH. LDL‐C genetic risk scoring, using the weighted sum of the LDL‐C‐raising alleles involved in determining lipid concentrations, can be used as a potential tool to differentiate between patients with polygenic dyslipidemia (but not FH) and patients with FH who test negative using current genetic assays. 31 Additionally, 1 expert group has suggested the umbrella of FH to include 2 groups of polygenic individuals whose inheritance pattern suggests an autosomal dominant disorder. They have termed these groups polygenic FH and FH combined with hypertriglyceridemia. Both groups have high polygenic scores and multiple family members with dyslipidemia and CAD. The former group is noted to have LDL‐C >190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) while the latter may have LDL‐C >190 mg/dL or a non‐ HDL‐C >220 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L) and triglycerides >300 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). 32 As noted previously, data from Khera and colleagues suggest that cardiovascular risk in these groups with polygenic dyslipidemia, while elevated compared with the general population, is not as high as those individuals with monogenic FH. 21

Consultation with a genetic counselor before genetic testing may be beneficial to ensure the patient understands the risks and benefits of genetic testing.

The results of genetic testing should complement clinical and nongenetic laboratory diagnoses. Effective cholesterol‐lowering treatments, which may include statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and other agents, are indicated for the treatment of patients with presumed FH regardless of genetic test results.

### A randomized controlled trial of genetic testing and cascade screening in familial hypercholesterolemia [^e852e9b1]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Family-based cascade screening from index probands is considered an effective way of identifying undiagnosed individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The role of genetic testing of the proband in the success of cascade screening for FH is unknown.

Methods

We randomized 240 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FH to genetic testing for FH (n=160) or usual care with lipid testing alone (n=80). The primary study endpoint was the proportion of probands with at least one relative enrolled in the study within one year after the notification of results.

Results

Proband median age was 59 (47-67) and 71% were female. Only 28 (12%) probands succeeded in enrolling a relative. While the genetic testing group had a higher proportion of probands with relatives enrolled (13.1%) compared with the usual care group (8.8%), this difference was not significant (p=0.40). In subgroup analyses, enrollment of a relative was higher in the pathogenic variant group (22.7%) compared to the no pathogenic variant (9.5%) and usual care groups (8.8%) (p=0.04).

Conclusion

We observed a low rate of family participation in cascade screening despite repeated recommendations to probands. Compared to usual care, genetic testing did not improve family participation in cascade screening for FH.

### Limited-variant screening vs comprehensive genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis [^ccfd900b]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Although identification of a P/LP variant is part of most diagnostic criteria for FH, diagnosis has traditionally been based only on clinical criteria, including elevated LDL cholesterol levels and family history of premature cardiovascular disease. However, family history may be inconclusive or unavailable and thus insensitive, and clinical observations such as cholesterol levels do not always meet diagnostic thresholds in some families with FH., Genetic testing is sufficient for diagnosis within clinical diagnostic criteria and can identify affected family members before symptom onset, enabling children to benefit from routine evaluation or treatment at a young age. A 20-year follow-up study of statin therapy in children found that none of those receiving treatment had died of cardiovascular disease before age 40 years, compared with 7% of their parents, who had initiated treatment later in life.

Unfortunately, genetic testing for FH is underused, with 90% of affected individuals worldwide remaining undiagnosed and only 3.9% of patients with FH in the US having a record of genetic testing. Recent expert statements recommend that patients suspected of having FH be offered genetic testing and that first-degree relatives of genetically positive individuals be screened for FH by lipid profile or genetic testing. In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cascade screening of relatives of individuals with FH.While the sequencing data in this study was sourced from a single clinical laboratory, any testing facility that provides high-coverage NGS for FH genes could address the genetic testing components of these recommendations.

Clinicians and consumers need to be aware of the limitations of any genetic test. In clinical settings, where clinicians may use limited-variant screens or comprehensive NGS tests, prior studies show that P/LP variants are identified in only 30% to 70% of individuals with a definite diagnosis of FH by LDL cholesterol levels or other clinical findings per Dutch Lipid Clinical Network scoring or Simon Broome Diagnostic Criteria for FH. Thus, an individual with clinical findings of FH and a negative result from any genetic test may have unidentified variants, and immediate family members remain at up to 50% risk. Further, the potential for false reassurance or incomplete information after limited-variant screening is not limited to FH. For any genetic condition with allelic heterogeneity in which multiple alleles at the same genetic locus can cause the same disease, analyzing only a limited selection of variants will likely lead to missed or incomplete diagnoses. Future work to pool comprehensive testing results from multiple testing facilities for comparison to limited-variant screening findings is needed to fully understand the disparate outcomes of various genetic technologies.

### Limited-variant screening vs comprehensive genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis [^8fda1eff]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Genetic tests for FH are available in clinical settings, where a clinician will order the test on behalf of a patient, and in consumer settings, where an individual may order a test directly from a testing laboratory (often called direct-to-consumer testing). In both settings, genetic tests frequently use either array-based genotyping or next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect variants. Critically, the technology used in a genetic test can substantially affect clinical utility. Array-based genotyping analyzes a limited set of genetic positions already known to have disease-causing variants. Sequencing-based testing is more comprehensive because it can analyze full gene sequences and detect not only known but also novel and private variants. One array-based product offered by a health and ancestry company focused on direct-to-consumer testing screens only 24 FH-associated variants as of July 2020,whereas tests that use NGS can detect more than 2000 known FH-associated variants as well as novel clinically actionable (pathogenic or likely pathogenic [P/LP]) variants.

Although most limited-variant screens are not offered in a medical or diagnostic setting, consumers may look to the results for guidance on health behaviors. Negative findings on a limited-variant screen in an individual who actually carries a disease-causing variant may lead to false reassurance that a disease-associated variant is not present, resulting in missed opportunities to initiate or intensify treatment and identify at-risk relatives. In addition, some limited-variant screens do not report whether an individual harbors 1 or 2 copies of a variant, whereas this is routine for NGS-based testing and can influence clinical management and outreach to relatives who may also need testing. Direct comparisons of these methods are needed to demonstrate how many patients with disease-associated FH variants might be identified with NGS but remain unidentified by limited-variant screens.

Here, we performed retrospective analyses of NGS results from individuals referred for FH diagnostic testing and individuals who received NGS of FH-associated genes as part of a proactive genetic test. We determined how many individuals with positive findings of FH variants on NGS would have been missed by a limited, 24-variant screen.

### 2023 update on European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: new treatments and clinical guidance [^37ffcf25]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2014, the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) statement on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH)focused attention on this rare and life-threatening disease, characterized by markedly elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels from birth and accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). At that time, HoFH had limited therapeutic options. Expert-led call-to-action statements and guidancecatalysed enormous progress, particularly in understanding the genetic complexity of HoFH and in developing new treatments. However, persistent questions regarding screening, diagnosis, and management require a new consensus statement (Box 1).

Box 1 
What is new in this EAS Consensus Statement on HoFH?

Updated diagnostic criteria
New insights into the genetics of HoFH
Updated recommendations on screening strategies for early identification
Updated recommendations for cardiac work-up at diagnosis and follow-up
Updated treatment algorithm incorporating novel treatments
Updated guidance on family planning for HoFH women of childbearing potential and heterozygous FH parents

Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of HoFH are major issues impacting HoFH care. Recent estimates indicate that ∼30 000 people worldwide have HoFH (Figure 1),, but <5% are identified.Inadequate awareness and ascertainment efforts, and a disconnect between clinical diagnosis and interpretation of genetic results by health providers and payers contribute to underdiagnosis. HoFH care is suboptimal, as shown by the HoFH International Clinical Collaborators (HICC) global registry,a clinician-founded initiative supported by the EAS including over 750 individuals from 38 countries (both high- and non-high-income regions). Diagnosis is made too late (median age 12 years), with ∼10% of patients showing clinical coronary atherosclerosis or aortic valve disease, and only 5% attain LDL-C goals.Treatment inequity is a major issue impacting patient cardiovascular health in less affluent countries.Urgent action is clearly needed to (i) improve awareness, and (ii) implement pragmatic clinical guidance for HoFH care, recognizing practical issues in different world regions. This second EAS statement updates evidence and addresses practical constraints impacting equity in care. How to balance advances in scientific knowledge with the realities of care globally is key to improving HoFH diagnosis and management.

Conclusions

Overall, our findings demonstrate a potential for significantly reduced clinical sensitivity and false reassurance among most individuals (61.8% to 68.9%) with disease-causing FH variants when limited-variant, array-based testing is used, especially among Black/African American and Hispanic individuals. Whether testing is obtained directly by a consumer or through a clinical setting, those tested should consult with a genetic counselor or other qualified health care professional to fully understand the benefits and limitations of the different types of genetic testing for FH.

### Cascade testing in familial hypercholesterolaemia: how should family members be contacted? [^6effb6a6]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Cascade testing or screening provides an important mechanism for identifying people at risk of a genetic condition. For some autosomal dominant conditions, such as familial hpercholesterolaemia (FH), identifying relatives allows for significant health-affecting interventions to be administered, which can extend a person's life expectancy significantly. However, cascade screening is not without ethical implications. In this paper, we examine one ethically contentious aspect of cascade screening programmes, namely the alternative methods by which relatives of a proband can be contacted. Should the proband be invited to contact his or her family members, or should the screening programme contact family members directly? We argue that direct contact is an ethically justifiable method of contact tracing in cascade screening for FH. Not only has this method already been utilised without adverse effects, an examination of the ethical arguments against it shows these are unsubstantiated. We describe several criteria that, if met, will allow an appropriate balance to be struck between maximising the efficiency of family tracing and respecting the interests of probands and their relatives.

### Limited-variant screening vs comprehensive genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis [^6460eab9]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1:176 to 1:282., FH causes lifelong exposure to elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that can lead to premature coronary artery disease and early death, exceeding the risks among patients with equivalent levels of LDL cholesterol due to multiple alternative factors. Timely pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality risks, but unfortunately most individuals with FH are undiagnosed and thus untreated., FH can be diagnosed clinically and via genetic testing, with the latter offering several advantages including the ability to identify affected individuals who do not meet specific cholesterol-level thresholds as well as asymptomatic and presymptomatic relatives who may be at risk for the specific disease-causing variant identified in the family. However, genetic tests vary greatly in their quality and in how many of the thousands of known and novel FH-associated genetic variants they include.

FH is an autosomal dominant disorder most frequently associated with variants in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene.Less frequently, FH is caused by variants in the apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene, primarily in the LDLR-binding region of the protein, or by gain-of-function variants in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9). Additionally, a rare, recessive form of FH is caused by variants in the LDLR adaptor protein 1 gene (LDLRAP1). The particular gene affected and the type of variant can influence an individual’s level of LDL cholesterol and risk for developing coronary artery disease, as well as the intensity of pharmacologic intervention needed to control cholesterol levels. LDLR null variants are most severe, while individuals with other LDLR variants, APOB variants, and PCSK9 variants generally have a milder phenotype.

Diagnostic and treatment summary

We recommend that most individuals with FH should be treated in primary care, preferably in a family context, while complex cases including children should be referred to specialized lipid or FH clinics. However, as FH management in primary care poses major challenges such as appropriate use of genetic testing, frequent requirement for polypharmacy, specialist knowledge of non-invasive testing, and complex organizational requirements for family cascade screening, ‘shared care’ between primary care and specialized lipid or FH clinics is another attractive option. In most countries, there is an urgent need for education of physicians to deal with FH, to establish networks of Lipid/FH clinics, and to establish laboratories for genetic screening and testing, preferably in a concerted manner (Figure 10).

### Estimated yield of screening for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with and without genetic testing in US adults [^7cf52d91]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the 2018 American College of Cardiology/AHA cholesterol guidelines recommending that all US adults aged ≥20 years not already on lipid‐lowering therapy undergo lipid measurements to estimate ASCVD risk and establish baseline values, there is limited evidence on the diagnostic yield of screening and relative lack of awareness and lipid testing among younger adults.Around two thirds of US adults report having their cholesterol checked, but those aged ≥40 years are 2.5 to 2.7 times more likely to be aware of a hypercholesterolemia diagnosis than those aged <40 years.As FH screening goes beyond measuring lipids alone, collecting accurate personal and family history information, patient symptoms, and genetics, it is likely that the number of young adults with FH screening is even lower. Our results identified potential subgroups of US adults, for whom FH screening may be especially beneficial. In some groups that we examined, an FH diagnosis may not alter treatment decisions (eg, those with an LDL‐C ≥190 mg/dL for whom high‐intensity statins are currently recommended).However, in subgroups for whom decisions about lipid‐lowering treatment may be less certain (eg, young adults, those with an LDL‐C between 160 and 189 mg/dL, or those with a 10‐year ASCVD risk score <7.5%), we quantified the potential FH screening yield that can be used to inform FH screening policy and clinical treatment decisions. Data from the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Studies Collaboration show that median age of FH diagnosis is 46 years.National FH screening programs could lead to earlier identification and treatment of individuals with FH to reduce the risk of premature ASCVD.In addition, a national genetic screening program for FH young adults in Australia was found to be cost‐effective.

An effort to continue sharing more detailed results and precise data is essential to allow the full benefit of the new genomic tools to be available to patients worldwide. The continued development and scaling of prediction tools such as the MLb-LDLr, together with FH-dedicated databases (integrating variant frequencies from populations of various geographic origins and genotype-phenotype correlations), are crucial. This will be important and strengthen the commitment of consortium and expert committees or geneticists with long-standing expertise in FH in providing a better and more accurate diagnosis along with effective tools for proper and efficient result interpretation in order to improve patient care and fight the disease.

### Low-cost high-throughput genotyping for diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia [^62626550]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a prevalent autosomal codominant disorder, predisposing affected individuals to premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to lifelong increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. FH variant carriers are at a 3- to 4-fold increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared with noncarriers. – Early initiation of lipid-lowering therapy in FH patients can prevent cardiovascular disease.Genetic screening is, therefore, strongly advised by guidelines, as it enables identification of FH patients at a young age, leads to a more reliable risk stratification, and positively affects initiation of and compliance to lipid-lowering therapy. – Despite the widely acknowledged positive implications of an early and reliable genetic diagnosis, ≈90% of the 30 million affected individuals worldwide have not been identified yet, leading to significant losses in health in FH variant carriers.On top of several other promising strategies to enhance FH detection,improving access to cheap and reliable genetic testing for FH may help in further implementation of wider genetic testing to increase the diagnostic yield in subjects with a clinical suspicion of FH.

Nowadays, genetic testing for FH focuses on identifying a pathogenic variant in 1 of the 3 FH genes (ie, low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR], apolipoprotein B [APOB], and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9]). Genetic testing for FH has historically involved DNA sequencing of the 3 FH genes by Sanger sequencing in specialized laboratories, which is rapidly being replaced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) nowadays. Because such DNA sequencing methods are laborious and relatively expensive, large-scale application of DNA testing for FH is often hampered and alternative rapid and affordable molecular diagnostic methods are warranted.A promising method for fulfilling these demands is the use of genotyping arrays that have a standard content of predetermined FH-causing variants. While the ability of genotyping arrays to accurately diagnose very rare variants has been debated, multiple studies have demonstrated their diagnostic accuracy, particularly when modified genotype calling procedures are employed. – For FH, this has been done with arrays containing probes for a limited amount of pathogenic variants, varying between 20 and 251 FH variants. –

In the present study, we first show that a more comprehensive customized genotyping array, containing 636 variants, previously classified as FH-causing, in combination with advanced genotyping calling procedures, would theoretically allow the identification of >90% of FH variant carriers in the Netherlands. Second, we validated this array in a selected sample of 1268 FH patients, previously diagnosed in the Dutch FH cascade screening program.

### The power of the pedigree: cascade screening in familial hypercholesterolemia [^c510f655]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by lifelong elevated levels of cholesterol.Despite widespread prevalence (∼1 in 250 people for the heterozygous form), it remains severely underdiagnosed, with estimates that <10% of affected individuals are aware of their diagnosis. Considering the linear relationship of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, FH patients experience accelerated atherosclerosis in the setting of cumulative lifetime exposure to high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. FH can be diagnosed based on clinical criteria;however, if feasible, genetic testing for causative genes should be undertaken, with testing for pathogenic variants in three primary genes: LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9.

Cascade screening allows for testing of family members of the index patient (the proband) who are at-risk based on their relationship to the patient; this can be done through a combination of lipid profile screening and genetic testing. Among those with genetically confirmed FH, cascade screening represents a simple, cost-effective method for identifying additional cases in a family. This ultimately leads to earlier diagnoses of FH and promotion of lipid-lowering therapy.

As an example of its effectiveness, a cascade screening program in the Netherlands, where genetic results were shared with a national foundation who then contacted the proband to help facilitate cascade screening, helped identify 70% of cases nationwide.In the United States, it is estimated that only ∼9% of probands had at least one relative screened,which may stem from significant barriers to cascade screening:,, 1) underdiagnosis of the index case (knowledge of the disorder, awareness of current guidelines, challenges of deciphering lipid and family history, patient opposition to screening, ineffective communication of genetic information among family members); 2) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act prohibits direct contact of at-risk relatives unless prior authorization from the proband has been given (ie, privacy laws); 3) providers and payers tied to poor reimbursement; and 4) concerns around genetic discrimination and stigmatization tied to the ability to obtain health insurance once a diagnosis is made.,,

### Life course approach for managing familial hypercholesterolemia [^8da8b043]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

An FH diagnosis may be made if a genetic variant associated with FH is present, or phenotypic criteria using scoring algorithms such as Dutch Lipid Clinics, Simon–Broome, Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death, or American Heart Association.It should be remembered that patients with a genetic variant may not meet phenotypic criteria, and, conversely, many patients who meet phenotypic criteria will not have a positive genetic test. While genetic testing is optimal for accurate diagnosis, it is also important for the initiation of cascade testing of relatives, and in the presence of severe hypercholesterolemia, in distinguishing between HeFH and HoFH. Testing may not be available in many places worldwide and may be too expensive for many families. Except for countries where cholesterol screening programs are in place, most children worldwide are diagnosed on the basis of cascade testing of index cases or a known positive family history of FH, premature CAD, or severely elevated cholesterol.

### Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis and management of pediatric and adult patients: clinical guidance from the National Lipid Association expert panel on familial hypercholesterolemia [^14adc7ac]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

The familial hypercholesterolemias (FH) are a group of genetic defects resulting in severe elevations of blood cholesterol levels and increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. FH is among the most commonly occurring congenital metabolic disorders. FH is a treatable disease. Aggressive lipid lowering is necessary to achieve the target LDL cholesterol reduction of at least 50% or more. Even greater target LDL cholesterol reductions may be necessary for FH patients who have other CHD risk factors. Despite the prevalence of this disease and the availability of effective treatment options, FH is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly among children. Deficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of FH indicate the need for greatly increased awareness and understanding of this disease, both on the part of the public and of healthcare practitioners. This document provides recommendations for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of FH in pediatric and adult patients developed by the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia. This report goes beyond previously published guidelines by providing specific clinical guidance for the primary care clinician and lipid specialist with the goal of improving care of patients with FH and reducing their elevated risk for CHD.

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^af52dc54]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

The genetic basis for more than 2 dozen monogenic dyslipidemias has largely been defined. Genetic technologies, such as DNA sequencing, can detect both rare and common DNA variants underlying dyslipidemias, and these methods are increasingly available. Although patients with extreme abnormalities in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be considered for genetic testing, it is only in a minority of patients that the results will alter treatment or outcomes. Currently, there is potential clinical utility of genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, familial chylomicronemia syndrome, sitosterolemia, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, and a few other rare disorders, and this will increase the demand for reliable genetic diagnostic methods at lower cost. Clinical indications for genetic testing for most dyslipidemias are not clearly established and currently no guidelines exist. A shared decision-making model between the patient and the provider is essential as patient values and preferences play a very strong role. Potential benefits of genetic testing include providing a firm diagnosis in many cases, guiding optimal management and prevention strategies, advancing care strategies beyond currently available treatments, and contributing to overall scientific progress. Understanding the limitations and risks of genetic testing techniques is also important, as is careful interpretation of genetic test results to achieve the greatest benefit. Here we review laboratory methods, as well as technical, biological, clinical, and ethical implications and applications of genetic testing in dyslipidemias.

### 2023 update on European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: new treatments and clinical guidance [^6ca3e52f]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

This 2023 statement updates clinical guidance for homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH), explains the genetic complexity, and provides pragmatic recommendations to address inequities in HoFH care worldwide. Key strengths include updated criteria for the clinical diagnosis of HoFH and the recommendation to prioritize phenotypic features over genotype. Thus, a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >10 mmol/L (>400 mg/dL) is suggestive of HoFH and warrants further evaluation. The statement also provides state-of-the art discussion and guidance to clinicians for interpreting the results of genetic testing and for family planning and pregnancy. Therapeutic decisions are based on the LDL-C level. Combination LDL-C-lowering therapy-both pharmacologic intervention and lipoprotein apheresis (LA)-is foundational. Addition of novel, efficacious therapies (i.e. inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, followed by evinacumab and/or lomitapide) offers potential to attain LDL-C goal or reduce the need for LA. To improve HoFH care around the world, the statement recommends the creation of national screening programmes, education to improve awareness, and management guidelines that account for the local realities of care, including access to specialist centres, treatments, and cost. This updated statement provides guidance that is crucial to early diagnosis, better care, and improved cardiovascular health for patients with HoFH worldwide.

### Reproductive carrier screening: identifying families at risk for familial hypercholesterolemia in the United States [^6ed80b10]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the American Heart Association recommends all adults aged 20 years and older have cholesterol (and other risk factors) evaluated every 4 to 6 years, testing is underutilized.Moreover, there is a range of LDL-C levels associated with FH and not all adults with FH have an LDL-C level above the diagnostic cutoff of 190 mg/dL.Identification of FH, through LDL-C levels may be more difficult in older adults because there is an age-related increase and therefore greater overlap in levels for people with and without FH. Accordingly, the diagnosis of FH is typically made based on a combination of family history, clinical examination findings, and LDL-C levels with, or without, genetic testing.However, the presence of a pathogenic FH gene variant alone has also been considered sufficient to make the diagnosis of FH, irrespective of the patient’s clinical features.These current testing strategies only identify ≈15% of individuals with FH and often times the diagnosis is only made once there is overt CVD, highlighting the need for a more proactive approach.It has been pointed out that while there is a need for an effective approach to screening for FH, the optimal approach has remained elusive.

### Familial hypercholesterolemia: screening, diagnosis, and treatment (...) [^63e87d99]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, is characterized by markedly increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that causes premature arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia typically presents with pathognomonic physical findings such as xanthomas or a corneal arcus. In contrast, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is not indicated by clinical findings and is typically not diagnosed until after an early-onset ASCVD event. 1 The worldwide prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is estimated to be 1 in 250 to 350, and ASCVD events can occur with this condition as young as 17 years in men and by 25 years of age in women. 2–4 Screening for and diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood can lead to treatment with lifestyle changes and medication, reducing the serious vascular effects of this dyslipidemia.

8 NICE advocates reviewing medical records to identify families with members older than 16 years who have LDL cholesterol greater than 190 mg per dL and a family history of ASCVD clinical events in men younger than 55 years and women younger than 65 years. These family members are then screened for dyslipidemia and genetically tested for familial hypercholesterolemia if the screening shows adults with LDL cholesterol greater than 190 mg per dL or children with LDL cholesterol greater than 155 mg per dL. 9 The American Heart Association endorses screening patients between 9 and 11 years of age to permit early identification of familial hypercholesterolemia and secondary “cascade” screening of other family members when a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia is identified.
1.

A reasonable practice is to combine the NICE and American Heart Association approaches and order a lipid profile for all family members older than 9 years who have a first-degree relative with a premature ASCVD event or a relative receiving treatment for LDL cholesterol greater than 190 mg per dL. The Dutch Criteria for Familial Hypercholesterolemia is a validated tool to assist clinicians in screening decisions and diagnosis.

### Functional testing of familial hypercholesterolemia-related variants: from bench to clinics [^5ee0674a]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Because FH is a monogenic disease, genetic testing has an important role in contributing to the diagnosis and subsequent clinical management not only of the index cases but also of their families. When no single-gene disorder is identified, approximately 20% to 40% of cases may have a polygenic etiology or high lipoprotein(a) concentration. The accuracy of the genetic testing results depends on the presence of the phenotype, the type of examination used, its indication, and the data available in the literature. It also depends on its curation to serve as a guide to laboratories and clinicians.

To conclude, the study of Islam et alconfirms previous evidence of the value of functional testing to characterize LDLR variants as causative of the FHF phenotype,but adds important association with clinical aspects of this disease. More studies with functional testing are expected and welcome!

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^156b28d6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Polygenic risk scores for hypercholesterolemia and clinical use: At least 15 different polygenic scores for LDL-C levels have been reported in research studies, but none of them is the accepted “gold standard” score for routine clinical use; in research studies, various scores demonstrate that 20 to 30% of patients with very high LDL-C levels have a high polygenic score rather than a single gene mutation driving the high LDL-C levels. For the FH phenotype, there is currently no consensus on how to use polygenic scores or the best score to use, and in instances when the genotype and phenotype may not agree, clinical decisions should be guided by the biochemical LDL-C phenotype; key points state that up to 30% of patients clinically suspected to have monogenic FH actually have polygenic hypercholesterolemia, management should be based on the severity of LDL-C elevation rather than whether the patient has monogenic or polygenic etiology, the clinical utility of polygenic scores is presently unclear, and implications of polygenic hypercholesterolemia for cascade family screening for FH among relatives need to be defined.

### Patient acceptance of genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia in the CASCADE FH registry [^32e8dec2]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Barriers to genetic testing and subsequent family cascade screening for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) include cost, patient and provider awareness, privacy and discrimination concerns, need for a physician order, underutilization of genetic counselors, and family concerns about the implications of genetic testing for care.

Objectives

The objective of the study was to determine the uptake of genetic testing with cost and privacy removed.

Methods

The FH Foundation offered free genetic testing and counseling to patients in the patient portal of the CASCADE FH Registry, who had not previously undergone genetic testing for 3 genes associated with FH (LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9). The free testing offer was extended to first-degree relatives of participants who had a positive genetic test result for cascade screening.

Results

Of 435 eligible patients, 147 opted in to participate, 122 consented, and 110 (68.2% female, median age: 52 years) received genetic testing. Of the participants, 64 had a positive genetic test result for a pathogenic variant in LDLR (59) or APOB (5); 11 had a variant of uncertain significance. Only 3 first-degrees relatives underwent genetic testing.

Conclusions

Although there was substantial interest in genetic testing, uptake of family cascade screening was poor. Innovative approaches to increase family cascade screening should be explored.

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^c82cac57]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

National Lipid Association scientific statement—family screening in genetic dyslipidemia should be recommended: at-risk relatives should at least be screened biochemically if a patient has a monogenic dyslipidemia. Cascade testing with either a lipid profile or DNA analysis cost-effectively identifies additional affected individuals, and DNA analysis may be preferred in some cases. Cascade testing should begin with first-degree relatives and then extend to second- and third-degree relatives in a stepwise “cascade” fashion, moving through the pedigree sequentially until all affected relatives have been identified. Clinicians should construct a family pedigree, identify at-risk relatives, and discuss with the proband the importance of informing relatives, with assistance and recommendation documented by the clinician. Probands should communicate their diagnosis to at-risk relatives, and communication assistance tools, such as family letters and online tools, should be provided to probands.

### An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of population genetic screening for familial hypercholesterolemia in US patients [^9d33183a]. Atherosclerosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Familial hypercholesterolemia is an underdiagnosed genetic metabolic condition limiting the clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increasing lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Population genetic screening in unselected individuals could quickly identify cases of familial hypercholesterolemia and enable early prevention, but the economic impact of widespread screening on patients has not been studied.

Methods

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of population genetic screening for familial hypercholesterolemia in 20 and 35-year-old adults in the United States from the perspective of patients. We developed a decision tree Markov hybrid model to examine diagnoses, cardiovascular disease, cardiac events, quality of life, and costs under population genetic screening compared to family-based cascade testing.

Results

While population genetic screening increased diagnoses and reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease, population genetic screening was not cost-effective compared to cascade testing at current levels of willingness to pay. Lower genetic testing costs, combined screening with other genetic conditions, and support to maintain lipid-lowering therapy use over time could improve the cost-effectiveness of population genetic screening.

Conclusions

Future research is needed to examine how cost-sharing strategies may affect the cost-effectiveness of screening to patients and how families and providers experience the clinical and economic outcomes of population screening.

### Defining the challenges of FH screening for familial hypercholesterolemia [^a568cb4a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to briefly review but also to highlight the rationale, motivation, and methods in the process of identifying patients of all ages with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an often hidden but very important genetic disorder. Since the initiation of population screening for FH in 1994 in the Netherlands, a vast amount of experience has been gathered, addressing almost all issues that are encountered in population screening.

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^af5edf5d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Impact of genetic test results on treatment and behavior—positive genetic confirmation of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may improve adherence with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering treatment, may permit access to certain treatments, and may motivate cascade screening of family members, and patients with a positive DNA result may feel more motivated to undergo screening for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). If no causative mutation is identified, some patients might experience decreased compliance and reduced motivation, possibly discontinuing treatment. Key points note that positive results may increase compliance and motivation, negative results may have the opposite effect in some patients, and genetic testing may facilitate targeted treatment for specific disorders.

### Developing and optimizing innovative tools to address familial hypercholesterolemia underdiagnosis: identification methods, patient activation, and cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia [^07cf23f7]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Implementation of evidence-based research into practice relies on passive diffusion, is inconsistent, and can take upwards of 17 years.This gap between evidence-based guidelines and their implementation into routine clinical practice is one of the most critical issues facing health care and public health today.Multiple barriers and facilitators to FH diagnosis and cascade testing have been identifiedand exist at the patient, provider, and health care system levels.These barriers include low levels of lipid screening of pediatric individuals,diagnostic criteria that are not optimized to facilitate FH identification in EHRs, suboptimal self-reported family history data, proband concerns about having the appropriate communication skills to inform family members about their risks, with resultant low FH identification and recruitment of at-risk relatives to cascade testing.

According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, work addressing barriers and gaps in care related to underdiagnosis of FH creates an opportunity to expand translational research agendas in genomics, precision medicine, and implementation science. To address these gaps, IMPACT-FH partners researchers with expertise in genetics, clinical lipidology, health communication, and implementation science with stakeholders from the FH Foundation, including individuals with FH, those with expertise in technology-based tools for FH identification, and health care providers dedicated to improving FH care. Through qualitative and implementation science methodologies, IMPACT-FH will use patient-engaged learnings to build tools for individuals with FH and health care providers that focus on outcomes most important to these individuals, and their families.

Improving identification and diagnosis of individuals with FH is a pivotal first step in the treatment and management of elevated LDL-C levels, preventing ASCVD, and alerting at-risk relatives about the need for cascade testing. Historically, identification of individuals with FH has relied on recognition of clinical and family history features such as lipid levels, premature ASCVD, and physical features such as xanthomas and corneal arcus.Genetic testing for FH can identify 60% to 80% of clinically suspected FH cases and population-based genomic screening programs can identify individuals with FH pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants who do not meet clinical diagnostic criteria. Previous research has found FH genetic testing improves diagnosis and is associated with improved adherence to recommended treatment and lower LDL-C and total cholesterol levels.,– Evaluating FH identification models and automating pedigree construction can lead to the creation of a novel ensemble model that incorporates elements of both genomic- and phenotype-based approaches to more accurately identify individuals likely to have FHwho need further clinical evaluation.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents: gaining decades of life by optimizing detection and treatment [^5c0181d7]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Globally, one baby is born with FH every minute. If diagnosed and treated early in childhood, individuals with FH can have normal life expectancy. This consensus paper aims to improve awareness of the need for early detection and management of FH children. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is diagnosed either on phenotypic criteria, i.e. an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level plus a family history of elevated LDL-C, premature coronary artery disease and/or genetic diagnosis, or positive genetic testing. Childhood is the optimal period for discrimination between FH and non-FH using LDL-C screening. An LDL-C ≥5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or an LDL-C ≥4 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with family history of premature CHD and/or high baseline cholesterol in one parent, make the phenotypic diagnosis. If a parent has a genetic defect, the LDL-C cut-off for the child is ≥3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). We recommend cascade screening of families using a combined phenotypic and genotypic strategy. In children, testing is recommended from age 5 years, or earlier if homozygous FH is suspected. A healthy lifestyle and statin treatment (from age 8 to 10 years) are the cornerstones of management of heterozygous FH. Target LDL-C is <3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if >10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from baseline if 8-10 years, especially with very high LDL-C, elevated lipoprotein(a), a family history of premature CHD or other cardiovascular risk factors, balanced against the long-term risk of treatment side effects. Identifying FH early and optimally lowering LDL-C over the lifespan reduces cumulative LDL-C burden and offers health and socioeconomic benefits. To drive policy change for timely detection and management, we call for further studies in the young. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment from childhood are critical to adding decades of healthy life for children and adolescents with FH.

### Case-finding and genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care [^9e254e04]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is one of the most common inherited disorders. The heterozygote form of FH is estimated to have a prevalence of 1 in 250.Left untreated, these individuals are at increased risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD).Treatment with lipid-lowering treatment, like statins, can dramatically reduce this risk.However, the majority of patients remain undiagnosed and untreated.

International guidelines recommend the identification of FH using various case-finding tools.In the UK, the 2008 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) FH guidelines recommended identifying possible FH cases in primary care using the Simon-Broome (S-B) criteria.In addition to the established case-finding approaches, we have developed a novel case-finding tool (Familial Hypercholetserolaemia Case Ascertainment Tool, FAMCAT).

Once an individual is identified at possible risk of FH, guidelines recommend the individual should be genetic tested to confirm the diagnosis.Currently, this testing is not offered in primary care but in specialist care.The most recently developed genetic test for FH uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostic assay. In addition to identifying FH-causing variants, this more comprehensive analysis identifies individuals with genetic variants of unknown significance (VUS) and those with minor variants that collectively can suggest the individual has a polygenic cause for hypercholesterolaemia.

We offered direct access to FH genetic testing in primary care, as part of a study to optimise the FAMCAT case-finding tool. We sought to identify the genetic and lipid profile of patients found at increased risk of FH, and the outcomes in those identified with FH-causing genetic variants or VUS in primary care.

### Implications of diagnosis through a machine learning algorithm on management of people with familial Hypercholesterolemia [^6e21d79a]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an underdiagnosed genetic condition that results in markedly elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increased risk for premature coronary heart disease. It is inherited in a monogenic, autosomal dominant pattern and affects approximately 1 in 313 people in the general population.If untreated, individuals with FH have a 3.8-fold increased risk of developing premature coronary heart disease, the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.Studies suggest that 26% of patients with FH have an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event by age 40, and 7% do not survive past this age.It is estimated that <1% of affected persons worldwide receive a formal diagnosis.

The American Heart Association and National Lipid Association currently recommend applying diagnostic criteria (eg, the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, the MEDPED criteria, or the Simon Broome Register) in adults with high clinical suspicion for FH, which is usually based on a threshold LDL-C level exceeding 190 mg/dL with a family history of early-onset ASCVD.,Formal assessment requires manual review of certain variables, such as history of ASCVD events, untreated lipid levels, physical examination findings including tendon xanthomas, medical histories of first-degree relatives, and genetic testing results (if available). Although there remains significant clinical utility in reviewing these criteria and conducting a thorough physical exam, there nevertheless remain certain pragmatic barriers to diagnosis, such as obtaining a detailed family history, determining the precise age of index events, and investing the time for such investigations.

### The power of the pedigree: cascade screening in familial hypercholesterolemia [^893a9189]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

This study takes the field further in our understanding of the implementation of cascade screening for FH. It is imperative that future research continue focusing on the role of genetic counseling and integration of genetic counselors into multidisciplinary teams. Understanding barriers to sharing genetic information at a patient level needs to be understood so that solutions can be implemented to address them. Even so, there remains a staggeringly high rate of underdiagnosis of FH, and research into the lack of education and how to overcome this remains paramount.

### Genetic testing in dyslipidemia: a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association [^650d9aa0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction—monogenic and polygenic lipid disorders—genetic testing is increasingly becoming a common consideration in the clinical care of patients with dyslipidemia, and confirming a diagnosis of monogenic dyslipidemia using genetic testing can affect management and screening to identify affected family members, termed “cascade screening”, as has been well defined in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In contrast, polygenic dyslipidemias result from concurrent contributions of multiple common variants, that is, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and more recently polygenic scores constructed from millions of SNPs with vanishingly small individual effect sizes are informative for common diseases, but more work is needed to determine their appropriate application in clinical practice, and validation studies are needed to verify the accuracy of specific genetic testing platforms and polygenic score algorithms. Key points note that rare, large-effect DNA variants cause monogenic or Mendelian dyslipidemias and that genetic testing for such variants may have clinical utility, whereas common small-effect DNA variants in aggregate create susceptibility quantifiable in a polygenic score, whose clinical utility is currently less clear.

### Estimated yield of screening for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with and without genetic testing in US adults [^d2d06457]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder that causes elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and is associated with an increased risk of early‐onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).An estimated 0.32% (95% CI, 0.26–0.39%) of individuals worldwide, and 0.40% (95% CI, 0.32–0.48%) of US adults, have FH.When untreated, the average age of first myocardial infarction in individuals with heterozygous FH is 50 years in men and 60 years in women, compared with 66 years in men and 72 years in women in the general population.Early identification of FH and initiation of lipid‐lowering treatment can prevent early ASCVD events during the young adult and middle age years and reduce risk over a patient’s lifetime.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has thus identified FH screening as a tier 1 genomic application with public health benefits, yet current guidelines have conflicting recommendations for FH screening.,

FH may be identified using a combination of clinical (eg, abnormally elevated LDL‐C and personal or family history of early ASCVD events) and genetic (ie, presence of likely pathogenic FH genetic variants) criteria, such as those used by Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) or American Heart Association (AHA).Although LDL‐C screening in US adults is common, FH screening requires accurate collection of additional clinical information or diagnostic genetic testing, which may be infrequent. In the CASCADE FH (Cascade Screening for Awareness and Detection of FH) patient registry, only 3.9% of patients with FH report genetic testing.In the United States, national surveys do not collect data on FH variants, and the potential impact of genetic testing on the yield of national screening for FH has not been estimated. FH screening using clinical criteria, genetic testing, or in combination might help identify individuals with FH who would benefit from treatment to reduce the risk of premature ASCVD.

We set out to estimate the probability of having any FH variants based on clinical characteristics and genotype data from participants in the UK Biobank. Then, we applied the UK Biobank–developed predictive model to US adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate FH screening yields based on clinical criteria alone using the modified DLCN clinical criteria, genetic testing alone, and combining clinical criteria with genetic testing.

### Enhanced identification of familial hypercholesterolemia using central laboratory algorithms [^b2e5eef4]. Atherosclerosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a highly prevalent genetic disorder resulting in markedly elevated LDL cholesterol levels and premature coronary artery disease. FH underdiagnosis and undertreatment require novel detection methods. This study evaluated the effectiveness of using an LDL cholesterol cut-off ≥99.5th percentile (sex- and age-adjusted) to identify clinical and genetic FH, and investigated underutilization of genetic testing and undertreatment in FH patients.

Methods

Individuals with at least one prior LDL cholesterol level ≥99.5th percentile were selected from a laboratory database containing lipid profiles of 590,067 individuals. The study comprised three phases: biochemical validation of hypercholesterolemia, clinical identification of FH, and genetic determination of FH.

Results

Of 5614 selected subjects, 2088 underwent lipid profile reassessment, of whom 1103 completed the questionnaire (mean age 64.2 ± 12.7 years, 48% male). In these 1103 subjects, mean LDL cholesterol was 4.0 ± 1.4 mmol/l and 722 (65%) received lipid-lowering therapy. FH clinical diagnostic criteria were met by 282 (26%) individuals, of whom 85% had not received guideline-recommended genetic testing and 97% failed to attain LDL cholesterol targets. Of 459 individuals consenting to genetic validation, 13% carried an FH-causing variant, which increased to 19% in clinically diagnosed FH patients.

Conclusions

The identification of a substantial number of previously undiagnosed and un(der)treated clinical and genetic FH patients within a central laboratory database highlights the feasibility and clinical potential of this targeted screening strategy; both in identifying new FH patients and in improving treatment in this high-risk population.

Genetic testing in dyslipidemia—ordering considerations state that once proceeding with testing and with patient consent, clinicians "advise using a CLIA-certified laboratory that offers the appropriate gene panel for the patient’s likely diagnosis," and can use the National Institutes of Health registry of CLIA-certified services. Many commercial laboratories may offer reduced-cost family screening within a set timeframe, and it is important to consult a genetic counselor before proceeding with such screening.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^14f9e509]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Whom to screen: how do we recognize index cases?

Probands (index cases) should be identified according to the following criteria:
plasma total cholesterol ≥8 mmol/L (≥310 mg/dL) in an adult or adult family member(s) (or >95th percentile by age and gender for country),
premature CHD in the subject or family member(s),
tendon xanthomas in the subject or family member(s),
sudden premature cardiac death in a family member.

For child probands, criteria #(ii)–(iv) are identical to those of adults, but criterion #(i) should be a plasma total cholesterol ≥6 mmol/L (≥230 mg/dL) in a child or child family member(s) (or >95th percentile by age and gender for country). The highest likelihood of detecting FH is in those with very high LDL cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and/or premature CHD in a family member.

Drawing a family pedigree (Figure 7) is essential to evaluate the likelihood of FH (Table 1). In cases of probable or definite FH, cascade screening using LDL cholesterol measurement in the family should be conducted and the subject referred for genetic testing if available, with subsequent cascade testing in the family if a causative mutation is found. Initial family members to be tested are biological first-degree relatives, namely parents, siblings, and children. Biological second-degree relatives including grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings should also be considered. ‘Premature CHD’ signifies CHD before age 55 in males and before age 60 in female first-degree relatives, while in second-degree relatives, the corresponding ages are 50 and 55.

### Genetic testing increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia among people referred to lipid clinics: Danish national study [^0235de3a]. Atherosclerosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

It is unclear to what extent genetic testing improves the ability to diagnose familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). We investigated the percentage with FH among individuals referred to Danish lipid clinics, and evaluated the impact of genetic testing for a diagnosis of FH.

Methods

From September 2020 through November 2021, all patients referred for possible FH to one of the 15 Danish lipid clinics were invited for study participation and >97% (n = 1488) accepted. The Dutch Lipid Clinical Network criteria were used to diagnose clinical FH. The decision of genetic testing for FH was based on local practice.

Results

A total of 1243 individuals were referred, of whom 25.9% were diagnosed with genetic and/or clinical FH. In individuals genetically tested (n = 705), 21.7% had probable or definite clinical FH before testing, a percentage that increased to 36.9% after genetic testing. In individuals with unlikely and possible FH before genetic testing, 24.4% and 19.0%, respectively, had a causative pathogenic variant.

Conclusions

In a Danish nationwide study, genetic testing increased a diagnosis of FH from 22% to 37% in patients referred with hypercholesterolaemia suspected of having FH. Importantly, approximately 20% with unlikely or possible FH, who without genetic testing would not have been considered having FH (and family screening would not have been undertaken), had a pathogenic FH variant. We therefore recommend a more widespread use of genetic testing for evaluation of a possible FH diagnosis and potential cascade screening.

### Genetic testing preferences and intentions in patients with clinically diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia [^5f14488c]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common Mendelian disorder characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels, which if untreated can cause premature heart disease. Less than 10% of cases in the United States are diagnosed. This study investigates decision-making factors associated with intentions to have FH genetic testing among patients clinically diagnosed with FH.

Methods

Fifty-three clinically diagnosed adults with FH and no genetic testing were recruited through the FH Foundation and lipid clinics. Participants completed a survey containing items capturing various reasons to engage in genetic testing.

Results

Exploratory factor analysis of survey items identified three factors: (a) aversion to FH genetic information, (b) curiosity regarding medical/family history, (c) and psychological reassurance. Psychological reassurance was, in turn, the only significant predictor of genetic testing intentions. The positive effect of reassurance on genetic testing intention was moderated by aversion such that individuals who were low in reassurance were more inclined to decline testing if aversion was high.

Conclusion

Findings suggest that clinically diagnosed patients' decisions about FH genetic testing are driven principally by psychological reassurance, particularly when low in aversion to FH genetic information.

### Limited-variant screening vs comprehensive genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis [^aa5394a2]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease and carries significant morbidity and mortality risks. Genetic testing can identify affected individuals, but some array-based assays screen only a small subset of known pathogenic variants.

Objective

To identify the number of clinically significant variants associated with FH that would be missed by an array-based, limited-variant screen when compared with next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based comprehensive testing.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study compared comprehensive genetic test results for clinically significant variants associated with FH with results for a subset of 24 variants screened by a limited-variant array. Data were deidentified next-generation sequencing results from indication-based or proactive gene panels. Individuals receiving next-generation sequencing-based genetic testing, either for an FH indication between November 2015 and June 2020 or as proactive health screening between February 2016 and June 2020 were included. Ancestry was reported by clinicians who could select from preset options or enter free text on the test requisition form.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants identified.

Results

This study included 4563 individuals who were referred for FH diagnostic testing and 6482 individuals who received next-generation sequencing of FH-associated genes as part of a proactive genetic test. Among individuals in the indication cohort, the median (interquartile range) age at testing was 49 (32-61) years, 55.4% (2528 of 4563) were female, and 63.6% (2902 of 4563) were self-reported White/Caucasian. In the indication cohort, the positive detection rate would have been 8.4% (382 of 4563) for a limited-variant screen compared with the 27.0% (1230 of 4563) observed with the next-generation sequencing-based comprehensive test. As a result, 68.9% (848 of 1230) of individuals with a P/LP finding in an FH-associated gene would have been missed by the limited screen. The potential for missed findings in the indication cohort varied by ancestry; among individuals with a P/LP finding, 93.7% (59 of 63) of self-reported Black/African American individuals and 84.7% (122 of 144) of Hispanic individuals would have been missed by the limited-variant screen, compared with 33.3% (4 of 12) of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. In the proactive cohort, the prevalence of clinically significant FH variants wasapproximately1:191 per the comprehensive test, and 61.8% (21 of 34) of individuals with an FH-associated P/LP finding would have been missed by a limited-variant screen.

Conclusions and Relevance

Limited-variant screens may falsely reassure the majority of individuals at risk for FH that they do not carry a disease-causing variant, especially individuals of self-reported Black/African American and Hispanic ancestry.

### Limited-variant screening vs comprehensive genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis [^4ee8d812]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

We reviewed deidentified data under an institutional review board–approved protocol (Western Institutional Review Board #20161796) for 2 cohorts of unrelated individuals: individuals referred by an ordering clinician for FH genetic testing whose samples were received from November 2015 through June 2020 and individuals whose samples for proactive genetic testing were received from February 2016 through June 2020. Patient consent for genetic testing was obtained by the ordering clinician, who attested to this on the requisition form at the time of ordering. The proactive panel (Invitae Genetic Health Screen) was either ordered by a clinician on behalf of an individual or a request for a test was initiatied by an individual with subsequent third-party physician approval. The proactive panel included up to 147 genes addressing a broad range of inherited health conditions, including FH. To reduce potential bias toward individuals with existing cardiological health concerns, we excluded individuals who ordered the cardiology-focused proactive test (Invitae Cardio Screen). Age and ancestry (selected from preset options or entered as free text on the test requisition form) were determined by self-report (from the tested individual or their clinician); individuals with missing ancestry data were grouped as unknown in ancestry-stratified analyses. Both cohorts were tested for more than 2000 possible variants (single-nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, and copy number variants) in 4 FH-associated genes: LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDLRAP1. Because loss-of-function variants in APOB are associated with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (a clinically distinct condition from FH), 12 loss-of-function APOB variants (none of which would be reported by the partial screen) were excluded from the analyses.

Our projection of the limited-variant comparison assay was guided by a package insert, last updated in August 2020, which lists 24 specific single-nucleotide variants for the FH assay: 23 variants in LDLR and 1 in APOB.Per a February 2019 statement from the manufacturer of the comparison assay, our analysis assumed that the limited-variant assay does not report whether an individual is heterozygous or homozygous for a variant.

### Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolaemia: the relevance of genetic testing [^242ad5b5]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

We assembled a cohort of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) for both basic and clinical research. We used a set of established diagnostic criteria to define FH. Some put forward that a definite diagnosis of FH is made when a mutation in the LDL-receptor (LDLR) gene is identified. We therefore set out to determine in these patients whether patients with a DNA diagnosis would differ significantly from those diagnosed clinically.

Methods and Results

We randomly selected 4000 hypercholesterolaemic patients from the Dutch Lipid Clinic network database. Phenotypical data were acquired by reviewing medical records. After review of medical records, 2400 patients could be defined as having FH. An LDLR mutation was identified in 52.3% of these patients. Patients with and without an LDLR mutation demonstrated different clinical and laboratory characteristics. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher in patients with an LDLR mutation, whereas triglycerides were higher in patients without an LDLR mutation. The phenotypic differences between the groups remained even after stratification for the presence or absence of tendon xanthomas.

Conclusion

Despite the use of stringent clinical criteria to define FH patients, two cohorts could be identified within our study population, namely those patients with and those without an LDLR mutation. Our findings suggest that among those without an LDLR mutation, patients with other causes of dyslipidaemia may be present. These observations underline the relevance of genetic testing in FH for clinical practice, for screening purposes, and for research involving these patients.

### Familial hypercholesterolemia and the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines: myths, oversimplification, and misinterpretation versus facts [^10ab52a8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic condition resulting in severe, lifelong elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a marked increased risk of early-onset coronary disease. FH is treatable when identified, yet is vastly under-recognized and undertreated. Although the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of cholesterol presented a paradigm shift, we believe that there have been serious oversimplifications, misinterpretations, and erroneous reporting about the current ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines that have contributed to suboptimal care for these subjects. In summary, the ACC/AHA guidelines place tremendous emphasis on the identification of patients with FH, the initiation of high-intensity statin therapy, the need to obtain follow-up lipid values to assess the efficacy and compliance to lifestyle and medical therapy, and the role of nonstatin drugs when needed for optimal care of the individual patient.

### New case detection by cascade testing in familial hypercholesterolemia: a systematic review of the literature [^71cb8ca2]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia is 1 in 250, but <10% of patients are diagnosed. Cascade testing enables early detection of cases through systematic family tracing. Establishment of familial hypercholesterolemia cascade testing programs in the US could be informed by approaches used elsewhere.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of published studies in the English language of cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, which reported the number of index cases and number of relatives tested and specified methods of contacting relatives and testing modalities methods utilized. For each study, we calculated yield (proportion of relatives who test positive) and new cases per index case, to facilitate comparison.

Results

We identified 10 studies from the literature that met inclusion criteria; the mean number of probands and relatives per study was 242 and 826, respectively. The average yield was 44.76% with a range of 30% to 60.5%, and the mean new cases per index case was 1.65 with a range of 0.22 to 8.0. New cases per index case tended to be greater in studies that used direct contact versus indirect contact (2.06 versus 0.86), tested beyond first-degree relatives versus only first-degree relatives (3.65 versus 0.80), used active sample collection versus collection at clinic (4.11 versus 1.06), and utilized genetic testing versus biochemical testing (2.47 versus 0.42).

Conclusions

New case detection in familial hypercholesterolemia cascade testing programs tended to be higher with direct contact of relatives, testing beyond first-degree relatives, in-home-based sample collection, and genetic testing. These findings should be helpful for establishing cascade testing programs in the United States.

### Developing and optimizing innovative tools to address familial hypercholesterolemia underdiagnosis: identification methods, patient activation, and cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia [^c382b3bb]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common cardiovascular genetic disorder and, if left untreated, is associated with increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Although FH is common, fatal, and treatable, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated due to a lack of systematic methods to identify individuals with FH and limited uptake of cascade testing.

Methods and Results

This mixed-method, multi-stage study will optimize, test, and implement innovative approaches for both FH identification and cascade testing in 3 aims. To improve identification of individuals with FH, in Aim 1, we will compare and refine automated phenotype-based and genomic approaches to identify individuals likely to have FH. To improve cascade testing uptake for at-risk individuals, in Aim 2, we will use a patient-centered design thinking process to optimize and develop novel, active family communication methods. Using a prospective, observational pragmatic trial, we will assess uptake and effectiveness of each family communication method on cascade testing. Guided by an implementation science framework, in Aim 3, we will develop a comprehensive guide to identify individuals with FH. Using the Conceptual Model for Implementation Research, we will evaluate implementation outcomes including feasibility, acceptability, and perceived sustainability as well as health outcomes related to the optimized methods and tools developed in Aims 1 and 2.

Conclusions

Data generated from this study will address barriers and gaps in care related to underdiagnosis of FH by developing and optimizing tools to improve FH identification and cascade testing.

Box 4 
Benefits and limitations of genetic testing in HoFH

Benefits

Permits a definitive diagnosis

Allows for objective visualization of the underlying genetic complexity

Enables access to appropriate current and emerging therapies and clinical trials

Can predict disease severity and treatment response in populations or cohorts, within limits

Can rule out similar conditions that require other treatments (e.g. sitosterolaemia)

Triggers cascade screening to find new patients with HeFH or phenotypic HoFH

Can facilitate prenatal genetic counselling

Knowledge of a definitive genetic basis can promote adherence to optimal therapy

Limitations

Accessibility and cost

Predicting individual phenotype and clinical response from genotype is not straightforward

Pathogenicity for many detected DNA variants cannot be definitively established

Some patients with phenotypic HoFH have only one or even no pathogenic variant detected

Some patients with bi-allelic pathogenic variants express HeFH but not HoFH phenotypically

The healthcare provider must be cautious not to overinterpret genetic results

Professional pre- and post-test genetic counselling is desirable but usually unavailable

Screening recommendations: key to early identification of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia

Early detection of HoFH is essential, but in practice is too late, as shown by the HICC registry.Lack of awareness about HoFH and poor guideline implementation are important barriers. Current guidelines recommend screening in children at ≤2 years if there is a positive family history of premature ASCVD or hypercholesterolaemia, and universal cholesterol screening at ages varying from 5 to 11 years.These guidelines are hardly followed, emphasizing the need for improved implementation.

This panel strongly recommends (i) screening for HoFH whenever suspected clinically and/or with premature ASCVD; (ii) expansion of paediatric guidelines to include newborn lipid screening when both parents are known to have HeFH or hypercholesterolaemia without a confirmed diagnosis of HeFH, or in regions with a strong founder effect; and (iii) creation of national screening programmes in countries where these are lacking. This panel joins FH advocacy groups worldwide in calling for paediatric universal FH screening, taking into consideration specific conditions, needs and resources of individual countries, to improve identification of FH, including HoFH.,

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^56f64bc3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Although there are no internationally agreed‐upon criteria for the diagnosis of FH, useful diagnostic criteria have been developed. The main diagnostic tools used for FH include the US Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death (MEDPED) criteria (Table 1), 22 the UK Simon Broome system (UK FH Register criteria; Table 2), 23 the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria (Table 3), 24 and the National Lipid Association expert panel recommendations (Table 4). 25, 26 The Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, which uses a scoring system to predict the likelihood of an index patient having FH, and the Simon Broome criteria are the only tools that incorporate genetic test results into their algorithm. In the Simon Broome criteria, a positive genetic test is sufficient for a definitive diagnosis of FH, while in the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, a positive genetic test should be accompanied by an additional measure (eg, elevated LDL‐C levels) to fulfill the definite diagnosis criteria. Although the existing diagnostic tools differ from each other, both in structure and the cut‐off values of the LDL‐C level necessary for diagnosis, their predictive values are comparable. 25 Among these diagnostic strategies, the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria provide the most detailed assessment of the likelihood of a diagnosis of HeFH and are sometimes favored by insurance providers for the purpose of denial or approval of treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with FH. More recently, the American Heart Association proposed a simple set of criteria; however, these criteria have not yet been widely accepted or implemented (Figure 2). 27 Table 5 highlights some of the differences between these diagnostic criteria. The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation, an organization dedicated to improving the awareness, diagnosis, and management of FH, has developed a mobile application 28 that can assist both patients and providers with diagnosing FH. A special flow chart to detect FH in children has been developed and tested by the European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel. 29

### Multidisciplinary teams in clinical lipidology and cardiometabolic care: a National Lipid Association expert clinical review [^1c013365]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Genetic counselors in dyslipidemia and cardiometabolic care are recommended within cardiovascular clinics and provide graduate-level expertise in medical genetics and psychosocial counseling to guide test selection, interpretation, and patient education. Technological advances have increased complexities in genetic testing, with options ranging from single-gene sequencing to whole-genome analysis; appropriate selection depends on indication and variant type such as missense, deletion/duplication, or trinucleotide repeat expansion, and errors arise when testing is ordered by providers with less genetics expertise. Genetic counselors’ expertise helps ensure appropriate tests are ordered, reducing medical errors and healthcare costs, and evidence supports that meeting with a genetic counselor improves adherence to medical management. The results of 2 recent studies showed that patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who received genetic counseling had lower LDL-C levels at follow-up, independent of the genetic test results. Genetic counseling also improves cascade family screening, with one study showing more first degree-relatives (27.1%) participated compared to those who did not meet with a genetic counselor (12.6%); these findings have been duplicated in other cardiac diseases, and tools such as the “family letter” disseminate diagnosis, genetic risk for relatives, and screening options.

This consensus statement on the management of children and young people with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) addresses management of paediatric FH in the UK, identified by cascade testing when a parent is diagnosed with FH and for those diagnosed following incidental lipid tests. Lifestyle and dietary advice appropriate for children with FH; suggested low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets and the most appropriate lipid-lowering therapies to achieve these are discussed in this statement of care. Based on the population prevalence of FH as ~1/250 and the UK paediatric population, there are approximately 50,000 FH children under 18 years. Currently only about 550 of these children and young people have been identified and are under paediatric care.

### Defining severe familial hypercholesterolaemia and the implications for clinical management: a consensus statement from the international atherosclerosis society severe familial hypercholesterolemia panel [^ee77ed9f]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is common in individuals who had a myocardial infarction at a young age. As many as one in 200 people could have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and up to one in 300000 individuals could be homozygous. The phenotypes of heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia overlap considerably; the response to treatment is also heterogeneous. In this Review, we aim to define a phenotype for severe familial hypercholesterolaemia and identify people at highest risk for cardiovascular disease, based on the concentration of LDL cholesterol in blood and individuals' responsiveness to conventional lipid-lowering treatment. We assess the importance of molecular characterisation and define the role of other cardiovascular risk factors and advanced subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in risk stratification. Individuals with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia might benefit in particular from early and more aggressive cholesterol-lowering treatment (eg, with PCSK9 inhibitors). In addition to better tailored therapy, more precise characterisation of individuals with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia could improve resource use.

### Improving the detection of potential cases of familial hypercholesterolemia: could machine learning Be part of the solution? [^0805daf5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a highly prevalent autosomal codominant genetic condition occurring with a prevalence of ≈1:311 in the worldwide general population.FH results in lifelong (from birth) exposure to high low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels, increasing the risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), more notably coronary artery disease (CAD).However, if individuals with FH are identified and prescribed effective cholesterol‐lowering treatments early, then much of their future adverse health outcomes can be avoided.Yet FH remains largely underdiagnosed, with an estimated 22.5 million adults with FH remaining to be identified globally (<10% identified).

The definitive method for diagnosing FH is through molecular (genetic) testing, recognized as the gold standard. There are currently no population‐wide genetic testing programs. Typically, genetic testing for FH is initiated by secondary and tertiary care specialists following a referral from primary care. These referrals are based on the physician's clinical suspicion of FH, for example, prompted by a premature ASCVD event such as an acute coronary syndrome. Specialists then use clinical diagnostic criteria, such as the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN), Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death, or Simon Broome,,,which were derived and validated on genetically confirmed cohorts of patients, to assess the likelihood of a positive, confirmatory genetic diagnosis in a patient with suspected FH. Yet these clinical diagnostic criteria demand thorough phenotypical assessments and detailed family histories, necessitating direct patient consultations. Such comprehensive data may not be consistently documented in electronic health records (EHRs), rendering these criteria less practical for automated, large‐scale screening approaches within the general population through primary care EHR systems, where many undiagnosed cases of FH likely exist. Screening criteria, on the other hand, are specifically developed for identifying potential FH cases in the general population through automated screening of EHRs.

### Childhood screening for familial Hypercholesterolemia: JACC review topic of the week [^974db87f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Screening for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in childhood remains controversial. Existing guidelines offer practitioners conflicting advice despite generally agreeing on the evidence and areas in which evidence is lacking, including a lack of long-term clinical trials demonstrating coronary event reduction as a result of screening and long-term data on statin side effects. A limitation of existing evidence-based frameworks is reliance on 1 evidence grading system to determine recommendations. However, rigorous evidence evaluation alternatives relevant to FH exist. FH is considered a tier 1 genetic condition, meaning that identification and treatment will improve health outcomes among those affected. Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the primary consequence of FH, can be considered causal for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Incorporating these concepts into existing evidence pathways allows the inclusion of surrogate clinical trial outcomes (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and atherosclerosis regression) and observational data on medication safety, strengthening the evidence for pediatric screening for FH.

### Mutational analysis of a cohort with clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia: considerations for genetic diagnosis improvement [^84acebaf]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant disorder of lipid metabolism caused by mutations in LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9. To fulfill the World Health Organization recommendation, the Portuguese FH Study was established. Here, we report the results of the past 15 years and present practical considerations concerning the genetic diagnosis of FH based on our experience.

Methods

Our approach comprises a biochemical and molecular study and is divided into five phases, including the study of whole APOB and functional assays.

Results

A total of 2,122 individuals were enrolled. A putative pathogenic variant was identified in 660 heterozygous patients: LDLR (623), APOB (33), and PCSK9 (4); 8 patients presented with homozygous FH. A detection rate of 41.5% was observed. A stricter biochemical criteria was shown to improve patient identification. Overall, we have identified 3.4% and 80% of all heterozygous and homozygous patients, respectively, estimated to exist in our country.

Conclusion

The Portuguese FH Study has established the genetic diagnosis of FH in Portugal and is committed to continue the investigation of the genetic complexity of FH. Genetic diagnosis of FH should be expanded to include the study of all coding/flanking regions of APOB and functional in vitro studies, to improve the correct patient identification, and to avoid misdiagnosis.Genet Med 18 4, 316-324.

### Genetic testing in familial hypercholesterolemia: strengthening the tools, reinforcing efforts, and diagnosis [^bac7f2ae]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Even before these criteria, shared databases of variants were built, either gene specific or all-encompassing such as ClinVar. This National Center for Biotechnology Information–funded resource has now become the principal database for archiving significant variants for numerous Mendelian diseases. It allows for a complete approach with the presentation of patient and molecular data from different resources (published studies or directly submitted by investigators through the dedicated platforms), as well as a variety of related tools to aid in variant interpretation. FH-associated mutations in ClinVar have been classified using a variety of criteria. These include the general ACMG/AMP guidelines (2015), specified guidelines adhering to the ACMG/AMP framework, and a number of independent methods. However, there is a lack of a standardized approach that is challenging to avoid different interpretations of similar variants. To date, more than 3600 LDLR gene variants are found in ClinVar. With the increasing need to establish genetic testing on a large scale to improve FH diagnosis and prevention, it has become crucial to develop and share a specifically adapted tool for the analysis of molecular results. This would guarantee a homogenous and standardized interpretation and classification of clinically relevant variants for FH. Beyond these tools, additional hard criteria can greatly help in evaluating the pathogenicity of an identified variant. These are family-related and functional analyses. In the first instance, familial segregation is investigated as well as genotype-phenotype correlation and the absence or very low frequency of phenotype-free individuals carrying the variation. Functional analysis is essential to confirm the pathogenicity of a variant by studying the impact of the variant at the transcript and/or protein level (RNA size and level, protein size, amount, and functionality). These analyses generally remain the gold standard for conclusive pathogenic variant identification.

Genetic testing in dyslipidemia—conclusions and counseling—In selected patients, genetic testing can be an informative aid in clinical diagnosis, with other potential benefits including guiding optimal management and prevention strategies, advancing care strategies beyond currently available treatments, identifying affected family members, and contributing to scientific progress. The decision to undergo genetic testing in a particular patient with dyslipidemia should weigh the following factors: 1) baseline clinical suspicion of a genetic etiology, 2) expected benefits and risks of testing, and 3) patient values and preferences. Genetic counseling is recommended before and after genetic testing. Understanding the limitations of genetic testing techniques is also important, as is their careful interpretation, to achieve the greatest benefit.

### Quality standards and samples in genetic testing [^6f649a57]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Risks associated with genetic testing

Testing for medically significant genetic variants is growing rapidly, although it is still a small component of medical testing overall. In the UK in 2005–2006, genetic tests accounted for <0.1% of all laboratory investigations.Compared with their working familiarity with most pathology investigations, many clinicians still have little experience of testing for inherited or de novo genomic variants.

As well as the usual challenges associated with bringing new technologies into healthcare, there are further issues associated with genetic investigations to consider. Genetic findings may aid the task of assessing clinical symptoms. They may also confirm a diagnosis long before the onset of symptoms in an individual patient. This is especially the case for inherited disorders with readily identifiable biomarkers. For example, serum cholesterol testing of relatives at risk of familial hypercholesterolaemia has long been known to refine or resolve genetic risks identified by family history. The advent of genetic testing for this disorder in families for whom the causal mutation has been identified has led to improved diagnostic accuracy and simplified the process of risk assessment among relatives.

Genetic testing is increasingly requested for healthy people identified by family history as being at high risk of having inherited a mutation predisposing to a serious adult-onset autosomal dominant monogenic disorder. Many of these conditions have no associated subclinical manifestations. Referred to as predictive, presymptomatic or predisposition testing, this category of testing is distinguished by absence of corroborating clinical or other confirmatory data. This scenario is not unique to late-onset dominant disorders and is often seen in other areas of genetic testing including prenatal, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and carrier testing for autosomal and X linked recessive disorders. It is also a prominent feature of ‘personalised medicine’,where genotyping is used to predict responses to, or side effects from, drugs.

Corroboration of evidence is an important aspect of clinical care. For example, a normal chest radiograph from a patient with severe congestive cardiac failure would normally prompt a check to ensure the correct image is being viewed. Many clinical measurements are corroborated by repeat measurements. The measurement of blood pressure, for example, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Although no other clinical features may be available to corroborate the result, repeated measurements over time provide a background in which outlying or incongruent findings can be evaluated.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) screening—selective and cascade strategies: Prior guidance emphasized selective screening of children with a family history, but family history alone is inadequate; cascade screening of first-degree relatives of an affected FH patient is recommended to enhance detection, reverse cascade screening of first-degree relatives of an affected child is also recommended with adults at greater short-term risk than the child; for other dyslipidemias with strong genetic components such as elevated Lp(a) and familial combined hyperlipidemia, cascade or reverse cascade screening is a reasonable consideration when a first-degree relative is affected.

### 2023 update on European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: new treatments and clinical guidance [^af529453]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Key recommendation : Consider only variants reported as ‘pathogenic/likely pathogenic’ according to recognized criteria as a confirmed genetic diagnosis of HoFH.

Variants in LDLR are often classified as ‘null’ (≤2% activity) or ‘receptor defective’ (2%–70% activity) based on their predicted impact on receptor function. Yet only ∼10% of all variants have been directly functionally tested; instead, most have been classified based on predictive algorithms, particularly missense variants.There are general patterns of genotype-phenotype correlation, with LDLR null variants having the most extreme LDL-C deviations and most blunted response to pharmacologic interventions.However, the genotype cannot definitively predict the precise phenotypic expression in an individual patient.

On balance, the benefits outweigh the limitations of genetic testing in HoFH (Box 4), with increased certainty of diagnosis and access to, use of, and compliance with appropriate treatment. For example, genetic testing occasionally reveals causal variants in genes that normally cause non-FH dyslipidaemias such as ABCG5 or ABCG8 in sitosterolaemia, with distinct treatment implications, i.e. elimination of dietary sterols and use of ezetimibe rather than statins plus apheresis (Figure 2A).However, genetic results can be potentially misunderstood or miscommunicated.A few patients with phenotypic HoFH have only one identified pathogenic variant because of technical reasons, interactions with undiscovered causal genes, or an unmeasured background polygenic effect, although the latter is currently not felt to be an important genetic mechanism underlying phenotypic HoFH.Furthermore, NGS has identified some individuals with phenotypic HeFH and an appropriate response to statins, who have two pathogenic variants on opposite chromosomes that would be expected to cause phenotypic HoFH. In cases of discordance, this panel recommends that a phenotypic diagnosis, HoFH or HeFH, takes priority over the genetic results. Patients and families with genetic results that are either difficult to understand or complex should be referred to a genetic counsellor or clinician with extensive experience in human genetics and lipidology.

### Process for mainstreaming genetic cascade testing into primary and tertiary health systems in familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), an autosomal dominant, fully penetrant disorder [^39408cf9]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Substantial advances in genomic medicine have enabled more personalised care and improved patient outcomes.Advancements in technology, treatment approaches and direct-to-consumer genetic testing platforms have increased demand to integrate genomic medicine into existing health systems.Genomic medicine is rapidly expanding and, as such, exceeding the capacity for genetic specialists to meet demand.There is a need to mainstream the provision of genomic medicine to other medical specialties, including primary care.

General practitioners (GPs) are usually the first point of contact and a key stakeholder in the continuity of patient care, playing an integral role in the implementation of genomic medicine into health systems.Primary care presents an ideal setting to access genomic medicine in a more equitable and efficient manner, especially for those living in rural, regional or remote areas where access to specialist genetic services is limited.However, several barriers to integrating genomic medicine into primary care have been described, including limited knowledge of genetics, a lack of confidence in providing genetic care and shortage of resources and specialist support.GPs manage a range of health concerns daily that require knowledge across multiple health conditions, including genetic disorders. Previous research indicates that adequate support for GPs to integrate genomic medicine into practice includes contact information for local genetic services, genetic testing and referral information, educational resources and two-way communication with genetic specialists.Preparing GPs to deliver genetic services as part of routine care requires more than providing education and training and, instead, a collaborative, system-wide approach that engages multiple stakeholders is needed.Efficient, equitable access to genomic medicine through primary care is expected to benefit patients, families, populations and the health system.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of lipid metabolism that leads to elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels from birth. Left untreated, FH causes premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and death.Although a highly preventable cause of premature cardiovascular disease, FH remains poorly diagnosed and poorly treated, with less than 10% of the greater than 35 million people worldwide with the condition being diagnosed.Siblings, children and parents of someone diagnosed with FH have a 50% chance of also having the condition.FH is a Tier 1 genomic application, meaning it is a preventable cause of ASCVD and death, supported by strong evidence-based guidelines, and significant potential to have a positive impact on public health. Additionally, FH can be easily diagnosed and managed in primary care, provided appropriate supports are in place.

### Efficacy of clinical diagnostic criteria for familial hypercholesterolemia genetic testing in Poland [^94666b44]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which leads to premature cardiovascular events, still remains underrecognized and undertreated in most countries. Untreated FH individuals aged 20-39 years are at 100-fold higher risk of mortality from coronary heart disease compared to those of a general population. Therefore, special efforts should be implemented to diagnose FH patients at early stages of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the revised Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria proposed by the Polish Lipid Experts Forum to select index FH patients for DNA mutational analysis in Poland.

Methods

The study included 193 unrelated adult patients (mean age 48 ± 13 years) with clinical diagnosis of FH based on the revised DLCN score, tested sequentially for mutations in LDLR and APOB genes using bidirectional Sanger sequencing and MLPA techniques. The cut-off points of the clinical FH criteria score were assessed by ROC statistics to identify patients with the highest probability of carrying an FH-causing mutation.

Results

The causal heterozygous LDLR or APOB mutation was identified in 41% (80/193) of probands. Adults aged <40 years were more likely to carry an FH-causing mutation compared to subjects aged ≥40 years (65% vs. 33%; p < 0.001). LDL-C thresholds for the molecular diagnosis of FH were 5.79 mmol/l for individuals aged<40 and 6.7 mmol/l for subjects ≥40 years old. The threshold values of the clinical diagnostic score for efficient selection of patients for genetic testing were 5 and 7 points for individuals aged <40 and ≥40 years, respectively.

Conclusions

The study validated the efficacy of proposed clinical FH criteria for the disease diagnosis in Poland. The clinical criteria score thresholds for positive FH molecular diagnosis differ depending on age (<40 and ≥40 years). We propose that in the healthcare systems with limited genetic testing resources individuals younger than 40 years, who fulfill the clinical criteria for possible, probable or definite FH should qualify for the FH mutation testing. The index patients aged ≥40 years with clinical diagnosis of probable or definite FH should also qualify for the genetic testing.
