## Question

patient presents with rlq pain. what do i order to diagnose. he is mute cannot talk

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and what to order to diagnose a mute patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and nonverbal history. Then, I should verify the focused physical examination and its diagnostic weight. Next, I will review the core laboratory tests and their limitations. After that, I need to determine the imaging strategy based on age, sex, pregnancy status, and body habitus, and reconcile guideline differences. Finally, I will consider special populations, alternative pathways if imaging is inconclusive, and synthesize a practical algorithm with contingencies for escalation and follow-up [^112BidjC] [^114vc3RD].

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the initial assessment, because I need to ensure we do not miss hemodynamic instability or peritonitis while adapting for a nonverbal patient. I will check ABCs, obtain vitals, establish IV access, and start isotonic fluids if hypotensive or tachycardic, while simultaneously screening for peritoneal signs and systemic toxicity that would push me toward urgent surgical consultation and expedited imaging rather than a stepwise approach [^114vc3RD] [^11361VUE].

> Wait, let me verify how to obtain a history without speech. I will use nonverbal cues and caregiver input to estimate onset, pain migration, associated nausea or vomiting, anorexia, bowel habit changes, dysuria, and fever, and I will document pain severity with a visual analog or numeric scale shown visually, because migration of pain to the RLQ and RLQ tenderness carry meaningful likelihood ratios for appendicitis even when history is limited [^111wABHK] [^112bHDkA].

> I will now examine the patient with a focused abdominal exam, but hold on, I should verify that I am not overinterpreting nonspecific findings. RLQ tenderness, guarding, rebound, and rigidity increase the likelihood of appendicitis, and I should also elicit Rovsing and psoas signs when feasible; however, I must remember that no single sign rules in or out appendicitis, so I should integrate these with labs and imaging rather than rely on any one maneuver [^111wABHK] [^112bHDkA].

> Next, I should review core laboratories, but let me reconsider which tests truly change management. A CBC with differential, CRP, and urinalysis are foundational; I will add a pregnancy test for all patients with the potential to be pregnant, and consider basic metabolic panel, lipase, and LFTs if hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease is plausible, recognizing that WBC and CRP support but do not confirm appendicitis and that UA helps exclude urinary sources of pain [^112BidjC] [^116BE929].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging; I need to align the modality with patient characteristics and guideline nuances. For adult men and nonpregnant adults with RLQ pain and intermediate to high suspicion, CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is generally recommended as first-line because of superior sensitivity and specificity for urgent conditions, whereas ultrasound-first strategies are favored in children, pregnant patients, and selected thin adults to avoid radiation, with MRI as a problem-solver when ultrasound is nondiagnostic and radiation avoidance remains a priority [^112LGR8q] [^1159KirJ] [^114DjBE8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ultrasound-first might be broadly acceptable for RLQ pain to reduce radiation, but I should double-check the comparative accuracy data. A large diagnostic accuracy study showed that CT outperforms ultrasound for detecting urgent conditions, and that a conditional strategy of ultrasound followed by CT if negative or inconclusive achieves high sensitivity with fewer missed diagnoses than CT-only, which supports a tiered approach rather than ultrasound-only in most adults with concerning presentations [^115Gcr3R] [^112Yc9Ju].

> Let me think about special populations, because I need to ensure my plan is tailored. In children, I should prioritize graded-compression ultrasound and avoid routine CT; if the appendix is not visualized, secondary signs and inflammatory markers can guide risk, and delayed CT or MRI can be reserved for persistent high suspicion, given the higher risk of missed appendicitis when classic features are absent and the potential for preventable delays [^114DjBE8] [^113CiBhs]. In pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line, and if nondiagnostic, MRI without gadolinium is preferred over CT to avoid ionizing radiation, though CT remains highly accurate if absolutely necessary after shared decision-making [^113s4teP] [^116gTAEA]. In older adults, presentations are often atypical and perforation risk is higher, so I should maintain a low threshold for CT and surgical consultation even when the history is limited [^111ofRkD].

> I should confirm the approach when imaging is inconclusive, because I need a safety net. If ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion remains intermediate to high, I should proceed to CT; if CT is negative but suspicion persists, observation with serial exams and repeat labs is reasonable, and diagnostic laparoscopy can be considered when the patient is high risk or deteriorating and the diagnosis remains unclear after appropriate imaging [^113xgLQZ] [^116ni8gB].

> But wait, what if the patient is a young woman with RLQ pain; I need to ensure gynecologic etiologies are not missed. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound should be integrated early to evaluate for ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, or other adnexal pathology, and if torsion is suspected, emergent gynecologic consultation is warranted even if initial imaging is nondiagnostic [^112b81r8] [^115i5Udz].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I will double-check each branch for internal consistency. Start with ABCs and focused exam; obtain CBC, CRP, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing when applicable; risk-stratify clinically; for adult men and nonpregnant adults with moderate to high suspicion, proceed to CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast; for children, pregnant patients, or thin adults with low to moderate suspicion, start with graded-compression ultrasound and escalate to CT or MRI if nondiagnostic; for persistent uncertainty or high-risk patients, consider observation with serial exams or diagnostic laparoscopy, documenting decision points and reassessment timelines to mitigate diagnostic delay [^112BidjC] [^112LGR8q] [^114DjBE8].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit, especially for a nonverbal patient. I will record objective findings, pretest probabilities, imaging indications, and shared decision-making discussions with caregivers, and I will provide clear return precautions and follow-up plans, because missed diagnoses in abdominal pain often stem from history-taking gaps, under-ordering of indicated tests, and follow-up failures, which are magnified when the patient cannot speak [^111tJF5W] [^111FXtYL].

> Finally, I should verify that my plan addresses radiation stewardship and resource use without compromising safety. Conditional strategies using ultrasound first with CT for inconclusive cases reduce CT utilization while maintaining high sensitivity for urgent conditions, and in recurrent low-risk abdominal pain, guideline-directed selective imaging after appropriate prior workup helps avoid unnecessary radiation and cost, though this scenario does not directly apply to a new acute RLQ presentation [^112Yc9Ju] [^1166LKz4].

For a mute patient with RLQ pain, order a **CBC, CRP, and urinalysis** to screen for infection or inflammation, and a **serum β-hCG** in all patients with the potential for pregnancy [^112BidjC] [^111mMYUn]. Obtain an **abdominal/pelvic CT with IV contrast** as first-line imaging to rapidly identify appendicitis or alternative causes [^112LGR8q] [^117PDmzo]. Use **ultrasound first** in children, pregnant patients, or when radiation is a concern, followed by CT if inconclusive [^1173qt8k] [^113s4teP]. Add electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes if systemic illness is suspected [^112BidjC]. These tests balance diagnostic accuracy, speed, and safety in a nonverbal patient [^113NoZTN].

---

## Essential laboratory tests

Laboratory tests are critical to **identify infection, inflammation, or organ dysfunction** and to narrow the differential diagnosis [^116BE929].

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Detect infection, inflammation, anemia | - Leukocytosis suggests infection/inflammation (e.g. appendicitis) <br/> - Anemia may indicate bleeding or chronic disease [^112BidjC] |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) | Detect systemic inflammation | Elevated CRP supports infection/inflammation (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis) [^112BidjC] |
| Urinalysis | Evaluate urinary tract involvement | - Hematuria/pyuria suggest urolithiasis/UTI <br/> - Normal UA supports appendicitis [^112BidjC] |
| Serum β-hCG (pregnancy test) | Rule out pregnancy-related complications | Essential in all patients with the potential for pregnancy to exclude ectopic pregnancy [^111mMYUn] |
| Basic metabolic panel (BMP) | Assess electrolytes, renal function | - Electrolyte imbalance may indicate dehydration or systemic illness <br/> - Renal dysfunction may suggest urinary pathology [^112BidjC] |
| Liver function tests (LFTs) | Evaluate hepatic/biliary involvement | - Elevated LFTs suggest hepatobiliary disease (e.g. cholecystitis, hepatitis) [^112BidjC] |

---

## Essential imaging studies

Imaging is crucial for **confirming the diagnosis** and guiding management, particularly in nonverbal patients [^113NoZTN].

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast | First-line for adults with RLQ pain; suspected appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, malignancy | - High sensitivity/specificity <br/> - Rapid <br/> - Comprehensive [^115Gcr3R] | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast allergy <br/> - Renal impairment |
| Ultrasound (US) | - Children <br/> - Pregnant patients <br/> - Radiation-sensitive patients <br/> - Initial assessment | - No radiation <br/> - Safe in pregnancy <br/> - Bedside availability [^112BidjC] | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited by obesity/bowel gas <br/> - Lower sensitivity in adults [^115Gcr3R] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - Pregnant patients <br/> - Contrast allergy <br/> - Renal impairment | - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue resolution [^115qtMc8] | - Expensive <br/> - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

Given the patient's inability to communicate, a **structured approach** is essential:

- **Initial assessment**: Perform a thorough physical examination, documenting vital signs, abdominal tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, and any visible signs of distress [^114vc3RD].

- **Laboratory tests**: Order CBC, CRP, urinalysis, serum β-hCG (if applicable), BMP, and LFTs based on clinical suspicion [^112BidjC].

- **Imaging**: Obtain CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast as the primary imaging modality in adults. Use ultrasound first in children, pregnant patients, or when radiation is a concern, followed by CT if inconclusive [^112BidjC] [^1173qt8k] [^116gTAEA].

- **Special considerations**: In pregnant patients, prioritize ultrasound and MRI to avoid radiation exposure. In children, use ultrasound first-line due to radiation sensitivity [^116gTAEA] [^1173qt8k].

---

## Conclusion

For a mute patient with RLQ pain, order a **CBC, CRP, urinalysis, and serum β-hCG** (if applicable), with BMP and LFTs as indicated [^112BidjC]. Use **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast** as first-line imaging in adults, and ultrasound first in children or pregnant patients, followed by CT if needed [^112LGR8q] [^1173qt8k] [^113s4teP]. This approach ensures accurate, rapid diagnosis while minimizing radiation and addressing patient-specific constraints.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, as well as commentary on indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Is appendiceal CT scan overused for evaluating patients with right lower quadrant pain? [^114ammCn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Reports citing excellent sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of focused appendiceal computed tomography (CT) and showing an overall reduction in resource use and nontherapeutic laparotomies have led to increasing use of that imaging modality. Diagnostic algorithms have begun to incorporate appendiceal CT for patients presenting to the emergency department with right lower quadrant pain. We present a series of 4 cases in which use of appendiceal CT ultimately led to increased cost, resource use, and complexity in patient care. The results of these cases support an argument against unbridled use of appendiceal CT scanning and reinforce the need for clinical evaluation by the operating surgeon before routine performance of appendiceal CT scan.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^112p7nKs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (eg, acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are of necessity related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### Beyond appendicitis: common and uncommon gastrointestinal causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain at multidetector CT [^1169b6pf]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Right lower quadrant abdominal pain is one of the most common causes of a patient visit to the emergency department. Although appendicitis is the most common condition requiring surgery in patients with abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain can be indicative of a vast list of differential diagnoses and is thus a challenge for clinicians. Other causes of right lower quadrant pain beyond appendicitis include inflammatory and infectious conditions involving the ileocecal region; diverticulitis; malignancies; conditions affecting the epiploic appendages, omentum, and mesentery; and miscellaneous conditions. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the modality of choice for evaluation of patients with several acute traumatic and nontraumatic conditions causing right lower quadrant pain. Multidetector CT is an extremely useful noninvasive method for diagnosis and management of not only the most common causes such as appendicitis but also less common conditions.

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: not always appendicitis [^116G2i4R]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the commonest causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), there are numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis that can simulate the clinical presentation of AA for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluation of patients presenting with acute onset RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, US and MRI, given lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in the pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP which we have classified systematically ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, urinary and reproductive systems to give the reader a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

History and physical examination in suspected appendicitis — In a meta-analysis of approximately 4,000 patients, right lower quadrant abdominal pain was reported as the most useful clinical finding with positive likelihood ratio 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.31 to 8.46 and negative likelihood ratio 95% CI 0 to 0.28. In a separate meta-analysis, pain migration had positive likelihood ratio 2.06 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.60) and negative likelihood ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.69), while pain progression had positive likelihood ratio 1.39 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.50) and negative likelihood ratio 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Additional Class III data indicate right lower quadrant tenderness had positive likelihood ratios of 2.3 and 1.1 with negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.1; rigidity carried a positive likelihood ratio of 3.8, and anorexia, rectal tenderness, guarding, fever, and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant had positive likelihood ratios below 2.9.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^112b81r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

Case Report

We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized; the patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^11361VUE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

What are the optimal methods in diagnosing IAI that balances benefits and risks?

Statement 2

Early clinical evaluation is essential for diagnosing IAIs. It helps to optimize diagnostic testing and can result in earlier implementation of a proper management plan (Recommendation 1C).

Statement 3

A step-up approach for diagnosis should be used and tailored to the clinical setting, resources, patient's age beginning with clinical and laboratory examination and progressing to imaging examinations (Recommendation 1C).

Diagnosis of complicated IAIs is mainly clinical. Early detection and treatment is essential to minimize complications of IAIs.

Patients with IAIs typically present with rapid-onset abdominal pain and signs of local and systemic inflammation (pain, tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and/or tachypnea). Hypotension and hypoperfusion signs such as oliguria, acute alteration of mental status, and lactic acidosis are indicative of ongoing organ failure.

Physical evaluation may limit the differential diagnosis to direct decisions regarding a proper management plan including the need for appropriate diagnostic testing, the need for initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and whether emergent intervention is required.

The value of physical findings in the diagnostic work-up for IAIs has been studied in relation to acute appendicitis where signs and symptoms are helpful in diagnosing or excluding appendicitis.

The presence of a positive psoas sign, fever, or migratory pain to the right lower quadrant suggests an increased likelihood of appendicitis. Conversely, the presence of vomiting before pain makes appendicitis unlikely.

Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) have been used over the last two decades to complete the clinical assessment of patients with IAIs. Although CT has higher sensitivity and specificity, concerns about radiation exposure have recently prompted reappraisal of the roles of sonography including performance by surgeons.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^1159KirJ]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic strategies

The fully paired study design, with all imaging tests in all patients and with the panel based final diagnosis as the reference standard, allowed a comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of multiple imaging strategies. We compared the following single imaging strategies: (1) diagnosis after clinical evaluation, (2) clinical diagnosis plus plain radiographs, (3) ultrasonography in all patients, and (4) CT in all patients. In addition, we investigated the following conditional ultrasonography and CT strategies: (5) ultrasonography first in all patients and CT in those with a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography and (6) ultrasonography in all patients and CT only in patients with inconclusive ultrasonography.

We also investigated imaging strategies driven by patients' characteristics, in which only selected patients would have initial ultrasonography, with CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography, whereas all others would have initial CT. For initial ultrasonography in these strategies, we selected (7) younger patients (< 45 years), for whom exposure to ionising radiation is most hazardous, and (8) non-obese patients (body mass index < 30 kg/m 2), in whom ultrasonography is more likely to be diagnostic. In another strategy (9) both younger and non-obese patients would have initial ultrasonography.

A common clinical view is that the choice of imaging for acute abdominal pain should be guided by the location of pain. Therefore, we investigated strategies in which the selection of ultrasonography or CT was driven by the abdominal quadrant in which the pain was predominantly located. In strategy (10) the choice of investigation was based on the American College of Radiology guidelines, which recommend ultrasonography for pain in the right upper quadrant and computed tomography for pain in the other quadrants and for diffuse abdominal pain. In an alternative pain location driven strategy (11) patients with pain in the right upper quadrant or right lower quadrant would have initial ultrasonography and all others would have initial CT. The box summarises the strategies investigated.

### Right upper quadrant pain: ultrasound first! [^114TCGGR]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is a common presenting symptom in emergency departments and outpatient medical practices, and is most commonly attributable to biliary and hepatic pathology. Ultrasound should be used as a first-line imaging modality for the diagnosis of gallstones and cholecystitis, as it allows the differentiation of medical and surgical causes of upper abdominal pathology, and in many circumstances is sufficient to guide patient management. Knowledge of strengths and limitations of ultrasound in the evaluation of RUQ is paramount in correct diagnosis. A spectrum of RUQ pathology for which a RUQ ultrasound examination should reasonably be considered as the initial imaging modality of choice will be reviewed.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the Emergency Department. Abdominal pain is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The Emergency Medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination are necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### The SIFIPAC / WSES / SICG / SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^111ofRkD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 1.1. We suggest the use of scoring systems for excluding acute appendicitis in elderly patients with a low-probability score (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).

Statement 1.2. We suggest against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on scoring systems (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).
2 Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients? In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.

According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.

Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.

There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.

According to some authors the typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.

According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs reflect the severity of the abdominal disease, the delay of hospital admission and the high rate of perforations. Indeed, significantly more signs and symptoms of peritonitis (abdominal distension, generalised tenderness and guarding, rebound tenderness, palpable abdominal mass) are recorded among older patients. Probably, comorbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^112Yc9Ju]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Application of CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result (strategy 5) had a higher sensitivity than the clinical diagnosis without imaging: 94% versus 88% (P < 0.001). This conditional strategy would result in a significantly lower number of missed urgent conditions compared with CT only: 6% versus 11%, with a higher sensitivity (P < 0.001) but a lower specificity (P < 0.001). An alternative conditional strategy with CT only after inconclusive ultrasonography (strategy 6) would further reduce use of CT (27% of patients) but would increase the proportion of missed urgent conditions from 6% to 15%.

Five hundred and twelve (50%) patients were older than 45, and 157 (15%) patients had a body mass index exceeding 30. Nine per cent of urgent conditions would be missed with a strategy in which imaging is based on body mass index (strategy 8) compared with 10% for the strategies based on age (strategy 7) or on both age and body mass index (strategy 9). The diagnostic accuracy of the strategy reflecting the American College of Radiology guidelines (10) was comparable to that of the CT only strategy. The use of ultrasonography for both pain in the right upper quadrant and pain in the right lower quadrant (strategy 11) would lead to 16% missed urgent conditions.

Exposure to radiation

Table 2shows use of ultrasonography and CT for each strategy. CT related exposure to radiation would vary between 56% and 81% for the strategies driven by patients' characteristics and between 65% and 95% for the strategies driven by location of pain. The second lowest use of CT (49%) would be achieved with the conditional CT strategy, the strategy that also had the highest sensitivity in detecting urgent diagnoses.

THE EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN: HISTORY AND PHYSICAL AND INITIAL LABORATORIES

Evaluation of the patient with abdominal pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Fig. 1). Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills. Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis. The psoas sign is an irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, a classic finding of acute appendicitis, which can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient laying on their left side. The Rovsing's sign can also be seen in acute appendicitis and is observed when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that white blood count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis. A urine analysis would assist in ruling out other diagnoses, such as urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, or renal stones. A pregnancy test is mandatory for women of childbearing age.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### Routine versus selective abdominal computed tomography scan in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain: a randomized controlled trial [^117XDi6k]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the role of abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging in patients with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain. The authors hypothesized that selective use of abdominal CT would reduce imaging without increasing the rates of negative appendectomy and perforated appendicitis.

Methods

A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in a community teaching emergency department. Adult patients with acute RLQ abdominal pain with suspected acute appendicitis were included. Patients were randomized to mandatory (all patients) or selective (based on clinical evaluation) abdominal CT imaging. The primary outcome was the negative appendectomy rate.

Results

A total of 152 patients were randomized to selective (n = 80) and mandatory (n = 72) intervention groups. The mean (± SD) age was 34.1 (± 3.5) years, and 48% were female. CT imaging was performed in 54 of 80 patients (68%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 56% to 78%) in the selective group and in 70 of 72 patients (97%; 95% CI = 90% to 100%) in the mandatory group. There was a trend to a decreased rate of negative appendectomy in the mandatory group (1/39 [2.6%]; 95% CI = 0.5% to 13.2%) as compared with the selective group (6/43 [13.9%]; 95% CI = 6.6% to 27.3%), with a difference in prevalence rates of 11.3% (95% CI = -3.5% to 26.3%). There was also a trend to a decreased perforated appendix rate in the mandatory group (4/39 [10.3%]) as compared with the selective group (7/38 [18.4%]), with a difference in prevalence rates of 8.2% (95% CI = -8.0% to 24.4%).

Conclusions

In this small sample of adult patients with RLQ abdominal pain and suspected acute appendicitis, CT imaging was performed less frequently in the selective group and there was a trend with mandatory CT imaging to reduced rates of negative appendectomy and perforated appendices.

### Red flag signs and symptoms for patients with early-onset colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AnYmS]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our review also found that nearly half of individuals with EOCRC reported abdominal pain, based on evidence from 73 studies, and a 1.3- to 6-fold positive association with EOCRC risk across 4 studies. Given its association with a myriad of gastrointestinal conditions, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends computed tomography for evaluating patients with acute right or left lower quadrant abdominal pain and ultrasonography for right upper quadrant pain, though the guidelines also recommend identifying associated symptoms to better focus a differential diagnosis. It may be inefficient and unrealistic to perform colonoscopy for all adults younger than 45 years with isolated abdominal pain, given the low diagnostic yieldand insufficient capacity across the US to accommodate this group. Nevertheless, the fact that 40% of patients with EOCRC presented with abdominal pain and 27% presented with altered bowel habits reinforces that any new symptom should be comprehensively evaluated by a clinician. Our findings suggest that EOCRC should be part of the initial differential diagnosis, and that a plan for follow-up should be in place, such as a 30- to 60-day follow-up visit to confirm whether the original working diagnosis was correct, the red flag sign or symptom has resolved, or to refer for colonoscopy to exclude EOCRC if these criteria are not met. We postulate that all benign causes of red flag signs or symptoms either can be diagnostically confirmed or should resolve with initial treatment. When an alternative diagnosis is not confirmed or signs or symptoms fail to resolve, a colonoscopy to rule out EOCRC should be pursued. Abdominal pain could serve as a marker to prompt further patient-clinician discussion about additional medical history, which could help determine whether further diagnostic work-up is warranted.

Diagnostics — targeted testing under specified circumstances: Stool testing should be performed under clearly identified circumstances (Table 2) for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, C. difficile, and STEC in symptomatic hosts (strong, low). Specifically, test for Yersinia enterocolitica in people with persistent abdominal pain (especially school-aged children with right lower quadrant pain mimicking appendicitis who may have mesenteric adenitis), and in people with fever at epidemiologic risk for yersiniosis including infants with direct or indirect exposures to raw or undercooked pork products. In addition, test stool specimens for Vibrio species in people with large volume rice water stools or either exposure to salty or brackish waters, consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, or travel to cholera-endemic regions within 3 days prior to onset of diarrhea.

### Diagnoses of exclusion in the workup of abdominal complaints [^114gPPDx]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, comprising 8.8% of all visits. Despite advances in medicine and imaging, 20% to 30% of patients still leave the department without a definitive diagnosis, whichhis can be both distressing for patients and unsatisfying for providers. Diagnoses of exclusion can be perilous, and their application should be carefully considered in order to not overlook more emergent complaints. However, a working knowledge of diagnoses of exclusion can guide therapeutics and specialty referrals that can ultimately provide answers and relief to a patient population often at odds with available information and expectations.

### Imaging of right lower quadrant pain in children and adolescents: expert panel narrative review [^111n2Yma]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

### Diagnostic characteristics of S100A8 / A9 in a multicenter study of patients with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain [^116JkhJc]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Over the past decade, clinicians have become increasingly reliant on computed tomography (CT) for the evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis. To limit the radiation risks and costs of CT, investigators have searched for biomarkers to aid in diagnostic decision-making. We evaluated one such biomarker, calprotectin or S100A8/A9, and determined the diagnostic performance characteristics of a developmental biomarker assay in a multicenter investigation of patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain.

Methods

This was a prospective, double-blinded, single-arm, multicenter investigation performed in 13 emergency departments (EDs) from August 2009 to April 2010 of patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Plasma samples were tested using the investigational S100A8/A9 assay. The primary outcome of acute appendicitis was determined by histopathology for patients undergoing appendectomy or 2-week telephone follow-up for patients discharged without surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, negative likelihood ratio (LR-), and positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of the biomarker assay were calculated using the prespecified cutoff value of 14 units. A post hoc stability study was performed to investigate the potential effect of time and courier transport on the measured value of the S100A8/A9 assay test results.

Results

Of 1,052 enrolled patients, 848 met criteria for analysis. The median age was 24.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 16–38 years), 57% were female, and 50% were white. There was a 27.5% prevalence of acute appendicitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the investigational S100A8/A9 assay in diagnosing acute appendicitis were estimated to be 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 93% to 98%) and 16% (95% CI = 13% to 19%), respectively. The LR- ratio was 0.24 (95% CI = 0.12 to 0.47), and the LR+ was 1.14 (95% CI = 1.10 to 1.19). The post hoc stability study demonstrated that in the samples that were shipped, the estimated time coefficient was 7.6 × 10(-3) ± 2.0 × 10(-3) log units/hour, representing an average increase of 43% in the measured value over 48 hours; in the samples that were not shipped, the estimated time coefficient was 2.5 × 10(-3) ± 0.4 × 10(-3) log units/hour, representing a 13% increase on average in the measured value over 48 hours, which was the maximum delay allowed by the study protocol. Thus, adjusting the cutoff value of 14 units by the magnitude of systematic inflation observed in the stability study at 48 hours would result in a new cutoff value of 20 units and a "corrected" sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 28%, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, we found the investigational enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for S100A8/A9 to perform with high sensitivity but very limited specificity. We found that shipping effect and delay in analysis resulted in a subsequent rise in test values, thereby increasing the sensitivity and decreasing the specificity of the test. Further investigation with hospital-based laboratory analyzers is the next critical step for determining the ultimate clinical utility of the ELISA test for S100A8/A9 in ED patients presenting with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain.

Appendicitis is one of the most common sources of abdominal pain in the emergency setting and is generally considered a straightforward diagnosis. However, atypical appearances, non-visualization, and inconclusive features can make these cases more complicated. The objectives of this article are to review the differential diagnoses for right lower quadrant pain, discuss the imaging characteristics of simple appendicitis on computed tomography (CT), and provide guidance for equivocal cases, complicated appendicitis, and appendicitis mimics.

### Surgical management of acute right lower-quadrant pain in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^113s4teP]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of right lower-quadrant pain in pregnant patients is a challenge in diagnosis. We discuss the surgical issues among pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain and demonstrate the method to diagnosis.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study with enrollment during 2 years. Pregnant patients presenting with acute right lower-quadrant abdominal pain and requiring surgical consult were included. Demographics, gestational age, symptoms, workup, operative results, and pathology were recorded.

Results

One-hundred patients were enrolled, 38 had nonspecific abdominal pain, 15 of whom were admitted. There were no differences in temperature, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift among the admitted and nonadmitted patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and had a substantially higher gestational age, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift than those who did not. Ultrasound was performed considerably more often on first-trimester patients (81.6%) compared with second- (58.1%) and third-trimester (57.9%) patients, and CT scan was used considerably less in the first trimester compared with the second and third trimesters, and considerably less than ultrasound for the first trimester. Sensitivity of ultrasound for appendicitis was inversely correlated to fetal gestational age, and CT scan retained high sensitivity and specificity throughout pregnancy.

Conclusions

This is one of the first prospective studies assessing diagnoses and workup of pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain. We recommend abdominal ultrasound be the first imaging modality for patients for whom surgical consultation is necessary, thereby determining if the pathology is obstetric. If inconclusive, a CT scan is necessary to guide treatment.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

### Current management of acute appendicitis in adults: what you need to know [^1163ARHT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute surgical diseases in the world today. Acute appendicitis can present with a well-recognized clinical presentation with abdominal pain which localize in the right lower quadrant. This presentation is more typical in men than in women of child baring age. Several clinical and laboratory calculations can be used to increase the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis. Various imaging modalities can be used to make the diagnosis which include ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each study has well known sensitivity/specificity of positive predictive value of making the diagnosis of appendicitis. The management of acute appendicitis is based on the presentation of the patient and dividing it into uncomplicated and complicated disease. Each requires management with antibiotics and followed with timely appendectomy. Recent studies have demonstrated nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis without no fecalith that can be managed with antibiotics alone. Complicated acute appendicitis should undergo timely surgical intervention. Patients presenting with a large appendiceal abscess or phlegmon should undergo percutaneous drainage and antibiotic management. There are certain patient populations that should be considered for surgical intervention. Pregnant patients as well as immunosuppressed patients should undergo timely surgical intervention to decrease the risk of complications. This review outlines the current principles of the diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of acute appendicitis based on the best available evidence of acute appendicitis in adults.

### Right lower-quadrant pain-more than one diagnosis [^114GQDV4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

When a patient presents with right-lower-quadrant pain in the emergency room, the diagnosis of appendicitis must always be considered, but the differential diagnosis for this symptom includes many other etiologies. We describe a case of an 8-year-old girl with von Willebrand disease who presented with right-lower-quadrant pain and was found to have an appendiceal wall hematoma. During her evaluation, an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, and the results were initially interpreted as an intussusception. Although ultrasound is a highly reliable way to diagnose appendicitis and intussusception, the case illustrates that the thickened abdominal wall that occurs in a mural hematoma can appear like the "target sign" that is usually associated with intussusception, and in certain clinical scenarios, alternative forms of imaging may be of value.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute left upper quadrant pain [^115qtMc8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints encountered in the emergency department and outpatient setting. Across all sites, the left upper quadrant (LUQ) is the least common location for abdominal pain with reportedly the lowest physical examination interrater agreement. The limited sensitivity of physical examination, combined with an uncommon and nonspecific clinical presentation, make assessment of LUQ pain challenging. Acute LUQ pain may arise directly from the spleen or infections in the LUQ, or represent referred pain from other organs such as stomach, bowels, pancreas, or kidney. This document aims to address acute pain with suspected splenomegaly, with fever, and not otherwise specified. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is usually appropriate for detection of a broad range of pathologies. In patients with suspected splenomegaly, ultrasound abdomen is also usually an appropriate alternate for initial imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^112GUZQH]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the ED need to be diagnosed correctly and treated accordingly. As the majority of patients will have self-limiting pathology not requiring surgical intervention, most will not require an admission to the hospital. Patients with abdominal pathology requiring surgical treatment, however, should not be missed. To diagnose patients with abdominal pain, many diagnostic modalities can be used to complement the "basic" clinical evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and blood and urine analysis. Diagnostic measures such as US, CT, laparoscopy, and clinical observation have all been reported in the literature. Ultrasound, for example, can assist in the diagnosis of many gastrointestinal causes of acute abdominal pain, and its routine use by surgeons for such patients has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy. Computer tomography has also been reported to increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce hospital admissions by 24%, and it is said to be the best predictor of the need for an urgent intervention. The use of cross-sectional imaging for all patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, however, is costly, time consuming, and, in the case of CT, exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The last issue is important as the growing use of CT is steadily increasing the collective dose of medical radiation to which patient populations are subjected. Even though the cancer risk from an abdominal CT is small for the individual, the increasing use of the modality may create a future health concern, especially for children. The indications for ordering a CT should therefore always be carefully scrutinized by medical personnel, especially when other diagnostic modalities can attain similar results.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^111DeDCH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Patients assessed at the emergency department at Rotorua Public Hospital with acute abdominal pain requiring admission to the surgical unit were enrolled in the prospective study.

Patients were examined by the admitting surgical team after taking a thorough history, Relevant points in the history included the patient's gender, duration of pain, site of pain, character of pain, fever, loss of appetite, change in bowel habit, vomiting, abdominal distension and urinary or genital symptoms.

Factors in the clinical examination that were considered of significant contribution to the final diagnosis included temperature, tachycardia, and abdominal tenderness and localized guarding.

Data was collected prospectively on an electronic database. Patients were followed up with further investigations that included ultrasound scan, CT scan and diagnostic laparotomy as was clinically indicated to ascertain the final diagnosis. All patients were admitted for observation or surgery if indicated.

Non-specific abdominal pain was defined as an abdominal pain in right iliac or hypogastric area lasting more than 6 hours and less than 8 days, without fever, leukocytosis, or obvious peritoneal signs and uncertain diagnosis after physical examination and baseline investigations including abdominal sonography; provide they have totally settled or underwent diagnostic laparoscopy that proved to be normal.

Analysis

Analysis was performed to evaluate the relative contribution and specificity of each individual factor to a definitive final diagnosis that led to identification those who had no definitive diagnosis. The data analyzed using SPSS ® version 10.5. Univariate analysis was performed using simple linear regression; multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### How to diagnose acute appendicitis: ultrasound first [^1173qt8k]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Why use US as first-line imaging modality?

In conclusion, the studies and reports detailed above give an overview of the persistent difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of AA in paediatric and adult patients, the usefulness of various clinical scores (which are not commonly used in routine practice) and recent developments of modern imaging techniques focusing on US imaging. To date, US imaging for suspected AA is performed world-wide by radiologists and many physicians of other medical subspecialties, with or without the support of sonographers.

Paediatric patient population: It is the opinion of the ESR working group on US that graded-compression US should be the first-line imaging modality in paediatric patients with suspected AA. Direct and indirect US signs of AA are well established, as is the examination technique itself. We recognize that US has, compared to CT and MRI, lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of AA. The 2011 ACR Appropriateness Criteria® for right lower quadrant pain — suspected appendicitis — state that "for adult patients with clinical signs of AA the sensitivity and specificity of CT are greater than those of US, but that in paediatric patients, the sensitivity and specificity of graded-compression US can approach those of CT, without the use of ionizing radiation".

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^116oZzjU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Early diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment results in accurate, prompt, and efficient management of acute abdominal pain. This technique reduces the rate of unnecessary laparotomy and right iliac fossa gridiron incisions and increases the diagnostic accuracy in these patients; however this approach is expensive with significant use of the resources and potential morbidity. Diagnostic laparoscopy also avoids extensive preoperative investigations, averts delays in operative management. Morino et al assessed the role of diagnostic laparoscopy and concluded that laparoscopy compared with clinical observation, early laparoscopy did not show a clear benefit in women with non-specific abdominal pain. They reported higher number of diagnosis and a shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopy group. In another study patients who have no evidence of guarding, normal temperature, and normal white cells count were observed; a practice that is proven to reduce the rate of negative appendicectomy. Non-specific abdominal pain is the most common diagnosis in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain (25–35% of all patients), and of those patients only a quarter needs surgical intervention. Clinical scores that were developed to recognize acute appendicitis are useful but those score could only be used with clinical judgment, if there is any suspicion of serious pathology the patient should undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy.

The current study shows the likely groups of patients with non-specific abdominal pain are those with normal white cell count, no history of vomiting and absent signs of peritoneal irritation with normal heart rate. Patients who fulfill those findings are suitable for early discharge, which may help to reduce the health care cost for those patients. All patients admitted to emergency department with abdominal pain should be referred for surgical opinion and the diagnosis of nonspecific abdominal pain should only be made after thorough assessment, definite pathology excluded and the patient does not return with the same complaint.

### A practical score for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^115Kx1L8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (1986). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Alvarado score" for acute appendicitis.

The Alvarado Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. It was developed by Dr. Alfredo Alvarado in 1986. The score is calculated based on eight clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. These features include symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The Alvarado Score is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, helping clinicians decide whether a patient requires surgical consultation, further diagnostic imaging, or can be safely discharged. It is applicable to all age groups, but it should be used with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for atypical presentations of appendicitis in this population.

The score is not recommended for use in patients with known gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgeries, or other conditions that may mimic the symptoms of appendicitis, as these could potentially skew the results.

The Alvarado score is a diagnostic tool used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis based on a patient's clinical presentation. It considers eight specific signs and symptoms, with each receiving a designated point value. The sum of these values yields a total score that helps in evaluating the likelihood of appendicitis.

What this involves is a checklist of symptoms and signs:

- Right lower quadrant tenderness is worth 2 points.
- An elevated temperature (higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius) adds 1 point.
- Rebound tenderness contributes an additional 1 point.
- Migration of abdominal pain to the right lower quadrant counts for 1 point.
- Anorexia, or loss of appetite, is also scored as 1 point.
- Nausea or vomiting likewise adds 1 point to the total.
- Leukocytosis, defined as a white blood cell count exceeding 10,000, provides 2 points.
- A left shift in leukocyte count, a sign of increased immature white blood cells, contributes 1 point.

To calculate the Alvarado score, determine the presence of each symptom or sign. If present, assign the associated points and sum them to get a score between 0 and 10.

The resulting score is then interpreted as follows:

- A score of 7 or above indicates "Probable appendicitis". This suggests a high likelihood of appendicitis, often prompting further medical evaluation, such as imaging or surgical consultation.
- Scores ranging from 5 to 6 denote "Possible appendicitis", indicating that appendicitis could be present. Medical professionals would typically consider additional clinical judgment and possibly further testing.
- A score below 5 implies "Unlikely appendicitis", suggesting that appendicitis is less probable, although it's important that clinicians still consider the broader clinical context.

This scoring system provides a structured approach, aiding healthcare providers in the initial assessment and decision-making process regarding suspected appendicitis.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112fTbZk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Patients with undiagnosed HAE with GI symptoms are likely to present across many care settings, including both primary care and specialist clinics. Inclusion of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained severe and often recurrent abdominal pain, with or without skin manifestations, may improve the diagnosis rate of HAE. Careful history-taking and a physical examination along with selected imaging studies and laboratory testing are vital to making the diagnosis. By including HAE in the differential diagnosis, providers can make the appropriate referral to a physician experienced in managing HAE, thus shortening the time to diagnosis and effective treatment and reducing the burden of disease.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Pitfalls in appendicitis [^117RYjZv]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of appendicitis is fraught with potential pitfalls, and despite its prevalence, appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. There is no single historical or physical finding or laboratory test that can definitively make the diagnosis. This article discusses the value of presenting signs, symptoms, laboratory testing, and the rational use of various imaging modalities, such as CT scanning and ultrasound. Challenges of special populations, such as children, the elderly, and pregnant patients, are also discussed. Although appendicitis continues to be a source of medical legal risk and misdiagnosis, a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of all tests in suspected appendicitis can improve the emergency physician's diagnostic accuracy in this high-risk disease.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^115Gcr3R]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy

Table 2shows the accuracy results for each strategy. Figure 3shows these results plotted in a receiver operating characteristics space (see web appendix for more information on the receiver operating characteristics space). The clinical diagnosis with or without plain radiographs had a high sensitivity but lacked specificity for urgent cases. Compared with the clinical diagnosis, the use of ultrasonography in all patients (ultrasonography strategy) reduced the number of false positive urgent diagnoses, but 30% of urgent conditions would still be missed. Ultrasonography as a single test was inferior to CT as a single test (CT strategy) for the detection of urgent conditions, as the sensitivity was significantly higher for CT (89%) than for ultrasonography (70%, P < 0.001). The sensitivities of both strategies were not significantly higher than with clinical evaluation alone; only specificities were significantly improved.

The performance of ultrasonography was stable between the participating centres. The sensitivity of 65% (95% confidence interval 58% to 72%) for ultrasonography done by residents without supervision after working hours was significantly lower than sensitivity of 74% (69% to 74%) for ultrasonography by radiologists (P = 0.03). The sensitivity was 69% (82% to 91%) for ultrasonography done by residents under supervision, which was not significantly lower than for ultrasonography done by radiologists (P = 0.20). The specificity for urgent conditions did not differ significantly between radiologists and supervised or unsupervised residents (P = 0.70).

The consequences of routine imaging for patients with potentially resolving appendicitis goes beyond the scope of this study. Future investigations will have to focus on this issue.

Having said all this, it must not be forgotten that thorough clinical evaluation is the cornerstone of every ED assessment for a patient with acute abdominal pain. In 7 out of 8 cases in which the radiological diagnosis was overruled, the surgeon did so rightly. The radiological result must always be interpreted in light of the clinical assessment of the patient.

### Right lower quadrant pain in a young female: ultrasound diagnosis of rectus abdominis tear [^113sqmdW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Right lower quadrant pain in young females presents a frequent diagnostic challenge for emergency physicians, with a broad differential and several important diagnoses. Using an "ultrasound first" imaging strategy can help decrease the use of computed tomography scans, with associated savings in radiation exposure, cost, and other resource use.

Case Report

We report a case of right lower quadrant pain in a young woman. After her initial history and physical examination, appendicitis was the leading differential. A bedside ultrasound was performed, leading to the uncommon diagnosis of rectus abdominis muscle tear. The sonographic findings of a muscle tear include increase in size, loss of linear, homogeneous architecture, and decreased echogenicity. Making this diagnosis at the bedside using ultrasound obviated the need for further imaging, avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, and decreasing emergency department length of stay and overall cost, while leading to a tailored treatment plan. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Rectus abdominis tear is a cause of right lower quadrant pain that may mimic appendicitis and should be considered in patients with this complaint. The ability to make this diagnosis with bedside ultrasound may assist in several important patient-oriented outcomes.

Diverticulitis has long been regarded as a disease of the elderly, but its incidence has been increasing in those under age 40. Younger patients with diverticulitis are more likely to be male and obese. They often have atypical presentations, and 25% may have right lower quadrant pain. Not surprisingly, the condition is often misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary surgery. An abdominal CT scan is the modality of choice for diagnosis, but the most important diagnostic step is simply to include diverticulitis on the differential diagnosis of a young person with lower abdominal pain.

### Single and combined diagnostic value of clinical features and laboratory tests in acute appendicitis [^112P2BwM]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical features and laboratory test results in detecting acute appendicitis.

Methods

Clinical features and laboratory test results were prospectively recorded in a consecutive series of 1,101 patients presenting with abdominal pain at the emergency department (ED) in six hospitals. Likelihood ratios (LRs) and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for the individual features. Variants of clinical presentation, based on different combinations of clinical features, were investigated and the accuracies of combinations of clinical features were evaluated.

Results

The discriminative power (AUC) of the individual features in patients with suspected appendicitis ranged from 0.50 to 0.65. For five of the 23 predictor sets, the accuracy for appendicitis was more than 85%. This accuracy was only found in male patients. The relative frequency of these predictor sets ranged from 2% to 13% of patients with suspected appendicitis. A combination of the clinical features migration of pain to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), and direct tenderness in the RLQ, was present in only 28% (120/422) of clinically suspected patients, of whom no more than 85 patients had appendicitis (71%). A "classical" presentation (combination of migration of pain to the RLQ, tenderness in the RLQ, and rigidity) occurred in only 6% (25/422) of patients with suspected appendicitis and yielded an accuracy of 100% in males but only 46% in females.

Conclusions

The discriminative power (AUC) of individual clinical features and laboratory test results for appendicitis was weak in patients with suspected appendicitis. Combinations of clinical features and laboratory tests with high diagnostic accuracy are relatively infrequent in patients with suspected appendicitis.

### Emergency laparoscopy – current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Non-specific abdominal pain

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However in those where observation is not safe, due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are two fold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimising potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### The value of pancreatic stone protein in predicting acute appendicitis in patients presenting at the emergency department with abdominal pain [^116i84C4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is defined as an inflammation of the vermiform appendix and is a common condition and an urgent surgical illness. It is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain and remains a diagnostic challenge. It has variable manifestations and generous overlap with other clinical syndromes. In fact morbidity increases significantly with the diagnostic delay and left untreated, appendicitis has the potential for severe complications, including perforation or sepsis, and may even cause death. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advancement in medicine, appendicitis still remains a clinical emergency.

No single sign, symptom, or diagnostic test exists which accurately confirms an appendiceal inflammation. The classic history of anorexia and periumbilical pain followed by nausea, right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, and vomiting occurs in only 50% of cases.

Accepted etiologic factors of appendicitis are appendiceal lumen obstruction and infection. The main therapeutic option still remains the surgical removal of the vermiform appendix even though a few studies promote an antibiotic treatment. After admission to the emergency department (ED), patients presenting with abdominal pain caused by a variety of different etiologic factors have to be worked up with the goal of approaching 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis in a time-, cost-, and consultation-efficient manner.

It is reported that appendectomy carries a complication rate of up to 15%, as well as increased associated costs and the discomfort of hospitalisation and surgery. Delay in diagnosis and treatment account for much of the associated mortality and morbidity. Therefore, the goal of the surgeon is to diagnose appendicitis as early as possible.

The overall mortality rate of 0.2–0.8% is attributable to complications of the disease rather than to surgical interventions. The mortality rate in children ranges from 0.1% to 1%; in patients older than 70 years, the rate rises above 20%, primarily because of diagnostic and therapeutic delay.

Appendiceal perforation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with non-perforating appendicitis. The mortality risk of acute but not gangrenous appendicitis is less than 0.1%, but the risk rises to 0.6% in gangrenous appendicitis. The rate of perforation varies from 16% to 40%, with a higher frequency occurring in patients below 50 years (40–57%) and in patients older than 50 years (55–70%), in whom misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. Complications occur in 1–5% of patients with appendicitis. Postoperative wound infections account for almost one third of the associated morbidity.

General medical — abdominal pain assessment for suspected appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and pyelonephritis lists condition-specific findings. Appendicitis findings include focal right lower quadrant tenderness possibly with rebound and guarding, right lower quadrant tenderness noted during palpation of the left lower quadrant (positive Rovsing's sign), peri-umbilical or diffuse abdominal tenderness with palpation of the abdomen/pelvis, fever, nausea/vomiting, and lack of appetite. Acute cholecystitis findings include right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness, fever, nausea and vomiting, and history of gallstones. Pyelonephritis findings include fever, nausea/vomiting, urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, back/flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^113CiBhs]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this case-control study, children with delayed diagnosis at their index ED encounter were more likely to have a longer duration of abdominal pain, no pain with walking, abdominal pain outside the right lower quadrant, no abdominal guarding, and a complex chronic condition compared with children with a timely diagnosis of appendicitis. Based on PAS or pARC scores, children with delayed diagnoses were less clinically discernible. They were more likely to receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiemetic therapy and less likely to receive opioids or undergo imaging. In 76.8% of patients with a delayed diagnosis, there were possibly or probably opportunities to improve diagnosis. Children with delayed diagnosis had worse outcomes. When the diagnosis was made, hospitalizations were longer, appendectomy was less likely, and appendiceal perforation and multiple abdominal surgical procedures were more likely. Taken together, our findings suggest that delayed diagnosis was more likely in patients with less classic presentations, that such patients were less likely to undergo imaging or receive appendicitis-directed treatments, and that a substantial fraction of delayed diagnoses were preventable despite being less clinically apparent.

Among children with delayed diagnosis of appendicitis, progression of disease occurred between the index and delay ED encounters. Nearly every classic symptom or sign of appendicitis was more likely to be present during the later visit. The PAS and pARC scores, which measure the likelihood of appendicitis, were higher during the delay encounter than during the index encounter. Abdominal guarding and migration of pain to the right lower quadrant were especially likely to develop after the index encounter: each feature was more than 10 times as likely to be present later. The presence of more classic symptoms during a second ED visit makes the diagnosis more discernible to clinicians. Conversely, the absence of classic appendicitis symptoms puts a patient at risk of a delayed diagnosis.

Nevertheless, in this study, most delayed diagnoses were probably or possibly MOIDs, indicating that there were potential opportunities to prevent delay. The 3 elements of the diagnostic process most associated with a MOID were failures in diagnostic reasoning that indicated that the patient's history should have prompted a deeper evaluation. Most children with delayed diagnosis had neither a WBC count nor an imaging study performed at the index encounter. Children with a characteristic history or physical examination should undergo these tests in an effort to prevent delayed diagnosis. In this study, only 22.0% to 61.3% of children received indicated imaging based on a pARC score above the threshold at which imaging is cost-effective. This finding suggests an opportunity to improve detection.

### A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis – a prospective study [^116Mzu24]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) is a clinical calculator used in the evaluation of adult patients who present with suspected acute appendicitis. This scoring system is designed to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis, helping to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories based on a variety of clinical factors such as symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The AAS can help guide clinical decision-making, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary imaging or surgery in low-risk patients. It is not applicable to pediatric patients, pregnant women, or individuals with previous appendectomy. It should also not be used in patients with other clear causes of abdominal pain.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) calculator assesses the likelihood of acute appendicitis by evaluating patient symptoms and lab results. Users input data related to seven key indicators which are translated into numerical scores based on established categories. The scoring system assigns weights to patient symptoms and lab values as follows:

- **Right Lower Quadrant Pain**:

- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Pain Relocation**:

- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Right Lower Quadrant Tenderness**:

- Present, male = 3 points
- Present, female aged 16–49 years = 1 point
- Present, female aged > 50 years = 3 points
- Absent = 0 points

- **Guarding**:

- None = 0 points
- Mild = 2 points
- Moderate or severe = 4 points

- **White Blood Cell Count (×10⁹/L)**:
- ≥ 7.2 and < 10.9 = 1 point
- ≥ 10.9 and < 14.0 = 2 points
- ≥ 14.0 = 3 points

- **Neutrophils (%)**:
- ≥ 62 and < 75 = 2 points
- ≥ 75 and < 83 = 3 points
- ≥ 83 = 4 points

- **C-Reactive Protein, mg/L (for symptoms > 24 hours)**:
- ≥ 4 and < 11 = 2 points
- ≥ 11 and < 25 = 3 points
- ≥ 25 and < 83 = 5 points
- ≥ 83 = 1 point
(alternative ranges for CRP are scored similarly based on different thresholds)

To compute the AAS score, each input response is translated into its respective point value. These scores are summed to produce a total score ranging between 4 and 23. This total score then helps provide a snapshot of appendicitis risk:

- A score of 10 or lower suggests a low risk of acute appendicitis.
- Scores from 11 to 15 indicate an intermediate risk.
- A score of 16 or higher points to a high risk of acute appendicitis.

These interpretations guide clinicians in assessing the probability of appendicitis, allowing for more informed decision-making in potential cases.

Pediatric suspected appendicitis — Kharbanda et al prospective cohort derivation and validation of decision rules: Children aged 3–18 years (total 601 patients) were evaluated, and a logistic regression rule using nausea, history of focal right lower quadrant pain, difficulty walking, rebound tenderness and absolute neutrophil count > 6.75x103 μL yielded that a score of 5 or less identified 108 patients with 106 without appendicitis, with sensitivity 98.7% (95% CI 95.5%-99.9%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 98.1% (95% CI 93.5%-99.7%); validation sensitivity was 96.3% (95% CI 87.5%-99%) and NPV 95.6% (95% CI 90.8%-99%). A recursive partitioning rule (absolute neutrophil count > 6.75, nausea/emesis/anorexia, maximal tenderness in right lower quadrant) achieved derivation sensitivity 100% (95% CI 97.7%-100%) and NPV 100% (95% CI 96.0%-100%), with validation sensitivity 98.1% (95% CI 90.1%-99.9%) and NPV 97.5% (95% CI 86.8%-99.9%). Patients identified as low risk by either prediction model should be considered for observation instead of imaging.

### Right-sided diverticulitis mimics appendicitis [^1164tyD8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Right-sided diverticulitis is a rare source of right lower quadrant pain in Western society; however, it is quite common in Asian societies. Right-sided diverticulitis presents very similarly to appendicitis, with right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities, and is often seen in young patients.

Objectives

In this report, we present a case of right-sided diverticulitis. We review right-sided diverticulitis' diagnosis and management. It is important to diagnose right-sided diverticulitis because it is a good mimic of appendicitis and ideally should be diagnosed before a patient has unnecessary surgery.

Case Report

A 26-year-old Asian woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain and fever. She was initially thought to have appendicitis clinically, but had right-sided diverticulitis diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Her right-sided diverticulitis resolved in 3 days.

Conclusions

Severe right lower quadrant pain in young patients of Asian descent can be right-sided diverticulitis. Right-sided diverticulitis is a benign condition managed medically that mimics appendicitis. CT imaging seems to be the best way to avoid unnecessary surgery.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and for efficient throughput of patients. Decision making in patients with abdominal pain on the basis of clinical and laboratory evaluation alone can result in unnecessary interventions or in delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, of which ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are the most often used, can assist in clinical decision making. Imaging has been shown to have a positive effect on the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, to lead to changes in decisions about management, and to increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has been responsible for an increase in hospital costs, and CT has been a growing source of exposure to radiation in adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has made available guidelines for imaging in patients with abdominal pain and specific locations of abdominal tenderness. This differentiation of use of imaging with patient tailored guidelines may not be sufficient to cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification of urgent conditions, without exposing patients to unnecessary forms of imaging. Unfortunately, many of the studies on imaging for acute abdominal pain have evaluated investigations in isolation, and several show methodological shortcomings such as retrospective collection of data or differential verification of test results.

We evaluated the added value of plain radiographs, ultrasonography, and computed tomography after clinical evaluation for making urgent diagnoses in patients presenting with abdominal pain. We compared the accuracy and costs of 11 diagnostic strategies, by using data systematically collected in a consecutive series of unselected patients presenting with acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain at the emergency department, all of whom were investigated with a structured overcomplete imaging protocol.

### MR imaging of acute right lower quadrant pain in pregnant and nonpregnant patients [^116gTAEA]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

The use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain is increasing, particularly in those circumstances where computed tomography (CT) is not desirable (eg, pregnancy, allergy to iodinated contrast material). Although ultrasonography (US) is considered the imaging study of choice for evaluation of abdominal pain in pregnant patients, MR imaging is a valuable adjunct to US in evaluation of pregnant patients with acute right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain who have inconclusive US results. MR imaging is also frequently used in patients with renal failure, in whom the use of iodinated contrast material is contraindicated, as well as in cases where CT results are inconclusive. In patients with acute RLQ pain, the breadth of abnormalities visible at MR imaging is very broad, with pathologic conditions potentially originating from multiple organ systems, but most commonly from the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. MR imaging is an excellent imaging modality for evaluation of RLQ pain and should be strongly considered in those patients in whom use of iodinated contrast media or radiation is not desirable.

### Use of diagnostic testing in the emergency department for patients presenting with non-traumatic abdominal pain [^113BGCaZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to measure the utilization and diagnostic value of tests used in the Emergency Department (ED) on patients with undifferentiated non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain. Specific goals were to measure how often these tests led to changes in diagnosis or disposition, which tests were most commonly used, and which tests providers considered most helpful. We conducted a pilot single-center, prospective descriptive study, enrolling all eligible adult patients who presented to our ED with non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain during defined hours of our intake period. Based on serial provider interviews pre- and post-testing, we measured the frequency of change of most likely diagnosis and disposition, which tests were performed, and the provider-perceived value of tests. We enrolled 124 subjects with a mean age of 44 years; 27% were admitted. Testing led to a change in most likely diagnosis in 37% of subjects, and in disposition in 41%. Frequency of diagnostic test use varied from a high of 93% for CBC to 6% for a blood or urine culture. Overall, 65% of patients had at least one imaging study performed, and 39% had an abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. Over all subjects, providers identified the most useful tests as the CT scan (31%) and urinalysis (17%). In conclusion, among ED patients who presented with non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain to one academic center, the pre-test most likely diagnosis and disposition were changed based on the ED evaluation in over one-third of subjects. Almost all received blood tests and two-thirds received one or more imaging studies. Based on providers' subjective opinions, the most valuable tests were the abdomino/pelvic CT scan and the urinalysis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of laboratory and ultrasound findings in patients with a non-visualized appendix [^117CtoGR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound (US) and laboratory testing are initial diagnostic tests for acute appendicitis. A diagnostic dilemma develops when the appendix is not visualized on US. Objective: To determine if specific US findings and/or laboratory results predict acute appendicitis when the appendix is not visualized. Methods: A prospective study was conducted on children (birth-18 yrs) presenting to the pediatric emergency department with suspected acute appendicitis who underwent right lower quadrant US. Children with previous appendectomy, US at another facility, or eloped were excluded. US findings analyzed: inflammatory changes, right lower quadrant and lower abdominal fluid, tenderness during US exam and lymph nodes. Diagnoses were confirmed via surgical pathology. Results 1252 subjects were enrolled, 60.8% (762) had appendix visualized and 39.1% (490) did not. In children where the appendix was not seen, 6.7% [33] were diagnosed with appendicitis. Among patients with a non-visualized appendix, the likelihood of appendicitis was significantly greater if: inflammatory changes in the RLQ (OR 18.0, 95% CI 4.5–72.1), CRP > 0.5 mg/dL (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.0–6.8), or WBC > 10 (OR 4.36, 95% CI 1.66–11.58). Duration of abdominal pain > 3 days was significantly less likely associated with appendicitis in this model (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.003–0.395). Combined, the absence inflammatory changes, CRP < 0.5 mg/dL, WBC < 10, and pain, ≤ 3 days had a NPV of 94.0%. Conclusion When the appendix is not visualized on US, predictors for appendicitis include the presence of inflammatory changes in the RLQ, an elevated WBC/CRP and abdominal pain < 3 days.

### Diagnostic errors related to acute abdominal pain in the emergency department [^111tJF5W]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Diagnostic errors in the emergency department (ED) are harmful and costly. We reviewed a selected high-risk cohort of patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain to evaluate for possible diagnostic errors and associated process breakdowns.

Design

We conducted a retrospective chart review of ED patients > 18years at an urban academic hospital. A computerised 'trigger' algorithm identified patients possibly at high risk for diagnostic errors to facilitate selective record reviews. The trigger determined patients to be at high risk because they: (1) presented to the ED with abdominal pain, and were discharged home and (2) had a return ED visit within 10days that led to a hospitalisation. Diagnostic errors were defined as missed opportunities to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on the evidence available during the first ED visit, regardless of patient harm, and included errors that involved both ED and non-ED providers. Errors were determined by two independent record reviewers followed by team consensus in cases of disagreement.

Results

Diagnostic errors occurred in 35 of 100 high-risk cases. Over two-thirds had breakdowns involving the patient-provider encounter (most commonly history-taking or ordering additional tests) and/or follow-up and tracking of diagnostic information (most commonly follow-up of abnormal test results). The most frequently missed diagnoses were gallbladder pathology (n = 10) and urinary infections (n = 5).

Conclusions

Diagnostic process breakdowns in ED patients with abdominal pain most commonly involved history-taking, ordering insufficient tests in the patient-provider encounter and problems with follow-up of abnormal test results.

### Pearls and pitfalls in the emergency department evaluation of abdominal pain [^116SB7yt]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department (ED), comprising approximately 5% of total visits. Although not typically serious, abdominal pain often presents many difficult situations for the clinician. Women of reproductive age and elderly individuals represent some of the most challenging patients to evaluate. Although there are general diagnostic and clinical principles that apply to the evaluation of all patients, these two groups deserve extra attention because of the broad differential diagnosis and potential for serious complications. This article outlines the epidemiology of abdominal pain in patients who present to the ED, and provides guidelines pertinent to the evaluation of all patients. In addition, the article discusses the approach to abdominal pain of pelvic origin in women of reproductive age and abdominal pain in elderly individuals.

### US of right upper quadrant pain in the emergency department: diagnosing beyond gallbladder and biliary disease [^112jNZ25]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is the most common diagnosable cause for right upper quadrant abdominal (RUQ) pain in patients who present to the emergency department (ED). However, over one-third of patients initially thought to have acute cholecystitis actually have RUQ pain attributable to other causes. Ultrasonography (US) is the primary imaging modality of choice for initial imaging assessment and serves as a fast, cost-effective, and dynamic modality to provide a definitive diagnosis or a considerably narrowed list of differential possibilities. Multiple organ systems are included at standard RUQ US, and a variety of ultrasonographically diagnosable disease processes can be identified, including conditions of hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, gastrointestinal, vascular, and thoracic origin, all of which may result in RUQ pain. In certain cases, subsequent computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography, or cholescintigraphy may be considered, depending on the clinical situation and US findings. Familiarity with the spectrum of disease processes outside of the gallbladder and biliary tree that may manifest with RUQ pain and recognition at US of these alternative conditions is pivotal for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Diagnosis at the time of initial US can reduce unnecessary imaging and its consequences, including excess cost, radiation exposure, nephrotoxic contrast medium use, and time to diagnosis, thereby translating into improved patient care and outcome. This article (a) reviews the causes of RUQ pain identifiable at US using an organ-system approach, (b) illustrates the US appearance of select conditions from each organ system with multimodality imaging correlates, and (c) discusses the relevant pathophysiology and treatment of these entities to aid in efficient direction of management.

### Evaluating patients with left upper quadrant pain [^117QVgn4]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a major role in the evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department with acute left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain. Multidetector computed tomography is currently the primary modality used for imaging these patients. The peritoneal reflections, subperitoneal compartment, and peritoneal spaces of the LUQ are key anatomic features in understanding the imaging appearance of acute diseases in this area. Diseases of the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and splenic flexure are encountered in patients with acute LUQ pain. Optimization of the imaging protocol is vital for accurate diagnosis and characterization of these diseases in the acute setting.

### Chronic appendicitis "syndrome" manifested by an appendicolith and thickened appendix presenting as chronic right lower abdominal pain in adults [^112QMjHh]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

In this short report, we describe a small series of adult patients with chronic appendicitis presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The clinical presentation was unusual and atypical for classic appendicitis because of the absence of fever, peritoneal tenderness on focused graded compression of the abdomen, and leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) findings included the presence of an appendicolith and appendiceal thickening, without mesenteric infiltration, abscess, or collection. In this series, the appendicolith appeared to represent a marker rather than an actual cause of appendicitis. Focused CT scans with additional lung and bone windows proved optimal in detecting appendicoliths, which were not visible on the scout localizer scans, despite windowing modifications. Our findings suggest that chronic appendicitis may be a phenomenon unique to adults and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic right lower quadrant pain in patients seen in the emergency room setting. Surgery is curative in such patients, although expectant management is an alternative when tolerated by the patient.

### Evaluating patients with right upper quadrant pain [^117DxLpY]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Many disorders of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree may cause right upper quadrant pain and clinical diagnosis may be challenging. Imaging plays a key role in establishing a prompt diagnosis and guiding appropriate management. Although ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice for most hepatobiliary disorders, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging also play important roles. Acute cholecystitis may be associated with many complications that have characteristic imaging features. MR cholangiopancreatography achieves high accuracy in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and allows for noninvasive imaging when ultrasonography and CT are indeterminate.

### ED endovaginal pelvic ultrasound in nonpregnant women with right lower quadrant pain [^115i5Udz]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

We hypothesized that emergency physician-performed endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) would change diagnostic decision making in nonpregnant women with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain.

Methods

A prospective cohort of female patients was enrolled at an urban emergency department (ED). Inclusion criteria were RLQ pain, hemodynamic stability, and a strong suspicion for appendicitis or right adnexal pathology. Treating physicians were queried regarding pre- and post-ED EVUS probability of disease, differential diagnoses, consultation, and management. Positive findings included large cysts or multitissue densities, tubal dilation, uterine enlargement/mass, and extensive peritoneal fluid.

Results

With a positive ED EVUS, mean physician probability increased for gynecologic (24%) and decreased for both surgical (14%) and medical (20%) disease. With a negative ED EVUS, mean physician probability increased for surgical disease (5.3%) and decreased for gynecologic disease (18.6%).

Conclusion

Emergency department EVUS changes physician diagnostic decision making in nonpregnant women with undifferentiated RLQ pain.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^114cvf3s]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guidelines — abdominal ultrasound can potentially diagnose acalculous cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, liver or kidney abscesses, perforated bowel, ascites, and/or appendicitis as potential sources of fever, and in surgical patients can identify surgical wound abscesses and determine if they are amenable to drainage. Acalculous cholecystitis, an important but often unrecognized cause of fever in critically ill patients, may be suspected with right upper quadrant pain, although this is commonly absent; in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of a febrile episode. However, a lack of data on false-positive and false-negative results in patients without abdominal signs or symptoms precludes a firm recommendation supporting routine diagnostic abdominal ultrasound.
