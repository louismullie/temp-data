## Question

Is furosemide good in wolff Parkinson syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether furosemide is good or useful in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what furosemide does pharmacologically and what its labeled indications are. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of WPW and the evidence-based acute and chronic management principles. Next, I will check whether any guideline or label links furosemide to WPW treatment. After that, I need to consider potential indirect or harmful effects of furosemide in WPW, especially electrolyte shifts and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical recommendation and ensure it aligns with contemporary guidelines and safety data [^112H4hFk].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and indications of furosemide. Furosemide is a loop diuretic indicated for edema associated with heart failure, renal disease, or hepatic disease, and for hypertension; it has no antiarrhythmic properties and no labeled or guideline-supported role in treating arrhythmias, including WPW-related tachyarrhythmias [^115UkLFN] [^116Cjoks] [^115PSErK] [^114uP5Z7].

> Now, I need to review WPW pathophysiology and its management. WPW reflects conduction over an accessory atrioventricular pathway that can bypass the AV node, enabling very rapid ventricular rates during atrial fibrillation and predisposing to ventricular fibrillation; definitive therapy is catheter ablation of the accessory pathway, and acute management hinges on avoiding AV nodal blockers in preexcited AF while using agents that slow conduction over the pathway or proceeding to synchronized cardioversion if unstable [^112H4hFk] [^112JV9TB] [^1113iHA7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify whether any authoritative source lists furosemide for WPW. I will now examine major guidelines and labels: ACC/AHA/HRS SVT/WPW guidance, ESC SVT guidance, and contemporary AF guidelines make no mention of furosemide for WPW; instead, they emphasize ablation, pathway-slowing agents such as procainamide or ibutilide in stable preexcited AF, and urgent cardioversion if unstable, while explicitly contraindicating AV nodal blockers like verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin, beta-blockers, adenosine, and amiodarone in preexcited AF due to risk of accelerating ventricular response or precipitating VF [^112H4hFk] [^112JV9TB] [^1113iHA7] [^116915Yk] [^111P9EUu].

> Wait, let me verify potential indirect harms. Furosemide can cause hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which lower arrhythmic thresholds and can potentiate tachyarrhythmias; in patients with WPW and preexcited AF, electrolyte disturbances may worsen ventricular rates and instability, and diuretic-induced potassium losses are specifically flagged as problematic in patients on antiarrhythmics with QT liability, reinforcing that furosemide does not improve — and may worsen — the arrhythmic milieu in WPW [^1143XwUH] [^112mKpYD] [^116Nj6zN].

> I should double-check whether any niche scenario makes furosemide helpful in WPW. Let me consider common WPW presentations: orthodromic AVRT, antidromic AVRT, and preexcited AF; none of these respond to diuresis or volume shifts, and none of the acute algorithms include furosemide for rate or rhythm control or for ablation support, whereas procainamide, ibutilide, or synchronized cardioversion are the evidence-based options depending on stability and QRS width [^112H4hFk] [^111P9EUu] [^116DiEyD].

> But wait, what if the WPW patient also has heart failure or pulmonary edema — could furosemide then be "good" indirectly by improving hemodynamics? Even in that case, furosemide treats volume overload, not the accessory pathway or arrhythmia mechanism; it neither slows pathway conduction nor prevents preexcited AF, so any benefit would be disease-specific rather than WPW-specific, and the arrhythmia still requires guideline-directed antiarrhythmic or ablative therapy [^115UkLFN] [^116Cjoks] [^112H4hFk].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Furosemide has no role in WPW pathophysiology or evidence-based management, offers no antiarrhythmic benefit, and may contribute to electrolyte shifts that destabilize arrhythmias; definitive WPW care is risk stratification and, when indicated, catheter ablation, with acute preexcited AF managed by avoiding AV nodal blockers and using procainamide or ibutilide if stable, or immediate synchronized cardioversion if unstable [^112H4hFk] [^111P9EUu].

> Final answer: No, furosemide is not good for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; it is not indicated for WPW-related arrhythmias, lacks any guideline support for this use, and may worsen risk via electrolyte disturbances, whereas WPW requires pathway-directed therapy and carefully selected antiarrhythmics or ablation when appropriate [^115UkLFN] [^116Cjoks] [^112H4hFk] [^112JV9TB].

---

Furosemide is **not indicated** for Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and offers **no therapeutic benefit** for WPW-related arrhythmias. It does not affect accessory pathway conduction or prevent tachyarrhythmias, and its use may cause electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) that can **increase arrhythmia risk**. Standard WPW management focuses on **catheter ablation** [^112JV9TB] and antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide or ibutilide [^112H4hFk]; furosemide has no role in this pathway. Use furosemide only for standard indications (edema, hypertension) and monitor electrolytes closely in WPW patients.

---

## Pharmacological properties of furosemide

Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb, causing natriuresis, diuresis, and calciuresis. It is indicated for edema from heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or renal disease, and for hypertension [^115UkLFN]. It has **no direct electrophysiological effects** on cardiac conduction or arrhythmogenesis.

---

## Pathophysiology of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome

WPW is characterized by an accessory atrioventricular pathway that bypasses the AV node, causing pre-excitation and tachyarrhythmias such as AVRT and AF with rapid ventricular response [^113dvy2K]. The key risk is **rapid conduction over the accessory pathway during AF**, which can precipitate VF and sudden death [^114fRnA3].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding furosemide in WPW

There is **no evidence** supporting furosemide for WPW: no studies or guidelines recommend its use for WPW-related arrhythmias. Its pharmacology does not address accessory pathway conduction or arrhythmia prevention.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Furosemide can cause electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) that **increase arrhythmia risk**, particularly in WPW patients with pre-excited AF. It may also cause volume depletion and hypotension, which can worsen hemodynamics during tachyarrhythmias.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC **do not mention furosemide** for WPW management. Recommended therapies include:

- **Catheter ablation**: First-line definitive therapy for symptomatic WPW or high-risk pathways [^112JV9TB] [^1113iHA7].
- **Antiarrhythmic drugs**: Procainamide, ibutilide, or flecainide for acute management of pre-excited AF or AVRT [^112H4hFk] [^111P9EUu].
- **Avoidance of AV nodal blockers**: Verapamil, diltiazem, beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone are contraindicated in pre-excited AF due to risk of accelerating ventricular response [^112H4hFk] [^116915Yk].

---

## Comparison with other diuretics

No diuretics, including loop, thiazide, or potassium-sparing agents, are indicated for WPW. Diuretics do not affect accessory pathway conduction or arrhythmia mechanisms.

---

## Clinical scenarios where furosemide might be considered

Furosemide may be used for **standard indications** (edema, hypertension) in WPW patients, but not for arrhythmia management. If used, monitor electrolytes closely and correct deficiencies to minimize arrhythmia risk.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Furosemide is **not indicated** for WPW and offers no benefit for WPW-related arrhythmias. Its use may increase arrhythmia risk via electrolyte disturbances. Management should focus on ablation and appropriate antiarrhythmics; reserve furosemide for standard indications with close electrolyte monitoring.

### Is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome a genetic disease? [^112ZREQi]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2005). Low credibility.

Family studies, and more recent molecular genetic investigations, indicate that the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and associated preexcitation disorders can have a substantial genetic component. Because preexcitation disorders are sometimes inherited as single gene disorders, key mechanistic insights can be gained that are expected to be relevant also to the more common multifactorial forms of these traits. Potentially, such insights will inform the future management of these conditions. Where WPW is inherited as a familial trait, with or without associated cardiac defects or a systemic syndrome, there are clinical genetic ramifications that are already of practical importance.

### Long term risk of Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and syndrome [^112Tj9wj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation, despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, up-stream EPS and/or ablation) vs. the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.

### Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in the era of catheter ablation: insights from a registry study of 2169 patients [^111hUPXc]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The management of Wolff-Parkinson-White is based on the distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic presentations, but evidence is limited in the asymptomatic population.

Methods and Results

The Wolff-Parkinson-White registry was an 8-year prospective study of either symptomatic or asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White patients referred to our Arrhythmology Department for evaluation or ablation. Inclusion criteria were a baseline electrophysiological testing with or without radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA). Primary end points were the percentage of patients who experienced ventricular fibrillation (VF) or potentially malignant arrhythmias and risk factors. Among 2169 enrolled patients, 1001 (550 asymptomatic) did not undergo RFA (no-RFA group) and 1168 (206 asymptomatic) underwent ablation (RFA group). There were no differences in clinical and electrophysiological characteristics between the 2 groups except for symptoms. In the no-RFA group, VF occurred in 1.5% of patients, virtually exclusively (13 of 15) in children (median age, 11 years), and was associated with a short accessory pathway antegrade refractory period (P < 0.001) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia initiating atrial fibrillation (P < 0.001) but not symptoms. In the RFA group, ablation was successful in 98.5%, and after RFA, no patients developed malignant arrhythmias or VF over the 8-year follow-up. Untreated patients were more likely to experience malignant arrhythmias and VF (log-rank P < 0.001). Time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curves for predicting VF identified an optimal anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway cutoff of 240 milliseconds.

Conclusions

The prognosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome essentially depends on intrinsic electrophysiological properties of AP rather than on symptoms. RFA performed during the same procedure after electrophysiological testing is of benefit in improving the long-term outcomes.

Challenging Existing Knowledge of Wolf‐Parkinson‐White and Brugada Syndrome

This year, 3 articles advanced our understanding of Wolf‐Parkinson‐White and Brugada syndromes, challenging existing knowledge and provoking new thoughts about current paradigms for treatment and management of these diseases.

Practice guidelines for management of Wolf‐Parkinson‐White in children have largely been based on the assumption that risk of sudden death is both predictable and ascertainable. A large retrospective multicenter international study of 912 children with Wolf‐Parkinson‐White provided evidence to suggest that, while risk of sudden death in children remains low, the ability to identify those at highest risk remains difficult. 4 These findings raise questions about future management recommendations and will likely affect the manner by which physicians counsel patients in the future.

Brugada syndrome has classically been considered a primary ion channel disorder. Although small case studies had previously suggested ablation as a curative therapy, multiple studies this year provide further evidence that epicardial ablation may successfully treat ventricular arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome in symptomatic adults. 5 While long‐term follow‐up following ablation is lacking and studies in children have not been performed, these preliminary results provide new insights into this disease. Regardless of whether ablation is found to be a treatment option for children with symptomatic Brugada syndrome, the manner in which we approach this disease and counsel patients regarding long‐term prognosis is likely to change. 6

### Long-term natural history of adult Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome patients treated with and without catheter ablation [^111HqAsp]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There are a paucity of data about the long-term natural history of adult Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) patients in regard to risk of mortality and atrial fibrillation. We sought to describe the long-term outcomes of WPW patients and ascertain the impact of ablation on the natural history.

Methods and Results

Three groups of patients were studied: 2 WPW populations (ablation: 872, no ablation: 1461) and a 1:5 control population (n = 11 175). Long-term mortality and atrial fibrillation rates were determined. The average follow-up for the WPW group was 7.9 ± 5.9 (median: 6.9) years and was similar between the ablation and nonablation groups. Death rates were similar between the WPW group versus the control group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.11; P = 0.56). Nonablated WPW patients had a higher long-term death risk compared with ablated WPW patients (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.50–20.93; P < 0.0001). Incident atrial fibrillation risk was higher in the WPW group compared with the control population (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.87; P < 0.0001). Nonablated WPW patients had lower risk than ablated patients (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.53; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Long-term mortality rates in WPW patients are low and similar to an age-matched and gender-matched control population. WPW patients that underwent the multifactorial process of ablation had a lower mortality compared to nonablated WPW patients. Atrial fibrillation rates are high long-term, and ablation does not reduce this risk.

### Genetic risk stratification: a paradigm shift in prevention of coronary artery disease [^117KZ66u]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Rare Single Gene Disorders

Variations in the DNA sequence that are disease related occur in a continuum from rare to common. However, because of the earlier clinical detection of the phenotypes and detection through pedigrees, we refer to inherited diseases as those that are rare versus those that are common. Rare disorders by definition occur in < 1% of the population and are usually associated with high penetrance. These genes were discovered through a technique referred to as genetic linkage analysis. This requires a pedigree of 2 or 3 generations of several individuals affected with the disease. A DNA marker, detected in those affected with the disease (more often than by chance), indicates it is in close physical proximity to the gene responsible for the disease. The DNA region is then cloned and sequenced to identify the responsible mutation, a process referred to as positional cloning. Using this approach, genes responsible for multiple rare cardiovascular inherited disorders were discovered, including familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The last 2 decades of the 20th century were a golden era for these rare diseases and provided tremendous insight into their pathogenesis and management. It is claimed of the 8,315 rare inherited disorders, a responsible gene has been discovered for > 5,482. Expression of the responsible mutant gene as a transgene in animal models for rare cardiovascular disorders [e.g. familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome] induces the expected human phenotype in the offspring. Thus, these disorders are often referred to as single-gene disorders because the mutant gene is both necessary and sufficient to induce the phenotype.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic pre-excitation systematic review — methods and search strategy state that the Evidence Review Committee (ERC) addressed four questions: "What is the comparative accuracy of invasive EP study (without catheter ablation of the accessory pathway) versus noninvasive testing for predicting arrhythmic events (including SCD) in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation?", "What is the usefulness of invasive EP study (without catheter ablation of the accessory pathway) versus noninvasive testing for predicting arrhythmic events (including SCD) in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation?", "What is the usefulness of invasive EP study (without catheter ablation of the accessory pathway) or noninvasive EP study for predicting arrhythmic events (including SCD) in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation?", and "What are the efficacy and effectiveness of invasive EP study with catheter ablation of the accessory pathway as appropriate versus noninvasive tests with treatment (including observation) or no testing/ablation as appropriate for preventing arrhythmic events (including SCD) and improving outcomes in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation?" This review complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and ACC/AHA Clinical Practice Guideline Methodology Summit Report recommendations, and eligible studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with a search window of all January 1, 1970, through August 31, 2014, using terms "asymptomatic or incidental" and "pre-excitation" or "Wolff-Parkinson-White or WPW" or "delta wave" or "accessory pathway", with bibliographies of previous relevant systematic reviews also searched.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) with preexcitation syndromes — Conduction over an accessory pathway during AF can cause dangerously rapid ventricular responses and, in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, may degenerate to ventricular fibrillation with risk of death; intravenous digitalis, verapamil, or diltiazem do not block the accessory pathway and may accelerate ventricular rate, and "these agents are contraindicated in this situation", while "caution should be exercised" with beta blockers in AF associated with preexcitation.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113NUFnW]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and antidysrhythmic type IV indicated for management of narrow complex tachycardias. Pharmacologic actions include inhibition of extracellular calcium ion influx across myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, reducing cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contraction and dilating main coronary and systemic arteries; it has no effect on serum calcium concentrations and exerts substantial inhibitory effects on the cardiac conduction system acting principally at the AV node, with some effects at the sinus node. Contraindications include documented hypersensitivity, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome, symptomatic severe hypotension (systolic BP less than 90 mmHg), sick sinus syndrome (if no pacemaker), second- and third-degree heart block (if no pacemaker present), and complete heart block; for IV administration, contraindications include use in newborns (because of benzyl alcohol), concomitant beta-blocker therapy, cardiogenic shock, and ventricular tachycardia (must determine whether origin is supraventricular or ventricular).

### Prophylactic radiofrequency ablation in asymptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White is not yet a good strategy: a decision analysis [^111hsVPU]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic management of asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern is controversial. We compared the risk:benefit ratios between prophylactic radiofrequency ablation and no treatment in asymptomatic patients with WPW.

Methods and Results

Decision analysis software was used to construct a risk-benefit decision tree. The target population consisted of 20- to 40-year-old asymptomatic patients with WPW without structural fatal heart disease or a family history of sudden cardiac death. Baseline estimates of sudden death and radiofrequency ablation complication rates were obtained from the literature, an empirical data survey, and expert opinion. The outcome measure was death within 10 years. Sensitivity analyses determined the variables that significantly impacted the decision to ablate or not. Threshold analyses evaluated the effects of key variables and the optimum policy. At baseline, the decision to ablate resulted in a reduction of mortality risk of 8.8 patients for 1000 patients compared with abstention. It is necessary to treat 112 asymptomatic patients with WPW to save one life over 10 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that 3 variables significantly impacted the decision to ablate: (1) complication of radiofrequency ablation, (2) success of radiofrequency ablation, and (3) sudden death in asymptomatic patients with WPW.

Conclusions

This study provides a decision aid for treating asymptomatic patients with the WPW ECG pattern. Using the model and the population we tested, prophylactic catheter ablation is not yet ready for widespread clinical use.

### Practice variation in the evaluation and management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern among competitive athletes [^111V31do]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Both the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2024 Heart Rhythm Society clinical practice recommendations for athletes were created in collaboration between sports cardiologists and EPs and acknowledge that age should be a consideration for shared decision-making in the risks and benefits of noninvasive (ETT) vs invasive (EPS with or without catheter ablation) diagnostic risk stratification and management of athletes with WPW pattern. This guidance stems from studies which have demonstrated that children have been shown to have a higher risk of arrhythmic events from WPW, which may explain appropriate differences between adult and pediatric providers in the current study regarding the likelihood of referring for invasive EPS and of pursuing ablation in the setting of a "low-risk" pathway by EPS.

Limitations of our study include self-reported data regarding respondents' clinical practice and expertise as well as the use of specific clinical case scenarios that could not fully encompass the heterogeneity of patient presentations and clinical decision-making. We also could not explore all areas of clinical uncertainty and practice variation (ie, clinicians' approach to intermittent pre-excitation). Despite these limitations, these data illustrate significant practice variation in this challenging clinical area and highlight areas in which the sports cardiology and EP communities can work collaboratively to refine best practices and optimize patient care.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114t35rU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. 1, 2, 3, 4 Although previous studies have reported a decreased incidence of AF after successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), 5, 6 paroxysmal AF frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 Our recent study found that the presence of advanced interatrial block (IAB) and age > 50 years were associated with a higher risk of AF recurrence after AP ablation in WPW patients. 10 For patients at high risk of AF recurrence, additional preventive interventions are required. Currently, pulmonary vein intervention (PVI) is a widely accepted treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal AF. 11 However, it is unknown whether additional PVI after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome, especially in patients at high risk of AF recurrence. Thus, the purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy of additional PVI after AP ablation in preventing AF recurrence in all patients with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF, and in patients at high risk of AF recurrence, identified by advanced IAB or age > 50 years.

### Clinical profile and management of wolf-parkinson white syndrome and asymptomatic pre-excitation carriers in Africa: a multicenter pan African registry from 17 countries [^116ZxthC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

Data are scarce regarding Wolf-Parkinson White Syndrome (WPW) syndrome and asymptomatic pre-excitation in Africa. This study tried to understand the current approaches utilized in Africa for the diagnosis and management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation.

Methods

The current prospective study was conducted in 20 centers located in 17 countries spanning all areas of Africa. Participants included had ventricular pre-excitation patterns. The data collected included symptoms, locations of accessory pathways (AP) and tachyarrhythmia, risk stratification, as well as acute and long-term management. In addition, we assessed the clinical effectiveness of the centers and the impact of socioeconomic and health metrics on these treatment approaches.

Results

Among 541 participants, 93% were diagnosed with WPW syndrome, with orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) being the most prevalent arrhythmia, affecting 55% of the cases. Approximately 30% of patients in Africa, except for the southern region, received intravenous amiodarone as the first-choice drug for orthodromic AVRT while adenosine was the drug of choice in the Southern region. Electrical cardioversion was the first-line treatment for pre-excited atrial fibrillation and antidromic AVRT across all of Africa. Radiofrequency ablation (RF) was the first long-term therapy option for 88% of patients in all African regions, unlike western and central Africa where it was implemented for less than 30% of patients (p < 0.001). The rates of RF success, long-term recurrence, and complications were 93%, 4.1%, and 3.8%, respectively.

Conclusion

There are significant variations between African regions in terms of diagnostic workup, accessory pathway localizations, and volume of invasive treatment. Countries in Northern and Southern Africa are more advanced than other African countries in terms of modern management strategy. Additional government investments are necessary to enhance diagnostic likelihood and curative treatments as well as to reduce the gap between different regions in Africa.

### Atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: ECG recognition and treatment in the ED [^116DiEyD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.3% of the population, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a condition where atrial impulses bypass the atrioventricular node and activate the ventricular myocardium directly via an accessory pathway. Clinical clues to the diagnosis include a young patient with previous episodes of palpitations, rapid heart rate, or syncope. Although several different rhythm presentations are possible, atrial fibrillation is a not infrequent dysrhythmia seen in the WPW patient. Electrocardiographic features suggestive of WPW atrial fibrillation include irregularity of the rhythm; a very rapid ventricular response; presence of a delta wave; and a wide, bizarre QRS complex. Stable patients suspected of having this condition should not receive agents that predominantly block atrioventricular conduction, but they may be treated with procainamide or ibutilide. If instability is present, electrical cardioversion is required.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115YJHzp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates atrial fibrillation (AF) in some of patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, in other patients it can recur.

Hypothesis

Whether adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome is unknown.

Methods

We retrospectively studied 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14 years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation, namely 103 (64.4%) undergoing only AP ablation (AP group) and 57 (35.6%) undergoing AP ablation plus PVI (AP + PVI group). Advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P‐wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads, using 12‐lead electrocardiography (ECG).

Results

During the mean follow‐up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3‐36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not differ in patients in the AP + PVI group and AP group (15.5% vs 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that PVI was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26‐1.68; p = 0.380). In WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was lower in patients in the AP + PVI group vs the AP group (90% vs 33.3%, respectively; p = 0.032).

Conclusions

PVI after successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening of a resting 12‐lead ECG immediately after AP ablation helps identify patients in whom PVI is beneficial.

### Digoxin [^1124bVbR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome)

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.

5.2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block

Digoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

### Usefulness of invasive electrophysiologic testing to stratify the risk of arrhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern: results from a large prospective long-term follow-up study [^112biPXb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess in a large cohort of asymptomatic subjects with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern the usefulness of invasive electrophysiologic testing (EPT) in predicting the occurrence of arrhythmic events over a five-year follow-up.

Background

Sudden death may be the first clinical manifestation of the WPW syndrome in previously asymptomatic patients. Serial EPTs have been proposed to identify patients at risk.

Methods

A total of 212 consecutive asymptomatic WPW patients were enrolled after a baseline EPT; patients were followed for five years, and 162 patients (115 noninducible and 47 inducible) patients underwent a second EPT.

Results

After a mean follow-up of 37.7 months, 33 patients became symptomatic. Of the 115 noninducible patients, 18.2% lost anterograde accessory pathway (AP) conduction, 30% retrograde AP conduction, and only 4 (3.4%) developed symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Of the 47 inducible patients, 25 with sustained atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) and atrial fibrillation (AF), and 4 with nonsustained AVRT and AF became symptomatic for SVT (n = 21) and AF (n = 8). They were younger, had shorter AP anterograde refractory periods, and multiple APs compared to patients who remained asymptomatic (for all comparisons, p < 0.0001). Of the eight patients with symptomatic episodes of AF and inducible sustained AF, two had a resuscitated cardiac arrest and one died suddenly; all three patients were inducible for AVRT and AF and had multiple APs.

Conclusions

In asymptomatic WPW subjects, EPT may be a valuable tool to stratify the risk of symptomatic and fatal arrhythmic events.

### Adenosine injection, solution (Adenosine) [^112M9cCt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trial Results

In controlled studies in the United States, bolus doses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg were studied. A cumulative 60% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia had converted to normal sinus rhythm within one minute after an intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg adenosine injection (some converted on 3 mg and failures were given 6 mg), and a cumulative 92% converted after a bolus dose of 12 mg. Seven to sixteen percent of patients converted after 1 to 4 placebo bolus injections. Similar responses were seen in a variety of patient subsets, including those using or not using digoxin, those with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, males, females, blacks, Caucasians, and Hispanics.

Adenosine is not effective in converting rhythms other than PSVT, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia, to normal sinus rhythm.

### Occurrence of intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during intravenous sedation [^1136LByR]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, defined as intermittent loss of the delta waves, can show occasional conduction through the accessory pathway. WPW syndrome often causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. However, it may be difficult to identify the abnormalities preoperatively because of their only intermittent occurrence. We report a case in which exogenously administered epinephrine and an autonomic imbalance may have precipitated the abrupt occurrence and disappearance of the delta waves.

Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) and preexcitation — epidemiology and risk features: "WPW and preexcitation syndromes refer to the presence of extra-atrio-ventricular nodal connection(s) between atrium and ventricle; such APs are comprised of atrial tissue". "AF occurs in approximately 15% of persons with WPW", and rapid preexcited AF is facilitated by "short antegrade pathway refractory period (< 250 ms), which allows rapid conduction and predisposes to VF and sudden death". In young persons without comorbid conditions, "pathway ablation is definitive therapy for AF and SVT", and for those who cannot undergo ablation, "preventive pharmacological therapy is directed to slowing pathway conduction".

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115gQTAx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Nifekalant, initially named MS‐551 in Japan, is a pure class 3 antiarrhythmic drug that is highly selective for blocking the rapid component of the delayed‐rectifier potassium currents without affecting the inward sodium and calcium currents or β‐adrenergic activity. 15, 16 Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular and atrial myocytes, exerts antiarrhythmic effects, 16 and decreases the defibrillation threshold. 17 Increasing clinical data indicate that nifekalant is an effective and safe drug in treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias, especially in the patients with ILVF. 18, 19, 20, 21 Nifekalant is also recommended by the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. 22, 23 More recently, nifekalant has been used in treatment of atrial arrhythmia and cardioversion of AF and atrial flutter. 24, 25 However, the potential utility of nifekalant in the treatment of preexcited AF has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF.

Manifest and concealed accessory pathways — prevalence, arrhythmia mechanisms, and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome risk are described as follows: Manifest pathways occur in 0.1% to 0.3% of the population and may conduct in both the anterograde and retrograde directions, whereas concealed pathways conduct only in the retrograde direction and therefore do not cause pre-excitation on the standard 12-lead ECG; in patients with a manifest accessory pathway, orthodromic AVRT accounts for approximately 90% to 95% of AVRT episodes, while pre-excited AVRT (including antidromic AVRT) accounts for 5%; PJRT features deeply inverted retrograde P waves in leads II, III, and aVF, with a long RP interval; in WPW, rapid anterograde accessory pathway conduction during AF can result in SCD with a 10-year risk ranging from 0.15% to 0.24%, and increased SCD risk is associated with a shortest pre-excited R-R interval of < 250 ms during AF, with the risk appearing highest in the first 2 decades of life.

In patients with reduced creatinine clearance (40 to 60 mL/min) the same doses were given once daily. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: QT > 450 msec; creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min; intolerance to beta-blockers; bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome in the absence of an implanted pacemaker; AFIB/AFL was asymptomatic or was associated with syncope, embolic CVA or TIA; acute myocardial infarction within the previous 2 months; congestive heart failure; bronchial asthma or other contraindications to beta-blocker therapy; receiving potassium-losing diuretics without potassium replacement or without concurrent use of ACE-inhibitors; uncorrected hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 MEq/L) or hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium < 1.5 MEq/L); received chronic oral amiodarone therapy for > 1 month within previous 12 weeks; congenital or acquired long QT syndromes; history of Torsade de Pointes with other antiarrhythmic agents, which increase the duration of ventricular repolarization; sinus rate < 50 bpm during waking hours; unstable angina pectoris; receiving treatment with other drugs that prolong the QT interval; and AFIB/AFL associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. If the QT interval increased to ≥ 520 msec (or JT ≥ 430 msec if QRS > 100 msec) the drug was discontinued. The patient population in this trial was 64% male, and the mean age was 62 years. No structural heart disease was present in 43% of the patients. Doses were administered once daily in 20% of the patients because of reduced creatinine clearance.

Early transfer to the appropriate, medically capable facility, or urgent cardiology and/or electrophysiology consultation, is also key.

This illustration outlines a contemporary algorithm that guides considerations to both diagnostic testing and therapeutic interventions in those presenting with electrical storm. Even in the absence of ST elevations on initial ECG, interventions like coronary angiogram and/or other recommended interventions in our illustration would be reasonable in those with persistent/advanced electrical storm. *Definitive use of or timing of implementing the suggested intervention may vary upon context. ¥ Nuclear imaging with PYP may not be available to rule out amyloidosis.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111qxFCc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF), also known as preexcited AF, typically presents with a rapid ventricular response rate and wide QRS complexes. The fast conduction of atrial high‐frequency impulses occurs preferentially via the accessory pathway (AP), which has a shorter refractory period than the atrioventricular node (AVN). Consequently, patients are at a higher risk of hemodynamic instability, spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), and cardiac arrest. 1, 2, 3 Patients with preexcited AF who present with hemodynamic instability typically undergo prompt electrical cardioversion. Those with stable hemodynamics are commonly treated with infusion of an antiarrhythmic drug to decrease the preexcited ventricular rate and prevent hemodynamic instability. The 2017 European Heart Rhythm Association Consensus 4 recommends procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, or ibutilide, whereas the 2014 American Heart Association Guidelines recommend 5 procainamide or ibutilide for intravenous use to acutely slow ventricular rate of preexcited AF. The above 4 agents, however, are not recommended for the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and impaired left ventricular function (ILVF). 6, 7, 8, 9 Intravenous amiodarone, a multichannel blocker, was widely used in the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and ILVF. 10 However, the recent reports of accelerated preexcited ventricular responses and VF during amiodarone infusion have raised concerns about its utility. 11, 12, 13, 14 Therefore, intravenous amiodarone is no longer considered the preferred drug of choice for treatment of preexcited AF. 4, 5 Thus, there is a need for a new agent for treatment of preexcited AF, particularly in patients with ILVF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic pre-excitation — epidemiology and prior guideline positions note that electrocardiographic pre-excitation affects about 0.1% to 0.3% of the general population, and patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have a risk of sudden cardiac death that may approach 4% over a lifetime; in asymptomatic pre-excitation, the first arrhythmic event may lead to sudden cardiac death. The 2003 ACC/AHA/ESC guideline designated "no treatment" as a Class I recommendation and catheter ablation as a Class IIa recommendation in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation, citing that the positive predictive value of the electrophysiological study is too low to justify routine use in asymptomatic patients and that potential benefit must be balanced against the approximately 2% risk of a major complication associated with catheter ablation.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in congenital heart disease — management: Tachycardia symptoms may begin in childhood but become increasingly problematic in adult years, when atrial dilation or surgical scars predispose the patient to atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation with potential for rapid conduction over an accessory pathway. An attempt at definitive therapy with catheter ablation has become the standard of care for these patients, but compared with simple accessory pathway ablation in a structurally normal heart, the acute success rates are reported to be lower and the risk of recurrence higher in patients with anatomic defects. Intraoperative accessory pathway ablation can be considered in the patient with Ebstein's anomaly referred for operative intervention for tricuspid valve disease, and this approach has been demonstrated to be safe and effective.

The entire process of EP studies in preexcited AF was recorded and analyzed. Consecutive R‐R intervals for 1 minute were measured before and 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes from onset of infusion. In addition, the R‐R interval was recorded and analyzed 1 minute before termination of AF. The EP parameters included the SPRR, average preexcited R‐R interval (APRR), average R‐R interval (ARR), the ratio of preexcited QRS complexes to total ventricular complexes (percentage preexcitation, PP). Clinical outcomes included heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). The EP parameters and clinical outcomes were compared during AF at the baseline before the drug infusion (baseline state) and after nifekalant infusion (at infusion time of 7‐10 minutes, or 1 minute before termination of AF whenever cardioversion occurred before 7 minutes). AF cardioversion, acceleration of preexcited ventricular responses, deterioration to syncope/cardiac arrest, and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) were also investigated.

Conventional catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias is associated with the potential adverse effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on both patients and laboratory personnel. Due to the greater radiation sensitivity and the longer life expectancy of children, reduction of radiation exposure for them is of particular importance. A novel technique for zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation is described using real-time tissue-tip contact force measurements for a 10-year-old boy who had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a left-sided accessory pathway.

Atrial fibrillation — causes and associated conditions include reversible triggers, AF without demonstrable heart disease, and metabolic contributors. AF may be related to acute, temporary causes such as alcohol intake, surgery, electrocution, myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary diseases, hyperthyroidism, and other metabolic disorders, and successful treatment of the underlying condition often eliminates AF. AF that develops in the setting of acute MI portends an adverse prognosis compared with preinfarction AF or sinus rhythm, and AF may be associated with atrial flutter, the Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, where treatment of the primary arrhythmias reduces or eliminates recurrent AF; AF is a common early postoperative complication of cardiac or thoracic surgery. AF is often an electrical manifestation of underlying cardiac disease, yet approximately 30% to 45% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20% to 25% of cases of persistent AF occur in younger patients without demonstrable underlying disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for development of AF, and after adjustment the excess risk appears mediated by left atrial dilation, with a graded increase in left atrial size as body mass index increases from normal to the overweight and obese categories.

Prolongation of Time to Recurrence of Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

Sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) has been studied in patients with symptomatic AFIB/AFL in two principal studies, one in patients with primarily paroxysmal AFIB/AFL, the other in patients with primarily chronic AFIB.

In one study, a U.S. multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response trial of patients with symptomatic primarily paroxysmal AFIB/AFL, three fixed dose levels of sotalol hydrochloride tablets (AF) (80 mg, 120 mg and 160 mg) twice daily and placebo were compared in 253 patients. In patients with reduced creatinine clearance (40 to 60 mL/min) the same doses were given once daily. Patients were not randomized for the following reasons: QT > 450 msec; creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min; intolerance to beta-blockers; bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome in the absence of an implanted pacemaker; AFIB/AFL was asymptomatic or was associated with syncope, embolic CVA or TIA; acute myocardial infarction within the previous 2 months; congestive heart failure; bronchial asthma or other contraindications to beta-blocker therapy; receiving potassium losing diuretics without potassium replacement or without concurrent use of ACE-inhibitors; uncorrected hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 meq/L) or hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium < 1.5 meq/L); received chronic oral amiodarone therapy for > 1 month within previous 12 weeks; congenital or acquired long QT syndromes; history of torsade de pointes with other antiarrhythmic agents which increase the duration of ventricular repolarization; sinus rate < 50 bpm during waking hours; unstable angina pectoris; receiving treatment with other drugs that prolong the QT interval; and AFIB/AFL associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. If the QT interval increased to ≥ 520 msec (or JT ≥ 430 msec if QRS > 100 msec) the drug was discontinued. The patient population in this trial was 64% male, and the mean age was 62 years. No structural heart disease was present in 43% of the patients. Doses were administered once daily in 20% of the patients because of reduced creatinine clearance.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) preexcitation syndromes with atrial fibrillation — treatment recommendations are: Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended in symptomatic patients with AF who have WPW syndrome, particularly those with syncope due to rapid heart rate or those with a short bypass tract refractory period (Level of Evidence: B). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended to prevent ventricular fibrillation in patients with a short anterograde bypass tract refractory period in whom AF occurs with a rapid ventricular response associated with hemodynamic instability (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is recommended to restore sinus rhythm in patients with WPW in whom AF occurs without hemodynamic instability in association with a wide QRS complex on the ECG (greater than or equal to 120-ms duration) or with a rapid preexcited ventricular response (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous flecainide or direct-current cardioversion is reasonable when very rapid ventricular rates occur in patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). It may be reasonable to administer intravenous quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ibutilide, or amiodarone to hemodynamically stable patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous administration of digitalis glycosides or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists is not recommended in patients with WPW syndrome who have preexcited ventricular activation during AF (Level of Evidence: B).

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AenWH]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. 1, 2, 3, 4 Previous studies have reported a decreased incidence in AF after successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), 5, 6 indicating that the AP itself may play an important role in the initiation of AF. However, paroxysmal AF still frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 The identification of patients at high risk for recurrence of AF is of clinical importance because additional therapeutic strategies are needed for these patients.

Interatrial block (IAB) denotes a conduction delay between the right and left atria that manifests in a 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as a P‐wave duration of > 120 ms. 10, 11 A prolonged P‐wave with biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads represents an even higher degree of IAB and has been referred to as advanced IAB. 10 The appearance of advanced IAB is frequently associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias, and has been found to predict AF in multiple clinical scenarios. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 However, the role of advanced IAB in predicting the recurrence of AF after AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome is unclear. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the clinical utility of advanced IAB for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

### Tachydysrhythmia treatment and adverse events in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^11446VVe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend avoiding atrioventricular-nodal blocking agents (AVNB) when treating tachydysrhythmias in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) patients.

Study Objectives

We investigated medications selected and resulting outcomes for patients with tachydysrhythmias and WPW.

Methods

In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we searched a hospital-wide database for the following inclusion criteria: WPW, tachycardia, and intravenous antidysrhythmics. The composite outcome of adverse events was acceleration of tachycardia, new hypotension, new malignant dysrhythmia, and cardioversion. The difference in binomial proportions of patients meeting the composite outcome after AVNB or non-AVNB (NAVNB) treatment was calculated after dividing the groups by QRS duration. A random-effects mixed linear analysis was performed to analyze the vital sign response.

Results

The initial database search yielded 1158 patient visits, with 60 meeting inclusion criteria. Patients' median age was 52.5 years; 53% were male, 43% presented in wide complex tachycardia (WCT), with 75% in atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter. AVNBs were administered in 42 (70%) patient visits. For those patients with WCT in AF, the difference in proportions of patients meeting the composite outcome after AVNBs vs. NAVNBs treatment was an increase of 3% (95% confidence interval [CI] -39%-49%), and for those with narrow complex AF it was a decrease of 13% (95% CI -37%-81%). No instances of malignant dysrhythmia occurred. Mixed linear analysis showed no statistically significant effects on heart rate, though suggested a trend toward increasing heart rate after AVNB in wide complex AF.

Conclusion

In this sample of WPW-associated tachydysrhythmia patients, many were treated with AVNBs. The composite outcome was similarly met after use of either AVNB or NAVNB, and no malignant dysrhythmias were observed.

In Milstein et al., 43 accessory pathways in 42 asymptomatic pts were identified, sustained AVRT could be induced in only 1 pt, and during follow-up 1 pt died of metastatic carcinoma after 43 mo and 1 pt died suddenly before EP study, with all other pts remaining asymptomatic. In Pappone et al., 129/209 (62%) remained asymptomatic at the end of f/u, whereas 33 (16%) developed arrhythmic events (SVT in 25, AF in 8), including documented VF in 3/209 and sudden death in 1/209, over 37.7 ± 16.1 mo (range 14 to 60 mo) of follow-up. In Satoh et al. AVRT was induced in 6/34 (18%) and sustained AF in 2/34 (6%) in asymptomatic pts, with mean follow-up 15 mo (range 2 to 47 mo). In Santinelli et al., anterograde ERP of accessory pathway ≤ 250 ms was present in 39/293 (13%), multiple accessory pathways were found in 13 (4%), and inducible arrhythmia was found in 47 (16%); clinically, 262/293 (89%) did not experience arrhythmic events while 31/293 (11%) had an arrhythmic event, which was potentially life threatening in 17 of them, with median follow-up 67 mo (range 8 to 90).

Effects of Nifekalant on AVN Conduction in Patients With AF and No AP

Electrophysiological effects of nifekalant on AVN conduction in patients with AF but no AP were determined. Nifekalant infusion terminated AF in 33 of 87 (38%) patients. Fifty‐four of 87 (62%) patients continued to have AF after 30 minutes of nifekalant treatment. The mean age of this group without AF termination was 58 ± 13 years (range 18‐74 years), and 32 were male. Twenty of 54 patients (37%) had structural heart diseases and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (37 ± 5%). The ventricular rate was 97 ± 17, 97 ± 16, 99 ± 18, 101 ± 20, 103 ± 22, 104 ± 24, 102 ± 21, 96 ± 19, and 95 ± 15 beats/min at baseline and after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes of infusion, respectively. Nifekalant did not significantly decrease the mean ventricular rate of AF in the absence of an AP (97 ± 17 versus 95 ± 15 beats/min, n = 54, P = 0.22). A trend toward an increased ventricular rate was noted at infusion time 0 to 10 minutes, and a trend toward a decrease at 10 to 30 minutes of the infusion period. In addition, the mean SBP in patients with AF but no AP did not change with nifekalant infusion (106 ± 16 versus 109 ± 17 mm Hg, n = 54, P = 0.30). No TdP occurred in these patients during nifekalant infusion.

### Atrial flutter with 1: 1 conduction in undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1126rGuj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction via an accessory pathway is an uncommon presentation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome not previously reported in the emergency medicine literature. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a form of ventricular preexcitation sometimes initially seen and diagnosed in the emergency department (ED), can present with varied tachydysrhythmias for which certain treatments are contraindicated. For instance, atrial fibrillation with preexcited conduction needs specific consideration of medication choice to avoid potential degeneration into ventricular fibrillation.

Case Report

We describe an adult female presenting with a very rapid, regular wide complex tachycardia successfully cardioverted in the ED followed by a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). Electrophysiology study confirmed atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction and revealed an accessory pathway consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, despite lack of ECG findings of preexcitation during sinus rhythm. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Ventricular tachycardia must be the first consideration in patients with regular wide complex tachycardia. However, clinicians should consider atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction related to an accessory pathway when treating patients with the triad of very rapid rate (> 250 beats/min), wide QRS complex, and regular rhythm, especially when considering pharmacologic treatment. Emergency physicians also should be aware of electrocardiographically concealed accessory pathways, and that lack of delta waves does not rule out preexcitation syndromes such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Dissection of RCA into pyramidal space exposes the site of accessory pathway.

Central Message

This article describes, in detail, the techniques of surgical ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Surgery is now rarely performed for this indication but may be necessary in refractory cases.

First performed by Sealy in 1968, surgical ablation of an accessory pathway was the gold standard for curative treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). However, in the early 1990s, the safety and efficacy of catheter radiofrequency ablation replaced the surgical procedure. In most patients, catheter ablation will provide a cure for WPW; however, in select, refractory cases there is still a role for surgical intervention. Here we present a case and the technical details for the surgical correction of WPW. Consent was obtained from the patient to publish the images and the data (IRB approval No. HM13607; July 29, 2013).

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular history — Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a congenital electrical function abnormality characterized by an accessory conductive pathway between the atria and the ventricles that causes earlier-than-anticipated ventricular activation, with characteristic electrocardiographic findings of a short PR interval and a wide QRS complex with a delta wave.

### Broad complex atrial fibrillation [^111kFhwk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The management of broad complex atrial fibrillation is complex and may be a source of morbidity and mortality if not correctly recognized and treated appropriately. We present a case series of 3 patients who were managed in our emergency department after complaints of palpitations. They presented with varying forms of rapid atrial fibrillation that had broad complexes on the 12-lead electrocardiogram. The first 2 patients were treated with calcium channel blockers for rate control, and treatment was complicated by rapid arrhythmia that required cardioversion. The final patient was correctly treated with intravenous procainamide. The diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was eventually made in all these patients. Broad complex atrial fibrillation must be treated with respect. Cases with rapid ventricular rate can decompensate from mismanagement due to poor ability to recognize the possibility of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in such patients. Procainamide forms the cornerstone of treatment in hemodynamically stable rapid broad complex atrial fibrillation of unknown origin.

### There is No reason to adopt ECG s and abandon American Heart Association / American college of cardiology history and physical screening for detection of cardiovascular disease in the young [^114JRVcQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

These primary care authors 1 not surprisingly demonstrated the capability of 12‐lead ECGs for identifying Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (preexcitation pattern) and possibly the long‐QT syndrome. Nevertheless, ECGs alone were responsible for these primary diagnoses in only 2 of the 5003 students screened, or < 0.1%, and remarkably the long‐QT syndrome and Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome represent 80% of the 16 students considered to have important cardiac disorders.

However, as cardiologists examining these data, we would underscore that asymptomatic Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome or long‐QT syndrome alone are not of sufficient clinical magnitude to solely justify the resources and energy necessary to sustain mandated ECG screening for all high school athletes in the United States. 12 Also, notably, a recent Mayo Clinic study reported that long‐QT syndrome was a virtually nonexistent cause of SD in young athletes and does not require disqualification from competitive sports. 13

It should be underscored that AHA/American College of Cardiology expert panels, composed of cardiovascular specialists, have consistently rejected the notion of mandated broad‐based universal (including national) screening that relies on the 12‐lead ECG, 5, 6, 7 given the many limitations, which include the following: unacceptable numbers of false positives that overwhelm the screening system with expensive downstream noninvasive testing; false negatives that defeat the very reason for such screening initiatives; logistical challenges in reliably interpreting ECGs in large populations (eg, for QT‐interval duration); overall cost burden; and, finally, the failure to demonstrate that ECG screening reduces cardiovascular mortality 7, 14 (Figure 1).

Williams et al 1 selectively used diagnostic echocardiography in only 22% of study participants, and the selection criteria for this testing are unclear. Consequently, the authors may well have underestimated the number of students in their population with structural heart disease (eg, HCM). Knowledge of the false‐negative ECG rate is critical to the merit of any ambitious screening initiative. Indeed, we have previously shown in a cohort of competitive athletes studied with echocardiography that the 12‐lead ECG was associated with a 10% false‐negative diagnostic rate for HCM that left a significant number of patients undiagnosed by the ECG alone. 15

### Propranolol hydrochloride (Propranolol) [^112ikv8L]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta-blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, some have been shown to be highly beneficial when used with close follow-up in patients with a history of failure who are well compensated and are receiving additional therapies, including diuretics as needed. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.

Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g. Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema)

In general, patients with bronchospastic lung disease should not receive beta-blockers.

Propranolol should be administered with caution in this setting since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous and exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta receptors.

Major Surgery

The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-blocking therapy prior to major surgery is controversial. It should be noted, however, that the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli in propranolol-treated patients might augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

Propranolol is a competitive inhibitor of beta-receptor agonists, and its effects can be reversed by administration of such agents, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension.

Diabetes and Hypoglycemia

Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of certain premonitory signs and symptoms (pulse rate and pressure changes) of acute hypoglycemia, especially in labile insulin-dependent diabetes. In these patients, it may be more difficult to adjust the dosage of insulin.

Propranolol therapy, particularly in infants and children, diabetic or not, has been associated with hypoglycemia especially during fasting, as in preparation for surgery. Hypoglycemia has been reported after prolonged physical exertion and in patients with renal insufficiency.

Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs of hyperthyroidism. Therefore, abrupt withdrawal of propranolol may be followed by an exacerbation of symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including thyroid storm. Propranolol may change thyroid-function tests, increasing T4and reverse T3and decreasing T3.

Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome

Beta-adrenergic blockade in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and tachycardia has been associated with severe bradycardia requiring treatment with a pacemaker. In one case this resulted after an initial 5 mg dose of intravenous propranolol.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^116m8Stz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Special concerns regarding specific arrhythmias — sex differences and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW): WPW syndrome and orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia are more common in men than in women, and in patients with WPW syndrome manifest pathways are more common in men, whereas antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia is more common in women than in men. Atrial fibrillation (AF) degenerating to ventricular fibrillation (VF) is more common in men than in women. For symptomatic WPW syndrome, the treatment of choice is radiofrequency (RF) ablation and the outcomes are similar in both sexes; during pregnancy, management may require initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs to block the accessory pathway and, in some, long-term monitoring. The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) at any age is greater in men than in women. Classic predictors such as obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) more in men, whereas for women, hyperglycemia, elevated hematocrit, and decreased vital capacity are more important predictors; the impact of diabetes is seen in both sexes but is much more pronounced in women. While nonsustained VT (NSVT) and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) have been associated with increased risk of sudden death in men with or without CHD, no such association has been seen in women; similarly, PVCs post–myocardial infarction (post-MI) in men have been associated with increased mortality, which does not hold true for women.

### Advanced management of electrical storm: beyond antiarrhythmics [^115Cnez6]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In the absence of any structural abnormalities, channelopathies are to be considered and ECGs and telemetry are to be reviewed carefully for long QT, Wolff-Parkinson-White or Brugada syndrome. For torsades de pointes secondary to long QT syndrome, administration of magnesium intravenously as well as tachypacing to acutely shorten the QT interval is the first step. For pre-excited atrial fibrillation in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, administration of procainamide intravenously, and/or emergent cardioversion, is recommended. Finally, for electrical storm secondary to Brugada syndrome, it is important to note that conventional therapy with amiodarone, procainamide, lidocaine and beta blockers may exacerbate the refractory VA, and acute management is best achieved with isoproterenol initially followed by maintenance therapy with quinidine once electrical stability is achieved.

Non-pharmacological and novel therapies for electrical storm

Beyond initial pharmacological interventions, managing sustained VAs requires a comprehensive approach targeting the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate. In review of the more contemporary methods used to manage advanced cases of electrical storm, there are several therapies that are targeted towards eradicating the anatomical nidus for the refractory VA. However, such therapies require haemodynamic stability prior to any of the following interventions.

Ventricular ablation is a catheter-based procedure to specifically isolate or eliminate the arrhythmogenic tissue responsible for the electrical storm. However, success rates vary significantly, ranging from 50% to 90%, depending on the heart structure and the complexity of the arrhythmia. The stellate ganglion block involves injecting local anaesthetic around the ganglion, typically at the C6/C7 level of the cervical spine to reduce sympathetic nervous system activation. Clinical evidence from multiple studies has shown that the stellate ganglion block significantly reduces arrhythmias in the first 24 hours following treatment, with minimal complications reported. Finally, cardiac sympathetic denervation is a surgical procedure that disrupts the sympathetic nerve fibres supplying the heart for which research demonstrated that 60% of patients were free of VA at 1 year, with 55% maintaining this benefit for 4 years. Complications of each intervention are specific to clinical expertise, the methods used to intervene and the anatomic structures involved. As such, careful consideration must be taken to determine the best intervention for each patient.

### Management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern by pediatric electrophysiologists [^114JrgTE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the present-day approach of pediatric cardiac electrophysiologists to asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern and to contrast to both published consensus statements and a similar survey.

Study Design

A questionnaire was sent to 266 Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society physician members in 25 countries; 21 questions from the 2003 survey were repeated, with new questions added regarding risk stratification and decision making.

Results

We received 113 responses from 13 countries, with responders having extensive electrophysiology experience (median 15 years [IQR 8.5–25 years]). Only 12 (11%) believed that intermittent pre-excitation and 37 (33%) that sudden loss of pre-excitation on exercise test were sufficient evidence of accessory pathway safety to avoid an invasive electrophysiology study. Optimal weight for electrophysiology study was 20 kg (IQR 18–22.5 kg), and 61% and 58% would then ablate all right-sided or left-sided accessory pathways, respectively, regardless of electrophysiological properties, whereas only 23% would ablate all septal accessory pathways (P < .001). Compared with 2003, respondents were more likely to consider inducible arrhythmia (77% vs 26%, P < .001) as sufficient indication alone for ablation.

Conclusions

In the context of recent literature regarding the reliability of risk-stratification tools, most operators are now performing electrophysiology study for asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White regardless of noninvasive findings. Many will then proceed to default ablation of all accessory pathways distant from critical conduction structures.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^1166bw2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited atrial fibrillation has not been assessed.

Methods and Results

The study populations consisted of patients with sustained preexcited(n = 51), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (n = 201), and persistent(n = 87). Effects of intravenous infusion of nifekalant were assessed on electrophysiological and clinical parameters. Nifekalant prolonged the shortest preexcited R‐R, the average preexcited R‐R, and the average R‐R intervals from 290 ± 35 to 333 ± 44 ms, 353 ± 49 to 443 ± 64 ms, and 356 ± 53 to 467 ± 75 ms, respectively, in patients with preexcited(all P < 0.001). Nifekalant also decreased the percentage of preexcitedcomplexes, heart rate, and increased systolic pressure (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant terminatedin 33 of 51 patients (65%). Similar effects were also observed in a subgroup of 12 patients with preexcitedand impaired left ventricular function. In patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, nifekalant significantly prolonged the effective refractory period, the block cycle length of the antegrade accessory pathway, and the atrial effective refractory period (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant had no effect on the effective refractory period of the antegrade atrioventricular node. Finally, in patients with persistentwithout an accessory pathway, nifekalant did not significantly decrease the ventricular rate of. One patient developed Torsades de Pointes. No other adverse effects were observed.

Conclusions

Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period of the antegrade accessory pathway and atrium without blocking antegrade conduction through the atrioventricular node, leading to slowing and/or to termination of preexcited. Thus, nifekalant might be an effective and a relatively safe drug in patients with preexcited.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^116Yo8MW]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Because patients with advanced IAB have a high risk of AF recurrence after AP ablation, additional interventions are required to prevent AF recurrence in this population. Pulmonary vein isolation is an established effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. 30 However, we did not assess whether pulmonary vein isolation was effective for preventing AF recurrence in patients in the present study. Although the pulmonary vein is reportedly involved in the development of paroxysmal AF in patients with WPW syndrome, 8 atrial substrate abnormalities partially determine the likelihood of AF recurrence after AP ablation in these patients. 4 Thus, the clinical efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation for preventing AF recurrence in these patients requires further study.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Pediatric ventricular arrhythmias — prevalence, definitions, risks, and device considerations are outlined as follows: In Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, an electrophysiology (EP) study may be indicated and ablation performed if symptomatic or if the accessory pathway refractory period is equal to or less than 240 ms. Isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are common, with 15% of all newborns showing ventricular ectopy on 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring; prevalence decreases to less than 5% in children, then increases to 10% by 10 y of age and 25% in late adolescence/early adulthood. In infants, accelerated idioventricular rhythm is defined as a ventricular rhythm no more than 20% faster than sinus rate; although it often resolves, VF and SCD have been reported, most often after intravenous digoxin or verapamil given for presumed SVT. Population data show a 40% decline in SIDS with avoidance of prone sleeping. For implantable cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs), in older children and adolescents prophylactic ICD implantation may be considered; transvenous systems are generally feasible in children older than 10 y, but a higher incidence of lead failure and ICD infection or erosion mandates judicious use in young patients.

### Intravenous furosemide for acute decompensated congestive heart failure: what is the evidence? [^116HT6Vo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Use of intravenous furosemide rather than oral administration in acute decompensated congestive cardiac failure is universally recommended in international guidelines. We argue that this recommendation is not supported by the existing evidence, and suggest that trials should be performed to determine whether larger doses of oral furosemide should be prescribed prior to an IV switch. This could reduce length of hospital admissions and allow for more patients to be managed in the primary care setting.

### Approach to a patient with asymptomatic pre-excitation [^111URAiB]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventricular pre-excitation is an electrocardiographic finding characterised by a delta wave and short PR interval. It is estimated that 1 in 1000 people will exhibit this pattern on the ECG; however, the true prevalence is likely under-represented because at least half of known patients with pre-excitation do not develop symptoms.

This ECG pattern indicates the presence of an accessory atrioventricular pathway (AP), an alternate electrical connection between atria and ventricles bypassing the normal His-Purkinje system. APs can conduct in antegrade direction, retrograde direction or both. Approximately 60%–75% of these pathways are considered 'manifest', meaning they are capable of antegrade conduction, and can inscribe the classic pre-excitation pattern on the ECG, and the rest are 'concealed', meaning they are only capable of retrograde conduction, cannot produce pre-excitation, but can still participate in atrioventricular (AV) re-entry tachycardias.

The initial description of the syndrome by Wolff, Parkinson and White included 11 patients with pre-excitation and the associated tachycardia, which was collectively termed as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. However, many patients with pre-excitation never develop tachyarrhythmias and remain asymptomatic their entire lives. In one cohort study, one-third of asymptomatic individuals with pre-excitation younger than 40 eventually developed symptoms, compared with zero patients over 40 years old at diagnosis. The most common arrhythmia (80%) is atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT), which directly uses the AP in the tachycardia circuit. However, atrial fibrillation (AF) is strikingly common (20%–30%) in patients with WPW, which suggests the AP itself may be involved in genesis of AF, perhaps as a result of haemodynamic and metabolic consequences of AVRT.

### Management of common arrhythmias: part II. ventricular arrhythmias and arrhythmias in special populations [^113qXG7L]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

In patients without established cardiac disease, the occurrence of premature ventricular complexes without sustained ventricular tachycardia is more an annoyance than a medical risk, and treatment is not required. In contrast, patients with established heart disease and premature ventricular complexes have a higher likelihood of developing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. These patients should be treated with a beta blocker or class I antiarrhythmic drug. Treatment of arrhythmias in pregnant women is rarely needed. When treatment is required, amiodarone should be avoided, and beta blockers should be used with caution, because these agents have been associated with fetal growth retardation. The most important rhythm abnormality in athletes is ventricular tachycardia associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. If the presence of the disease is confirmed by echocardiography, beta-blocker therapy is necessary, and these patients should be limited to participation in nonstrenuous sports. Acute arrhythmias in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be treated with adenosine. Radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway can provide long-term control.

### Tachyarrhythmias in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome… [^116DfoBa]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

EVERY physician should be fully familiar with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because it is frequently associated with the various ectopic tachyarrhythmias. In addition, the electrocardiographic findings in the WPW syndrome may closely resemble many other abnormalities that are frequently misinterpreted in our daily practice. The WPW syndrome was first recognized as a clinical entity by Wolff et al, 1 in 1930. The ECG findings, which were later considered to be characteristic of this syndrome, were described by Wilson2 in 1915, and by Wedd3 in
1921. The tachyarrhythmias may occur at any time and may begin at birth or during infancy, childhood, or adult life. Sixty percent to 70% of the cases with WPW syndrome have been encountered in healthy individuals without organic heart disease.
4. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be diagnosed by the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram, the His bundle electrogram, or vectorcardiogram. The typical ECG findings include a short Chung EK.

### Abnormal Q waves in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome… [^117S5cbg]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Between January 1970 and January 1975 the diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was entertained in 44 patients. Thirty-one of these patients had negative δ-defiections on one or more electrocardiographic leads, thereby simulating a pattern of myocardial infarction. Fifteen patients were initially referred with an erroneous diagnosis of MI based on the presence of Q waves. In nine of these 15 patients, the referring diagnosis was MI plus ventricular preexcitation; in six, the diagnosis of ventricular preexcitation was overlooked entirely. The incidence of misdiagnosis was exactly the same as that reported by Wolff and White approximately 30 years ago. Erroneous diagnoses of MI can be virtually eliminated by normalizing the ORS complex by premature stimulation of the atrium during the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway.
