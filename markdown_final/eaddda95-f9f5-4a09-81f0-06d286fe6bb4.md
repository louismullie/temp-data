## Question

what is contraindicated in cocaine induced vasospasm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what is contraindicated in cocaine-induced vasospasm and how to justify that answer with clinical reasoning and references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of cocaine-induced vasospasm and why certain drugs might worsen it. Then, I should verify which medication classes are explicitly contraindicated in guidelines and why. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence and any nuances, including exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer and double-check for any conflicting data that might modify practice.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: cocaine blocks reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine, producing intense alpha-adrenergic stimulation and vasoconstriction across multiple vascular beds, including coronary and cerebral arteries, which is the core mechanism behind ischemia in this setting [^111M53VP] [^112hCTtZ] [^11469XQB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about beta-blockers. I should verify the classic teaching and its rationale. The traditional concern is that nonselective beta-blockade removes beta-2–mediated vasodilation while leaving alpha-1 vasoconstriction unopposed, thereby worsening vasospasm and ischemia. This is why ACC/AHA guidelines advise not administering beta-blockers in ACS with recent cocaine or methamphetamine intoxication, and why multiple reviews and case reports caution against beta-blockers in cocaine-associated chest pain or ACS [^111VnEmS] [^111PFkLv] [^112hCTtZ] [^112dGA8F].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence because practice has evolved. Observational meta-analyses and cohort studies have not shown increased myocardial infarction or mortality with beta-blockers in cocaine-associated chest pain, suggesting the risk may be lower than historically taught; however, these are observational and not designed to capture transient hemodynamic or vasospastic worsening, so guidelines still recommend avoiding beta-blockers in acute intoxication and, if beta-blockade is absolutely necessary, preferring agents with alpha-1 antagonism and ensuring concurrent vasodilator therapy, which signals persistent caution rather than endorsement [^111Se8kD] [^1163DpLa] [^112negw3] [^116GZwHm] [^111Wph89].

> I need to check whether any other drug classes are contraindicated outright. Ergot alkaloids such as methylergonovine are well known to precipitate severe vasospasm and are contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease or vasospastic disorders; given cocaine's pro-spastic milieu, adding an ergot would be expected to compound vasoconstriction and ischemia, so these should be avoided in cocaine-induced vasospasm contexts [^notfound].

> Let me consider vasoconstrictive sympathomimetics and decongestants because patients may be using them. Agents like pseudoephedrine and other sympathomimetics can trigger or worsen vasospasm, and they are recognized precipitants of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome; in a patient with cocaine-induced vasospasm, additional sympathomimetic exposure would plausibly aggravate vascular constriction and should be avoided [^1179BkqD].

> But wait, what about triptans; could they be relevant here? Triptans are 5‑HT1B/1D agonists that can cause vasoconstriction and are contraindicated in patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease or a history of vasospasm; in a patient with cocaine-induced vasospasm, triptans would pose a mechanistic risk of worsening vasoconstriction and should be avoided [^115gsfbj] [^1141dLwc].

> I should double-check the practical clinical implications so the recommendation is actionable. In acute cocaine intoxication with suspected vasospasm, avoid nonselective beta-blockers and avoid ergot alkaloids; if beta-blockade is deemed necessary for compelling indications, use labetalol or carvedilol with concurrent vasodilators and close monitoring, recognizing this remains a conditional approach rather than a blanket endorsement; and broadly avoid additional sympathomimetic agents and triptans that could potentiate vasoconstriction [^116GZwHm] [^111Wph89] [^1179BkqD] [^115gsfbj].

> Let me reconsider whether any exceptions undermine the core answer. The absence of increased MI or mortality in observational beta-blocker cohorts does not negate transient vasospastic risk or the mechanistic concern, and guideline conservatism remains appropriate; thus, the most defensible, reference-aligned statement is that nonselective beta-blockers are contraindicated in cocaine-induced vasospasm, with the strongest caveat being that if a mixed alpha/beta-blocker is used, it should be paired with vasodilator therapy and specialist input, which still frames nonselective beta-blockade as the agent to avoid in this setting [^111VnEmS] [^111Wph89].

> Final answer, keeping it precise and clinically grounded: Nonselective beta-blockers are contraindicated in cocaine-induced vasospasm because they risk unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation and worsening vasoconstriction. Ergot alkaloids and vasoconstrictive sympathomimetics should also be avoided, and triptans should not be used in patients with known or suspected vasospastic disorders in this context [^111VnEmS] [^111PFkLv] [^1179BkqD] [^115gsfbj].

Beta-blockers are **contraindicated in cocaine-induced vasospasm** because they can cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, worsening vasoconstriction and ischemia [^111PFkLv] [^112HjJid]. Nonselective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are especially risky; if beta-blockade is absolutely necessary, use labetalol or carvedilol with caution and ensure concurrent vasodilator therapy [^116GZwHm] [^111Wph89]. Preferred treatments are **benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers** to reduce vasospasm and ischemia [^116K7pve] [^113H24q9].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for beta-blocker contraindication

Cocaine increases synaptic catecholamines, causing alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation; beta-2–mediated vasodilation offsets alpha-1 vasoconstriction. Beta-blockers remove beta-2 vasodilation, leaving unopposed alpha-1–mediated vasoconstriction, which can **worsen vasospasm and ischemia** [^11722fHQ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting contraindication

- **Case reports**: Multiple reports describe worsening vasospasm and ischemia after beta-blockers in cocaine toxicity [^112dGA8F] [^111Se8kD].
- **Guidelines**: ACC/AHA advise against beta-blockers in acute cocaine intoxication due to risk of potentiating coronary spasm [^111PFkLv] [^111VnEmS].
- **Meta-analyses**: No clear increase in MI or mortality with beta-blockers, but mechanistic risk and case reports sustain caution [^1163DpLa] [^112negw3].

---

## Specific beta-blockers and their risks

| **Beta-blocker** | **Risk level** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Propranolol (nonselective) | High | - Unopposed alpha stimulation <br/> - Worsens vasospasm |
| Metoprolol (beta-1 selective) | Moderate | - Less alpha effect <br/> - Still risk of unopposed alpha |
| Labetalol (alpha/beta blocker) | Low-moderate | - Alpha-1 blockade mitigates unopposed alpha <br/> - Use with caution |
| Carvedilol (alpha/beta blocker) | Low-moderate | - Alpha-1 blockade mitigates unopposed alpha <br/> - Use with caution |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: Do not administer beta-blockers in ACS with recent cocaine use due to risk of potentiating coronary spasm [^111PFkLv] [^111VnEmS].
- **ASAM/AAAP guidelines**: Avoid beta-blockers in cocaine intoxication; if needed, use labetalol or carvedilol with vasodilators and close monitoring [^1166TQTh] [^111Wph89].
- **Emergency medicine consensus**: Avoid beta-blockers in cocaine-associated chest pain; use benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers [^111PFkLv] [^113H24q9].

---

## Alternative pharmacological management

- **Benzodiazepines**: First-line for agitation, hypertension, and vasospasm; reduce sympathetic tone [^116K7pve] [^1166TQTh].
- **Nitrates**: Effective for coronary vasospasm and ischemia [^111QRuzk] [^1111AFHD].
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Useful for vasospasm and ischemia [^111QRuzk] [^115PTtoK].
- **Alpha-blockers**: Phentolamine can reverse cocaine-induced vasoconstriction [^113H24q9] [^115QoxCv].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific considerations

- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**: Avoid beta-blockers in cocaine-associated ACS; use nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and benzodiazepines [^111PFkLv] [^116K7pve].
- **Hypertensive emergency**: Use short-acting agents (e.g. nitroprusside, phentolamine, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers); avoid long-acting agents to prevent abrupt collapse [^113iu8bS] [^1112Hjf6].
- **Chronic cardiovascular disease**: If beta-blockade is necessary, use labetalol or carvedilol with vasodilators and close monitoring [^116GZwHm] [^111Wph89].

---

## Potential consequences of beta-blocker administration

Beta-blocker use in cocaine-induced vasospasm can **worsen vasoconstriction**, precipitate ischemia or infarction, and increase arrhythmia risk; case reports document deterioration after beta-blockers, including fatal outcomes [^112dGA8F] [^111GumCJ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Avoid beta-blockers**: Especially nonselective agents (e.g. propranolol) in cocaine-induced vasospasm [^111PFkLv] [^111VnEmS].
- **Use alternatives**: Benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers are preferred [^116K7pve] [^113H24q9].
- **If beta-blockade is necessary**: Use labetalol or carvedilol with vasodilators and close monitoring [^116GZwHm] [^111Wph89].

---

Beta-blockers are **contraindicated in cocaine-induced vasospasm** due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation that worsens vasoconstriction and ischemia; use benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers instead, and if beta-blockade is unavoidable, choose labetalol or carvedilol with vasodilators and careful monitoring.

### Nonobstructive versus obstructive coronary artery disease in acute coronary syndrome: a meta-analysis [^112PGZ15]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that, among NObCAD patients, those with normal coronary arteries may carry a lower CHD risk than the subjects with mildly obstructed CAD, representing a different population of younger patients with a possible tendency for spontaneous thrombosis and other etiologies leading to CAD (eg, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, variant angina pectoris, microvascular dysfunction, and coronary vasospasm). 5, 6, 31 Indeed, a meta‐analysis of 18 studies including unselected or stable patients without significant epicardial coronary artery disease reported that coronary events were 6‐fold more frequent in patients with mild (0–20%) stenosis and 15‐fold more frequent in patients with moderate stenosis (20–40%), when compared with patients with smooth and normal arteriograms. 48 From the present meta‐analysis, a different picture emerges for ACS. In the noncritical stenosis range, normal (0%) coronary arteries were associated with no better prognosis than a nonobstructive (1–49%) coronary stenosis. Such a discrepancy, however, may be artificial, because (1) our meta‐analyses restricted to NObCAD subjects included a very scarce number of events and were largely underpowered; (2) heterogeneous conditions were included under the umbrella term of NObACS, which may encompass disparate entities, such as epicardial artery coronary vasospasm, takotsubo acute cardiomyopathy, cocaine or other illicit drug abuse, spontaneous coronary dissection, or even acute myocarditis with ACS‐like presentation. In fact, a major concern in the clinical definition of nonobstructive ACS is that the majority of the included studies did not carry out special diagnostic investigations to rule out the potential role of microcirculation as a cause of myocardial acute injury (as shown in Table S4), nor were diagnostic tests carried out to assess the effective vessel atherosclerotic burden that is often undetectable at angiography due to negative atherosclerotic remodeling. 49

### Stroke in young adults who abuse amphetamines or cocaine… [^1139EYrs]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Evidence has been accumulating for 2 decades supporting a link between abuse of stimulant drugs and strokes in young people. 1–8 Human imaging and postmortem examination, as well as laboratory animal models, suggest that stimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, might produce strokes by direct effects on the cerebral circulation, including elevated blood pressure, vasculitis, and cerebral vasospasm. 7, 9–18. then reinstated by the Tenth Circuit US Court of Appeals in August
2006. 22 Despite the many case reports, the causal link has remained controversial because of the possibility of coincidental co-occurrence from the high prevalence of drug abuse and methodologic weaknesses and conflicting findings of the 5 epidemiologic case-control studies and 1 cross-sectional study that have examined the association. 23–28. Atrial fibrillation or flutter was a strong risk factor for ischemic stroke in univariate analysis, but it did not remain significant in the multivariate model because of strong collinearity with the "miscellaneous cardiac" variable. In patients with hemorrhagic strokes, only amphetamine abuse, coagulation defects, and hypertension were strong independent predictors of in-hospital death; in contrast, in patients with ischemic stroke, only acute myocardial infarction was significantly associated with death. Controlling for other risk factors, we found that amphetamine abuse was associated with twice the risk of hemorrhagic stroke as cocaine abuse. In contrast, amphetamine abuse was not associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, while cocaine abuse was associated with an increased risk.

Amphetamine abuse, but not cocaine abuse, was associated with increased risk of death after a hemorrhagic stroke. Animal studies support the biological plausibility of a causal link between cocaine and amphetamine abuse and strokes. Intravenous methamphetamine, in rhesus monkeys, causes microhemorrhaging, thrombosis, infarction, poor vascular filling, and fragmentation of small arterioles and capillary beds. 12, 13 Methamphetamine also has been shown to exacerbate ischemic brain injury in mice. 41 Cocaine causes vasoconstriction11 and disruption of cerebrovascular autoregulation in the presence of increased blood pressure. 42.

### Cocaine and the critical care challenge [^111kRXnT]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Cocaine, which first made its appearance > 1,000 yrs ago, is now widely used throughout the world. The physiologic responses to cocaine may cause severe pathologic effects. This review highlights the many critical care challenges resulting from these effects.

Design

Historical vignettes, epidemiologic factors, modes of preparation and delivery, and the physiologic and pharmacologic effects of these agents are presented.

Setting

Cocaine causes intense vasoconstriction, which potentially causes damage to all organ systems. Examples of these toxicities are presented.

Patients

The adverse multisystem responses to cocaine exposure produce organ failure, which challenges diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic intervention. Organ system failure involves the brain, heart, lung, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, musculature, and other organs. These harmful effects are additive to preexisting organ dysfunction.

Intervention

Recognition of associated cocaine injury alerts the physician that organ dysfunction is more likely to occur and to be more severe. Such anticipation helps plan for therapy in the critical care setting.

Results and Conclusions

Cocaine use is an expanding health hazard, despite intense governmental efforts to contain its distribution and use. Recognition of the signs and symptoms of cocaine toxicity help anticipate the subsequent organ dysfunction and implement earlier organ system support.

### Best evidence topic report. beta-blockers in cocaine induced acute coronary syndrome [^113YaGmB]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether beta blockers should be used in the treatment of chest pain associated with cocaine use. 12 papers were found, of which two presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that Beta Blockers should not be used in the treatment of cocaine induced myocardial ischaemia.

### Best evidence topic report. cocaine induced myocardial ischaemia: nitrates versus benzodiazepines [^1111AFHD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nitrates are better than benzodiazepines in the treatment of cocaine induced chest pain. Seven citations were reviewed of which two answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that in patients with cocaine induced chest pain it appears that nitrates or benzodiazepines are effective in combination or alone in resolving chest pain and improving cardiac performance. We recommend that the agent of choice may be influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent CNS symptoms.

Cardiac ischemia in stimulant intoxication — agent selection and beta blocker considerations: Alternative agents (e.g., calcium channel blockers, vasodilators) are generally preferred for management of cardiac ischemia in patients experiencing stimulant intoxication. However, if beta blockers are used, clinicians should consider using a medication with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (e.g., carvedilol, labetalol), and if an unopposed beta blocker was used in a patient who is or was recently stimulant intoxicated, clinicians should also consider providing a coronary vasodilator (e.g., nitroglycerin, calcium channel blocker); for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation).

### Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the impact of cocaine use, hunt-hess grade, and other risk factors [^117TNwN4]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasospasm severity grading

All patients underwent repeat DSA 7 days after initial SAH bleed to evaluate for vasospasm. DSA was evaluated by residents, fellows, and attendings for evidence of radiographic vasospasm. Each patient's angiographic imaging was reviewed by an attending and an endovascular fellow to determine the vasospasm grade. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or evaluation by another attending. The evaluators did not have access to the patient's chart while reviewing the imaging, but the patient's name could not be hidden from the imaging. However, the cases were conducted over a 10-year period, the evaluation of the imaging was not done until six months to a year after the final case, and the physicians conducting the review of imaging were not involved in most of the cases. The possibility of bias in vasospasm grading from prior knowledge of patient history is low, but not zero.

DSAs were reviewed and CV was graded on a scale of 0 to 3 using the Visual Cerebral Vasospasm Classification, as described by Merkel et al. Grade 0 is classified as all vessels showing physiologic shape. Grade 1 is CV in A1, A2 & M2. Grade 2 is CV in M1 & ICA terminus. Grade 3 is classified as CV causing severe reduction in ICA, A1 & M1. Figure 1 serves as a reference for vasospasm grading on initial presentation. The number of angiograms performed for vasospasm treatment was also recorded. All patients at our institution receive nimodipine for vasospasm prophylaxis and systolic blood pressure is liberalized to 180–200 depending on the clinical scenario. If vasospasm was identified on DSA, patients were treated with intra-arterial verapamil first, then followed with intra-arterial nitroglycerin, or less frequently, milrinone. If the vasospasm did not resolve after delivery of the pharmacologic agents or recurred, balloon angioplasty was utilized.

Fig. 1
(A - C) demonstrates drawings of vasospasm grades 1, 2, and 3. (D - F) demonstrates DSA images revealing grades 1, 2, and 3 (as shown by arrows) respectively, and correlates with the drawing. (G - I) is DSA 6 months post vasospasm incidence with a grade of 0

Long term outcomes

Long-term outcomes were measured using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores based on functionality at clinical follow-ups. mRS scores were assessed at 3 months.

Chest pain/Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)/STEMI inclusion criteria include chest pain or discomfort in other areas of the body of suspected cardiac origin with associated symptoms, noting that atypical or unusual symptoms are more common in women, the elderly, and diabetic patients and may also present with CHF, syncope, and/or shock; inclusion also lists chest pain associated sympathomimetic use (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine); and for patients with likely non-cardiac chest pain and a low likelihood of ACS, defer the administration of aspirin (ASA) and nitrates per the Pain Management Guideline.

### Clinical characteristics and management of methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy: state-of-the-art review [^116xC84d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Proactive screening for intracardiac thrombi in patients presenting with MACM is advised given the elevated risk. 29 Contrast echocardiography and CMR will provide a higher sensitivity for the detection of intracardiac thrombi. 75, 77, 86 Prophylactic anticoagulation is indicated in the hospitalized patient, and long‐term anticoagulation should be considered in those with severe LV dysfunction. 87

In patients presenting with MACM complicated by acute coronary syndrome, coronary vasospasm must be considered as a cause. 32, 33 Diagnostic coronary angiography should be used according to guidelines and, if vasospasm is suspected, vasodilatory medications should be considered. If β blockade is initiated, a β blocker with α‐1 receptor antagonist activity (ie, carvedilol and labetalol) may be better tolerated.

Rhabdomyolysis is a common and challenging complication of methamphetamine use and often leads to acute kidney injury. 88 Electrolyte disturbances and acidosis may contribute to proarrhythmic risk and negative inotropy. Usual management of rhabdomyolysis requires rapid administration of isotonic fluid that may be prohibitive in a patient presenting in acute HF. Active surveillance for rhabdomyolysis by checking creatinine kinase and urine studies early on may be prudent. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, hemodialysis with ultrafiltration should be considered early to prevent imminent, severe renal damage.

### Vascular disease in cocaine addiction [^1177xuP8]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Cocaine, a powerful vasoconstrictor, induces immune responses including cytokine elevations. Chronic cocaine use is associated with functional brain impairments potentially mediated by vascular pathology. Although the Crack-Cocaine epidemic has declined, its vascular consequences are increasingly becoming evident among individuals with cocaine use disorder of that period, now aging. Paradoxically, during the period when prevention efforts could make a difference, this population receives psychosocial treatment at best. We review major postmortem and in vitro studies documenting cocaine-induced vascular toxicity. PubMed and Academic Search Complete were used with relevant terms. Findings consist of the major mechanisms of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis, emphasizing acute, chronic, and secondary effects of cocaine. The etiology underlying cocaine's acute and chronic vascular effects is multifactorial, spanning hypertension, impaired homeostasis and platelet function, thrombosis, thromboembolism, and alterations in blood flow. Early detection of vascular disease in cocaine addiction by multimodality imaging is discussed. Treatment may be similar to indications in patients with traditional risk-factors, with few exceptions such as enhanced supportive care and use of benzodiazepines and phentolamine for sedation, and avoiding β-blockers. Given the vascular toxicity cocaine induces, further compounded by smoking and alcohol comorbidity, and interacting with aging of the crack generation, there is a public health imperative to identify pre-symptomatic markers of vascular impairments in cocaine addiction and employ preventive treatment to reduce silent disease progression.

### Ecstasy induced acute myocardial infarction [^113ygNSK]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

A 23 year old man presented with a clinical history and ECG compatible with acute myocardial infarction, having taken a single tablet of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymetamphetamine) 18 hours previously. He was treated with aspirin and thrombolytic therapy; however, cardiac catheterisation showed angiographically normal coronary arteries and left ventricular function. Sympathomimetic drugs are freely available and widely abused in Britain, but there is little evidence of the mechanisms or management of cardiac complications. In such cases the use of standard treatment for acute myocardial infarction is recommended with agents such as glyceryl trinitrate and phentolamine to reduce coronary artery spasm. Early coronary angiography may help to determine the relative contribution of spasm, thrombus, and underlying atherosclerotic disease.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^116GZwHm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Hyperadrenergic symptoms — adjunctive pharmacotherapy when persistent: If the hyperadrenergic state persists despite appropriate improvement in agitation and neuromuscular hyperactivity following treatment with benzodiazepines or other GABAergic agent, clinicians can consider adjunctive treatment with the following medications: a beta blocker with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (eg, carvedilol, labetalol; Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation), an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (eg, dexmedetomidine for severe symptoms, clonidine for mild to moderate symptoms; Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation), and where beta blockers are contraindicated, other pharmacological options such as calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators, with consideration of other clinically relevant signs and symptoms (Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation). While calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators may be most beneficial in treating hypertension and vasospasm.

### Cognitive aids for the diagnosis and treatment of neuroanesthetic emergencies: consensus guidelines on behalf of the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care (SNACC) education committee [^114u2Y8j]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm — diagnostic confirmation and hemodynamic management emphasize angiographic standards, vasoactive choices, blood pressure targets, and nimodipine use. "Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm", while "CT angiography has shown good correlation with DSA but may overestimate the degree of vessel narrowing", and "DSA or CT angiography and perfusion combined is usually used for confirmation of cerebral vasospasm". Hypertension is favored because "Hypertension independently improves CBF", and "a fluid bolus is reasonable at the start of management of vasospasm while initiating vasopressor therapy". "Vasoactive medications most commonly employed to treat DCI are phenylephrine and norepinephrine", with "Dopamine… used to a lesser extent and vasopressin… a useful adjunct when very high doses of other vasopressors are required", and "Inotropes may be considered for inadequate response to induced hypertension". Targets may be set as "a percentage increase (eg, 20%)… or an absolute value", and "The target should be made based on the patient's initial clinical response". For aneurysm status, "The presence of a second unruptured aneurysm does not contraindicate induced hypertension… " and with an unsecured aneurysm "judicious blood pressure elevation can be attempted". Evidence supports nimodipine: "Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown improved outcomes with the use of nimodipine… although not necessarily a reduction in the radiologic incidence of vasospasm", and "its effect is not a direct result of vasodilation". If hypotension occurs, "a strategy of lower dose short interval dosing can be implemented… [or] nimodipine can be discontinued". Escalation may require "angioplasty and intra-arterial vasodilator therapies… Repeated treatments may be required", and "Nicardipine may also be utilized in patients where oral nimodipine is not feasible". Overall, "The overall treatment goals, regardless of modality, are to optimize CBF, reduce cerebral metabolic rate, and avoid secondary injury".

### Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the impact of cocaine use, hunt-hess grade, and other risk factors [^115Hy9iJ]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral vasospasm (CV) following spontaneous, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a well-described phenomenon, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. CV tends to occur 3–14 days after the initial bleed and can lead to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and infarction. Despite the best medical treatment, approximately one-third of patients with CV suffer from persistent neurological deficits, due to decreased cerebral perfusion and DCI.

Multiple risk factors for CV have been posited. For example, females are 27% more likely to have CV as compared to their male counterparts. A history of hypertension (HTN), both treated and untreated, has also been previously found to be an important risk factor for CV after aSAH as has a history of tobacco use. Furthermore, common scoring systems such as the Hunt Hess (HH) grade and modified Fisher Scale (mFS) scores have also been found to correlate with CV occurrence. More recently, other factors have been identified as possibly protective in nature against CV risk, including older age.

Pre-morbid substance abuse, particularly the use of cocaine, is common among aSAH patients. Given the vasoactive properties of cocaine, it was postulated to increase the risk of vasospasm in aSAH patients. There are several studies supporting this theory. In 2001, Conway et al. compared 27 aSAH patients recent cocaine exposure and found an increased risk of CV compared to controls, though with no effect on clinical outcomes. Howington et al. found cocaine use increased the risk of vasospasm by almost 3 fold. In a large meta-analysis, Florez-Perdomo et al. found that cocaine use was associated with increased risk of vasospasm and higher mortality. Conversely, Alaraj et al. came to the opposite conclusion in 2010, finding no difference in both incidence of symptomatic vasospasm or clinical outcome between 31 cocaine users with aSAH and controls. Despite the numerous evaluations of the effect of cocaine on vasospasm in SAH patients, there has been no evaluation of whether cocaine induces more severe or more refractory vasospasm than that experienced by other patients with aSAH.

The present study aims to evaluate the effect of cocaine on aSAH vasospasm incidence, severity, and refractoriness to treatment.

### Β-blockers for chest pain associated with recent cocaine use… [^111Se8kD]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion β-Blockers do not appear to be associated with adverse events in patients with chest pain with recent cocaine use. Cocaine is an illegal substance used by millions of Americans. 1By preventing reuptake of endogenous catecholamines, cocaine can lead to systemic vasoconstriction, coronary vasospasm, thrombus, and plaque formation, and, by increasing contractility and heart rate, an increase in cardiac oxygen demand.
2. -4 As a sodium channel blocker, cocaine may also be proarrhythmic, potentially resulting in malignant ventricular arrhythmias. 4 Owing to these multiple effects, cocaine may trigger severe hypertension, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and death. 3, 4 Traditional teaching dictates that β-blockers are contraindicated in the setting of cocaine-associated chest pain. Previous studies suggest that β-blockers may exacerbate coronary vasospasm and the toxic effects of cocaine by creating "unopposed" α-adrenergic stimulation.

5, 6 Recommendations against β-blockers in the setting of cocaine-associated chest pain are common3, 7 and have been introduced into recent cardiology guidelines. 8–10 These recommendations are based primarily on case reports11, 12 and small catheter-based human studies. 5, 13 Of note, the only catheter-based study to show worsening of cocaine-induced vasospasm involved intracoronary propanolol. 5 To our knowledge, no large clinical studies aimed at assessing the safety of systemic β-blockers in cocaine-associated chest pain have been performed.
3. Secondary outcomes included peak troponin level in the first 24 hours of admission, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia requiring defibrillation, need for intubation, and need for vasopressor agents. Cardiovascular death as determined by death certificates from the National Death Index was also a secondary outcome.

There are thought to be approximately 2 million cocaine users in the United States, 1 and the drug is estimated to be involved in more than 500 000 ED visits a year. 18 Cocaine is a powerful sympathomimetic drug that works by blocking reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine at adrenergic nerve terminals, leading to vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and increased cardiac contractility. 2 Coronary artery thrombus formation following cocaine abuse has been described, 19 and the sodium channel–blocking properties of cocaine increase the risk of dangerous arrhythmias. 4.

### Fatal encephalopathy after an isolated overdose of cocaine [^115Ntzjs]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cocaine induced brain damage can be divided into primary neurotoxic effects causing toxic encephalopathy, secondary effects of compromised cerebral blood flow in ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, cerebral vasculitis and vasospasm, and tertiary effects due to hypoxia as a result of cardiopulmonary collapse. Toxic leucoencephalopathy mainly affects white matter (WM) tracts serving higher cerebral function, thereby leading to altered personality, attention deficits and memory impairment in mild cases and to dementia, coma and brain death in severe cases. Here we describe the case of a 21-year-old man who committed suicide by injecting cocaine. The cocaine induced a toxic leucoencephalopathy, which was proven at autopsy.

### Cocaine and buerger disease… [^115psmoT]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

A patient with a diagnosis of Buerger disease is described with peripheral limb ischemia and toe amputations, 2 recent small myocardial infarctions, and a long history of cigarette use. Peripheral angiography findings were incompatible with the clinical impression, and further workup revealed heavy recreational use of cocaine. A literature review of the clinical and pathologic manifestations of Buerger disease and of cocaine exposure shows them to have remarkable similarities. Based on our case observation and suggestive evidence from the literature, we propose that cocaine exposure may masquerade as Buerger disease, and further, that unrecognized cocaine exposure may underlie such cases, even including those originally described by Buerger in 1908.

Coronary artery spasm — Coronary artery spasm results from vasomotor dysfunction and can occur in the presence or absence of atherosclerotic ischemic heart disease, and vasospasm episodes can lead to VA, syncope, and SCD. Treatment includes risk factor elimination including smoking cessation, and treatment with vasodilators including dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with or without nitrates. Patients with coronary artery spasm who survive an SCA are a high-risk population, and recurrent VA, even life-threatening, may be prevented if coronary artery spasm can be effectively addressed with risk factor modification, smoking cessation, and ongoing treatment with nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers; however, SCA or VA can recur despite medical therapy or if compliance is poor. Whether a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator may provide protection while medical therapy is being evaluated has not been assessed but is of interest, and an ICD can terminate VT/VF initiated by spasm, potentially preventing SCD.

### Should β-blockers be used in the treatment of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome? [^114z35UG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically evaluate the 30 year debate of beta-blocker use in cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome (CIACS).

Data Sources

An Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, and Ovid MEDLINE (1966-August 21, 2007) search of the medical literature was conducted using the key terms cocaine, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and adrenergic beta-antagonists.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical trials, case reports, national cardiovascular guidelines, and reviews published in English were evaluated. Case reports were included based on whether (1) acute coronary syndrome was suspected, (2) a beta-blocker was used during the treatment course, and (3) objective and subjective patient-specific information was documented.

Data Synthesis

Three case reports and 2 placebo-controlled trials were identified that used 4 beta-blockers (atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol, propranolol). Three national guidelines addressed beta-blocker use. Although published data are limited, propranolol and labetalol exert minimal to no effect on alleviating cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction. None of the evaluated national guidelines recommends beta-blockers as first-line agents in CIACS management.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers should not be considered first-line agents for controlling chest pain in patients with documented CIACS. If long-term beta-blockade is warranted, its benefits should be weighed against recurrent use of cocaine and possible exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome. Given that carvedilol exhibits ancillary pharmacologic proprieties beneficial in CIACS, and post-myocardial infarction mortality data are available regarding its use, this agent could be considered to be appropriate therapy.

Acute nonocclusive intestinal ischemia — etiology, diagnosis, and treatment are specified as follows: Nonocclusive intestinal ischemia should be suspected in patients with low flow states or shock, especially cardiogenic shock, who develop abdominal pain; in patients receiving vasoconstrictor substances and medications (e.g., cocaine, ergots, vasopressin, or norepinephrine) who develop abdominal pain; and in those who develop abdominal pain after aortic coarctation repair or after surgical revascularization for intestinal ischemia caused by arterial obstruction. For diagnosis, arteriography is indicated in patients suspected of having nonocclusive intestinal ischemia whose condition does not improve rapidly with treatment of their underlying disease. For treatment, the underlying shock state is the most important initial step; laparotomy and resection of nonviable bowel is indicated for persistent symptoms despite treatment; and transcatheter administration of vasodilators into the area of vasospasm is indicated when patients do not respond to systemic supportive treatment and in intestinal ischemia due to cocaine or ergot poisoning.

### Update on endovascular therapies for cerebral vasospasm induced by aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114V3rzz]. Neurosurgical Focus (2006). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm remains a major source of morbidity and death in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). When vasospasm becomes refractory to maximal medical management consisting of induced hypertension and hypervolemia and administration of calcium channel antagonists, endovascular therapies should be considered. The primary goal of endovascular treatment is to increase cerebral blood flow to prevent cerebral infarction. Two of the more frequently studied endovascular treatments are transluminal balloon angioplasty and intraarterial papaverine infusion. These two have been used either alone or in combination for the treatment of vasospasm. Other pharmacological vasodilating agents currently being investigated are intraarterial nimodipine, nicardipine, verapamil, and milrinone. Newer intraarterial agents, such as fasudil and colforsin daropate, have also been investigated. In this article the authors review the current options in terms of endovascular therapies for treatment of cerebral vasospasm. The mechanism of action, technique of administration, clinical effect and outcomes, and complications of each modality are discussed.

### Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the impact of cocaine use, hunt-hess grade, and other risk factors [^111JYB5v]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is a common complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) that contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. While numerous identified CV risk factors exist, illicit substance use's influence, particularly cocaine, remains controversial. This study aims to elucidate relationships between known risk factors and CV's incidence, severity, and refractoriness.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on all aSAH patients between 2014 and 2023 with inclusion criteria of confirmed aneurysms on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and available urine drug screens (UDS). Demographic data, Hunt-Hess (HH), modified Fisher Scale (mFS), comorbidities, and vasospasm grades were collected. Outcomes, including vasospasm treatment counts, length of stay (LOS), and 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, were recorded.

Results

Of 88 patients, 43% experienced CV. Cocaine use was significantly more prevalent in the CV group (26% vs. 8%, p = 0.04) and increased CV risk (OR = 4.11, 95% CI: 1.25–16.13, p = 0.03), independent of other factors. Higher HH grades were associated with increased CV incidence (OR = 1.75, p = 0.01), severity (β = 0.271, p = 0.02), and 3-month mRS scores (β = 0.81, p < 0.001). Female sex also predicted vasospasm incidence (OR = 4.78, p = 0.01). Older age was associated with worse long-term outcomes (β = 0.05, p = 0.004). In the multivariable analysis, cocaine revealed a significant increased risk of CV incidence (OR = 5.79, p = 0.02). Higher HH grades significantly impacted CV severity (OR = 0.30, p = 0.01) and worse long-term outcomes (OR = 0.957, p < 0.01) in the multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Females, those with positive cocaine use on UDS, and a history of T2DM were at an increased risk of CV with no impact on severity, recurrence, or 3-month outcomes. Older age was associated with worse long-term outcomes. HH grade was significantly associated with increased vasospasm severity, refractoriness to treatment, and worse long-term outcomes as per mRS scores.

### Cardiovascular considerations during Cancer therapy: gaps in evidence andExpert Panel Recommendations [^113ifySh]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

HER2-targeted therapies

Recommendations

- It is feasible to continue HER2-targeted therapy in individuals with mild, minimally symptomatic LV dysfunction.

Gaps in knowledge

- The risks and benefits of permissive cardiotoxicity for HER2-targeted CTR-CVT are not fully understood in large populations.

Randomized control trials have demonstrated that shorter courses of HER2-targeted therapy (< 1 year) in early-stage breast cancer can lead to worse disease-free and overall survival. Observational data suggest that any interruptions in HER2-targeted therapy may be associated with poorer outcomes. These findings prompted 2 prospective single-arm trials to evaluate the management of reduced LVEF in patients receiving HER2-targeted therapies. In both studies, all participants were closely observed with serial echocardiography, and ACEIs and beta-blockers were administered at the highest tolerated doses. HER2-targeted therapy was discontinued only if the LVEF dropped to < 35% to 40% or if moderate HF symptoms developed. Although the approach was deemed feasible, a 5% to 10% incidence of moderate to severe HF or LV impairment necessitating the discontinuation of HER2 therapy was observed with permissive CTR-CVT. The risk-benefit relationship of this approach has not been fully evaluated, and the net clinical benefit regarding cancer-free survival remains uncertain. Up to 14% of patients treated with permissive CTR-CVT exhibited evidence of LV impairment at 18-month follow-up, though this rate may be confounded by prior anthracycline exposure and could plausibly be lower in those not treated with anthracyclines. Further research is needed to define the role of permissive CTR-CVT with HER2-targeted therapy.

Fluoropyrimidines

Recommendations

- Chest pain syndromes suspected to be caused by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)–induced or capecitabine-induced coronary vasospasm should be acutely treated with nitrates and/or calcium-channel blockers.
- After suspected coronary vasospasm, nitrates and/or calcium-channel blockers should be considered. If rechallenging with 5-FU or capecitabine is planned, it should be conducted in a closely monitored setting.

### Acute myocardial infarction: etiologies and mimickers in young patients [^112HjJid]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug Use

An important risk factor for AMI in young adults is illicit drug abuse, which is associated with a poor prognosis. For this reason, a detailed history of illicit drug use is a necessary part of assessment of a young individual with an AMI. The most implicated substances are stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines, and 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). Mechanisms that lead to cardiac complications with these drugs typically involve vessel damage, prothrombotic effects and direct myocardial injury. In contrast, cocaine may increase myocardial oxygen demand because of increase in blood pressure and heart rate, while also promoting platelet activationor coronary vasospasm, resulting in acute myocardial ischemia. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of AMI following amphetamine use is not well understood but likely because of a combination of coronary vasospasm, intracoronary thrombus formation, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Management of AMI secondary to amphetamine and cocaine abuse is not clearly defined but includes calcium channel blockers for treatment of suspected coronary vasospasm or thrombolytics/anticoagulants for coronary thrombi. Selective beta‐1 adrenergic receptor blockade is generally avoided until the absence of illicit drug use is confirmed as it may exacerbate coronary vasospasm via unopposed alpha adrenergic agonism. The incidence of cocaine‐induced AMI has been reported as high as 25% among AMI patients aged 18 to 45 years, particularly in those with other cardiac risk factors. When there is clear thrombus, plaque disruption, or occlusive disease the treatment of ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction in patients with recent substance use within 6 hours of onset of chest pain follows standard protocol with immediate PCI or thrombolytic therapy if PCI is not available.

### Methylergonovine (methylergonovine maleate) [^111xadnD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

General

This drug should not be administered I.V. routinely because of the possibility of inducing sudden hypertensive and cerebrovascular accidents. If I.V. administration is considered essential as a lifesaving measure, methylergonovine maleate should be given slowly over a period of no less than 60 seconds with careful monitoring of blood pressure. Intra-arterial or periarterial injection should be strictly avoided.

Caution should be exercised in the presence of impaired hepatic or renal function.

Coronary artery disease

Patients with coronary artery disease or risk factors for coronary artery disease (e.g., smoking, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol) may be more susceptible to developing myocardial ischemia and infarction associated with methylergonovine-induced vasospasm.

Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of methylergonovine maleate and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions or reduced therapeutic effect of methylergonovine maleate or the concomitant drug (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Medication errors

Inadvertent administration of methylergonovine maleate to newborn infants has been reported. In these cases of inadvertent neonatal exposure, symptoms such as respiratory depression, convulsions, cyanosis and oliguria have been reported. Usual treatment is symptomatic. However, in severe cases, respiratory and cardiovascular support is required.

Methylergonovine maleate has been administered instead of vitamin K and Hepatitis B vaccine, medications which are routinely administered to the newborn. Due to the potential for accidental neonatal exposure, methylergonovine maleate injection should be stored separately from medications intended for neonatal administration.

### Outcomes of beta blocker use in cocaine-associated chest pain: a meta-analysis [^1163DpLa]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Beta blockers (β-blockers) remain a standard therapy in the early treatment of acute coronary syndromes. However, β-blocker therapy in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain (CACP) continues to be an area of debate due to the potential risk of unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation and coronary vasospasm. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies to compare outcomes of β-blocker versus no β-blocker use among patients with CACP.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through September 2016 using the keywords 'beta blocker', 'cocaine' and commonly used β-blockers ('atenolol', 'bisoprolol', 'carvedilol', 'esmolol', 'metoprolol' and 'propranolol') to identify studies evaluating β-blocker use among patients with CACP. We specifically focused on studies comparing outcomes between β-blocker versus no β-blocker usage in patients with CACP. Studies without a comparison between β-blocker and no β-blocker use were excluded. Outcomes of interest included non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using Q and I 2 statistics.

Results

A total of five studies evaluating 1794 subjects were included. Overall, there was no significant difference on MI in patients with CACP on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 1.36, 95%CI 0.68 to 2.75; p = 0.39). Similarly, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality in patients on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.26 to 1.79; p = 0.43).

Conclusions

In patients presenting with acute chest pain and underlying cocaine, β-blocker use does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MI or all-cause mortality.

### Cocaine-induced pemphigus vulgaris [^117DkzD5]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cocaine-induced PV and pemphigus vegetans are extremely rare and can occur after intranasal administration. The first clinical discussion of cocaine inducing bullous disease occurred in the 1980s; however, this resulted after ingestion rather than intranasal exposure. Although it is unknown how intranasal cocaine induces autoimmunity to Dsg proteins, possible explanations include effects of unknown adulterants, such as levamisole, quinine, procaine, or amphetamines, as well as cocaine-induced vasospasm leading to ischemia, which has been implicated in the development of granulomatous polyangiitis with eosinophilia, IgA vasculitis, and urticarial vasculitis.

The treatment of cocaine-induced PV mirrors that for idiopathic PV. Based on recent studies, patients with severe PV often require a combination of intravenous Ig, oral immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine, and topical corticosteroids. Other treatments that have been trialed for cocaine-induced PV include plasmapheresis and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. In multiple reports, cocaine re-challenge resulted in a relapse of PV.

### Depression as a risk factor for incident ischemic stroke among HIV-positive veterans in the veterans aging cohort study [^113WrMgk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms underlying the association between depression and incident ischemic stroke among HIV‐positive people have not been thoroughly investigated though likely are multifactorial. Chronic HIV infection has been associated with a chronic, systemic inflammatory state, coagulopathies, platelet dysfunction, CD4 cell depletion with resultant lack of vascular repair, cART associated dyslipidemia, and direct vascular damage by HIV. While our results support the hypothesis that depression increases stroke risk among HIV‐positive people, this association was attenuated by controlling for alcohol and cocaine use. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Primary Prevention of Ischemic Stroke Guidelines consider alcohol and illicit drugs, including cocaine, "less well documented or potentially modifiable risk factors", in part because of the complexities of their association with stroke risk and comorbidity with depression. Alcohol use disorders are associated with increased risk of developing such stroke risk factors as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation and is known to modulate platelet aggregation, impair synthetic liver function, cause hyperhomocysteinemia, and predispose to thromboembolism. A "J shape" association between alcohol consumption and ischemic stroke risk has been described in the HIV‐negative population, with alcohol having a protective effect at low and moderate levels of consumption and a noxious effect at higher levels. Cocaine use has also been linked to factors increasing stroke risk, including reversible vasospasm, hypertensive surges, drug‐induced arteritis, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, increased platelet aggregation, and thromboembolism. Higher rates of unhealthy alcohol and cocaine use have been described in both depressed, and HIV‐positive populations. Increased stroke risk among people with depression and HIV using alcohol and/or cocaine may also be explained by poorer medication adherence, less healthy behavior modification, toxic effects of alcohol on multiple aspects of physiology and vascular health, and increased rates of other vascular risk conditions (eg, smoking). Given that many of these vascular risk factors are not specific to HIV, cART was not associated with increased stroke risk, and the effect sizes from Cox models were similar between those with and without HIV, it appears that most of the association between depression and stroke risk is not driven by HIV or HIV‐specific factors.

### Assessment of cocaine use in patients with chest pain syndromes… [^112hCTtZ]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Myocardial infarction was first noted to occur in association with cocaine use in 1982. 12 Since that time, more than 250 cases of myocardial infarction have been attributed to cocaine use. 13–18 Recent investigations have shown that cocaine use is both an acute and a chronic cardiac risk factor. Acutely, cocaine increases coronary artery vasoconstriction, myocardial oxygen demand, platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation. 16–28 As a result, cocaine use can result in acute myocardial infarction, even in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease. 16, 17 Long-term users may develop left ventricular hypertrophy29–31 and atherosclerosis, 32–38 possibly placing them at higher risk for future ischemic events. 16, 39.

The evidence that cocaine use may result in myocardial ischemia, along with the recognition that the pharmacologic treatment and disposition of patients with myocardial ischemia14, 18, 40–43 may differ depending on whether the patient has recently used cocaine, has led to recommendations by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research44 and the American College of Emergency Physicians45 that patients with chest pain syndromes be questioned about recent cocaine use. These patients would also be less likely to receive β-antagonists and thrombolytic agents, which in the setting of cocaine use could lead to a potentially higher risk of adverse outcomes or an increased prevalence of false-positive ST-segment elevations. 40, 42, 43, 46–48 During the phase 2 interview, the patients were asked the following question: "Since you arrived at the hospital this time, has anyone asked you anything about cocaine use".

The marked increase in recreational cocaine use in the past decade, combined with the recognition that cocaine can induce myocardial ischemia26, 27 and infarction, 12–18, 43, 50, 55 has fundamentally altered the treatment of patients with chest pain. Patients who have myocardial ischemia secondary to cocaine use are treated differently from patients who have myocardial ischemia unrelated to cocaine use. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia include early use of benzodiazepines, 42, 43, 55 avoidance of β-antagonists, 16, 18, 42, 43 and more cautious use of thrombolytic agents40, 48 and lidocaine. 41 In patients with cocaine-associated chest pain, electrocardiograms, clinical history, and laboratory markers of myocardial infarction appear to be less specific for acute infarction. 14, 18, 46, 47, 56–58.

### Cocaine-induced renal infarction: report of a case and review of the literature [^1156g3Ey]. BMC Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Cocaine intoxication is associated with multiple cases of vascular injury. Renal infarction as a result of cocaine use, however, is uncommon. In a patient with a history of cocaine abuse presenting with fevers and flank pain suggestive of urinary tract infection or nephrolithiasis, cocaine-induced renal infarction must be considered in the differential diagnosis. The vasoconstrictive and thrombotic effects of cocaine are most likely the dominant factors in cocaine-induced renal infarction. The possible atherogenic effect of cocaine and the relationship of this effect to renal infarct is likely to be a long term, rather than an acute factor. The diagnosis of CIRI is based on exclusion of other entities that cause renal infarct (e.g. hypercoagulable states due to factor deficiency, autoimmune diseases and thromboembolic events), in conjunction with documented cocaine use and appropriate radiographic studies. We highly recommend non-invasive evaluation of the renal arterial supply in patients with CIRI in order to broaden our knowledge of this disorder, and conceivably better understand its selectivity for one kidney. Thus far, there is no agreement on the management of patients with this disease. In fact, it is difficult to suggest a uniform therapeutic approach to this disorder because one cannot predict whether the infarct will be due to vasospasm, thrombosis or both. In addition, the extent of the renal infarct will likely influence clinical management and outcome. Although anticoagulation, antithrombotic, conservative managements as well as surgical approaches have been attempted with variable success, perhaps the most plausible treatment would be to prevent this misfortune by patient education.

### Cocaine-induced cerebral vasoconstriction detected in humans with magnetic resonance angiography… [^11469XQB]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

reporting median cocaine use of 8 lifetime exposures. Intervention. — Double-blind intravenous administration of cocaine or placebo, with cerebral magnetic resonance angiography performed at baseline and 20 minutes following infusion. Main Outcome Measure. — Cocaine-induced angiographic change indicative of vasoconstriction. Conclusions. — Cocaine administration induced dose-related cerebral vasoconstriction on magnetic resonance angiograms. These changes occurred at low cocaine doses and in the absence of other risk factors, including polydrug abuse, hypertension, or cerebrovascular disease. Outcome stratification by prior cocaine use statistically strengthened the relationship between cocaine administration and vasoconstriction. and the incidence of vasoconstriction was found. Raters determined that 5 of 8 subjects who received 0. 4 mg/kg cocaine experienced angiographic alterations from baseline images indicative of cerebral vasoconstriction.

These ranged from subtle differences in arterial caliber to more significant alterations, including focal narrowing or complete signal loss from a major arterial structure. cocaine doses, respectively. These values and their time course closely parallel those published in a recent report of the venous plasma cocaine level time course following intravenous cocaine administration. 30 These results are the first to document that intravenous administration of a relatively low dose of cocaine to otherwise healthy humans can induce angiographic changes indicative of cerebral vasoconstriction. This finding. suggests that low cocaine doses are sufficient to induce cerebrovascular dysfunction. The data also are suggestive of a dose-effect relationship between cocaine and vasoconstriction. It is currently unclear whether simple extrapolation from these findings to predict the occurrence of cerebral vasoconstriction in illicit cocaine abusers is appropriate. However, if cerebral vasoconstriction.

producing cerebrovascular dysfunction in addition to its acute vasoconstrictive effect. While additional studies with larger subject numbers will be needed to confirm this relationship, the current data suggest that the incidence of cocaine-induced cerebral vasoconstriction may be increased in individuals who escalate from occasional to regular cocaine use. a dose-effect relationship between cocaine and cerebral vasoconstriction. These results underscore the risks of single doses of cocaine in promoting cerebrovascular abnormalities, particularly in individuals with other risk factors. The data also strongly suggest that there is an increased risk of cerebrovascular dysfunction in individuals who are frequent or long-term cocaine.

### Ultrasound induced microbubble cavitation for the treatment of catheterization induced vasospasm [^112o61Qp]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that a brief application of diagnostic high MI impulses during a commercially available MB infusion may be an effective noninvasive method of treating catheter-induced vasospasm. This approach could have significant potential as a safe, effective, and noninvasive treatment for CIV in infants and children.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE Specific diagnostic US-mediated microbubble cavitation settings can be utilized to reverse vasospasm and improve tissue perfusion in porcine models of peripheral arterial spasm, which may be related to locally increased nitric oxide release. The methodology should next be examined for treatments in humans, and if successful could have therapeutic potential in the management of peripheral arterial injury and vasospasm.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK Diagnostic US-mediated microbubble cavitation could be a targeted method of locally augmenting endothelial responses in clinical situations where it may be beneficial to reverse vasoconstrictive states. Mechanistically, the role of specific chemical mediators needs to be further studied, as well as the cavitation events that optimize vasodilation and improved flow.

### Cognitive aids for the diagnosis and treatment of neuroanesthetic emergencies: consensus guidelines on behalf of the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care (SNACC) education committee [^111fHbRB]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) — incidence, impact, timing, risk factors, and monitoring are summarized as follows. Cerebral vasospasm in the purest sense is a radiologic diagnosis and is seen in up to 67% of patients who are imaged at the peak expected time of vasospasm after SAH, and of this number, 32.5% developed delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). From a clinical standpoint, symptomatology is likely not to develop until there is about 50% luminal narrowing, and vasospasm accounts for 10% to 50% of deaths after SAH in patients surviving the initial aneurysmal bleed. The highest risk time for DCI is 3 to 14 days after SAH, with peak incidence at days 7 to 8. Major risk factors include a larger amount of subarachnoid blood and poor clinical grade of the initial SAH, with other risk factors including age 40 to 59 years, history of hypertension, larger aneurysm size, intraventricular hemorrhage, hyperglycemia, smoking, and cocaine use; notably, the prophylactic use of induced hypertension has been associated with an increased risk of vasospasm. In management, routine monitoring tools may be either diagnostic or serve as a trigger for definitive investigations, and clinical, radiographic, and physiological monitoring are essential for early detection as responsiveness to pharmacological intervention decreases with time; the utility of clinical monitoring is less in patients with a larger initial insult.

### Guidelines for the neurocritical care management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114noJEz]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Hemodynamic management for delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in aSAH — blood pressure and cardiac output augmentation — There are insufficient quality data to recommend for or against blood pressure or cardiac output augmentation for the prevention and treatment of DCI, and due to associated risks, use should be judicious and tailored to the individual hemodynamic profile. The evidence base reviewed included eight RCTs and four observational comparative studies; a majority found no benefit of blood pressure augmentation in DCI outcomes, and a prospective cohort reported harm. Specific trials found no differences when prophylactic hypertensive hemodilution was compared with normovolemia in Hunt and Hess grade I to III patients, when norepinephrine-induced hypertension was compared with dobutamine-induced augmentation in cardiac index regarding angiographic vasospasm, and when hypervolemia and induced hypertension were tested in a two-by-two design with mRS outcomes; induced hypertension was associated with worse neurobehavioral scores and significant adverse events including pulmonary edema. In a multicenter RCT of symptomatic DCI, induced hypertension using fluids and norepinephrine continued until neurologic deficits improved, a maximum systolic/mean arterial pressure of 230/130 mm Hg was reached, or a complication occurred; the trial was stopped prematurely for slow recruitment and the authors noted a higher rate of poor outcome in the induced hypertension group. Two RCTs also evaluated EGDT protocols using a central line and noninvasive or invasive cardiac output monitoring to guide care before and after development of DCI.

### Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the impact of cocaine use, hunt-hess grade, and other risk factors [^115p6RH3]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is a common complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) that contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. While numerous identified CV risk factors exist, illicit substance use's influence, particularly cocaine, remains controversial. This study aims to elucidate relationships between known risk factors and CV's incidence, severity, and refractoriness.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on all aSAH patients between 2014 and 2023 with inclusion criteria of confirmed aneurysms on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and available urine drug screens (UDS). Demographic data, Hunt-Hess (HH), modified Fisher Scale (mFS), comorbidities, and vasospasm grades were collected. Outcomes, including vasospasm treatment counts, length of stay (LOS), and 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, were recorded.

Results

Of 88 patients, 43% experienced CV. Cocaine use was significantly more prevalent in the CV group (26% vs. 8%, p = 0.04) and increased CV risk (OR = 4.11, 95% CI: 1.25–16.13, p = 0.03), independent of other factors. Higher HH grades were associated with increased CV incidence (OR = 1.75, p = 0.01), severity (β = 0.271, p = 0.02), and 3-month mRS scores (β = 0.81, p < 0.001). Female sex also predicted vasospasm incidence (OR = 4.78, p = 0.01). Older age was associated with worse long-term outcomes (β = 0.05, p = 0.004). In the multivariable analysis, cocaine revealed a significant increased risk of CV incidence (OR = 5.79, p = 0.02). Higher HH grades significantly impacted CV severity (OR = 0.30, p = 0.01) and worse long-term outcomes (OR = 0.957, p < 0.01) in the multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Females, those with positive cocaine use on UDS, and a history of T2DM were at an increased risk of CV with no impact on severity, recurrence, or 3-month outcomes. Older age was associated with worse long-term outcomes. HH grade was significantly associated with increased vasospasm severity, refractoriness to treatment, and worse long-term outcomes as per mRS scores.

### Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the impact of cocaine use, hunt-hess grade, and other risk factors [^1112Mx2T]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of CV contributes to prolonged LOS, likely due to its association with complications and the need for additional treatments and extended monitoring. In patients with no evidence of radiographic vasospasm within 5–7 days of SAH, hospital stays were notably shorter. Our data confirms that LOS was increased in patients with at least one incidence of vasospasm. Due to the monitoring efforts required, such as transcranial Doppler, and further treatment paradigms of intra-arterial vasodilators or balloon angioplasty, longer hospital stays are not unreasonable in patients with symptomatic vasospasm.

Although there is abundant research supporting higher HH grades impacting vasospasm incidence, there exists limited data on the impact of HH grades on vasospasm severity and recurrence. Our findings reveal an association between HH grades ≥ 3 and increased vasospasm severity with no impact of HH grades on CV incidence. Previous studies show HH grades of 4 and 5 are increasingly associated with poorer long-term outcomes. Our data reveals higher HH grades, specifically 4 and 5, are associated with worse long-term functional outcomes and more deficits at the 3-month mark, which supports earlier findings.

Sex remained a positive predictor of vasospasm incidence in the single-variable analysis, and approaches significance in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Further investigation into the relationship between female sex and vasospasm incidence revealed no significant differences when controlling for age or race. The relationship between female sex and vasospasm has been explored across various clinical contexts, revealing significant associations that may be influenced by hormonal and age-related factors. Conversely, in cases of aSAH, female sex has been identified as a significant predictor of symptomatic vasospasm, with women, particularly those aged 55 to 74, being at higher risk for vasospasm-related complications; this heightened risk is likely due to hormonal changes associated with menopause. The influence of female sex hormones on vasospasm is further supported by studies on conditions like Raynaud's phenomenon, although patient-reported data does not consistently indicate a strong hormonal impact on vasospastic episodes. Furthermore, women exhibit greater sensitivity to coronary vasomotor dysfunction, including both coronary microvascular dysfunction and epicardial vasospasm, often at lower doses of acetylcholine compared to males. These findings underscore the complex interplay between sex, hormonal status, and vascular health, highlighting the need for further research to understand the mechanisms driving these sex-specific differences in incidence and severity.

### Crack cocaine causing fatal vasoconstriction of the aorta [^113QuRQu]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Cocaine is the most powerful central nervous stimulant found in nature. All forms of cocaine cause tachycardia and vasoconstriction. A smokable, rapidly reacting form of cocaine base, "crack", is highly addictive. Smoking crack introduces a high concentration of cocaine into the bloodstream, rendering it especially dangerous. We report a case that visually demonstrates severe aortic vasoconstriction from the suprarenal aorta and extending to both femoral arteries and beyond, resulting in renal failure and fatal bowel ischemia after a 5-day binge of crack cocaine.

### Effects of cocaine on the coronary arteries [^111GumCJ]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A number of studies have documented myocardial ischemia and infarction associated with cocaine use. Mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand from cocaine-induced vasoconstriction and increased myocardial workload are often invoked as the major postulated mechanism by which cocaine induces myocardial ischemia. This article reviews the literature studying the effects produced by cocaine on the coronary arteries to provide insight into the various pathophysiologic mechanisms by which cocaine triggers acute cardiac ischemia or infarction.

Methods

We reviewed the published literature describing the effects of cocaine on the coronary arteries. A MEDLINE search of English language articles published between 1985 and 2000 was performed. Key words included coronary arteries, coronary vasoconstriction, vasospasm, coronary vasodilation, cardiac vasculature, myocardial ischemia, platelets, thrombosis, and cocaine. Both animal and human studies were included. The bibliographies of identified articles were also explored for additional sources of information.

Results

A recreational dose of cocaine increases the heart rate by approximately 30 beats/min. It also increases the blood pressure by 20/10 mm Hg. These increases are modest, are equivalent to mild exercise, and are not believed to be sufficient to result in myocardial ischemia in the majority of cases. Animal and human studies have documented cocaine-induced early coronary artery vasodilation as shown by a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure ranging from 13% to 68%. This was followed by a more sustained vasoconstriction demonstrated by a decrease in epicardial coronary artery diameter ranging from 5% to 30% with various doses of cocaine by various methods of administration. These changes alone are also an unlikely explanation for cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia. Therefore neither increases in myocardial workload nor hemodynamic changes are sufficient to explain cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia. However, evidence also exists that cocaine activates platelets and promotes thrombosis, resulting in intracoronary thrombus formation. Cocaine may also promote premature and more severe coronary atherosclerosis.

Conclusion

The etiology of cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia is complex and is likely to be multifactorial. It appears to be the result of coronary artery vasoconstriction, intracoronary thrombosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis.

Beta blocker use in cocaine intoxication — risk context and consultation: Historically, beta blockers have been avoided when treating cocaine intoxication due to case reports theorizing risks associated with unopposed alpha stimulation, which can result in an acute increase in blood pressure and/or coronary artery vasoconstriction following beta blocker administration. Evidence suggests that this risk is lower than hypothesized, and a systematic review and meta-analysis found beta blockers were not associated with adverse events — including myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial necrosis, or death — during hospitalization and long-term follow-up; however, this issue remains an area of controversy in the field and for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology.

### Phenotype-based management of coronary microvascular dysfunction [^114GGJnY]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Microvascular angina

Although obviously a lot less accurate than the information provided by invasive coronary physiology studies and non-invasive tests such as PET or cardiac MRI perfusion scans, the clinical presentation with predominantly effort-induced angina, rest-angina suggestive of vasospasm or "mixed" effort and rest angina, helps clinicians to at least suspect the prevailing mechanism of angina in a given patient and identify suitable initial antianginal therapies. First line therapy in effort-induced MVA entails a trial of beta-blockers (selective beta-blockers, or combined alpha/beta-blockers) or calcium channel antagonists (dihydropyridine and/or non-dihydropyridine). Long-acting nitrates should be avoided in general, as they are frequently ineffective and may aggravate symptoms due to a 'steal effect'. However, up to 50% of MVA patients find short-acting sublingual nitrates, oral nitrates or skin GTN patches helpful. Nicorandil may be helpful in cases of vasospastic MVA, as it is in patients with variant angina. These therapies aid with vasodilatation as well as reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption.

Renin-angiotensin system blockade is recommended. ACE inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve hyperemic myocardial blood flow, CFR and angina burden in patients with MVA. Statins may have additional benefit in MVA, over and above standard lipid control and plaque modification. Studies suggest anti-inflammatory properties, increase in endothelial nitric oxide release and inhibition of the rho kinase pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which leads to vasodilatation.

Ranolazine is mentioned in guidance documents, with potentially better response in patients with low CFR.

Vasospastic angina

Patients with epicardial or microvascular spasm should undergo initial therapy with calcium channel blockade. This encourages vascular smooth muscle relaxation, reduces propensity toward spasm, and potentially reduces myocardial oxygen demand. High doses and/or a combination of non-dihydropyridine (verapamil or diltiazem) with dihydropyridine (amlodipine) calcium blockers may be required. In contrast to MVA, long-acting nitrates are useful adjuncts in epicardial spasm, while beta-blockers are avoided. Nicorandil is also an option.

Mixed (microvascular and vasospastic)

The combination of treatments in this group reflects the mixed pathologies described above. Calcium channel antagonists (dihydropyridine and/or non-dihydropyridine) are considered first line, followed by nicorandil and/or third line agents such as ranolazine or trimetazidine.

### A rare case of nitroglycerin resistant coronary arterial vasospasm during coronary artery bypass surgery [^1157Ta2Z]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the arterial graft spasms are not known. However, multiple factors might Interplay. For instance, vascular trauma secondary to coronary artery manipulation or cardioplegia infusion, platelet activation at the site of endothelial damage, high local concentrations of potassium, acid‐based disorders, hypomagnesemia, and induced ischemia. In addition, increased intracellular calcium has been reported to be a contributor since it mediates fine and powerful regulation of the interaction between the myosin and the actin filaments that regulate cellular contraction. This mechanism probably accounts for the successful results obtained when calcium channel‐blocking agents treat angina. Similarly, nitroglycerin may also provide epicardial coronary vasodilatation through a calcium‐mediated mechanism. Furthermore, a study published by Engelman reported four patients who experienced life‐threatening coronary vasospasm following the withdrawal of calcium channel blocker at the time of coronary revascularization. Withdrawal from preoperative intravenous nitroglycerin was reported as a potential cause of severe early post‐CABG spasm. Medication‐induced coronary artery spasm — such as potentially in our patient — may be influenced by the treatment of ADHD with dextroamphetamine‐amphetamine, perhaps contributing to the clinical presentation.

### Effects of a β-blocker on the cardiovascular response to MDMA (ecstasy) [^1135wW93]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'Ecstasy') produces tachycardia and hypertension and is rarely associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. In clinical practice, beta-blockers are often withheld in patients with stimulant intoxication because they may increase hypertension and coronary artery vasospasm due to loss of beta(2)-mediated vasodilation and unopposed alpha-receptor activation. However, it is unknown whether beta-blockers affect the cardiovascular response to MDMA.

Methods

The effects of the non-selective beta-blocker pindolol (20 mg) on the cardiovascular effects of MDMA (1.6 mg/kg) were investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 16 healthy subjects.

Results

Pindolol prevented MDMA-induced increases in heart rate. Peak values (mean ± SD) for heart rate were 84 ± 13 beats/min after MDMA vs 69 ± 7 beats/min after pindolol-MDMA. In contrast, pindolol pretreatment had no effect on increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after MDMA. Peak MAP values were 115 ± 11 mm Hg after MDMA vs 114 ± 11 mm Hg after pindolol-MDMA. Pindolol did not change adverse effects of MDMA.

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that beta-blockers may prevent increases in heart rate but not hypertensive and adverse effects of MDMA.

### Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low-risk patients with cocaine-associated chest pain [^1162hXPX]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with cocaine-associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a "rule out acute coronary syndrome" protocol, often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge. In patients without cocaine use, coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged. It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine-associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia. We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low-risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain (self-reported or positive urine test). Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED (without serial markers) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements. Patients with negative coronary CTA (maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged. The main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction.

Results

A total of 59 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Patients had a mean age of 45.6 ± 6.6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male. Seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85% had a TIMI score < 2. Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED, 18 of whom were discharged following CTA (90%). Thirty-nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following CTA (95%). Six patients had coronary stenosis ≥ 50%. During the 30-day follow-up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event (0%; 95% CI, 0–6.1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction (0%; 95% CI, 0–6.1%).

Conclusions

Although cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non-ischemic ECG, and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30-day adverse events.

### Safety of β-blockers in the acute management of cocaine-associated chest pain [^117Angnk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cocaine is the most commonly abused illegal drug in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) because of chest pain and accounts for almost 40% of all drug-related visits. It is not known whether all β-blockers (BB) and β1-selective agents or mixed α1/β-adrenergic antagonists (α1/β-BB) are safe in the acute management of cocaine-associated chest pain, due to concerns of unopposed α-receptor activity resulting in coronary artery spasm and hypertensive urgency.

Methods

Patients who presented to the EDs of 2 large inner city hospitals because of chest pain and who tested positive for cocaine were identified by retrospective chart review. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, vital signs, electrocardiographic abnormalities, medication use, comorbidities, and troponin values were documented. The presence and type of BB used were studied in relation to peak elevation in troponin T and troponin I. Troponin elevation was defined as a troponin I greater than 0.6 ng/mL and troponin T greater than 0.1 ng/mL if serum creatinine was less than 2 mg/dL.

Results

A total of 378 patients were included in the study; of these, 78% (n = 296) were black; 12% (n = 44), white; and 10% (n = 38), of other race. Twelve percent (n = 46) of the patients had typical chest pain, 22% (n = 84) had coronary artery disease, 56% (n = 213) had hypertension, and 21% (n = 79) had diabetes mellitus. The admission electrocardiogram showed changes (ST elevation, ST depression, or T-wave inversion) in 43% (n = 163) of the patients. β-Blockers were used in 43% (n = 162) of the encounters. Troponin elevation occurred in 11% (n = 42) of patients. There was no difference in the number of patients with troponin rise in the BB and non-BB groups, 22 of 162 vs 20 of 213 (P = .2). There was no difference in mean peak troponin levels in patients with troponin rise who were treated with BB vs no BB, 6.7 vs 5.7 ng/mL (P = .6). There was no difference in mean peak troponin levels in patients with troponin rise who were treated with a β1-selective agents vs a α1/β-BB, 7.5 vs 4.1 ng/mL (P = .4). No cases of hypertensive urgency were identified after taking any BB.

Conclusion

Troponin rise is not uncommon in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and occurred in 11% of the patients. In patients with cocaine-associated chest pain, BBs did not appear to change the incidence of troponin rise. β1-Selective BBs did not appear to worsen troponin levels compared with mixed α1/β-BB.

### Cocaine use is an independent risk factor for cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116dNjnR]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although acute cocaine use has been temporally associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), the prevalence of vasospasm and the clinical outcome of patients experiencing aSAH associated with cocaine exposure are unclear. We have analyzed this patient population in our institution to address these issues.

Methods

Between 1992 and 1999, 440 patients presented to our institution with aSAH. This sample was retrospectively analyzed to determine which patients had used cocaine within 72 hours of aSAH as documented by urine toxicology studies or patient history. These patients were then compared with control aSAH patients without recent cocaine exposure through univariable and multivariable analyses.

Results

Twenty-seven aSAH patients (6.1% of total) had either urine toxicology positive for cocaine metabolites (20 patients, 74%) or a history of cocaine use within 72 hours of aSAH (7 patients, 26%). Cocaine users were more likely to experience cerebral vasospasm defined as a delayed clinical deficit (from 3 to 16 days after aSAH) unexplained by concurrent CT scan and either responsive to hypervolemic and/or hypertensive therapy or accompanied by angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing than control subjects (63% versus 30%; odds ratio [OR], 3.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.77 to 8.62; P = 0.001). Patients using cocaine were younger than control subjects (mean age, 36 versus 52 years; P < 0.0001). Aneurysms of the anterior circulation were observed more frequently in cocaine users than in control subjects (97% versus 84%; OR, 6.89; 95% CI, 1.18 to 47.47; P = 0.029). A significant difference was not observed, however, in the discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores between the 2 groups (P = 0.73). Differences were not observed between the 2 groups when the distributions of sex, hypertension, admission Glasgow Coma Scale subarachnoid hemorrhage grade, and multiple aneurysms were analyzed. Logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with vasospasm and discharge GOS score. Only a thick blood clot on the admission CT (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 3.95 to 14.08; P < 0.0001) and recent cocaine use (OR, 6.41; 95% CI, 2.14 to 19.23; P = 0.0009) were independently associated with vasospasm. Cocaine use was not independently associated with the discharge GOS score.

Conclusions

We conclude that there is an increased prevalence of vasospasm in aSAH patients with recent cocaine exposure but no difference in clinical outcome. In addition, these patients are younger and more likely to have anterior circulation aneurysms.

### Imaging of heart disease in women: review and case presentation [^1139WFvx]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

CCTA also accurately assesses LVEF. Despite this, concerns related to radiation exposure in women limit the use of CCTA and ERNA to patients with low echogenicity and contraindications to CMR. Also, due to the increasing use of prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) gating, which has resulted in lower radiation dose and better image quality, assessment of LV volumes by CCTA is no longer ubiquitously available.

Case 1
Cardiac arrest in a 28-year-old woman. A 28-year-old woman with no medical history other than smoking was admitted to the intensive care unit after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation on ECG, return of spontaneous circulation after 8 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and external defibrillation. At admission, ECG revealed ST-elevation in the anterior leads. Echocardiography showed a hypokinetic left ventricular anterior wall. ICA was performed to rule out MI, showing normal coronary arteries (A) and a hypokinetic apex with mildly reduced LVEF of 45% (B, end-diastolic ventriculography; C, end-systolic ventriculography), suggestive of TTC. CMR performed 10 days later displayed normalization of LVEF and wall motion abnormalities (D, end-diastolic and E, end-systolic sequences on balanced SSFP cine sequences in 3-chambers view), and no sign of myocardial scar or edema on LGE and T1-mapping sequences (F, T1 inversion recovery LGE sequence in 3-chambers view) and was therefore not suggestive of TTC. Given the initial ECG and hypokinetic pattern suggestive of a transient reduced coronary flow in the LAD, coronary vasospasm was hypothesized. A second ICA with assessment of coronary microvascular function and coronary vasoreactivity testing was performed (G, ICA before pharmacological spasm provocation test). Assessment of coronary microvascular function confirmed normal coronary arteries (index of microcirculatory resistance = 10, N < 25; CFR = 4.5, N > 2). Following intracoronary infusion of 100 μg of acetylcholine, all 3 criteria for vasospastic angina were met, i.e. (i) a marked diffuse vasospasm, most pronounced in the proximal left anterior descending artery (H, red arrowhead), (ii) angina symptoms provoked by acetylcholine infusion, and (iii) ST-elevation on ECG. All these findings were completely reversed after administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin (I). Noteworthy, acetylcholine-induced coronary spasm can be induced at lower acetylcholine doses in women than in men, suggesting a higher sensitivity to vasospasms in the female population which could be related to the high prevalence of CMVD. Upon discharge, a defibrillator was implanted and long-term treatment with calcium-channel blockers and long-acting nitrates was introduced along with advises to cease smoking, which constitutes an important risk factor for coronary vasospasm. Given the fact that up to 80% of MINOCA patients are women, an epicardial origin to angina or, in this case, to cardiac arrest should not be dismissed before ruling out coronary vasospasm. ICA-based criteria are well established to diagnose epicardial vasospastic angina and should be discussed after the acute phase when no clear explanation for an ACS in a woman can be evidenced.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that of patients with aSAH, females, those with positive cocaine use on UDS, and history of T2DM were at an increased risk of CV with no impact on severity, recurrence, or 3-month outcomes. Older age was associated with worse long-term outcomes. HH grade was significantly associated with increased vasospasm severity, refractoriness to treatment, and worse long-term outcomes as per mRS scores.

### Cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in the human coronary microcirculation: new evidence from myocardial contrast echocardiography [^113XQND4]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cocaine is a major cause of acute coronary syndrome, especially in young adults; however, the mechanistic underpinning of cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome remains limited. Previous studies in animals and in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization suggest that cocaine constricts coronary microvessels, yet direct evidence is lacking.

Methods and Results

We used myocardial contrast echocardiography to test the hypothesis that cocaine causes vasoconstriction in the human coronary microcirculation. Measurements were performed at baseline and after a low, nonintoxicating dose of intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg) in 10 healthy cocaine-naïve young men (median age, 32 years). Postdestruction time-intensity myocardial contrast echocardiography kinetic data were fit to the equation y = A(1-e(-βt)) to quantify functional capillary blood volume (A), microvascular flow velocity (β), and myocardial perfusion (A×β). Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and left ventricular work (2-dimensional echocardiography) were measured before and 45 minutes after cocaine. Cocaine increased mean arterial pressure (by 14 ± 2 mm Hg [mean ± SE]), heart rate (by 8 ± 3 bpm), and left ventricular work (by 50 ± 18 mm Hg·mL(-1)·bpm(-1)). Despite the increases in these determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, myocardial perfusion decreased by 30% (103.7 ± 9.8 to 75.9 ± 10.8 arbitrary units [AU]/s; P < 0.01) mainly as a result of decreased capillary blood volume (133.9 ± 5.1 to 111.7 ± 7.7 AU; P < 0.05) with no significant change in microvascular flow velocity (0.8 ± 0.1 to 0.7 ± 0.1 AU).

Conclusions

In healthy cocaine-naïve young adults, a low-dose cocaine challenge evokes a sizeable decrease in myocardial perfusion. Moreover, the predominant effect is to decrease myocardial capillary blood volume rather than microvascular flow velocity, suggesting a specific action of cocaine to constrict terminal feed arteries.

### Clinical outcomes after treatment of cocaine-induced chest pain with beta-blockers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112negw3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines have suggested avoiding beta-blockers in the setting of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome. However, the available evidence is both scarce and conflicted. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the evidence pertaining to the use of beta-blockers in the setting of acute cocaine-related chest pain and its implication on clinical outcomes.

Methods

Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify literature relevant to patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who were treated with or without beta-blockers. We examined the end-points of in-hospital all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all outcomes using a random-effects model.

Results

Five studies with a total of 1447 patients were included. Our analyses found no differences between patients treated with or without beta-blockers for either myocardial infarction (RR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.61–1.91) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.46–1.24). Heterogeneity among included studies was low to moderate.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use is not associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients presenting with acute chest pain related to cocaine use.

Recreational drug use is a recognized cause of a number of acute vascular events. Cocaine is associated with a number of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and aortic dissection. Cutting agents are commonly used to dilute the amount of cocaine required to enhance the profits of the seller. Such cutting agents themselves often provoke acute vascular disease. We present the case of a 34-year-old female presenting with profound ischemia affecting all four limbs secondary to cocaine inhalation.

### RCVS: by clinicians for clinicians-a narrative review [^1179BkqD]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk factors and triggers

RCVS can occur spontaneously/idiopathically, without a precipitating factor; in other patients, it occurs secondarily (approximately 40–60% of cases). The precipitating factors and triggers of RCVS and TCH, respectively, are manifold (Table 4), which illustrates why the exact pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Trigger factors for the most severe headache in a patient's life can include coughing, bathing, physical exertion, Valsalva maneuvers, and sexual activity. Headaches caused by trigger factors may represent a primary headache disorder. However, when present in combination with focal neurological deficits and appropriate angiographic findings, these factors may be considered etiologically to be triggers of RCVS. According to two of the four main studies, the most frequent precipitating factors, accounting for 31% of cases overall, are vasoactive medications (especially serotonergic drugs) and the postpartum period. Vasoactive substances mainly include serotonergic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy); and triptans and sympathomimetics with serotonergic effects, such as over-the-counter drugs for upper respiratory tract infections (e.g. pseudoephedrine), amphetamines, cocaine, and ergot derivatives. The use of these substances in combination with each other or with cannabis or opioids (which also have known SSRI effects) has already led to fatal cases of RCVS. Vasoactive drugs act via specific receptors (antidepressants: 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A; triptans: 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D) located on smooth muscle cells in the area of peripheral and central blood vessels, and serotonergic–sympathomimetic synergism can cause potent cerebral/myocardial vasoconstriction. An important precipitating factor for men is cannabis use (up to 32% in the French case series), whose ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol can trigger vasoconstriction in different models. In up to 40% of RCVS cases, there is a history of migraine. One reason may be that triptans are precipitating factors for RCVS.

### Substance use in pregnancy and its association with cardiovascular events [^117HEAd3]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Cocaine is known to stimulate the sympathetic system, induce vasospasm and alter electrical signaling. In the general population, cocaine is an established risk factor for AMI, stroke, arrhythmia, CM/HF, and cardiac arrest. For pregnant women with reported cocaine use at delivery, we found an association with AMI, stroke, CM/HF, but not arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Opioid use alters cardiac physiology primarily through abnormal cardiac signaling by modifying electrical conduction and contractility, with a strong association with AMI, stroke, arrhythmia, CM/HF, cardiac arrest, and mortality. Only an increased association with AMI, CM/HF, and cardiac arrest were increased in women who abused opioids at delivery hospitalization. Opioids, as well as other substances with an intravenous route of administration, such as methamphetamine and cocaine, have an established association with endocarditis. This was similarly confirmed among pregnant women with opioid, cocaine, or methamphetamine use at delivery.

### Death temporally related to the use of a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist in cocaine associated myocardial infarction [^112dGA8F]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although it is commonly stated that the use of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists is contraindicated in patients with cocaine toxicity, actual clinical evidence of harm is lacking. This case helps to highlight the risks of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists in patients with chest pain associated with cocaine use.

Case Report

A 54-year-old man was brought to the emergency department (ED) complaining of chest pain after using approximately 1 gram of intranasal cocaine. Aspirin and nitroglycerin spray relieved his pain. Although he remained pain free, tachycardia persisted despite 15 mg of diazepam intravenously. Nearly two hours after presentation, a total of 5 mg of metoprolol was given for persistent tachycardia (115/minute) and an elevated troponin. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of crushing substernal chest pain, developed pulseless electrical activity, and could not be resuscitated.

Discussion

The administration of beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbates cocaine-induced lethality in animals. In humans given smaller doses of cocaine, beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbate coronary vasoconstriction. Both effects are presumed to occur through unopposed alpha adrenergic receptor agonism. Despite these data, actual cases describing adverse effects in cocaine users given beta adrenergic receptor antagonists are uncommon. This case supports the potential lethality of a cocaine-beta adrenergic receptor antagonist interaction.

### Systematic review of nephrotoxicity of drugs of abuse, 2005–2016 [^1122VCRB]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Cocaine

Cocaine use has increased in the United States in 2014–2015 due to the increase in cultivation of Coca in Colombia, but these levels are still below the 2006 levels. Cocaine seizures have increased and reached their highest since 2010; this is an indicator for increased cocaine availability. The per gram price of cocaine surged to its highest in the first quarter of 2015, while the purity of cocaine is at its all-time low. Levamisole, dexamisole and fentanyl are the usual adulterants found in cocaine seized by the DEA. Cocaine is available in two forms; as a salt (powder) with HCL and as an insoluble free base which is used as crack.

Vasoconstriction caused by cocaine is thought to result from uptake inhibition of catecholamines, serotonin and dopamine and increased release of norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. This surge of catecholamines increases alpha adrenergic stimulation which causes vascular smooth muscles to constrict. Cocaine up regulates vascular endothelin-1 receptors which causes decreased renal blood flow and GFR. Sustained cocaine-induced vasoconstriction has devastating effects that lead to renal hypertension even without signs of systemic hypertension. This hypertensive state causes renal damage and leads to kidney failure. Cocaine may also cause platelet adhesion and microaggregates. Detailed mechanisms and pathogenesis are beyond the scope of this study and can be found in studies by Zimmerman et al. and Jaffe et al. A combined effect of these proposed mechanisms can cause cocaine-induced renal infarcts (CIRI). Bemanian et al. reported lack of evidence of a thrombus or valvular vegetation and concluded that the vasoconstrictive effect and thrombogenicity of cocaine were the major causes of CIRI. Madhira et al. reported bilateral renal infarction due to vasospasm, confirmed by angiography. Similar cases were also reported. TMA has also been reported in relation to cocaine use. Two patients presenting with worsening renal function and hypertension, were shown to have no rhabdomyolysis on investigation, and a kidney biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of TMA. It would be safe to propose that renal infarction should be in the differential diagnosis of severe abdominal pain developing in cocaine users.

### Treatment advances for cocaine-induced ischemic stroke: focus on dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists [^115PTtoK]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors reviewed the pathogenesis of cocaine-related cerebral ischemia, appraised current knowledge of its sequelae, and assessed the role of putative therapeutic agents, particularly dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists.

Method

The authors performed an OVID-based literature review of all indexed journals between 1966 and 2000.

Results

Cocaine abuse significantly increases the risk of ischemic stroke. The principal mechanism of cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia is vasospasm of large cranial arteries or within the cortical microvasculature. Increased levels of extracellular monoamines, particularly dopamine, mediate vasospasm. Neuroanatomical and labeling studies also have shown that dopamine-innervated neurons may regulate cerebral blood flow. Indeed, dopamine-rich brain regions appear to be relatively specific targets for cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia. Neuroimaging studies show that cocaine-induced hypoperfusion can persist even after 6 months of abstinence. Hypoperfusion can result in deficits on complex and simple psychomotor tasks but perhaps not on memory or attention. Severe cerebral ischemia can directly precipitate neuronal death and degradation, a condition exacerbated by liberation of the excitatory amino acid glutamate. Dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists inhibit cocaine-mediated dopamine release on neurons involved in vasospasm and the control of cortical circulation. Other causes of cerebral ischemia include thrombogenesis and vasculitis. Although antithrombotic agents have potential in alleviating cocaine's neurotoxic effects, their use may be limited by the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Cocaine abuse can result in stroke, neuroischemia, and cognitive deficits that can persist even after prolonged abstinence. Dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists, such as isradipine, show promise as therapeutic agents for preventing cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia.

### Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the impact of cocaine use, hunt-hess grade, and other risk factors [^117CgUp4]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations that must be acknowledged. Firstly, the retrospective nature of the study limits the ability to establish causality between vasospasm incidence and any of the risk factors analyzed. Additionally, the reliance on chart reviews and the availability of admission urine drug screens (UDS) may have introduced selection bias, as only patients with documented UDS were included in the analysis. The sample size, while sufficient for initial analyses, may not be large enough to detect more subtle associations or to generalize the findings to broader populations. Furthermore, the study did not account for potential confounding variables such as the use of other vasoactive substances, antiplatelet therapy use at the time of admission, variations in treatment protocols, or the timing of cocaine use relative to the onset of vasospasm. Lastly, the study's single-center design limits the generalizability of the results, and the findings may not apply to other institutions with different patient populations or treatment approaches. Future studies should aim to address these limitations by utilizing prospective, multicenter designs with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive data collection.

Case Report

We are reporting on the treatment of a patient with cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome (CAACS) who did not benefit from standard therapy, but who eventually responded positively to phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist.

Discussion

This report should encourage physicians to add phentolamine to their pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of CAACS.

### Treatment of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity: a systematic review [^113H24q9]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cocaine abuse is a major worldwide health problem. Patients with acute cocaine toxicity presenting to the emergency department may require urgent treatment for tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm, leading to pathological sequelae such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and death.

Objective

The objective of this study is to review the current evidence for pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular toxicity resulting from cocaine abuse.

Methods

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 2015. Articles on pharmacological treatment involving human subjects and cocaine were selected and reviewed. Evidence was graded using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. Treatment recommendations were compared to current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Special attention was given to adverse drug events or treatment failure. The search resulted in 2376 articles with 120 eligible involving 2358 human subjects. Benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents: There were five high-quality (CEBM Level I/II) studies, three retrospective (Level III), and 25 case series/reports (Level IV/V) supporting the use of benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents in 234 subjects with eight treatment failures. Benzodiazepines may not always effectively mitigate tachycardia, hypertension, and vasospasm from cocaine toxicity. Calcium channel blockers: There were seven Level I/II, one Level III, and seven Level IV/V studies involving 107 subjects and one treatment failure. Calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and coronary vasospasm, but not necessarily tachycardia. Nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators: There were six Level I/II, one Level III, and 25 Level IV/V studies conducted in 246 subjects with 11 treatment failures and two adverse drug events. Nitroglycerin may lead to severe hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs: There were two Level I studies and three case reports. Alpha-1 blockers may improve hypertension and vasospasm, but not tachycardia, although evidence is limited. Alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonists: There were two high-quality studies and one case report detailing the successful use of dexmedetomidine. Beta-blockers and β/α-blockers: There were nine Level I/II, seven Level III, and 34 Level IV/V studies of β-blockers, with 1744 subjects, seven adverse drug events, and three treatment failures. No adverse events were reported for use of combined β/α-blockers such as labetalol and carvedilol, which were effective in attenuating both hypertension and tachycardia. Antipsychotics: Seven Level I/II studies, three Level III studies, and seven Level IV/V case series and reports involving 168 subjects have been published. Antipsychotics may improve agitation and psychosis, but with inconsistent reduction in tachycardia and hypertension and risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Other agents: There was only one high level study of morphine, which reversed cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction but increased heart rate. Other agents reviewed included lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate, amiodarone, procainamide, propofol, intravenous lipid emulsion, propofol, and ketamine.

Conclusions

High-quality evidence for pharmacological treatment of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity is limited but can guide acute management of associated tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm. Future randomized prospective trials are needed to evaluate new agents and further define optimal treatment of cocaine-toxic patients.

### Cachannel blockade reduces cocaine's vasoconstriction and neurotoxicity in the prefrontal cortex [^1146Xchc]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cocaine is not only a highly addictive drug but also one associated with significant neurotoxicity, including cerebral strokes, transient ischemic attacks as well as seizures. Clinical studies using brain imaging have documented profound reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brain of cocaine users, and preclinical optical imaging studies have reported similar findings in rodent models of cocaine exposure. However, the mechanisms associated with cocaine-induced CBF reductions and ischemia are not well understood, but may result from direct vasoconstriction elicited by cocaine-induced [Ca 2+] i increases in vascular smooth muscle cells and/or by parallel increases in neuronal activity that exacerbate tissue hypoxemia. Indeed cocaine alters neuronal ionic mechanisms, including neuronal K + and Ca 2+ conductance and influx/efflux. In pyramidal neurons from the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) cocaine increased voltage-sensitive calcium currents in response to membrane depolarization. Previously, we showed that in rodents chronically exposed to cocaine, an acute dose of cocaine triggered a long lasting reduction in CBF and persistent increases in deoxygenated hemoglobin ([HbR]) and in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca 2+] i), which we measured in the somatosensory cortex and that were associated with behavioral manifestations of temporal paralysis. Acute cocaine also triggered vasoconstriction and ischemia in naive rats but these effects were shorter lasting than in the chronically exposed rats suggesting sensitization with repeated exposure. Thus cocaine's vascular effects and its ability to increase neuronal [Ca 2+] i is likely to contribute to its neurotoxicity.

Results

Demographics

The mean age of patients in both the no-vasospasm and vasospasm groups was comparable (55 vs. 53 years, p = 0.97). However, there was a significant difference was observed in sex distribution, with females representing 89.5% of the vasospasm group compared to 64% in the no vasospasm group (p = 0.01). Cocaine use was significantly more common in the vasospasm group (26% vs. 8%, p = 0.04).

Racial distribution did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.78), with Black and Hispanic patients being predominant in both. There was also no significant difference in most comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Tobacco use (both current and ever) did not differ between groups. BMI was similar in both groups, with no significant difference (27 vs. 29 kg/m², p = 0.60). Neurological status, measured by the HH grade, was significantly higher in the vasospasm group (3 vs. 2, p = 0.01), but did not reach significance in the mFS (p = 0.057).

Patients with vasospasm had a significantly longer length of stay (14 vs. 21 days, p = 0.0001). Primary aneurysm location was not significantly different (p = 0.25). The 3-month mRS scores were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.94). (Table 1)

### Marijuana-associated ST-elevation myocardial infarction: is this a benign drug [^1164dHSp]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Marijuana is the most commonly used psychoactive drug in the USA. A 35-year-old man with a medical history of marijuana abuse is admitted to the hospital due to crushing substernal chest pain. ECG shows evolving ST-segment elevation with a rise in cardiac enzymes, consistent with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A urine toxicology screen is positive for cannabis and negative for cocaine and other stimulant drugs. An emergent cardiac catheterisation reveals no evidence of coronary artery disease or thrombosis. A diagnosis of coronary vasospasm is strongly considered, and the patient is started on calcium channel blocker, with a resolution of symptoms and ECG changes. Marijuana-induced coronary spasm causing myocardial infarction has rarely been reported. Marijuana is becoming a social norm in adolescents and there remains a misconception that it is harmless and even beneficial. Increasing drug abuse remains a public health concern, necessitating population education by physicians for safer healthcare practices.

### Cocaine-induced pseudo-wellens' syndrome: a wellens' phenocopy [^113YMFNk]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Wellens' syndrome represents critical occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Electrocardiographic changes similar to Wellens' wave are not exceptional to acute coronary occlusion and can also be seen in cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, persistent juvenile T wave, bundle branch blocks, cerebral haemorrhage, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary embolism, pheochromocytoma, Takotsubo syndrome, digitalis and cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Cocaine-induced pseudo-Wellens' syndrome should be considered as one of the differentials, since cocaine is used frequently by young adults and can cause left anterior descending coronary vasospasm mimicking Wellens' syndrome. Initiation of the beta-blocking agent in pseudo-Wellens' syndrome as a part of acute coronary syndrome management can be disastrous. We illustrated a case of cocaine-induced pseudo-Wellens' syndrome presented with typical chest pain associated with Wellenoid ECG.

### Cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the impact of cocaine use, hunt-hess grade, and other risk factors [^116Pvsr6]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The relationship between cocaine use and cerebral vasospasm has been increasingly recognized in recent years, with several studies highlighting the significant risks and clinical challenges associated with this condition. One study reported two cases of chronic cocaine users who experienced severe vasospasm during neurointerventional procedures, underscoring the heightened risk of iatrogenic vasospasm in this patient group. Another case report detailed the development of delayed cerebral ischemia and subsequent cortical blindness in a patient with a history of cocaine use, exacerbated by repeated cocaine use weeks after an aSAH. Additionally, a large inpatient study identified cocaine use as a significant risk factor for the development of cerebral vasospasm following traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, further highlighting the dangers associated with this substance. A comprehensive review discussed the mechanisms by which cocaine can lead to both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, emphasizing vasospasm as a primary mechanism of injury. Lastly, a small case series focused on the outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusions related to cocaine use, highlighting the role of vasospasm in contributing to poor outcomes in these cases. These studies collectively underscore the critical impact of cocaine use on cerebral vasospasm, illustrating the complex interplay between substance abuse and cerebrovascular pathology. Of studies looking specifically at the impact of cocaine use on the incidence of CV following aSAH, our findings were consistent with the findings throughout most of the literature showing an elevated risk of CV specifically in patients with recent cocaine use. Similar to some prior research, we too found no impact on the long-term clinical outcomes in these patients when compared to controls. We additionally looked at the severity of the CV and the degree of refractoriness to treatment, as indicated by the number of repeated treatments required, and found no difference between those with premorbid substance use and those without.

Amongst all the patients diagnosed with RCVS, 35 (44%) patients were non‐smokers, 26 (33%) current smokers and 13 (16%) were ex‐smokers. There was no information about tobacco use in six (8%) patients.

Three (4%) patients started using a nasal decongestant shortly before symptom onset. One patient used triptans for migraine headaches almost daily for several weeks before symptom onset. One patient had TCH about 2 weeks after consuming cocaine. There were no mentions of new medications or drugs started within 3 months before symptom onset in other patients. Although one patient was undergoing cancer therapy, cytostatic treatment with bevacizumab was ongoing for months before first RCVS symptoms.

Twenty‐two (28%) patients had a previous diagnosis of migraine, 10 were diagnosed with unspecified migraine, six with migraine with aura and six with migraine without aura. Fifty‐eight (73%) patients had no previous history of migraine. Seven (9%) patients were previously suffering from chronic headaches that did not fulfil migraine or other specific headache criteria (chronic headache NOS (not otherwise specified)). Two (3%) patients had previous experience of TCH that was not caused by aneurysm rupture or RCVS. Two (3%) patients were previously diagnosed with cluster headaches and two (3%) patients were diagnosed with tension headaches. Fourteen (18%) patients had history of depression, anxiety or both before symptom onset.

One patient had a previous diagnosis of RCVS before current symptom onset.

### Surgical reconstruction of the left main coronary artery with patch-angioplasty [^115FwAtD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Coronary angiography is the standard procedure used to identify definitive coronary anatomy. Other methods are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Doppler-echocardiography, preferably by transesophageal approach. The proximal parts of the main coronary artery can be visualized very well by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and by electron-beam CT scanning. Invasive catheterization can lead to mechanically induced spasm of coronary arteries. In the cases of unclear or suspected LMCA stenosis, CT angiography can be performed to unmask catheter-induced coronary spasm as the underlying reason for isolated left main coronary artery stenosis seen in invasive angiography. Coronary vasospasm is defined as a decrease in the caliber of the coronary arteries with evidence of ischemia, commonly known as variant or Prinzmetal's angina. This degree of ischemia may be significant enough even in patients with normal coronaries to produce myocardial damage as indicated by elevated cardiac troponin I and cardiac arrest. Variant angina typically occurs during rest or at night. Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for coronary vasospasm. Additional factors implicated in vasospasm include hypocalcemia, sotalol, pseudoephedrine, hyperventilation and cocaine use. 10 of 37 patients in our cohort, reffered for surgical reconstruction of the LMCA had no really stenosis. The LMCA could have easily passed with a 5 mm probe. 8 of them had a concomitant aortic valvular disease. Dyspnea was a predominant symptom in these patients. A heavy spasm must have been occurred during angiography. For safety reasons one vein bypass was performed as suggested by Soga et al. In our opinion these patients have benefited of the plan to perform the reconstruction. Otherwise a competitive flow after CABG with patent LMCA would have consumed the grafts in this cohort very soon.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^111Wph89]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chest pain during stimulant intoxication — For patients experiencing chest pain during stimulant intoxication, clinicians should initiate treatment for the underlying intoxication with GABAergic agents (eg, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol) as long as there are no clinical contraindications (Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Alternative agents (eg, calcium channel blockers, vasodilators) are generally preferred for management of cardiac ischemia in patients experiencing stimulant intoxication; however, if beta blockers are used in patients with stimulant intoxication, clinicians should consider using a medication with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (eg, carvedilol, labetalol), and if an unopposed beta blocker was used, clinicians should also consider providing a coronary vasodilator (eg, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blocker); for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). While treating underlying stimulant intoxication in patients experiencing chest pain, clinicians should concomitantly evaluate for ACS and other causes of acute chest pain in stimulant intoxication, and chest pain that does not fully resolve as signs and symptoms of stimulant intoxication improve should be evaluated and treated following current standards of care (Moderate certainty, Strong Recommendation).

### Cocaine-induced ischemia in prefrontal cortex is associated with escalation of cocaine intake in rodents [^117EUQVZ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Cocaine-induced vasoconstriction reduces blood flow, which can jeopardize neuronal function and in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) it may contribute to compulsive cocaine intake. Here, we used integrated optical imaging in a rat self-administration and a mouse noncontingent model, to investigate whether changes in the cerebrovascular system in the PFC contribute to cocaine self-administration, and whether they recover with detoxification. In both animal models, cocaine induced severe vasoconstriction and marked reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the PFC, which were exacerbated with chronic exposure and with escalation of cocaine intake. Though there was a significant proliferation of blood vessels in areas of vasoconstriction (angiogenesis), CBF remained reduced even after 1 month of detoxification. Treatment with Nifedipine (Ca 2+ antagonist and vasodilator) prevented cocaine-induced CBF decreases and neuronal Ca 2+ changes in the PFC, and decreased cocaine intake and blocked reinstatement of drug seeking. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that cocaine-induced CBF reductions lead to neuronal deficits that contribute to hypofrontality and to compulsive-like cocaine intake in addiction, and document that these deficits persist at least one month after detoxification. Our preliminary data showed that nifedipine might be beneficial in preventing cocaine-induced vascular toxicity and in reducing cocaine intake and preventing relapse.

### A rare case of nitroglycerin resistant coronary arterial vasospasm during coronary artery bypass surgery [^116qU7wn]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Patient Presentation

A 47‐year‐old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and former tobacco use presented to an outside hospital with complaints of cardiac chest pain associated with shortness of breath. The symptoms commenced 12 h before presentation and were partially relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin; however, the patient required eight doses for symptom control. Her home medications included oral diltiazem (240 mg daily), isosorbide mononitrate (30 mg daily) for anginal chest pain, and dextroamphetamine–amphetamine (20 mg daily) for attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Upon presentation, she was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, normotensive, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute. Initial laboratory tests revealed troponin I levels of 0.037 and 0.023 ng/mL, with a subsequent measurement below 0.020 ng/mL. Electrocardiography (EKG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes. A nuclear cardiac stress test revealed high risk stress test with large anterior, septal, and lateral ischemia (Figure 1). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%, and no wall motion abnormalities. The patient subsequently underwent an elective coronary angiogram, which revealed 95% stenosis vs Catheter tip associated vasospasm of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) that did not respond to intracoronary nitroglycerin (Figure 2). Of note, no other coronary vasodilators were given, no intracoronary imaging was performed, and no Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) was ordered to confirm atherosclerotic versus vasospastic nature of the stenosis. No significant disease was noted in the right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCx), or LIMA. The right iliac and common femoral arteries were normal. Given the findings, she was transferred to our facility for CABG.

### Cocaine-associated hemoperitoneum following atraumatic splenic rupture: a case report and literature review [^113xcs3B]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Cocaine use remains epidemic and is associated with a wide range of medical complications. The well-studied physiologic effects of cocaine include increased norepinephrine reuptake with sustained alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation and resultant vasoconstriction. Cocaine-associated vasoconstriction was shown to transiently reduce splenic volume on average by 20%. This vasoconstriction transiently elevates blood pressure. In addition, increased abdominal venous pressure due to cough could suggest an inciting event for splenic hemorrhage in this patient. This has been previously described in a case report of a patient with hemoperitoneum after ingestion of cocaine and associated acute emesis; however, no etiologic source or evidence of underlying pathology was found.

Splenic infarction following cocaine use is rare but has been described, particularly in patients with sickle hemoglobinopathies. It is plausible that cocaine-associated splenic hematoma or rupture results from transient vasospasm with subsequent bleeding into the infarcted area. Secondary infection of the infarcted spleen with resultant sepsis and death has also been detailed.

While the use of cocaine causing hematoma of the spleen has been described, this case is the first report of a case that details hemoperitoneum caused by ASR following cocaine use. Although uncommon, the potential for death due to splenic rupture warrants awareness and highlights the importance of a social history in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain.

Consent

Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.

### Isradipine decreases the hemodynamic response of cocaine and methamphetamine results from two human laboratory studies: results from two human laboratory studies [^116W2AEJ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Massive hypertensive crises relating to cerebrovascular accidents such as strokes or ruptured aneurysms, or cardiovascular dysfunction and toxicity, are an important cause of morbidity and mortality associated with cocaine or methamphetamine use. Experimentally administered, pharmacologically effective doses of cocaine and methamphetamine may serve as a model for studying the effects of these drugs on hemodynamic response and for examining the potential utility of the antihypertensive and dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonist isradipine to block these effects. We therefore examined, in two separate experiments of similar design conducted contemporaneously, the hemodynamic effects of cocaine or methamphetamine in the presence and absence of isradipine.

Methods

In both experiments (total N = 31), isradipine pretreatment was provided to cocaine- or methamphetamine-dependent male and female subjects before intravenous administration of low and high doses of cocaine (0.325 or 0.650 mg/kg) or methamphetamine (15 or 30 mg), respectively, on separate test days.

Results

Both cocaine and methamphetamine administration produced predicted elevations in blood pressure (with peak response between 1 and 3 min after infusion). Apart from tachycardia, no arrhythmias were reported. Isradipine significantly reduced stimulant-associated increases in all measures of blood pressure except pulse pressure, but tended to enhance the effects of these drugs on heart rate.

Conclusions

Clinical studies are needed to determine whether isradipine is therapeutically efficacious in preventing hypertensive crises and the associated cerebrovascular and cardiovascular sequelae in cocaine- or methamphetamine-dependent individuals. As there is no established pharmacotherapy for treating cocaine or methamphetamine dependence, identification of a medication that reduces the harmful medical consequences of these drugs would be scientifically and clinically important.

### Cocaine-associated chest pain [^117Wguno]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Current estimates establish that more than 30 million people in the United States use cocaine. Cardiovascular complaints commonly occur among patients who present to emergency departments(EDs) after cocaine use, with chest pain the most common complaint in several studies. Although myocardial ischemia and infarction account for only a small percentage of cocaine-associated chest-pain, physicians must understand the pathophysiology of cocaine and appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies to best manage these patients and minimize adverse outcomes. This article reviews the pharmacology of cocaine, its role in the pathogenesis of chest pain with specific emphasis on inducing myocardial ischemia and infarction, and current diagnostic and management strategies for cocaine-associated chest pain encountered in the ED.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1166TQTh]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant intoxication — assessment and hyperadrenergic symptom management — clinicians should assess hyperadrenergic signs and symptoms, including tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and agitation, and ongoing monitoring and management of vital signs — especially heart rate and blood pressure — is critical to prevent complications from sympathomimetic toxicity. GABAergic agents are the primary treatment for stimulant-related hyperadrenergic symptoms, and significant hyperadrenergic symptoms should typically be managed in an acute care setting. For cocaine intoxication with cardiovascular disease, beta blockers are generally contraindicated; many experts recommend alternative medications such as calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators, noting these classes may be most beneficial for hypertension and vasospasm but may result in poor control of reflex tachycardia. Limited data indicate that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g., dexmedetomidine for more severe symptoms, clonidine for mild to moderate symptoms) are beneficial for stimulant-induced agitation, can be useful for hypertension and tachycardia, and thus should be considered in the management of the hyperadrenergic state of stimulant intoxication; clinicians should monitor for medication side effects with usual care. If considering pharmacotherapy with a beta blocker, one with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (e.g., labetalol) is preferred due to low risk of unopposed alpha stimulation, and clinicians should consider consulting with a specialist in these instances; additionally, calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and vasospasm but not necessarily tachycardia, and benzodiazepines appear safe for non-cardiovascular related symptoms.

### A rare case of nitroglycerin resistant coronary arterial vasospasm during coronary artery bypass surgery [^117SWMnP]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Coronary artery vasospasm following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a rare but potentially life‐threatening complication that can lead to myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock. Nitroglycerin‐resistant vasospasm, particularly involving the left main coronary artery (LMCA), poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Case Presentation

We report the case of a 47‐year‐old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and ADHD on dextroamphetamine‐amphetamine, who presented with chest pain and was found to have a suspected severe LMCA lesion. Coronary angiography revealed a 95% LMCA stenosis that was unresponsive to intracoronary nitroglycerin, raising concern for catheter‐induced vasospasm versus true stenosis. The patient underwent urgent CABG. Intraoperatively and postoperatively, she experienced recurrent, diffuse coronary vasospasm refractory to nitroglycerin, necessitating multiple interventions including mechanical circulatory support with intra‐aortic balloon pump and percutaneous ventricular assist device. Coronary angiography confirmed severe diffuse coronary and peripheral vasospasm. The patient was managed with intravenous vasodilators, vasopressors, and supportive care, and eventually recovered with restoration of cardiac function and discharge to cardiac rehabilitation.

Discussion

This case underscores the difficulty in differentiating vasospasm from true atherosclerotic disease in the LMCA, the potential for nitroglycerin resistance, and the risk of severe complications during CABG. The use of adjunctive imaging modalities, vasodilators beyond nitroglycerin, and early mechanical circulatory support may be critical in managing such complex cases.

Conclusion

Nitroglycerin‐resistant coronary vasospasm, especially in the LMCA, can mimic fixed stenosis and lead to inappropriate surgical intervention and life‐threatening complications. A multidisciplinary, imaging‐guided approach is essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal management.
