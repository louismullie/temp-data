## Question

Clotrimazole troches for otitis externa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clotrimazole troches/lozenges are appropriate for treating otitis externa and, if not, what evidence-based alternatives should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and route/formulation for clotrimazole troches. Then, I should clarify the microbiology and clinical spectrum of otitis externa. Next, I will check guidelines and trial data for otic therapies, including any role for clotrimazole in otomycosis. Then, I need to assess formulation suitability and safety for otic use. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation based on regulatory labeling, guidelines, and clinical evidence.

> Let me first confirm the product details and labeled use. Clotrimazole 10 mg lozenges (troches) are designed for topical use in the mouth for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis and for select prophylaxis in immunocompromised hosts; they are not indicated for systemic mycoses, and the labeling does not describe otic use or administration to the ear canal, with contraindication in patients hypersensitive to components and noted adverse effects including abnormal liver function tests, nausea, and oral discomfort [^113ttYRg] [^116SpSYx] [^1112Loy4] [^114aMxnt] [^116KS12k].

> Next, I should review what we are treating. Acute otitis externa is usually bacterial (about 90%, commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus), whereas fungal otitis externa (otomycosis) accounts for roughly 10%; malignant or necrotizing otitis externa is an invasive, high-morbidity entity in older, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients that requires systemic therapy and subspecialty care [^115nN2h8] [^114tQTwk] [^111wNmKS] [^1118uZcV].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory scope before jumping to off-label considerations. The FDA troche labels make no mention of ear disease or otic administration, and approved indications are strictly limited to oropharyngeal candidiasis treatment and narrowly defined prophylaxis; there is no otic indication or instruction for use in the external auditory canal [^113ttYRg] [^116SpSYx].

> I will now examine whether clotrimazole has evidence in ear disease at all. Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific data: topical clotrimazole 1% otic solution has demonstrated efficacy for otomycosis, including a phase 3 trial showing high complete response rates comparable to eberconazole, and reviews and guidelines for otomycosis consistently support topical azole therapy with debridement; the IDSA also recommends mechanical cleansing plus topical antifungals (e.g., azoles) for noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa, but none of these data involve troches or oral mucosal dosage forms used in the ear canal [^115J1JrX] [^117RDHee] [^115YTLxE] [^115N9TDv].

> Let me think about formulation suitability because route and excipients matter. A solid, slowly dissolving oral troche is physically incompatible with the narrow, variably edematous ear canal; it will not distribute as needed across canal epithelium, its excipients are not formulated for otic tissues or sterility, and if the tympanic membrane is not intact, non-ototoxicity cannot be assured; otic therapy requires drops or solutions with appropriate pH and safety for potential middle-ear exposure, which troches cannot provide [^114C4PPy] [^1157U72e].

> Next, I should review practice guideline recommendations to ensure alignment. The AAO-HNSF acute otitis externa guidelines recommend topical preparations as initial therapy, instruction on proper drop administration, aural toilet and/or wick placement if obstructed, avoidance of systemic antibiotics unless specific host factors or extension are present, use of non-ototoxic agents when the tympanic membrane is perforated or tubes are present, and reassessment at 48–72 hours if not improving; there is no role for troches or other solid dosage forms in the ear canal per these guidelines [^115o9R8F] [^116ZLvWP] [^113YUrtu] [^114C4PPy] [^116cTiiN].

> Hold on, I should verify safety concerns specific to the troche if misused in the ear. Beyond lacking any evidence base or labeling for otic use, troches could act as a retained foreign body, traumatize canal skin, and introduce non-sterile excipients; the adverse event profile of lozenges, including abnormal liver tests and gastrointestinal effects, underscores that their pharmacokinetics and tolerability are characterized for oral mucosa, not the external auditory canal or the middle ear space in the event of a perforation [^116KS12k] [^116TQkW2] [^113ttYRg].

> I should now outline appropriate, evidence-based alternatives for bacterial acute otitis externa. Topical fluoroquinolone otic drops are first-line and guideline-concordant, with FDA-labeled options including ofloxacin otic and ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone (Ciprodex); dosing is age- and indication-specific, and high-quality evidence supports efficacy, with recent RCT data showing the addition of a topical steroid to ciprofloxacin can further improve outcomes compared with ciprofloxacin alone in AOE, while maintaining safety in patients with intact tympanic membranes per trial criteria [^1157U72e] [^116bNuHN] [^116mKAFi] [^11753HNM].

> For suspected fungal otitis externa (otomycosis), I should double-check that azole drops are supported. After meticulous debridement and cleansing, topical azole antifungals such as clotrimazole 1% solution are effective and commonly used; RCT data support clotrimazole otic solution efficacy, and systematic reviews corroborate benefit across topical azoles; select reviews also note practical use of clotrimazole cream in the canal in specific scenarios, though otic solutions are generally preferred for distribution and comfort; again, this is not the troche dosage form [^115J1JrX] [^117RDHee] [^115YTLxE] [^111LWvFY].

> But wait, what if the presentation suggests malignant otitis externa or the patient is at high risk? I need to ensure we escalate appropriately: malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa requires early ENT involvement, systemic antipseudomonal therapy, imaging to assess skull base involvement, and prolonged management, with fungi considered in refractory or atypical cases; topical agents alone are inadequate in this scenario [^111wNmKS] [^1118uZcV].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should confirm the bottom line. Clotrimazole troches/lozenges are not appropriate for otitis externa because they lack any FDA otic indication, have no supporting clinical evidence for ear canal use, are physically and pharmaceutically incompatible with otic administration, conflict with guideline-endorsed topical liquid therapies, and raise safety concerns if placed in the ear; instead, use guideline-recommended otic drops for bacterial AOE (e.g., ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin with or without steroid) and azole otic solutions for otomycosis after debridement, with urgent escalation for suspected malignant disease [^113ttYRg] [^115o9R8F] [^1157U72e] [^116mKAFi] [^115J1JrX] [^115N9TDv].

---

Clotrimazole troches are **not appropriate for otitis externa** because they are formulated for oropharyngeal use [^113ttYRg] and are not intended for otic administration [^116SpSYx]. The **standard of care is topical otic drops** [^115o9R8F] with antibacterial [^11753HNM] or antifungal agents [^115N9TDv], depending on the pathogen. Clotrimazole **1% otic solution or cream may be used** [^117RDHee] for fungal otitis externa (otomycosis), but troches should not be used in the ear canal [^113ttYRg].

---

## Pharmacological properties of clotrimazole troches

Clotrimazole troches are designed for **oropharyngeal candidiasis** [^113ttYRg], delivering local antifungal activity in the mouth and throat. They are **not formulated for otic use** and should not be administered into the ear canal [^116SpSYx].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines for otitis externa treatment

Otitis externa is primarily bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) [^115o9R8F] and is managed with topical antibacterial drops [^1157U72e]. Fungal otitis externa (otomycosis) is less common and is treated with topical antifungals [^117RDHee], such as clotrimazole 1% otic solution or cream [^115N9TDv]. There is **no evidence** [^111qDrVB] or guideline support [^115o9R8F] for clotrimazole troches in otitis externa.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Clotrimazole troches are not intended for otic use [^113ttYRg], and excipients may cause irritation or adverse reactions if placed in the ear canal. Troches are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component [^114aMxnt]. Using troches in the ear canal is **off-label and unsupported** by evidence or guidelines [^115o9R8F].

---

## Alternative antifungal treatments for otitis externa

For fungal otitis externa, topical antifungals, such as **clotrimazole 1% otic solution or cream**, are recommended [^115N9TDv] [^117RDHee]. These formulations are designed for otic use and have demonstrated efficacy and safety in clinical practice [^115J1JrX].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Clotrimazole troches are **not appropriate for otitis externa** because they are formulated for oropharyngeal use [^113ttYRg] and are not intended for otic administration [^116SpSYx]. The **standard of care is topical otic drops**, with antibacterial or antifungal agents selected based on the pathogen [^115o9R8F] [^117RDHee]. Clotrimazole **1% otic solution or cream may be used** for fungal otitis externa [^117RDHee], but troches should not be used in the ear canal [^113ttYRg].

### Comparison of safety and efficacy of foam-based versus solution-based ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa [^113E8enP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of a foam-based antibiotic formulation in the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE) with the more conventional solution-based formulation.

- **Study design**: Phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Multicenter.

- **Subjects and methods**: Sixty-three eligible adult patients with unilateral AOE were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: an experimental 0.3 percent foam-based ciprofloxacin (FoamOtic Cipro) or 0.3 percent solution-based ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan). All patients received the same dosage regime (twice daily for 7 days). The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy (cure) at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary variables included improvement of the disease symptoms such as otalgia, tenderness, edema, and otorrhea.

- **Results**: Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study. Seven patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis due to major deviations from the protocol. Per-protocol analysis (n = 57) showed that cure was achieved in all the patients (P = 1.000). No significant differences were found between groups for symptomatic relief, resolution of otic discharge, or onset of pain reduction. Both treatments were found to be highly efficacious and safe, demonstrating the noninferiority of the experimental drug.

In conclusion, foam-based ciprofloxacin is a safe and effective new treatment for AOE.

### Otitis externa [^112WcHnY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. It may be associated with eczema of the ear canal and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with absence of ear wax or with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007. Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, so please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.

### Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography for malignant otitis externa: Lesion not shown on planar image [^114gzoZx]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Malignant otitis externa is a severe and rare infection of the external acoustic meatus. Triphasic bone and (67)Ga scintigraphies are used to initially detect and follow up on the response to therapy. With single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography images, the diagnostic sensitivity is higher. We presented a case with malignant otitis externa with an initial negative planar scintigraphic finding. The lesion was detected by photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography images. We concluded that the photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography should be performed routinely for patients with suspected malignant otitis externa, even without evidence of a lesion on planar images.

### Ofloxacin [^116f7iv9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosage and administration:

- **Otitis externa**: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of otitis externa is as follows:
	- **For pediatric patients (from 6 months to 13 years old)**: Instill five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) into the affected ear once daily for seven days.
	- **For patients 13 years and older**: Instill ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) into the affected ear once daily for seven days.

	- The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness, which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and the drops should then be instilled. This position should be maintained for five minutes to facilitate the penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

- **Acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes**: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients (from 1 to 12 years old) with tympanostomy tubes is as follows:
	- Instill five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) into the affected ear twice daily for ten days.

	- The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness that may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and the drops should then be instilled. The tragus should be pumped four times by pushing inward to facilitate the penetration of the drops into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate [^112Z6JY6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

No comparative studies have been conducted with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate lotion and clotrimazole alone. The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of a fungal infection may lead to the suppression of host inflammation, resulting in a worsening condition or decreased cure rate.

Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole following the topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate lotion have not been studied. The following information was obtained using 1% clotrimazole solution formulations. Six hours after applying radioactive clotrimazole 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm³ in the stratum corneum to 0.5 to 1 mcg/cm³ in the reticular dermis, and 0.1 mcg/cm³ in the subcutis. No measurable amount of radioactivity (< 0.001 mcg/mL) was found in the serum within 48 hours after the application under an occlusive dressing of 0.5 mL of the solution. Only 0.5% or less of the applied radioactivity was excreted in the urine.

- **Microbiology**:
	- **Mechanism of action**: Clotrimazole is an imidazole antifungal agent. Imidazoles inhibit 14-α-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-α-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting the growth of fungi.

### Acute otitis externa: Efficacy and tolerability of N-chlorotaurine, a novel endogenous antiseptic agent [^112Jn1XD]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

The study's objective was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the endogenous antiseptic N-chlorotaurine (NCT) compared to standard clinical treatment following a phase IIb clinical trial protocol. The antimicrobial agent NCT was compared with Otosporin, which contains neomycin, polymyxin B, and hydrocortisone, for the topical treatment of acute otitis externa in a randomized and rater-blinded clinical study.

Fifty patients suffering from acute otitis externa were divided into two groups based on a randomized list. The test group received 1 mL of 1% aqueous NCT solution, while the reference group received 1 mL of Otosporin. These substances were applied to the external ear canal during one daily session until the signs of infection disappeared. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed daily using a visual analogue scale and a six-step infection score. Additionally, smears were analyzed to identify causative pathogens.

Both medications were equally well tolerated by the patients. Treatment was successful for all patients in the NCT group, with only one patient in the reference group not experiencing resolution of the infection. The inflammation score decreased more rapidly in the NCT group, leading to an earlier cessation of therapy. This difference became notably significant between days 4 to 7 (P < 0.01 each). The time required for the disappearance of inflammation (score 0) was 5.6 ± 1.6 days (mean ± SD, range 3–9 days) in the NCT group compared to 7.4 ± 1.6 days (range 4–10 days) in the Otosporin group (P < 0.001).

### Topical azole treatments for otomycosis [^117RDHee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the outer ear, which may be treated with topical antifungal medications. There are many types, with compounds belonging to the azole group ('azoles') being among the most widely used.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the benefits and harms of topical azole treatments for otomycosis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The search date was 11 November 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with otomycosis. The comparison was made between any topical azole antifungal with placebo, no treatment, another type of topical azole, or the same type of azole but applied in different forms. A minimum follow-up of two weeks was required.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Standard Cochrane methods were used. Our primary outcomes were: 1) clinical resolution, as measured by the proportion of participants with complete resolution between two and four weeks after treatment (as defined by the authors of the studies), and 2) significant adverse events. Secondary outcomes included 3) mycological resolution and 4) other less serious adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

- **Main results**: We included four studies with 559 participants from Spain, Mexico, and India. Three studies included both children and adults; one included only adults. The duration of the studies varied.

### External and middle ear diseases: Radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^116Yi4Nb]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Pathology of the external and middle ear is the most frequent reason to prescribe antibiotics and perform surgery in children and young adults. In the majority of cases, imaging studies are not performed; the need for imaging arises when complications are suspected or when treatment is not effective. This paper discusses indications for temporal bone imaging studies and presents the most frequent pathological conditions, along with differential diagnosis, clinical symptoms, and methods of treatment.

- **Methods and results**: This pictorial review describes major external and middle ear diseases, with special regard to clinical findings and appropriate reporting.

- **Conclusions**: Apprehension of the complete clinical picture, together with imaging clues, narrows differential diagnosis and helps avoid mistakes. Evaluation of temporal bone pathologies requires close cooperation between the clinician and radiologist.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

- **Study design**: In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created using an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

- **Results**: The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group also recommended that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (such as a nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, or prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE. Systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is an extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy.

### Is biofilm the cause of chronic otitis externa [^116FqkWY]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

This study was undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, we considered patients affected by chronic external otitis treated either by chemical ear peeling (CEP) or by antibiotic/steroid treatment to compare the clinical and microbiological outcomes. In the second phase, we compared the microscopic findings observed in the CEP samples of patients affected by chronic otitis externa's acute exacerbation or by acute otitis externa to demonstrate the role of biofilm in the pathogenesis of chronic otitis externa.

- **Study design**: Prospective, double-blind, controlled study.

- **Methods**: In phase 1, we compared clinical and microbiological data collected from two groups of 25 patients with chronic otitis externa treated by CEP or by conventional antibiotic/steroid treatment. In phase 2, we compared the results of the optical and electron microscopic analysis of specimens obtained by performing CEP in two groups of patients (25 with chronic otitis externa exacerbation and 15 with acute otitis externa).

- **Results**: In phase 1, the disease control rate yielded markedly better results when treated with CEP. In phase 2, biofilms were identified in 23 of the 25 patients with chronic otitis externa exacerbation (92%) and in only three acute external otitis cases (20%).

CEP is a simple and effective method for the treatment of chronic external otitis. The removal of the bacterial biofilm has a high correlation with a long-term clinical remission.

### Acute otitis externa: An update [^115nN2h8]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition characterized by the inflammation of the ear canal, primarily caused by bacterial infection, with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus* being the most frequent pathogens. It typically presents with a rapid onset of symptoms, including otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea. This condition often follows swimming or minor trauma due to inappropriate cleaning.

- **Symptoms and diagnosis**: Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding.
- **Treatment options**: Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics, such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones, are the treatments of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents are available in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may expedite symptom resolution. However, there is no substantial evidence favoring the clinical superiority of any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation over others.
- **Considerations for treatment choice**: The selection of treatment depends on factors like tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact.
- **Use of oral antibiotics**: Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases where the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection.
- **Chronic otitis externa**: This is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^111qDrVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge, and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

- **Search strategy**: Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT, and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication, or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa, and furunculosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

- **Main results**: Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various interventions.

### Malignant external otitis: What the diabetes specialist should know - a narrative review [^1118uZcV]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Malignant external otitis (MEO), also known as malignant otitis externa or necrotizing external otitis, is an aggressive form of external otitis characterized by the spread of inflammatory activity towards the soft tissues of the external auditory meatus and the bone of the skull base. It presents significant morbidity and mortality. The term "malignant" is considered inappropriate as it does not indicate the development of cancer but rather the rapid local spread of inflammation to healthy tissues. The first report of the disease is attributed to Toulmouche in 1838, while the term "malignant otitis externa" was first used by Chandler in 1968.

Incidence rates of MEO vary, with a population-based study in Taiwan reporting 2.24 cases per million person-years of observation, and another study in Spain reporting 1.3 cases per million inhabitants per year. Individuals under 18 years old present with a very low incidence of the disease. MEO is more prevalent in males than females, with a ratio of 1.45 males to 1 female.

Despite advances in the treatment of MEO, incidence rates between 10% and 20% have been published, with a more recent study from the United States reporting an overall mortality of 2.5% during the initial hospitalization. Existing diabetes and poor glycemic control are associated with longer hospitalization, increased healthcare costs, and mortality in this patient category.

Our Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) Department has extensive experience in managing patients with MEO. Specifically, 11 cases of patients with MEO presented in 1977, which was one of the largest case series at that time. At that time, quinolones were not yet widely used.

### The development of antibiotic resistant organisms with the use of ototopical medications [^111dsHrJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

There is growing concern over the use of systemic antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance. The question remains as to whether ototopical medications may also promote antibiotic-resistant organisms, either on a local level (in the ear) or in other areas of the aerodigestive tract. We performed an evidence-based review to answer the following clinical question: "Do antibiotic ototopical medications induce antibiotic-resistant organisms?"

- **Study design**: We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1966 to the present. We used appropriate search terms to identify pertinent articles. These articles were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality. The search terms included:

	- **Ototopical treatments**: "ototopical antibiotics", "ototopical drops", "topical antibiotics and otitis externa", "otitis externa and antibiotic drops", "otitis externa and ototopical drops", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and ototopical therapy"

	- **Conditions**: "otitis externa and treatment", "otitis media", "otitis media and treatment", "chronic suppurative otitis media", "chronic suppurative otitis media and treatment", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and treatment"

	- **Resistance**: "antibiotic resistance", "otitis externa and resistant organisms", "otitis media and resistant organisms", "chronic suppurative otitis media and resistant organisms"

	- **Related searches**: "otitis media and antibiotic drops", "chronic suppurative otitis media and antibiotic drops", "ophthalmic antibiotic drops", "draining ear", "P.E. tube otorrhea"

- **Results**: After an initial screening of over 2,500 articles, 38 articles were selected for further review.

### Clotrimazole [^116TQkW2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Abnormal liver function tests have been reported in patients treated with clotrimazole lozenges; elevated SGOT levels were reported in about 15% of patients in the clinical trials. In most cases, the elevations were minimal, and it was often impossible to distinguish the effects of clotrimazole from those of other therapy and the underlying disease, which was malignancy in most cases. Periodic assessment of hepatic function is advisable, particularly in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment.

Since patients must be instructed to allow each lozenge to dissolve slowly in the mouth to achieve the maximum effect of the medication, they must be of an age and physical and/or mental condition to comprehend such instructions.

- **Carcinogenesis**: An 18-month dosing study with clotrimazole in rats has not revealed any carcinogenic effect.

- **Usage in pregnancy**: Pregnancy Category C: Clotrimazole has been shown to be embryotoxic in rats and mice when given in doses 100 times the adult human dose (in mg/kg), possibly secondary to maternal toxicity. The drug was not teratogenic in mice, rabbits, and rats when given in doses up to 200, 180, and 100 times the human dose, respectively.

Clotrimazole given orally to mice from nine weeks before mating through weaning at a dose 120 times the human dose was associated with impairment of mating, decreased number of viable young, and decreased survival to weaning. No effects were observed at 60 times the human dose.

### Adherence to antibiotic prescribing guidelines in Dutch primary care: an analysis of national prescription data on ear and respiratory tract symptoms and conditions among 384 general practices [^113AyrfG]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is treated in just over 30% of cases with a macrolide or broad-spectrum antibiotic, regardless of whether there is an uncertain or no indication for an antibiotic. For patients with otitis externa for whom an antibiotic was uncertain and who did receive an antibiotic, this antibiotic was a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in fewer than half of the cases. Acute otitis media was treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases. When an antibiotic was prescribed for patients with acute otitis media with an uncertain or certain indication for an antibiotic, prescribers chose a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in over 90% of the cases.

- **Figure 2 description**: Type of antibiotics for ear symptoms and conditions as a percentage of all prescriptions for a specific indication. Macro = macrolides that are not mentioned in the appropriate guidelines, broad = broad-spectrum antibiotics that are not mentioned in the guidelines, top3 = total of first-, second- and third-choice of antibiotic according to the guideline, O.E. = otitis externa, O.M. A. = otitis media acute. Insufficient data were available to calculate practice variation. No = no indication to prescribe an antibiotic, Uncertain = uncertain indication to prescribe an antibiotic, Certain = certain indication to prescribe an antibiotic. For otitis externa, there is no group for which there is a certain indication to prescribe an antibiotic.

### Hyperbaric oxygen as an adjuvant treatment for malignant otitis externa [^111xpjYp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Malignant, or necrotising, otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external ear canal and surrounding soft tissue and bone. It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for malignant otitis externa.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was April 4, 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials, involving adults, undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in malignant otitis externa.

- **Data collection and analysis**: No identified articles described randomised controlled trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of malignant otitis externa.

- **Main results**: Due to the lack of data, we could present no results.

- **Authors' conclusions**: No clear evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy when compared to treatment with antibiotics and/or surgery. We found no data to compare rates of complication between the different treatment modalities. Further research is required.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^116wXkHe]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The main findings favoring placebo at one and nine months provide evidence that topical intranasal corticosteroids are not likely to be an effective means of treating children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. The study has demonstrated the feasibility of active monitoring in general practice, with particularly high natural resolution rates occurring after as little as one month of follow-up.

### ESR essentials: imaging of middle ear cholesteatoma-practice recommendations by the European Society of Head and Neck Radiology [^114HusFZ]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The most common means of removing a cholesteatoma is to use a retro-auricular approach. This can be defined according to whether the posterior external auditory canal (EAC) wall is removed (canal wall down mastoidectomy or CWDM) or preserved (canal wall up mastoidectomy or CWUM). A CWDM is effective at eradicating cholesteatoma but results in a large cavity that needs frequent cleaning, maintenance of water precautions, and creates difficulties in fitting hearing aids. Conversely, a CWUM avoids these disadvantages but, due to greater preservation of bony structures, complete removal of cholesteatoma is more challenging, and CWUMs are associated with higher residual disease rates. To mitigate the disadvantages of CWDM, the posterior EAC wall can be reconstructed and the mastoid obliterated using various materials, including cartilage, bone (powder, chips, or pâté), fascia, or hydroxyapatite.

- **Mastoidectomy types**: Sagittal and axial reconstructions from an unenhanced CT through the left temporal bone of a patient who has previously undergone CWDM show a deficiency of the posterior EAC wall and the formation of a cavity, which needs to be cleaned under otoscopic guidance. In another patient who has previously undergone a CWUM with an intact posterior EAC wall, a defect in the superomedial EAC wall and tympanic membrane has been repaired with tragal cartilage.

For smaller cholesteatomas, minimally invasive endaural or transcanal approaches are considered.

### Scedosporium apiospermum: A rare cause of malignant otitis externa [^115HtKMF]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old man, with a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus, presented with left-sided otalgia. Initially diagnosed with simple otitis externa, he was discharged on topical drops. He re-presented two months later with worsening otalgia and discharge. A diagnosis of malignant otitis externa was made based on clinical and radiological findings. Intravenous Tazocin and Gentamicin were administered based on previous bacterial cultures from ear swabs. Despite treatment, the patient did not improve and developed left-sided facial nerve palsy. Following a change in antimicrobial therapy, his condition stabilized, and he continued with management in the community on intravenous Meropenem with twice-weekly aural toilet. Repeated nuclear medicine imaging failed to demonstrate resolution. A bony sequestration was removed from the external auditory canal in the outpatient clinic. Extended culture identified Scedosporium apiospermum; thus, his management was changed to oral Voriconazole. This led to rapid clinical improvement and disease resolution over a 6-week period.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: A randomized clinical trial [^11753HNM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The study, "Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. ciprofloxacin)" was published by Laurence Chu and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Network Open. This study is related to the disease acute otitis externa.

The trial aimed to answer the question: Is the combination of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide superior to ciprofloxacin alone in patients with acute otitis externa? This study was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT). The population included 393 patients, comprising 198 females and 195 males. Patients included both adults and children over the age of 6 months suffering from acute otitis externa.

Key exclusion criteria involved having a previous episode of acute otitis externa within 4 weeks, more than one episode within 6 months, tympanic membrane perforation, otitis media, or malignant otitis externa.

The interventions were as follows:

- **Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide group**: 197 patients received ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution administered BID for 7 days.
- **Ciprofloxacin alone group**: 196 patients received ciprofloxacin 0.3% otic solution administered BID for 7 days.

The study thoroughly addressed the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment compared to ciprofloxacin alone in managing acute otitis externa.

### Otitis externa: A practical guide to treatment and prevention [^114U9KpW]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection, usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal. It may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort limited to the external auditory canal. The most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa. Avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention.

Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

### Malignant aspergillus flavus otitis externa with jugular thrombosis [^115mcNRK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old male patient sought care from the otorhinolaryngology department at University Hospital in Marseille, France. He had a 5-month history of malignant otitis externa (MOE) that was worsening despite 4 months of treatment with intravenous ceftazidime, oral ciprofloxacin, and a topical combination of neomycin, polymyxin B, dexamethasone, and thiomersal. The patient had a history of high blood pressure, treated with perindopril and nicardipine, and diabetes mellitus, inadequately controlled (hemoglobin A1c of 7.7%) with metformin and sitagliptin.

Upon admission, an otoscopic examination found otorrhea, inflammation, and stenosis of the right external auditory canal, obscuring the tympanic membrane. Examination of the cranial nerve was normal. A pure-tone audiogram showed a right mixed hearing loss with an air-bone gap at 15 dB and a symmetrical bone curve due to presbycusis. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation level (42 mm at 1 hour, 82 mm at 2 hours) and leukocytosis (11 g/L), while C-reactive protein results were within the reference range. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed thickening of the ear skin, focal tympanal bone osteolysis, partial right mastoid air cells and middle-ear cavity opacification, and osteolysis of the occipital, styloid, and mastoid bones consistent with MOE. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast media confirmed skull base osteomyelitis, evidenced by bone lysis and marrow enhancement of the clivus. Both MRI and CT showed a right jugular vein thrombosis, along with cellulitis and abscess formation.

### Otitis externa: Review and clinical update [^114tQTwk]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can be acute or chronic, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can lead to canal edema, discharge, and pain, eventually resulting in extra-canal manifestations.

The topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate for treating early-stage disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, while oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or in individuals who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.

### Ear pain: Diagnosing common and uncommon causes [^113ysnQc]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Otalgia (ear pain) is a common presentation in the primary care setting, with many diverse causes. Pain originating from the ear is termed primary otalgia, with otitis media and otitis externa being the most frequent causes. An examination of the ear typically reveals abnormal findings in patients with primary otalgia. Pain originating outside of the ear is referred to as secondary otalgia. Its etiology can be difficult to establish due to the complex innervation of the ear. The most common causes of secondary otalgia include temporomandibular joint syndrome and dental infections. Primary otalgia is more prevalent in children, whereas secondary otalgia is more common in adults.

History-taking and physical examination generally lead to identifying the underlying cause. However, if the diagnosis is not immediately clear, a trial of symptomatic treatment, imaging studies, and consultation may be reasonable options. Otalgia may be the only presenting symptom in several serious conditions, such as temporal arteritis and malignant neoplasms. When risk factors for malignancy are present, such as smoking, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, or age 50 years or older, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or otolaryngology consultation may be warranted.

### Otitis externa [^114G4LxB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. It may be associated with eczema of the ear canal and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of empirical treatments for otitis externa? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review.)

- **Results**: Nine studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid, topical aluminium acetate, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, and combinations of these agents.

### Oxymetazoline, mupirocin, clotrimazole-safe, effective, off-label agents for tympanostomy tube care [^111LWvFY]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Only a few medications have United States Food and Drug Administration indications for the prevention and/or treatment of infections in patients with tympanic perforations or tympanostomy tubes. We examined three off-label agents that have become important in tympanostomy tube care, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of each in experimental assays and human application.

- **Methods**: Computerized literature review.

- **Results**:
	1. Oxymetazoline nasal spray applied at the time of surgery is equivalent to fluoroquinolone ear drops in preventing early postsurgical otorrhea and tympanostomy tube occlusion at the first postoperative visit.
	2. Topical mupirocin 2% ointment is effective alone or in combination with culture-directed systemic therapy for the treatment of tympanostomy tube otorrhea caused by community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
	3. Topical clotrimazole 1% cream is highly active against the common yeast and fungi that cause otomycosis. A single application after microscopic debridement will cure fungal tympanostomy tube otorrhea in most cases. None of these three agents is ototoxic in animal histological or physiological studies, and each has proven safe in long-term clinical use.

In conclusion, oxymetazoline nasal spray, mupirocin ointment, and clotrimazole cream are safe and effective as off-label medications for tympanostomy tube care in children.

### Ofloxacin [^116WFAap]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in pediatric patients of the following ages for the listed indications:

- **Six months and older**: Otitis externa with intact tympanic membranes.
- **One year and older**: Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes.
- **Twelve years and older**: Chronic suppurative otitis media with perforated tympanic membranes.

Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below these ages have not been established. Although no data are available on patients less than age 6 months, there are no known safety concerns or differences in the disease process in this population that will preclude the use of this product. No changes in hearing function occurred in 30 pediatric subjects treated with ofloxacin otic and tested for audiometric parameters.

Although quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals after systemic administration, young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution for one month showed no systemic effects, quinolone-induced lesions, erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of arthropathy.

### An emergency medicine-focused review of malignant otitis externa [^111wNmKS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal (EAC) and is known for its severe morbidity and mortality.

- **Objective**: This narrative review provides an overview of malignant otitis externa for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: MOE is an invasive external ear infection that spreads to the temporal bone and can further progress to affect intracranial structures. Complications of advanced MOE include cranial nerve involvement, most commonly the facial nerve, and intracranial infections such as abscess and meningitis. The most common causative agent of MOE is Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, others include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fungi. Major risk factors for MOE include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and advanced age. Red flags for MOE include severe otalgia (pain out of proportion to exam) or severe otorrhea, neurological deficits (especially facial nerve involvement), previously diagnosed otitis externa not responsive to therapy, and patients with major risk factors for MOE. Examination may show purulent otorrhea or granulation tissue in the EAC. Culture of EAC drainage should be performed. Diagnosis is aided by computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast, which may demonstrate bony destruction of the temporal bone or skull base. When suspecting MOE, early consultation with an otolaryngologist is recommended, and antibiotics with pseudomonal coverage are needed. Most patients with MOE will require admission to the hospital.

- **Conclusions**: MOE is a rare, yet deadly diagnosis.

### Has cerumen a protective role in recurrent external otitis [^115aoaRU]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

We investigated the bactericidal activity of cerumen in patients with recurrent otitis externa.

- **Materials and methods**: Cerumen samples were collected from two groups. Group A (n = 20) consisted of patients with recurrent otitis externa (two or more acute otitis externa attacks per year), and Group B (n = 30) consisted of cerumen from a healthy population. We examined the bactericidal activity against common microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus, that are associated with recurrent otitis externa.

- **Results**: A significant decrease in the count of Staphylococcus epidermidis was observed in both Group A (P < 0.05) and Group B (P < 0.01). A comparison of decreases and increases in the percentages of microorganisms between Groups A and B showed a significant difference only in the count of Escherichia coli (P ≤ .05). The count of E. coli decreased in cerumen suspension in Group A but increased in the healthy population.

- **Conclusion**: We did not confirm that cerumen from patients with recurrent otitis externa had less bactericidal activity than cerumen from a healthy population.

### Efficacy of intratympanic OTO-104 for the treatment of Ménière's disease: The outcome of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^115GC8Kq]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

Although all 148 patients who were randomized and received the study drug in the 811 study were included in the primary analysis, 12 of these patients had major protocol deviations (e.g. received systemic steroids during the study or did not meet other eligibility criteria). For the population of 136 patients who did not have major protocol deviations (66 patients treated with OTO-104, 70 treated with placebo), the OTO-104 group had significantly lower mean DVD at month 3 than placebo (2.263 for OTO-104 versus 3.746 for placebo; p = 0.031).

The OTO-104 treatment group in this population had significantly fewer days sick at home or bedridden at month 3 (0.8 for OTO-104 versus 1.6 for placebo; p = 0.026), and the OTO-104 group exhibited higher adjusted mean PGIC scores at month 3 than placebo (1.8 for OTO-104 versus 1.2 for placebo; p = 0.007). Other secondary endpoints, including mean vertigo severity score at month 3 (0.33 for OTO-104 versus 0.45 for placebo; p = 0.113) and change from baseline in vertigo frequency at month 3 (−0.60 for OTO-104 versus −0.49 for placebo; p = 0.113), favored OTO-104 treatment but did not achieve statistical significance.

The 811 study was conducted from August 27, 2018, to December 22, 2020, and was therefore impacted by COVID-19. In instances where patients could not travel to the site or chose not to because of COVID-19 restrictions, sites could conduct scheduled clinic visits remotely. Twenty-eight patients (18.8% of the study population) had at least one visit impacted by COVID-19.

### The role of surgery in necrotizing otitis externa [^1174SM3N]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2017). Low credibility.

This retrospective case review describes a subset of five patients with necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) with a refractory disease course who underwent surgery as part of their management plan between 2008 and 2013. Surgery promoted the cure of four out of the five patients, and a fungal pathogen was recovered in four out of five surgical samples. We conclude that surgery may be a necessary diagnostic and treatment adjunct in selective cases of NOE, especially in patients with a refractory disease course or with a suspected fungal etiology.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa executive summary [^116SLoNd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The eight recommendations developed address the appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE), the use of oral and topical antimicrobials, and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Otitis externa [^116B25Sr]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotizing forms. It may be associated with eczema of the ear canal and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, individuals with an absence of ear wax or narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and following mechanical trauma.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation to assess the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.

### Skull base osteomyelitis: Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in atypical presentation [^112WXoNQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

We sought to document the diagnostic and management difficulties in masked skull base osteomyelitis secondary to malignant otitis externa, emphasizing establishing diagnostic criteria in recurrence. This retrospective analysis involved three cases of inadequately treated malignant otitis externa in elderly diabetic individuals, leading to recurrence and atypical manifestations of skull base osteomyelitis on the contralateral side, with or without multiple cranial nerve involvement.

Two of the three cases resulted in death despite aggressive treatment. One case was treated successfully with a combination of antipseudomonal microbial drugs for 8 to 12 weeks and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Major complications such as thrombosis of the lateral sinus and internal jugular vein, meningitis, ophthalmoplegia, blindness, cervical spine erosion, and paralysis of all cranial nerves except the first cranial nerve were observed.

There is high morbidity and mortality associated with skull base osteomyelitis. In partially treated cases of malignant otitis externa, atypical symptoms and findings including unilateral severe otalgia, unremitting headache, and the presence of high ESR and unilateral OME constitute diagnostic clues for skull base osteomyelitis. Such cases require further investigation with CT, MRI, Technetium 99 and gallium 67 scintigraphy, and aggressive management.

### Malignant otitis externa [^113WpnrZ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant external otitis is a severe infection of the external auditory canal and skull base, which most often affects elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. This disease is associated with cranial nerve complications, and it carries a high morbidity-mortality rate. Malignant otitis externa requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. The most effective treatment includes controlling diabetes and combating the infection with appropriate antibiotics and debridement of necrotic tissue; sometimes, aggressive surgical management is necessary. We present our 5-year institutional experience in managing this disease. The aim of this study was to present our experience with the management of malignant otitis externa.

- **Methods**: All patient records with malignant otitis externa during the last 5 years (2007–2012) were retrieved and reviewed. Diabetes mellitus profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ear swab for culture and sensitivity, computed tomography, and scintigraphy using technetium 99 and gallium 67 were investigated for all patients.

- **Results**: During the last 5 years (2007–2012), 10 patients diagnosed with malignant otitis externa were admitted to our clinic for investigation and treatment. There were 7 men and 3 women, all between 64 and 83 years of age, presenting with severe persistent otalgia, purulent otorrhea, granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, and diffuse external otitis. Four patients displayed facial nerve palsy. Nine patients were confirmed to have diabetes, and 4 of these 9 cases had chronic renal failure and underwent dialysis.

### Panel 7: Otitis media: Treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media, and complications of otitis media, along with their implications for clinical practice.

Data sources included PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1,122 potentially related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary.

Recent literature and guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; however, antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age-dependent. Topical antibiotics are the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments.

There is a significant emphasis on the accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, as a crucial aspect of clinical practice.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate [^111YgNdU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate lotion is indicated for patients 17 years and older for the topical treatment of symptomatic inflammatory tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis caused by Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum. Effective treatment without the risks associated with topical corticosteroid use may be achieved using a topical antifungal agent that does not contain a corticosteroid, particularly for noninflammatory tinea infections. The efficacy of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate lotion for treating infections caused by zoophilic dermatophytes (e.g. Microsporum canis) has not been established.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^113YUrtu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis externa, specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend not offering systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated acute otitis externa. This recommendation stands unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy.

### Searching the literature and selecting the right references [^116qUR5y]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The ability to locate published data on a topic is a fundamental skill in the research process, aiding in the formulation and refinement of a research question and the planning of the study. Searching the literature for studies relevant to one's question requires knowledge of databases such as MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, or the Hospital Literature Index. PubMed provides access to MEDLINE and over 12 million citations in the medical literature.

When searching in PubMed, you can apply various "limits", such as what fields the search term is in (e.g. author, title, text word, journal), type of report (e.g. clinical trial, review, editorial), language, patient age, gender, and human or animal study. The "Boolean operators" (AND, OR, and NOT) can further focus and refine your search. However, to ensure that you retrieve all files of interest and do not miss any that might be critical to your understanding of the topic, you must search all fields and be careful not to exclude potentially important files with the NOT operator.

### Otomycosis: Diagnosis and treatment [^115YTLxE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Aspergillus and Candida spp. are the most frequently isolated fungi in patients with otomycosis. The diagnosis of otitis externa relies on the patient's history, otoscopic examination under microscopic control, and imaging studies. Direct preparation of the specimens, particularly with optical brighteners, mycologic culture, and histologic examination, is very important and strongly recommended for the correct diagnosis.

Patients with noninvasive fungal otitis externa should be treated with intense débridement and cleansing, along with topical antifungals. Topical antifungals, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, bifonazole, ciclopiroxolamine, and tolnaftate, are potentially safe choices for the treatment of otomycosis, especially in patients with a perforated eardrum. The oral triazole drugs, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, are effective against Candida and Aspergillus, with good penetration of bone and the central nervous system. These drugs are essential in the treatment of patients with malignant fungal otitis externa complicated by mastoiditis and meningitis.

### The anticoagulant therapy for otogenic sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis: A case report and literature review [^1161JhED]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis is a severe and potentially fatal intracranial complication of acute otitis media and middle ear cholesteatoma. Early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and immediate radical mastoidectomy are the recommended standard treatments; however, anticoagulant therapy is always an option worthy of clinical consideration. Here, we report a case of middle ear cholesteatoma complicated with sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis in a patient who received anticoagulant therapy for 1 year before the operation due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

### Lemierre syndrome complicating otitis externa: Case report and literature review [^112D2S2f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, known as Lemierre syndrome, is a rare disorder usually caused by *Fusobacterium necrophorum*, a Gram-negative anaerobic organism that normally inhabits the oropharynx. Lemierre syndrome typically follows primary oropharyngeal infections and affects previously healthy adolescents and young adults in a characteristic manner, often with fatal results if left untreated. There has been a significant increase in the number of reported cases of Lemierre syndrome, possibly reflecting the trend to withhold antibiotics for initially uncomplicated oropharyngeal infections.

- **Objectives**: We hope to alert the reader to a potentially fatal disease process that has recently been increasingly identified by reporting a unique manifestation of Lemierre syndrome and by reviewing the literature.

- **Case report**: A 19-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with a chief complaint of fever, ear pain, and generalized weakness. She was noted to be in septic shock, with left neck erythema and swelling. A computed tomography scan showed thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein (IJV), which was later excised. She recovered following a course of intravenous and oral antibiotics.

- **Conclusion**: Septic thrombophlebitis of the IJV is associated with multiple sources and organisms. This case is unique in both the organism (*Peptococcus anaerobius*) and the source (otitis externa). This disease process must be identified early and aggressively treated to avoid significant morbidity and mortality.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^116cTiiN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute otitis externa, more specifically with respect to follow-up, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend reassessing the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse acute otitis externa and to exclude other causes of illness.

An 89-year-old man presented to the outpatient clinic with a 2-month history of persistent unilateral left-sided otalgia, otorrhoea, and reduced hearing despite the administration of oral and topical antibiotics. Treatment was protracted, necessitating a 4-month hospital admission for intravenous antifungal medication, followed by an additional 3 months of oral antifungal treatment. This case describes the clinical presentation, complications, and treatment of this potentially fatal condition in the context of an unusual and easily missed causative organism.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for otitis externa [^117TkkCm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Ofloxacin otic is as effective in curing otitis externa in children (< 12 years of age) as the preparation combining polymyxin/neomycin plus hydrocortisone and as ciprofloxacin otic. Furthermore, ofloxacin otic, as it requires less frequent dosing, is likely to encourage greater patient adherence and consequently achieve a better cure rate than both of these treatment options. Because a number of cases of otitis externa are complicated by an undiagnosed tympanic membrane perforation, the lack of ototoxicity associated with ofloxacin otic makes it a particularly safe option for use in these patients.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate [^117VD9Lm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate lotion is a medication used on the skin to treat fungal infections of the feet, groin, and body, as diagnosed by your doctor. It should be used for fungal infections that are inflamed and have symptoms of redness and/or itching. Talk to your doctor if your fungal infection does not have these symptoms.

The medication contains a corticosteroid. Notify your doctor if you notice side effects with its use (see "What are the possible side effects of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate lotion?" below). Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate lotion is not to be used in the eyes, in the mouth, or in the vagina.

### Ofloxacin [^111MLkBM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with other anti-infective preparations, prolonged use may result in the over-growth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If the infection is not improved after one week, cultures should be obtained to guide further treatment. If otorrhea persists following a full course of therapy, or if two or more episodes of otorrhea occur within six months, further evaluation is recommended to exclude an underlying condition such as cholesteatoma, foreign body, or a tumor.

The systemic administration of quinolones, including ofloxacin at doses much higher than given or absorbed by the otic route, has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. Young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution showed no systemic effects, lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of arthropathy. No drug-related structural or functional changes of the cochlea and no lesions in the ossicles were noted in the guinea pig following otic administration of 0.3% ofloxacin for one month.

No signs of local irritation were found when 0.3% ofloxacin was applied topically in the rabbit eye. Ofloxacin was also shown to lack dermal sensitizing potential in the guinea pig maximization study.

- **Information for patients**: Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the fingers or other sources. This precaution is necessary if the sterility of the drops is to be preserved. Systemic quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with significant effects in other contexts.

### Malignant otitis externa: A novel stratification protocol for predicting treatment outcomes [^113n8q75]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

This study stratifies malignant otitis externa into severe and nonsevere disease categories to predict treatment courses and outcomes.

- **Setting**: Tertiary center.

- **Patients**: Retrospective review from 2004 to 2014, including 28 patients. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis by senior authors, radiographic evidence of disease, admission for intravenous antibiotics or debridement, and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up.

- **Interventions**: Severe group stratification occurs if two or more of the following are present: cranial nerve VII palsy, fungal positive culture, relapse, surgery performed, or major radiographic findings. All other patients are stratified into the nonsevere group.

- **Main outcome measures**: Cure, alive with refractory disease, death by disease, and death by other causes. Secondary measures include antibiotic duration and number of disease-related admissions.

- **Results**: Forty-three percent (12 of 28) and 57% (16 of 28) of patients were stratified into the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. The severe group had significantly more adverse disease-specific outcomes than the nonsevere group (7 of 12 versus 0 of 16; p = 0.002). Disease-specific mortality was 42% in the severe group and 0% in the nonsevere group. The severe group had longer antibiotic courses (12.8 versus 6.9 weeks; p = 0.01) and more disease-related admissions or relapses (1.6 versus 1; p < 0.001). Only four of the severe group patients achieved cure. All but two nonsevere patients achieved cure, with those two dying of other causes.

- **Conclusion**: A subgroup of malignant otitis externa may exist that is not as susceptible to parenteral antibiotics and local debridement.

### Efficacy and safety of eberconazole 1% otic solution compared to clotrimazole 1% solution in patients with otomycosis [^115J1JrX]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). High credibility.

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of eberconazole 1% otic solution to clotrimazole 1% solution, and to compare their safety profiles in the treatment of otomycosis, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active treatment-controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted. One hundred and ninety patients diagnosed with otomycosis were randomly assigned to receive either eberconazole 1% otic solution or clotrimazole 1% solution.

Baseline characteristics, including age, gender, ethnicity, and clinical variables, were comparable between the two groups. Both study groups exhibited high complete response rates, with 81.8% in the eberconazole group and 83.5% in the clotrimazole group. Although non-inferiority of eberconazole relative to clotrimazole could not be demonstrated, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis indicated that eberconazole 1% otic solution was not inferior to clotrimazole 1% solution for the primary efficacy endpoint. Secondary endpoints also demonstrated therapeutic similarity between eberconazole 1% and clotrimazole 1% solutions by the end of the study. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, and there were no related adverse events or withdrawals due to an adverse event.

Eberconazole 1% otic solution is confirmed as an efficacious and safe treatment option for patients affected by otomycosis in general practice.

### The pH of commonly used topical ear drops in the treatment of otitis externa [^113penoG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Healthy ear canal skin has an acidic pH. Evidence suggests that reacidification of the ear canal may lead to the resolution of otitis externa. The pH of 15 commonly prescribed topical ear drop preparations used in the treatment of otitis externa was measured using a Jenway 3020 pH meter with temperature compensation at 37.5 °C. The pH values ranged from 2.89 to 7.83. Two-thirds of the preparations tested were of acidic pH, while the remaining one-third were alkaline. Reacidification of the ear canal may help in the treatment of otitis externa.

### The use of extemporaneously compounded 1% tetracaine to improve adherence with clotrimazole 1% topical solution in the treatment of ear infection: a case report [^114EifP4]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Adherence to drug therapy is essential for achieving successful outcomes in most medically amenable conditions. However, drug side effects, particularly pain, can interfere with the desired outcomes. We present a case of non-adherence due to severe pain associated with the topical use of clotrimazole 1% solution in the ear. The instillation of a 1% tetracaine solution prior to the administration of clotrimazole effectively blocked the pain sensation, enabling the patient to successfully complete the antifungal therapy.
