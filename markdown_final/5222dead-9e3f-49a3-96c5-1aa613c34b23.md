## Question

what causes vitamin d def

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes vitamin D deficiency and the major risk factors behind low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how vitamin D status is defined and which biomarker is valid. Then, I should examine the two main sources of vitamin D — cutaneous synthesis and diet — and their limitations. Next, I will review pathophysiological causes including malabsorption, hepatic and renal disease, and medication effects. After that, I will consider sequestration and increased requirements such as obesity, age, and genetics. I will then integrate population-specific high-risk groups and the role of magnesium as a cofactor. Finally, I should address measurement controversies and screening guidance before synthesizing how these factors converge in real patients [^112abct4] [^113DFK9U].

> Let me first confirm the physiological basis of "vitamin D status". Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the appropriate integrated biomarker because it reflects both skin production and intake and has a half-life of roughly 2–3 weeks, whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is tightly regulated and short lived, so it does not track body stores well; I need to ensure I don't confuse these two tests in interpretation [^1167Q1RY] [^1128upyg]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thresholds; the Institute of Medicine concluded that 20 ng/mL generally meets population requirements, while the Endocrine Society has historically set sufficiency at ≥ 30 ng/mL, treating < 20 ng/mL as deficiency and < 12 ng/mL as severe deficiency, so I should state both conventions clearly when discussing "deficiency" [^1128upyg] [^111TsKkR].

> Next, I should review the two principal sources of vitamin D and why they fail. Cutaneous synthesis via UVB accounts for the majority of vitamin D stores under natural conditions; however, latitude, season, ambient UV, time spent outdoors, clothing, and skin pigmentation strongly modulate production, and I should double-check that typical sunscreen use does not usually abolish cutaneous vitamin D in real-world settings, which consensus suggests it does not when used to prevent erythema [^113TRypV] [^113DFK9U] [^115xnr1L]. Wait, let me verify the seasonality point; models and trial data consistently identify ambient UV radiation and time outdoors as dominant predictors of low 25(OH)D, which reinforces the primacy of UV exposure determinants in population risk stratification [^113DFK9U].

> I will now examine dietary intake and supplementation limitations. Very few foods naturally contain meaningful vitamin D, fortification policies vary, and diet alone rarely compensates for low UVB exposure; I should confirm that both D2 and D3 can be used clinically, though D3 generally has higher potency and is most often used in supplements, while guidelines still consider either acceptable for treatment and prevention [^113TRypV] [^11271EhQ] [^114GRJMf]. Hold on, I should verify that insufficiency of intake is particularly consequential in groups with restricted sun exposure, which aligns with guideline emphasis on empiric supplementation in selected life stages and risk profiles rather than relying solely on diet [^112abct4].

> Let me consider pathophysiological mechanisms beyond insufficient input. Impaired intestinal absorption due to celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic insufficiency, or post-bariatric surgery can drive low 25(OH)D, while chronic liver disease impairs 25-hydroxylation and chronic kidney disease reduces 1α-hydroxylation; but wait, I should clarify that 25(OH)D is still the status test in CKD and that treatment of deficiency in CKD generally follows population strategies unless there is an indication for active metabolites, per KDIGO [^115ye1w4] [^1113Mtyi]. I also need to check for medication-induced catabolism or reduced absorption: enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, rifampin, and orlistat, among others, can lower 25(OH)D levels and increase requirements, which can be 2–3 times higher than standard dosing in affected patients [^114tvLJq] [^115rP1Fz].

> Now, I should review sequestration and increased requirements. Obesity sequesters vitamin D in adipose tissue, lowering bioavailability, so obese individuals typically require 2–3 times higher doses to achieve the same 25(OH)D response; let me verify that guidance explicitly notes this higher dosing need in obesity and with interacting medications or malabsorption [^111TsKkR] [^115rP1Fz]. Elderly adults have reduced cutaneous synthesis due to lower 7-dehydrocholesterol and often less sun exposure, and genetic variation in DBP, VDR, and CYP enzymes contributes to interindividual variability, although I should be careful not to overstate genetic effects on population variance compared with environmental drivers like UV exposure and BMI [^113TRypV] [^114rfqdw] [^113DFK9U].

> Next, I should identify population groups at heightened risk. Exclusively breastfed infants depend on maternal status and receive little vitamin D from milk, so they need supplementation; maternal deficiency during pregnancy likewise predisposes neonatal deficiency, and there is emerging guidance to consider empiric supplementation during pregnancy for potential perinatal benefits, though I must acknowledge evolving evidence strength here [^116ZZxso] [^111U4Jbv]. Elderly, institutionalized, or homebound adults, individuals with dark skin at higher latitudes, people with obesity, and those with malabsorption syndromes or on interacting medications are consistently flagged as higher-risk, and contemporary guidelines emphasize risk-based assessment while avoiding population-wide screening [^113DFK9U] [^112abct4].

> I need to check a potentially overlooked metabolic cofactor: magnesium. Magnesium participates in vitamin D transport and hydroxylation steps, and low magnesium intake has been associated with lower 25(OH)D levels and possibly attenuated response to supplementation; but wait, the evidence base here is largely observational and lower quality, so I should frame magnesium optimization as a plausible, low-risk adjunct rather than a primary, standalone cause in most patients [^116T4Hqe].

> Hold on, I should review controversies and measurement issues before concluding. Assay variability, particularly with some immunoassays underdetecting 25(OH)D2 or cross-reacting with metabolites, can confound interpretation; I need to ensure reliable assays and be mindful of lab-to-lab variability when defining "deficiency" cut points for individual patients [^111TBfK7]. On screening, I should confirm that the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to support routine screening of asymptomatic adults and that the Endocrine Society 2024 guideline similarly recommends avoiding routine population testing, favoring targeted assessment in at-risk groups where results will alter management [^113eufYa] [^112abct4].

> Let me synthesize how these factors converge in real-world patients. An older, obese, dark-skinned individual living at a high latitude who is taking an enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant exemplifies converging risks: decreased cutaneous synthesis with age, adipose sequestration, high melanin reducing UVB penetration, environmental UVB scarcity, and medication-induced catabolism; any one might be insufficient to cause marked deficiency, but together they substantially increase risk and dosing requirements [^113TRypV] [^113DFK9U] [^111TsKkR]. Conversely, an exclusively breastfed infant of a vitamin D–deficient mother has low endogenous synthesis, low dietary vitamin D, and limited reserves, underscoring why infant and maternal supplementation strategies are critical in this dyad [^116ZZxso] [^111oP7oD].

> In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency arises from a multifactorial interplay: insufficient UVB exposure, limited dietary intake, impaired absorption or metabolism from gastrointestinal, hepatic, or renal disease, medication-induced catabolism, and increased requirements or sequestration due to obesity, aging, and genetic variability; I should confirm that contemporary practice favors risk-stratified assessment and empiric supplementation in defined groups, rather than universal screening, to align testing and treatment with the likelihood of benefit [^112abct4] [^113DFK9U].

Vitamin D deficiency is primarily caused by **insufficient sun exposure** (UVB) [^113TRypV] — especially at high latitudes, during winter [^113DFK9U], or with predominantly indoor lifestyles — and by **inadequate dietary intake** given the scarcity of natural food sources [^112bmgjr]. Additional causes include **malabsorption syndromes** (celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery) [^114tvLJq] [^115ye1w4], chronic liver or kidney disease [^1113Mtyi], obesity (sequestration in fat) [^113cP2er], dark skin pigmentation, aging (reduced skin synthesis), exclusive breastfeeding without supplementation [^116ZZxso], and medications that increase vitamin D catabolism (antiepileptics, glucocorticoids) [^111TsKkR]. Magnesium deficiency can also impair **vitamin D metabolism** [^116T4Hqe]. Routine screening is **not recommended** for the general population [^112abct4]; **targeted testing is advised for high-risk groups** [^113DFK9U] [^112abct4].

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

### Insufficient sunlight exposure

- **Latitude and season**: UVB decreases with latitude and in winter, reducing cutaneous synthesis [^113TRypV] [^114QNBg8].
- **Indoor lifestyle**: Prolonged indoor time limits UVB exposure [^112bmgjr].
- **Clothing and sunscreen**: Covering clothing and sunscreen reduce UVB exposure [^114rfqdw].

---

### Dietary insufficiency

Few foods naturally contain **vitamin D** [^112bmgjr]; fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods are the primary sources [^11271EhQ]. Low intake or lack of fortification **increases deficiency risk** [^112bmgjr].

---

## Physiological and demographic factors

### Skin pigmentation

Darker skin reduces cutaneous **vitamin D synthesis** because melanin absorbs UVB, thereby decreasing conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3.

---

### Age

Older adults have reduced cutaneous **vitamin D synthesis** [^113TRypV] and often have **less sun exposure** [^114rfqdw].

---

### Obesity

In obesity, **vitamin D is sequestered within adipose tissue**, lowering its bioavailability and circulating levels [^113cP2er].

---

### Pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy and lactation **increase vitamin D requirements** [^111U4Jbv]; **without supplementation**, the higher demand can lead to deficiency [^116ZZxso].

---

## Medical conditions and medications

### Malabsorption syndromes

- **Celiac disease**: Impairs absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D [^115ye1w4].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Reduces absorption and increases deficiency risk [^114tvLJq].
- **Bariatric surgery**: Alters GI anatomy, reducing absorption [^113cP2er].

---

### Chronic diseases

Chronic kidney disease **impairs 1α-hydroxylation to active 1,25(OH)₂D**, and **chronic liver disease** reduces 25-hydroxylation to 25(OH)D [^115ye1w4].

---

### Medications

Certain antiepileptics **increase catabolism of vitamin D** [^111TsKkR], and **glucocorticoids** also increase catabolism and reduce bioavailability [^113cP2er].

---

## Genetic and metabolic factors

### Genetic polymorphisms

Genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway can **lower 25(OH)D concentrations**; **polymorphisms** in VDR, CYP2R1, and GC are implicated.

---

### Magnesium deficiency

Magnesium is a required cofactor for **vitamin D metabolism** [^116T4Hqe], and **deficiency** impairs the hydroxylation steps needed to activate vitamin D [^116T4Hqe].

### Magnesium deficit: Overlooked cause of low vitamin D status [^116T4Hqe]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Like vitamin D deficit, magnesium deficit is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several steps in vitamin D metabolism, such as vitamin D binding to its transport protein and the conversion of vitamin D into the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by hepatic and renal hydroxylation, depend on magnesium as a cofactor. A new analysis of two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data sets, published in BMC Medicine, investigated potential interactions between magnesium intake, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D — generally accepted as an indicator of vitamin D status — and mortality.

Data indicate a reduced risk of insufficient or deficient vitamin D status at high magnesium intake and an inverse association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, among those with magnesium intake above the median. The study provides important findings concerning potential metabolic interactions between magnesium and vitamin D and its clinical relevance. However, results should be considered preliminary since biochemical data on individual magnesium status were lacking, confounding cannot be excluded, and questions on the dose-response relationship still remain to be answered.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^113TRypV]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem caused mainly by insufficient exposure to sunlight. It is estimated that 1 billion people have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency worldwide, which is particularly prevalent among elderly people. Vitamin D exists in two forms: D2 (ergocalciferol), which is obtained from yeast and plants, and D3 (cholecalciferol), obtained from the diet through the ingestion of vitamin D-containing products like fatty fish and eggs, vitamin D-fortified milk or margarine, and/or the use of multivitamins. However, the primary source of vitamin D3 (80–90% of the body's stores) is via ultraviolet irradiation of the precursor molecule 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin.

Vitamin D (D2 and D3) is then subsequently hydroxylated in the liver by 25-hydroxylase to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). 25OHD is then further hydroxylated in the kidney by the 1-alpha hydroxylase to form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D) or calcitriol, which is the biologically active form of vitamin D. The 1-alpha hydroxylation can also occur in a multitude of other tissues, generating locally active vitamin D, which leads to auto and/or paracrine effects. The principal index of vitamin D status is the serum 25OHD concentration, which has a half-life of approximately 3 weeks, compared with the biologically active form 1,25(OH)₂D, which has a half-life of only 4–6 hours.

### Vitamin D deficiency: A worldwide problem with health consequences [^112bmgjr]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency is the lack of appreciation that sun exposure in moderation is the major source of vitamin D for most humans. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and foods that are fortified with vitamin D are often inadequate to satisfy either a child's or an adult's vitamin D requirement. Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and will precipitate and exacerbate osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures in adults. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk of common cancers, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and infectious diseases.

A circulating level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of > 75 nmol/L, or 30 ng/mL, is required to maximize vitamin D's beneficial effects for health. In the absence of adequate sun exposure, at least 800–1000 IU of vitamin D3 per day may be needed to achieve this in children and adults. Vitamin D2 may be equally effective for maintaining circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D when given in physiologic concentrations.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113DFK9U]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In populations with a low prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, screening the general population is not cost-effective. The decision to assess an individual should be made using a risk stratification approach for vitamin D deficiency. Prioritized screening for high-risk groups could be useful, given the potentially adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on skeletal and overall health, particularly when the serum 25(OH)D levels are less than 30 nmol/L (< 12 ng/mL). Boosted regression tree models have also been developed from RCT data to predict serum 25(OH)D concentration.

Several predictor variables of a deseasonalized serum 25(OH)D concentration less than 50 nmol/L have been identified from training and validation data sets in the D-Health trial. The two strongest predictors were ambient UV radiation and total intake of vitamin D. Other important predictors of mild vitamin D deficiency included time spent outdoors, alcohol consumption, BMI, quality of life measures, and physical activity. A lack of ambient UVB radiation and the absence of vitamin D fortification in foods or vitamin D supplements will likely result in poor vitamin D status, especially in individuals with other risk factors present.

In conclusion, screening for optimal vitamin D status in the general population should be avoided as it is not informative and presents a considerable economic burden. Nonetheless, several characteristics and pathological conditions in the general population could place individuals at risk for severe deficits.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the Covid-19 pandemic [^116754JX]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

As the Covid-19 pandemic is rapidly expanding, we need to proactively explore plausible options to slow its seemingly inexorable progress and be better prepared for new waves of epidemic severe respiratory infections. We would be amiss if we did not look earnestly for low-risk nutritional interventions that can be deployed to the entire public. Correcting deficient vitamin D status may be a good target for such an intervention because the possibly seasonal outbreaks of Covid-19 and the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic could point in this direction. Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common during winter and spring in regions located at higher latitude, which may be defined as places at a latitude greater than 40° and includes the UK, Central and Northern Europe, Canada, and the northern half of the United States. Similarly, some regions in the southern hemisphere experience this deficiency. This short communication will explore key factors that increase the likelihood of individuals having low vitamin D status during winter and spring as a permissive factor for viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, including Covid-19.

To make it clear at the outset, this presentation concerns only measures that ensure adequate vitamin D status within currently accepted guidelines and is not suggesting the use of very high oral doses that exceed currently set upper limits.

The consideration of factors that make it more likely for an individual to have vitamin D deficiency is an important example of the practical application of precision nutrition (PN).

The Institute of Medicine recently published recommendations for the daily intake and optimal serum levels of vitamin D based on an extensive review of the existing literature. Here, we examine the issue and put levels of vitamin D in context for the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. Large randomized controlled trials are necessary to ensure that recommendations are appropriate.

### Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in gastrointestinal disorders [^115ye1w4]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin D and calcium are critical for skeletal health. Their absorption from the intestine is negatively impacted by a number of gastrointestinal diseases and surgical procedures, leading to osteoporosis and/or osteomalacia. Diseases of the liver can impact the metabolism of vitamin D to its circulating form, 25(OH)D, as well as the production of carrier proteins, albumin and vitamin D-binding protein that may alter the delivery of 25(OH)D and its active metabolite 1,25(OH)₂D to target tissues, including the skeleton, again leading to bone disease. The clinician evaluating a patient with apparent osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency needs to consider a gastrointestinal etiology. Similarly, the clinician evaluating a patient with a gastrointestinal disorder needs to evaluate that patient for vitamin D deficiency and bone disease. Treatment involves adequate vitamin D and calcium supplementation to achieve normal serum 25(OH)D, PTH, and serum and urine calcium levels.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, particularly in the context of fracture prevention, the 2018 USPSTF guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, whether alone or in combination, for the primary prevention of fractures in males and premenopausal females.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^117VCote]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves an extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been demonstrated to act as a key transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of the VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of evaluating noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international guidelines emphasize the complexity of reaching a consensus on this matter.

### Vitamin D deficiency in childhood: old lessons and current challenges [^1179xskG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D in childhood is a re-emerging public health problem in developed countries. New lifestyle habits, the current "epidemics" of obesity in children and adolescents worldwide, and other preventable risk factors may play a role in favoring the occurrence of vitamin D deficiency. In addition to skeletal consequences, hypovitaminosis D has been found to be involved in the development of serious extra-skeletal health problems in childhood, including atopy and autoimmunity. The increasing concerns about the global health impact of vitamin D deficiency make further research necessary to fill knowledge gaps in this field, particularly to establish universally accepted "normal" serum 25(OH)D levels in the pediatric population and to improve strategies for the screening, prevention, and treatment of hypovitaminosis D. This review discusses the key points of hypovitaminosis D in childhood in light of new knowledge and highlights the limitations of strategies to control this condition.

### Vitamin D deficiency is endemic in neurosurgical patients and is associated with a longer length of inpatient stay [^114uTrcj]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in spinal surgery and critical care, potentially impacting outcomes in cranial neurosurgical care and playing roles in underlying disease processes.

- **Methods**: A prospective observational cohort study was performed. All emergency cranial neurosurgical ward admissions from January 1st to May 10th, 2017, were screened for inclusion (n = 406). Patients already receiving vitamin D supplementation, spinal patients, and elective admissions were excluded. Admission vitamin D levels were checked for the remaining patients (n = 95). Patients with vitamin D < 30 nmol/L were defined as "deficient", and those with 30–50 nmol/L were deemed "inadequate". All patients with levels < 50 nmol/L received replacement therapy per local guidelines. Descriptive analyses of the cohorts were conducted, with multivariate regression used to assess the effect of vitamin D on length of stay, inpatient morbidity, and mortality.

- **Results**: The median age of participants was 61 years (n = 95; 57% male, 43% female). The median vitamin D level was 23 nmol/L, categorizing them as deficient. 84% (n = 80) of patients had low vitamin D levels, with 61% (n = 58) classified as deficient (< 30 nmol/L). Vitamin D deficiency rates were similar in those aged below 65 years (86%; n = 38/44) and those above 65 years (82%; n = 42/51). A deficient vitamin D level was associated with a longer hospital stay (P = 0.03), and this relationship persisted after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, and the Charlson comorbidity index before admission. No statistically significant association was observed between vitamin D status and inpatient outcomes beyond length of stay.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^111XQeK2]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend solely on reduced solar exposure or dietary intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites.

Varying recommendations from different societies arise because of evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, there is interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects, leading to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. Initial negative results are likely due to the enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes.

- **Administration routes**: Oral administration of vitamin D is preferred. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo.

### Common misconceptions about vitamin D — implications for clinicians [^113imBRF]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Misconceptions about vitamin D continue to grow despite publications in the past few years that have attempted to clarify risk. We present our perspective and offer several conclusions. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce fracture risk by approximately 10%. On the other hand, little evidence exists to support a threshold measure for vitamin D status (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) above which fractures are reduced. The association of serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with other chronic diseases is confounded by multiple factors and conflicting outcomes, which cannot be used to support a causal association. High doses of vitamin D supplements might not be completely harmless and should be avoided until additional data become available. Similarly, scant rationale exists for aggressive vitamin D supplementation for pregnant or lactating women. Dispelling misconceptions about vitamin D will ultimately benefit healthcare providers and patients alike.

### An evidence-based review of vitamin D for common and high-mortality conditions [^114YxCHb]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin available from food and sun exposure. Vitamin D receptors are present in cells throughout the body, causing it to act like a hormone. Observational studies document the association of low vitamin D levels with multiple health conditions. This article reviews the evidence for vitamin D in prevention and treatment in primary care.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature review of randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and large prospective trials examining the role of vitamin D deficiency in the most common conditions seen in primary care and the top 10 causes of mortality since 2010.

- **Results**: Vitamin D supplementation in patients with known cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack. It does not seem to have an effect in the treatment of hypertension or in cancer prevention. There is emerging evidence that supplementation reduces COVID-19 severity and the risk of mechanical ventilation.

	- Vitamin D at more moderate levels may reduce the risk of falls, but higher doses may increase fall risk. There does not seem to be a link between vitamin D supplementation and improved cognition. Vitamin D supplementation may be helpful in patients with major depression, and high doses may improve pain in people with fibromyalgia. Supplementing patients with prediabetes reduced the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation, in conjunction with standard emollient treatment, helped reduce symptoms in people with atopic dermatitis.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116Tw7ci]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D supplementation, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend initiating either 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once weekly for 8 weeks or an equivalent of 6,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily in all adult patients with vitamin D deficiency. The goal is to achieve a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy with 1,500–2,000 IU daily.

### Hyperparathyroidism and malnutrition with severe vitamin D deficiency [^112gUCgY]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency and its associated problems are common in developing Asian countries and countries of the Middle East. Various factors, including poor nutritional status and other compounding factors such as dietary, cultural, ethnic, and environmental factors, play a major role in contributing to the poor calcium and vitamin D homeostasis. Vitamin D deficiency is thought to exacerbate signs and symptoms of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). In this overview, we present evidence of the impact of vitamin D and calcium deficiency on primary HPT (PHPT).

- **Methods**: We performed an evidence-based review of articles published in the English language between January 1960 and June 2008.

- **Results**: Level IV evidence suggests widespread calcium and vitamin D deficiency in developing countries (issue 1). Limited level IV evidence suggests malnutrition as a primary cause of calcium and vitamin D deficiency (issue 2). Level IV evidence suggests that calcium and vitamin deficiencies cause secondary HPT and possibly PHPT as well (issues 3 and 4). A literature search revealed only six studies that correlated vitamin D levels with clinical, biochemical, and pathologic features of PHPT (issue 5). These studies provide level IV evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency causes some specific clinical features of PHPT as well as exacerbating other features of the disease.

- **Conclusions**: In the developing countries, which have severe vitamin D and calcium deficient population, PHPT patients present with advanced disease and particularly severe bone symptoms.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, especially concerning vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend maintaining tolerable upper limits for vitamin D at 4,000 IU/day in adults and advise not to exceed this limit without medical supervision. It is recognized that higher levels, such as 10,000 IU/day, may be required to correct vitamin D deficiency.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly). This is due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D levels below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These include institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, and individuals who use certain concomitant medications (e.g. anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids). Patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease, should also be considered. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (e.g. denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### Vitamin D deficiency an important, common, and easily treatable cardiovascular risk factor [^113Uz9dq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, present in approximately 30% to 50% of the general population. A growing body of data suggests that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may adversely affect cardiovascular health. Vitamin D deficiency activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and can predispose individuals to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency causes an increase in parathyroid hormone, which increases insulin resistance and is associated with diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. Epidemiologic studies have associated low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with coronary risk factors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Vitamin D supplementation is simple, safe, and inexpensive. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to firmly establish the relevance of vitamin D status to cardiovascular health. In the meantime, monitoring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and correction of vitamin D deficiency is indicated for optimization of musculoskeletal and general health.

### Sunscreen photoprotection and vitamin D status [^115xnr1L]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Global concern about vitamin D deficiency has fueled debates on photoprotection and the importance of solar exposure to meet vitamin D requirements. To address this, an international panel of 13 experts in endocrinology, dermatology, photobiology, epidemiology, and biological anthropology reviewed the literature prior to a 1-day meeting in June 2017, during which the evidence was discussed. The aim was to reach a consensus on the influence of photoprotection by sunscreens on vitamin D status, considering other relevant factors.

A serum level of ≥ 50 nmol L⁻¹ 25D is targeted for all individuals. Broad-spectrum sunscreens that prevent erythema are unlikely to compromise vitamin D status in healthy populations. Vitamin D screening should be restricted to those at risk of hypovitaminosis, such as patients with photosensitivity disorders who require rigorous photoprotection. Screening and supplementation are advised for this group. Ultimately, sunscreen use for daily and recreational photoprotection does not compromise vitamin D synthesis, even when applied under optimal conditions.

Knowledge of the relationship between solar exposure behavior, sunscreen use, and vitamin D is important for public health. However, there is confusion about optimal vitamin D status and the safest way to achieve it.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^111TBfK7]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin D: 25OHD levels are measured in ng/ml or nmol/l (1 ng/ml is equivalent to 2.5 nmol/l). However, several technical problems should be recognized when measuring vitamin D levels:

- **Assays for measuring 25OHD**: There are two main types of assays used for measuring 25OHD. The immune-based assay is commonly used in clinical practice, while the chromatography-based assay is considered the gold standard for research. The utilization of different methods among laboratories leads to a great variability in test results. This has led to the recent introduction of the standard reference material for vitamin D by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States.

- **Detection limitations of immunoassays**: Total circulating 25OHD is the sum of 25OHD2 and 25OHD3. However, not all immunoassays used in clinical practice are able to detect 25OHD2, which can lead to underestimation of 25OHD levels.

- **Potential confounders of 25OHD measurement**: Various factors may falsely elevate 25OHD levels. Other vitamin D metabolites, which are relatively abundant, can account for 2 to 20% of the 25OHD measured.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1167Q1RY]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

**Vitamin D metabolism and mechanism of action**: Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Both vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D2 and D3 are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)₂D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D3, 23) hydroxy forms: 24,25(OH)₂D₂/₃, 23,25(OH)₂D₃, and 1,24,25(OH)₃D₂/₃ (or 1,23,25(OH)₃D₃). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH)₂D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^111ByWWk]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Theoretically, obtaining a 25(OH)D level within an optimal window for the general population will necessarily result in overscreening and overtreatment of healthy individuals. While general screening for 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency is not recommended, measurements could be performed in patients with several risk factors for severe deficiency or who are being evaluated for metabolic bone disease. This recommendation may help to mitigate the dramatic increase in the number of 25(OH)D measurements and the associated economic burden. Supporting this view, initiatives have been undertaken to reduce unnecessary 25(OH)D analyses in Australia. The change in recommended testing criteria halved the number of measurements but paradoxically increased the number of unnecessary tests and decreased tests of patients at high risk of deficiency, with only a small improvement in the detection of deficiency.

- **Screening and testing for vitamin D status**: Levels of 25(OH)D in the general population vary considerably depending on several factors, including the season, latitude, cultural factors leading to reduced UVB light exposure, skin pigmentation, body mass index (BMI), sex, age, level of physical exercise, and food fortification with vitamin D or use of vitamin D supplements, even among otherwise comparable Western societies. Moreover, genetic factors such as gene polymorphisms may have major effects on serum 25(OH)D according to twin studies and Mendelian randomization (MR) reports.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine: What clinicians need to know [^1128upyg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011).

Serum 25OHD levels and screening: Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function.

After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care.

### Vitamin D-resistant diseases [^114K13xo]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Hereditary vitamin D receptor defects (HVDRDs) is a more appropriate and precise title for an inborn error of metabolism commonly known as pseudo-vitamin D deficiency or vitamin D dependency, type II. It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder; approximately 70 kindreds have been described. Its main importance lies in elucidating the physiology of vitamin D and calcium homeostasis in humans. Patients usually develop clinical and biochemical aberrations identical to vitamin D deficiency, but with high serum levels of calcitriol, within the first year of life (i.e. muscle weakness, bone pain, deformities, and fractures). Defective calcium gut absorption leads to hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, and defective mineralization of newly formed bone matrix.

The disease is not cured by vitamin D replacement therapy, although some patients respond to very high doses of vitamin D or its metabolites. Cells derived from patients, mainly cultured skin fibroblasts, were used to assess steps in calcitriol action from cellular uptake to bioresponse and to elucidate the molecular aberrations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Point mutations in the VDR gene were identified in every patient examined, and the same defect was observed in the obligatory heterozygotes. The functional characterization of the patient's VDR reflected the localization of the mutation (18 different ones described at the time of writing), thus providing vital information about the structure-function relationship in the human VDR and the essential role of the VDR as the mediator of vitamin D action.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: Variability, knowledge gaps, and the concept of a desirable range [^114rfqdw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent worldwide; however, proportions vary widely between regions depending on genetic and lifestyle factors, the threshold to define deficiency, and the accuracy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays used. Latitude, pollution, concealing clothing, sun exposure, gender, dietary habits, and lack of government regulation account for up to 50% variation in serum 25OHD levels, whereas genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway account for less than 5%.

Organizations and societies have developed guidelines for recommended desirable 25OHD levels and vitamin D doses to reach them, but their applicability across age groups and populations is still debated. This article and the accompanying online supporting information highlight sources of variations in circulating 25OHD levels, uncertainties and knowledge gaps, and analytical problems facing 25OHD assays, while emphasizing efficacy and safety data as dominant factors when defining a desirable range for 25OHD levels.

We propose a desirable range of 20 to 40 ng/mL (50 to 100 nmol/L), provided precise and accurate assays are used. Although slightly lower levels, 15 to 20 ng/mL, may be sufficient for some infants and adults, higher levels, 40 to 60 ng/mL, may still be safe. This desirable range allows physicians to tailor treatment while considering season, lifestyle, vitamin D intake, and other sources of variation. We reserve 25OHD measurements for at-risk patients, defined by disease or lifestyle, and the use of 25OHD assays calibrated against the recommended international standards.

### Vitamin D deficiency induces early signs of aging in human bone, increasing the risk of fracture [^116W4w3z]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread medical condition that plays a major role in human bone health. Fracture susceptibility in the context of low vitamin D has been primarily associated with defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix (osteoid). However, bone's fracture resistance is due to toughening mechanisms at various hierarchical levels ranging from the nano- to the microstructure. Thus, we hypothesize that the increase in fracture risk with vitamin D deficiency may be triggered by numerous pathological changes and may not solely derive from the absence of mineralized bone.

We found that the characteristic increase in osteoid-covered surfaces in vitamin D-deficient bone hampers remodeling of the remaining mineralized bone tissue. Using spatially resolved synchrotron bone mineral density distribution analyses and spectroscopic techniques, we observed that the bone tissue within the osteoid frame has a higher mineral content with mature collagen and mineral constituents, which are characteristic of aged tissue. In situ fracture mechanics measurements and synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography of the crack path indicated that vitamin D deficiency increases both the initiation and propagation of cracks by 22 to 31%.

Thus, vitamin D deficiency is not simply associated with diminished bone mass. Our analyses reveal the aged nature of the remaining mineralized bone and its greatly decreased fracture resistance. Through a combination of characterization techniques spanning multiple size scales, our study expands the clinical understanding of the pathophysiology of bone health in the context of vitamin D deficiency.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^111Mr3cj]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency, which impedes good immune function, is common during winter and spring in regions of high latitude. There is good evidence that vitamin D deficiency contributes to the seasonal increase of virus infections of the respiratory tract, from the common cold to influenza, and now possibly also COVID-19. This communication explores key factors that make it more likely, particularly in combination, that individuals are vitamin D deficient. These factors include old age, obesity, dark skin tone, and common genetic variants that impede vitamin D status. Precision nutrition is an approach that aims to consider known personal risk factors and health circumstances to provide more effective nutrition guidance in health and disease.

In regard to avoiding vitamin D deficiency, people with excess body fat, a dark skin tone, or older age usually need to use a moderately dosed daily vitamin D supplement. This is particularly true for those living in a high-latitude region, getting little ultraviolet B exposure due to air pollution, or staying mostly indoors. Carriers of the GC (group-specific component) rs4588 AA genotype are also more likely to become deficient. Very high-dosed supplements with more than 4000 IU vitamin D are rarely needed or justified.

A state-by-state Mendelian randomisation analysis of excess COVID-19 mortality of African-Americans in the United States shows a greater disparity in northern states than in southern states. It is conceivable that vitamin D adequacy denies the virus easy footholds and thereby slows the spreading of the contagion. This finding should drive home the message…

Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes; identifying and treating deficiency may improve outcomes.

- **Objective**: To review the evidence about screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and trial registries through March 12, 2020; bibliographies from retrieved articles, outside experts, and surveillance of the literature through November 30, 2020.

- **Study selection**: Fair- or good-quality, English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) compared with no screening, or treatment with vitamin D (with or without calcium) compared with placebo or no treatment conducted in nonpregnant adults; nonrandomized controlled intervention studies for harms only. Treatment was limited to studies enrolling or analyzing participants with low serum vitamin D levels.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two reviewers assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; when at least three similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Mortality, incident fractures, falls, diabetes, cardiovascular events, cancer, depression, physical functioning, and infection.

Forty-six studies (N = 16,205) (77 publications) were included. No studies directly evaluated the health benefits or harms of screening. Among community-dwelling populations, treatment was not significantly associated with mortality (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], 0.3% [95% CI, -0.6% to 1.1%]).

### Vitamin D supplementation: guidelines and evidence for subclinical deficiency [^116p1oAq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

To summarize recommendations from the 2011 US Institute of Medicine report on vitamin D and the new guideline from the US Endocrine Society, the focus is on treating and preventing vitamin D deficiency, including in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and those who have undergone gastric bypass.

The US Institute of Medicine has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 400 IU per day for children younger than 1 year, 600 IU per day for children aged 1 year and older up to age 70, and 800 IU per day for older adults. It was concluded that a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level of 20 ng/ml or more will meet the requirements for 97.5% of the population. The US Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline suggests that 400–1000 IU per day may be necessary for children under 1 year, 600–1000 IU per day for children aged 1 year and older, and 1500–2000 IU per day for adults aged 19 years and older to maintain 25(OH)D levels above 30 ng/ml, which is considered optimal. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, even in remission, and those who have had gastric bypass surgery require increased vitamin D to maintain adequate levels.

The differences in recommendations from the US Institute of Medicine and the US Endocrine Society's Practice Guideline reflect differing goals and perspectives on the evidence. There are significant gaps in the literature, highlighting a need for studies that assess the impact of vitamin D treatment on outcomes at various 25(OH)D levels.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D for adults aged 50–70 and 800 IU/day for those over 70 years. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether these amounts are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D may be necessary to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to over 30 ng/mL.

### Nutritional rickets: Deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or both [^116tjho3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Nutritional rickets remains a public health problem in many countries, despite dramatic declines in the prevalence of the condition in many developed countries since the discoveries of vitamin D and the role of ultraviolet light in prevention. The disease continues to be problematic among infants, especially those who are exclusively breast-fed, infants and children of dark-skinned immigrants living in temperate climates, infants and their mothers in the Middle East, and children in many developing countries in the tropics and subtropics, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Bangladesh. Vitamin D deficiency remains the major cause of rickets among young infants in most countries because breast milk is low in vitamin D and its metabolites, and social and religious customs and/or climatic conditions often prevent adequate ultraviolet light exposure. In sunny countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh, such factors do not apply.

Studies indicated that the disease occurs among older toddlers and children and probably is attributable to low dietary calcium intakes, which are characteristic of cereal-based diets with limited variety and little access to dairy products. In such situations, calcium supplements alone result in the healing of the bone disease. Studies among Asian children and African American toddlers suggested that low dietary calcium intakes result in increased catabolism of vitamin D and the development of vitamin D deficiency and rickets. Dietary calcium deficiency and vitamin D deficiency represent two ends of the nutrition spectrum causing rickets.

### Is vitamin D the fountain of youth [^1121WqZ8]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the role of vitamin D deficiency for both classic and "nonclassic" effects and to emphasize the caution that association does not prove causation. The methods include a review of the pertinent literature regarding vitamin D and its effects on bone, muscle function, immune function, glucose tolerance, cancer risk, and the development of cardiovascular disease and other conditions. Additionally, the limitations of observational studies are discussed.

Results show that vitamin D inadequacy is common worldwide and classically causes osteomalacia and rickets. More recently, there is an appreciation of the contribution of low vitamin D status to increased falls and fracture risk. Additionally, nonclassic effects of vitamin D inadequacy are being recognized, and low vitamin D status is potentially associated with a multitude of conditions, including Alzheimer disease, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, and higher overall mortality. It is important to recognize that associations in observational studies can be due to chance, bias, or confounders, or they may be indicative of causality.

The conclusion indicates that because vitamin D deficiency has been established to have adverse musculoskeletal consequences, optimization of vitamin D status, for both the individual patient and the overall population, is warranted.

### Prevalence and risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency at birth and associated outcome [^116qij2h]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

We found that up to 45% of infants are at risk for deficient vitamin D levels, and 35% are at risk for insufficient levels. The approximated probability of an infant being born with a sufficient vitamin D level, as defined by the AAP for children, is less than 40%. Importantly, the upper limit of vitamin D that is defined as sufficient could be suboptimal because vitamin D levels of < 30 ng/mL have been associated with increased secretion of intact parathyroid hormone and reduced intestinal calcium absorption in healthy adults. While a vitamin D level of 20 ng/mL is considered sufficient, maintaining a level of 30 ng/mL is recommended for better health in children and adults, despite the lack of clear evidence of an optimal concentration of vitamin D for bone and general health.

Because the main source of vitamin D is vitamin D3, which is synthesized in the skin through a photolytic reaction, the level of vitamin D depends on factors such as skin pigmentation, use of sunscreens, coverage of sun-exposed skin, seasonal factors, and geographic latitude.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QjdGp]. The Lancet Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with non-communicable and infectious diseases, but the vitamin D status of African populations is not well characterized. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in children and adults living in Africa.

- **Methods**: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, African Journals Online, and African Index Medicus for studies on vitamin D prevalence, published from database inception to Aug 6, 2019, without language restrictions. We included all studies with measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations from healthy participants residing in Africa. We excluded case reports and case series, studies that measured 25(OH)D only following a clinical intervention, and studies with only a meeting abstract or unpublished material available. We used a standardized data extraction form to collect information from eligible studies; if the required information was not available in the published report, we requested raw data from the authors. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in African populations, using established cutoffs and mean 25(OH)D concentrations. We stratified meta-analyses by participant age group, geographical region, and residence in rural or urban areas. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018112030.

- **Findings**: Our search identified 1692 studies, of which 129 studies with 21,474 participants from 23 African countries were included in the systematic review, and 119 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

### Vitamin D deficiency is not associated with growth or the incidence of common morbidities among Tanzanian infants [^117WtLR4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Infants are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency due to limited sun exposure and low dietary intake via human breastmilk. Dark skin pigmentation is a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Severe vitamin D deficiency can cause nutritional rickets. A previous cohort study conducted in Tanzania determined that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed uninfected infants with severe vitamin D deficiency at 6 weeks of age had an increased risk of wasting.

Vitamin D deficiency is common, particularly during the early weeks of life among HIV-unexposed Tanzanian infants. Vitamin D status among Tanzanian infants is primarily determined by breastfeeding status and season. Poor vitamin D status does not appear to be an important contributor to morbidity and growth among HIV-unexposed Tanzanian infants.

Globally, it is estimated that 1 billion people are vitamin D deficient and nearly 50% of the global population is affected by vitamin D insufficiency. For most individuals, 50% to 90% of the body's vitamin D is produced by sun exposure of the skin, while the remaining proportion is obtained from the diet. As a result, the risk of vitamin D deficiency is highly influenced by sun exposure, latitude, skin-covering clothing, and skin pigmentation. Infants are known to be at particularly high risk for vitamin D deficiency due to low rates of sun exposure and low dietary intake via human breastmilk, particularly if the mother is vitamin D deficient.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with substantial increases in the incidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke, as well as in diseases such as chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Low vitamin D levels also upregulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increase inflammation, and cause endothelial dysfunction.

However, the role of vitamin D deficiency in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is an emerging and hotly debated topic. Epidemiological studies suggest an association between low vitamin D levels and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but a causal relationship has not been established, and clinical trials and meta-analyses have not demonstrated convincing evidence that vitamin D therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes. Some evidence suggests that vitamin D status is a biomarker of lifestyle, as unhealthy and sedentary lifestyles are associated with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and are also risk factors for cardiovascular complications.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111dG7rW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, particularly in pediatric patients, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend ensuring at least 2–3 times more vitamin D intake for their age group. This recommendation is particularly relevant for children with obesity or those on medications such as anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, antifungals (such as ketoconazole), and medications for AIDS.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L).

The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

### Low vitamin D status despite abundant sun exposure [^115m2dmi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Lack of sun exposure is widely accepted as the primary cause of epidemic low vitamin D status worldwide. However, some individuals with seemingly adequate UV exposure have been reported to have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, results that might have been confounded by imprecision of the assays used.

- **Objective**: The aim was to document the 25(OH)D status of healthy individuals with habitually high sun exposure.

- **Setting**: This study was conducted in a convenience sample of adults in Honolulu, Hawaii (latitude 21 degrees).

- **Participants**: The study population consisted of 93 adults (30 women and 63 men) with a mean (SEM) age and body mass index of 24.0 years (0.7) and 23.6 kg/m² (0.4), respectively. Their self-reported sun exposure was 28.9 (1.5) hours per week, yielding a calculated sun exposure index of 11.1 (0.7).

- **Main outcome measures**: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured using a precise HPLC assay. Low vitamin D status was defined as a circulating 25(OH)D concentration less than 30 ng/ml.

- **Results**: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 31.6 ng/ml. Using a cutpoint of 30 ng/ml, 51% of this population had low vitamin D status. The highest 25(OH)D concentration was 62 ng/ml.

In conclusion, these data suggest that variable responsiveness to UVB radiation is evident among individuals, causing some to have low vitamin D status despite abundant sun exposure. Furthermore, because the maximal 25(OH)D concentration produced by natural UV exposure appears to be approximately 60 ng/ml, it seems prudent to use this value as an upper limit when prescribing vitamin D supplements.

### Vitamin D supplementation for term breastfed infants to prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health [^116ZZxso]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide, contributing to nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on the health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk, and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation given to infants or lactating mothers on vitamin D deficiency, bone density, and growth in healthy term breastfed infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to 29 May 2020, supplemented by searches of clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and citations.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in breastfeeding mother-infant pairs comparing vitamin D supplementation given to infants or lactating mothers with placebo, no intervention, or sunlight. Comparisons included vitamin D supplementation of infants versus supplementation of mothers.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 19 studies with 2837 mother-infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to lactating mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus lactating mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. Vitamin D supplementation given to infants at 400 IU/day may increase

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^114QNBg8]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

In the absence of sufficient UV-B exposure and dietary intake, 25(OH)D levels depend heavily on the release of stored vitamin D built up during periods of high vitamin D availability, mostly from heightened UV-B exposure. It is well documented that vitamin D stores decline and 25(OH)D levels greatly decrease during the dark season. Winter and spring levels at higher latitudes, such as in Central and Northern Europe, Canada, and the northern half of the United States, commonly drop to half of the summer and autumn levels or less. People who are elderly, obese, have dark skin tones, or carry genetic risk variants tend to be more severely affected than others living in the same region.

Deficient vitamin D status, as indicated by low 25(OH)D levels, undermines the maintenance of good health. There is little doubt that very low concentrations of 25(OH)D leave an opening for various health harms, from accelerated progression of osteoporosis, greater risk of falls, increased prevalence of obesity, heightened vulnerability to perinatal depression, impairment of glucose homeostasis, to reduced life expectancy and increased overall mortality, not least due to respiratory diseases. Thus, even if it turns out that a permissive effect of vitamin D deficiency for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the health outcomes following from that infection does not exist, there is still broad consensus that nobody should be vitamin D deficient at any time, neither in winter nor in old age, neither due to obesity nor due.

### Vitamin D and diabetic complications: True or false prophet [^117Kfm5V]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

There is an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency, with over one billion people worldwide affected. Our previously published UK data indicates that vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 30 ng/mL) occurs in 91% of patients with diabetes, with severe deficiency [25(OH)D < 10 ng/mL] in 32% of patients. The purpose of this review was to examine the association between vitamin D status and cardiovascular disease, with particular reference to diabetes mellitus and its complications.

This review is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, national guidance on the management of vitamin D deficiency has led to controversy and confusion in the UK, particularly concerning adult patients with or at risk of developing bone disease. In light of this, we are pleased to introduce an authoritative practical clinical guideline provided by the National Osteoporosis Society UK. This guideline has been developed to assist clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians, and other practicing professionals, by offering key recommendations on several crucial areas:

- **Estimation of vitamin D status**: Guidelines on the most effective methods for determining vitamin D levels.
- **Vitamin D testing recommendations**: Best practices for when and how to test for vitamin D.
- **Threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency**: Clearly defined parameters defining deficiency levels.
- **Treatment options for vitamin D deficiency**: Recommended treatment protocols to address deficiencies.
- **Rapid correction guidance**: Strategies for quickly correcting vitamin D deficiency.
- **Maintenance therapy advice**: Guidance on maintaining adequate vitamin D levels post-correction.
- **Monitoring blood tests**: Recommendations for regular testing to ensure sustained vitamin D sufficiency.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency represents a significant health challenge, complicated by a wide array of conflicting guidelines and inconsistent clinical management throughout the UK. This welcomed authoritative guidance aims to improve patient care and management.

Key points to note include:

- The worldwide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is notably high, particularly among the elderly.
- The marker 25OHD is identified as the most accurate indicator of vitamin D status, with deficiency defined as 25OHD concentrations of less than 30 nmol/L.
- While vitamin D is primarily responsible for maintaining extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, recent studies have associated it with many other health conditions.
- Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to muscle weakness, primarily affecting proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^116Bce1P]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

The workup of deficiency involves assessing vitamin D levels, which are not routinely screened in the general population. When vitamin D deficiency is suspected, the serum 25(OH)D₃ level is measured, as it is the major circulating form of vitamin D. Serum 1,25(OH)₂D₃ is typically measured only in special cases such as acquired and inherited vitamin D disorders. A serum 25(OH)D₃ level lower than 20 ng/mL (500 mmol/liter) is considered deficient, while levels between 21 and 29 ng/mL (525–725 mmol/liter) are considered insufficient.

In terms of management, foods in Canada and the United States, such as cow's milk and margarine, are fortified with vitamin D, although this fortification may not suffice in regions with low sun exposure. It is recommended that infants receive a daily intake of 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D, while adults should aim for a daily intake of 400–2000 IU.

### Vitamin D: importance in the prevention of cancers, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis [^113qJMQH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

This review aims to highlight the numerous health benefits of vitamin D and its deficiency in increasing the risk of several serious and common diseases, such as certain cancers, type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Epidemiologic studies frequently indicate that sunlight exposure, which facilitates the production of vitamin D(3) in the skin, is crucial in the prevention of many chronic diseases. Since very few foods inherently contain vitamin D, sunlight is the primary source for most of our vitamin D needs.

To assess vitamin D status, the metabolite 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] should be measured in the blood. Vitamin D deficiency is common among infants who are exclusively breastfed without vitamin D supplementation and in individuals of all ages with increased skin pigmentation, consistent use of sun protection, or restricted outdoor activities. Often, vitamin D deficiency is mistakenly diagnosed as fibromyalgia. A novel dietary source of vitamin D is fortified orange juice. Both human and animal studies support the hypothesis that a widespread, unrecognized epidemic of vitamin D deficiency is a contributing factor to many chronic debilitating diseases.

Increasing awareness of the subtle yet significant consequences of vitamin D deficiency is imperative. Annual serum 25(OH)D measurement is a sensible strategy for monitoring vitamin D deficiency. The current recommended adequate intakes for vitamin D are insufficient, and, barring sunlight exposure, a daily intake of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D is necessary.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117LzzKb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, particularly in pediatric patients concerning daily requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend maintaining tolerable upper limits of vitamin D without exceeding them without medical supervision. These limits are set at 1,000 IU/day for infants up to 6 months, 1,500 IU/day for infants from 6 months to 1 year, at least 2,500 IU/day for children aged 1–3 years, 3,000 IU/day for children aged 4–8 years, and 4,000 IU/day for children over 8 years old. It is recognized that higher levels of 2,000 IU/day for children aged 0–1 year, 4,000 IU/day for children aged 1–18 years, and up to 10,000 IU/day may be required to correct vitamin D deficiency.

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^11271EhQ]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). Low credibility.

Dietary intake is a key modulator of vitamin D status. The intake of the most common natural form of vitamin D, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in most, if not all, people. The rare exceptions are usually due to acquired or inherited disruptions of vitamin D absorption and metabolism, such as severe cholestasis and abetalipoproteinaemia. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is now a less common form in dietary supplements with lower bioavailability and potency than vitamin D3, but it has been used extensively in the past because of the low cost associated with its production.

Only a few foods, mainly fatty coldwater fish like herring, sardines, mackerel, and salmon, contain naturally significant amounts of vitamin D. Some foods, such as milk in the United States and fortified cereals in many countries, contain artificially added vitamin D, typically as vitamin D3. Another important vitamin D source for some people is dietary supplements.

After vitamin D is absorbed from the small intestines and bound to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in circulating blood, it eventually reaches the liver and is then rapidly converted by cytochrome enzymes, mainly CYP2R1, to the 25(OH)D form found in circulating blood.

Higher vitamin D intake is then associated with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. Representative oral doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU supplemental vitamin D3, in addition to approximately 200 IU from foods, were seen after 3 years to increase initially adequate 25(OH)D levels by about 0%, 63%, and 78%, respectively.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Dd4sy]. The Lancet Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with non-communicable and infectious diseases, but the vitamin D status of African populations is not well characterized. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in children and adults living in Africa.

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, African Journals Online, and African Index Medicus for studies on vitamin D prevalence, published from database inception to August 6, 2019, without language restrictions. We included all studies with measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations from healthy participants residing in Africa. We excluded case reports and case series, studies that measured 25(OH)D only following a clinical intervention, and studies with only a meeting abstract or unpublished material available. We used a standardized data extraction form to collect information from eligible studies; if the required information was not available in the published report, we requested raw data from the authors. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in African populations, using established cutoffs and mean 25(OH)D concentrations. Meta-analyses were stratified by participant age group, geographical region, and residence in rural or urban areas. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018112030.

Our search identified 1692 studies, of which 129 studies with 21,474 participants from 23 African countries were included in the systematic review.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111X74a6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The 2011 guidelines from the Endocrine Society provide specific recommendations for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in pediatric patients. It is suggested to initiate treatment with either 2,000 IU/day of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 for at least six weeks, or with 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 once weekly for at least six weeks. This is followed by maintenance therapy of 600–1,000 IU per day in pediatric patients aged 1–18 years. The goal is to achieve and maintain a blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL.
