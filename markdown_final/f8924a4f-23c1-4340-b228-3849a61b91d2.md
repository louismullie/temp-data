## Question

What is the appropriate evaluation and management of gastroenteritis presenting with frequent vomiting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage gastroenteritis presenting with frequent vomiting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and identification of red flags. Then, I should classify dehydration severity to choose the care venue. Next, I will decide on rehydration strategy with ORT versus IV and when to use nasogastric routes. After that, I need to address antiemetic therapy, including single-dose and possible multidose ondansetron. I will then cover antibiotics and when not to use them. Finally, I will consider adjuncts, monitoring, prevention, special populations, and implementation details to ensure consistent care pathways.

> Let me first confirm the initial clinical assessment priorities because missing red flags can be costly, and, wait, I should verify that dehydration scoring adds value beyond gestalt. A careful history and physical focused on fluid balance, urine output, frequency of emesis/diarrhea, mental status, mucous membranes, capillary refill, skin turgor, and respiratory pattern remains foundational, with the Clinical Dehydration Scale (CDS) providing a pragmatic 0–8 metric that correlates with severity and ED length of stay, though it does not replace clinical judgment [^117VVp7x] [^117B7Nr4] [^115xEro7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "just a stomach bug" when certain features mandate urgent action. I need to check for signs of shock, marked lethargy, bilious or bloody emesis, severe abdominal pain, or altered mental status that suggest surgical or metabolic emergencies such as obstruction, intussusception, diabetic ketoacidosis, elevated intracranial pressure, or pregnancy-related hyperemesis in women of childbearing age, and I should keep cyclic vomiting syndrome in mind if the pattern is stereotypic and recurrent while also remembering Dietl's crisis as a potential masquerader in children with episodic pain and vomiting [^111GcL98] [^113pHt9M] [^1154xBoH] [^1162b27s].

> Next, I should review what testing is actually helpful because over-ordering rarely improves outcomes here. Initial diagnostic testing is generally limited, with electrolytes or glucose reserved for moderate to severe dehydration or atypical features and routine stool studies unnecessary in likely viral illness, which aligns with primary care and ED guidance emphasizing targeted evaluation rather than broad panels [^117B7Nr4] [^1128hkTk] [^115tX9y8].

> I will now examine severity stratification and the care venue, and, wait, I should confirm that mild cases can be safely managed at home with structured follow-up. Mild disease without significant dehydration can be managed at home, moderate dehydration often needs ED-supervised oral rehydration with antiemetic support, and severe dehydration or shock requires hospital-level care with IV therapy and close monitoring until perfusion, mental status, and aspiration risk normalize [^117VVp7x] [^116t5QFh] [^116T8iZ1].

> For rehydration strategy, let me think about first-line options and confirm that ORT remains superior in most nonsevere cases. Reduced-osmolarity oral rehydration solutions are first-line for mild to moderate dehydration across ages, and in some minimally dehydrated children, a pragmatic approach with half-strength apple juice followed by preferred fluids can be effective and acceptable when ORS is refused or unavailable, although ORS is preferred when dehydration is more than minimal [^116t5QFh] [^117VVp7x].

> Now, antiemetic therapy is crucial when vomiting impedes ORT, but wait, I should double-check both efficacy and safety signals across trials. A single oral dose of ondansetron (commonly 0.15 mg/kg) reduces re-vomiting, facilitates oral intake, decreases the need for IV fluids, and shortens ED stays based on RCTs and systematic evidence, and while one network meta-analysis reported an odds ratio greater than 1 for hospitalization that appears directionally counterintuitive, the consistent clinical signal across trials is reduction in IV rehydration and improved ORT success, so I should interpret hospitalization outcomes with caution and rely on the robust IV reduction and vomiting cessation endpoints for decision support [^111Fwbx2] [^114THufC] [^116jnMej].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I previously said multiple-dose ondansetron should be avoided, and I need to reconcile that with emerging evidence. Earlier reviews recommended single-dose use and discouraged multidose regimens largely due to limited data and potential safety concerns, but a recent high-quality multicenter RCT showed that caregiver-administered multidose ondansetron over 48 hours after ED discharge reduced moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis, suggesting practice may evolve, though local protocols should consider the new data alongside patient selection, return precautions, and follow-up until guidelines are updated [^116KLu61] [^116KLu61].

> If ORT fails or dehydration is moderate to severe, I should confirm the IV approach and avoid assumptions that faster is better. Standard isotonic crystalloids with an initial 20 mL/kg bolus and reassessment is a prudent default; I initially thought rapid 60 mL/kg regimens might hasten recovery, but randomized trials and meta-analyses show no clinical advantage and raise concerns for adverse events in some contexts, and moreover, special caution is warranted in scenarios like myocarditis or DKA where rapid boluses may be harmful, underscoring the importance of diagnosis-specific tailoring and stepwise reassessment [^112tphpt] [^112MyGvw].

> But wait, what if I am practicing in a resource-limited setting where WHO Plan C is standard. I need to ensure I cite that Plan C has not been formally evaluated in randomized trials and recent work has questioned the safety of bolus-heavy strategies, with a phase II trial suggesting that slower rehydration without boluses may reduce serious adverse events, so careful local adaptation and safety monitoring are essential when applying bolus protocols in severely dehydrated children [^117XwQth] [^111GRniC] [^115qkCES].

> Let me reconsider alternatives when IV access is difficult or emesis persists despite antiemetics. Nasogastric rehydration is a viable and often underused option that can be at least as effective as IV rehydration in moderate to severe dehydration, and may reduce complications and resource use when implemented within a standardized protocol with close monitoring for gastric intolerance [^112yLZik].

> I should confirm antibiotic decision-making because unnecessary antibiotics remain common and harmful. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated in acute gastroenteritis, which is typically self-limited and viral, and empiric therapy should be reserved for dysentery, high fevers with invasive features, prolonged symptoms, severe traveler's diarrhea, immunocompromise, or pathogen-specific indications, with evidence showing no reduction in hospital stay for undifferentiated AGE; mild Vibrio gastroenteritis likewise warrants fluids rather than antibiotics [^1114Yef4] [^1128hkTk] [^112nJnTW] [^111toLwQ] [^116PfkuA].

> Next, I should review adjunctive therapies, and I need to ensure I do not overstate benefits where evidence is weak. Routine probiotics should be discouraged given recent high-quality trials showing lack of benefit and potential harm in some contexts, antimotility agents may provide symptomatic relief in watery diarrhea but should be avoided in bloody diarrhea, and structured monitoring of intake, output, urine frequency, and serial hydration status every few hours helps guide safe disposition decisions [^1134Czzk] [^1128hkTk] [^117VVp7x] [^116oY9j6].

> For prevention and public health, I should double-check the strongest levers for reducing morbidity. Hand hygiene and environmental cleaning remain cornerstones for norovirus and other enteric pathogens, and universal infant rotavirus immunization is recommended and has substantially reduced severe disease and hospitalizations in many regions, improving overall AGE outcomes even as norovirus prominence has increased post-rotavirus vaccine rollout [^115AD1jk] [^116twHoq] [^1128hkTk].

> Special populations require tailored thinking, so let me think through a few. Immunocompromised patients merit broader evaluation and a lower threshold for targeted antimicrobials, pregnant patients with severe vomiting need consideration of hyperemesis gravidarum and pregnancy-safe antiemetics, Parkinson's patients should avoid abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy during gastroenteritis to prevent severe complications, and recurrent stereotypic vomiting should prompt consideration of cyclic vomiting syndrome or gastric motility disorders, with management diverging from standard AGE pathways [^1114Yef4] [^113pHt9M] [^116qUSw1] [^1154xBoH] [^1168enq6].

> Implementation matters, and, hold on, I should verify where practice variation undermines outcomes. U.S. and Canadian EDs differ in ORT initiation, antiemetic use, and IV bolus practices, so embedding standardized pathways with CDS scoring, ORT-first algorithms, and protocolized single-dose ondansetron in the ED can reduce IV use and admissions while maintaining safety, with local review of emerging multidose data to update discharge practices [^112udihK] [^117VVp7x] [^111Fwbx2] [^1134Czzk].

> To summarize my clinical flow before finalizing orders, I should double-check coherence across steps. Assess dehydration severity and screen for red flags, prioritize reduced-osmolarity ORS with single-dose ondansetron when vomiting limits intake, escalate to NG or IV rehydration with standard 20 mL/kg boluses and reassessment rather than rapid strategies, avoid routine antibiotics and probiotics, tailor antimotility use, reinforce hygiene and rotavirus vaccination, and arrange discharge once the patient tolerates oral fluids with improving clinical scores and clear return precautions, now with consideration of recent evidence for selective multidose ondansetron after ED discharge where appropriate [^116t5QFh] [^111Fwbx2] [^116T8iZ1] [^1114Yef4] [^1134Czzk].

The workup for gastroenteritis with frequent vomiting centers on **clinical assessment of dehydration** [^117VVp7x] and exclusion of red flags (shock, altered mental status, severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, or blood in stool) [^111GcL98]. Routine labs are not needed for mild cases; obtain electrolytes, glucose, and renal function if moderate–severe dehydration or red flags are present [^116t5QFh] [^1128hkTk]. Oral rehydration with **reduced-osmolarity ORS** [^116t5QFh] is first-line for mild–moderate dehydration; use ondansetron to facilitate ORT when vomiting persists [^111Fwbx2]. Escalate to **IV isotonic fluids** [^116T8iZ1] for severe dehydration or ORT failure, and reserve antibiotics for specific indications (e.g. dysentery, immunocompromise) [^1114Yef4]. Early refeeding [^1128hkTk] and strict hand hygiene [^115AD1jk] are essential; admit for severe dehydration, shock, or inability to tolerate fluids [^117VVp7x].

---

## Clinical assessment and initial evaluation

### History and physical examination

For the **history**, assess onset, duration, and frequency of vomiting; associated symptoms (diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain) [^115tX9y8]; recent travel; sick contacts; dietary history; medication use; and comorbidities [^111GcL98]. The **physical examination** should evaluate general appearance, vital signs, hydration status (capillary refill, skin turgor, mucous membranes, fontanelle in infants), and include an abdominal and neurologic assessment [^115xEro7].

---

### Assessment of dehydration severity

Severity is categorized as **mild, moderate, or severe**. Mild dehydration presents with minimal clinical signs, normal vital signs, and slight thirst; moderate with tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes, and delayed capillary refill; and severe with hypotension, lethargy, shock, markedly delayed capillary refill, and minimal urine output [^115xEro7].

---

### Red flag symptoms requiring immediate attention

- Persistent vomiting (> 24–48 hours)
- Inability to retain fluids
- Signs of severe dehydration or shock
- Altered mental status
- Severe abdominal pain
- Blood in vomitus or stool
- Immunocompromised status
- Very young infants (< 3 months)

---

## Laboratory and diagnostic testing

Routine laboratory testing is generally unnecessary in mild cases, but evaluation is indicated with moderate to severe dehydration, persistent vomiting (> 48 hours), red flag symptoms, or in immunocompromised patients [^1128hkTk]. Recommended tests include **serum electrolytes, glucose, and renal function**; obtain blood gas analysis if severe dehydration or metabolic disturbance is suspected, and reserve stool studies for severe illness, persistent symptoms, immunocompromised hosts, or suspected outbreaks. Imaging with abdominal ultrasound or X-ray is reserved for suspected complications or alternative diagnoses such as obstruction or intussusception [^114NvTJh].

---

## Management strategies

### Rehydration therapy

Rehydration is the **cornerstone of management**. The choice of rehydration method depends on the severity of dehydration and the patient's ability to tolerate oral intake [^116UtX9W].

---

#### Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)

- **Indication**: First-line for mild to moderate dehydration [^116t5QFh].
- **Solution**: Reduced-osmolarity ORS (75 mmol/L sodium, 75 mmol/L glucose, osmolarity 245 mOsm/L) [^116t5QFh].
- **Administration**: Small, frequent sips (5–10 mL every 1–2 minutes); increase gradually as tolerated [^1128hkTk].
- **Adjunct**: Ondansetron may be used to facilitate ORT in children with persistent vomiting [^111Fwbx2].

---

#### Intravenous (IV) rehydration

IV rehydration is indicated for **severe dehydration**, shock, or failure of ORT [^116oY9j6]. Use isotonic solutions (normal saline or Ringer's lactate) and deliver 20 mL/kg boluses for severe dehydration or shock, repeating as needed. After stabilization, provide maintenance fluids using the 4–2–1 rule (4 mL/kg/h for the first 10 kg, 2 mL/kg/h for the next 10 kg, and 1 mL/kg/h for remaining weight) [^116T8iZ1].

---

### Antiemetic therapy

Ondansetron is effective in **reducing vomiting** [^116jnMej], facilitating ORT, and decreasing the need for IV fluids and hospitalization. A single oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg (maximum 8 mg) is recommended in children with persistent vomiting. Avoid routine use of multiple doses due to potential adverse effects, including diarrhea and QT prolongation [^114THufC] [^1134Czzk].

---

### Nutritional management

Resume age-appropriate feeding within 4–6 hours after rehydration; continue breastfeeding or formula for infants, and return to a regular diet for older children. Avoid restrictive diets, as **early refeeding** supports recovery and maintains nutritional status [^1128hkTk].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated**; reserve use for severe bacterial infections (e.g. dysentery, cholera) or in immunocompromised patients [^1114Yef4] [^116PfkuA].

---

## Prevention of complications

Prevent complications by closely **monitoring hydration status**, electrolyte balance, and nutritional status. Educate caregivers on recognizing dehydration, administering ORT correctly, and when to seek medical attention, and emphasize strict hand hygiene and infection control to limit transmission [^112FrHYx].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

- Severe dehydration or shock
- Persistent vomiting despite antiemetic therapy
- Inability to tolerate oral or nasogastric rehydration
- Significant electrolyte disturbances
- Altered mental status or severe systemic illness
- Immunocompromised patients
- Very young infants (< 3 months)

---

## Follow-up care and patient education

Arrange **follow-up within 24–48 hours** to reassess hydration status and clinical improvement [^117VVp7x]. Reinforce the importance of adequate hydration, early refeeding, hand hygiene, and recognition of warning signs, and ensure that infants receive rotavirus vaccination to prevent severe gastroenteritis [^116twHoq].

## Summary table: management of gastroenteritis with frequent vomiting

| **Severity** | **Rehydration** | **Antiemetic** | **Nutrition** | **Hospitalization** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | ORT | Not routinely | Early refeeding | No |
| Moderate | ORT ± ondansetron | Single dose | Early refeeding | If ORT fails |
| Severe | IV fluids | Ondansetron | Delayed until stable | Yes |

---

Management of gastroenteritis with frequent vomiting centers on **rehydration therapy**, antiemetic use, and early nutritional support. Hospitalization is reserved for severe cases or complications, and patient education is essential for prevention and follow-up care [^116UtX9W].

### Therapy of acute gastroenteritis: role of antibiotics [^1114Yef4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhoea remains a very common health problem, even in the industrialized world. One of the dilemmas in assessing patients with acute diarrhoea is deciding when to test for aetiological agents and when to initiate antimicrobial therapy. The management and therapy of acute gastroenteritis is discussed in two epidemiological settings: community-acquired diarrhoea and travellers' diarrhoea. Antibiotic therapy is not required in most patients with acute gastroenteritis because the illness is usually self-limiting. Antimicrobial therapy can also lead to adverse events, and unnecessary treatments add to resistance development. Nevertheless, empirical antimicrobial therapy can be necessary in certain situations, such as patients with febrile diarrhoeal illness, with fever and bloody diarrhoea, symptoms persisting for more than one week, or immunocompromised status.

The IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend administering reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution as first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate dehydration in infant, pediatric, and adult patients with acute diarrhea from any cause. It is also recommended for patients with mild-to-moderate dehydration associated with vomiting or severe diarrhea.

Norovirus is a leading cause of childhood vomiting and diarrhea in the United States and globally. Although most illnesses caused by norovirus are self-resolving, severe outcomes may occur from dehydration, including hospitalization and death. A vast majority of deaths from norovirus occur in developing countries. Immunocompromised children are at risk for more severe outcomes. Treatment of norovirus illness is focused on early correction of dehydration and maintenance of fluid status and nutrition. Hand hygiene, exclusion of ill individuals, and environmental cleaning are important for norovirus outbreak prevention and control, and vaccines to prevent norovirus illness are currently under development.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions.

- **Gastrointestinal etiologies**: Include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases.
- **Central nervous system etiologies**: Primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs.
- **Endocrinologic causes**: Pregnancy is the most common and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age.
- **Other causes**: Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses may also cause nausea and vomiting.

Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### Antiemetic drug use in children: What the clinician needs to know [^114THufC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Vomiting is not only unpleasant for both children and families, but it can also lead to frequent hospital admissions. Persistent vomiting hampers oral intake and increases the risk of dehydration; thus, the proper use of antiemetic drugs can be beneficial. The pharmacological treatment of vomiting in children remains challenging for pediatricians because several antiemetics are prescribed "off-label", outside their authorized drug label. Domperidone and ondansetron are the most commonly known antiemetic drugs. A single oral dose of ondansetron has been shown to reduce the risk of re-vomiting, the need for intravenous fluids, and hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis. There is sufficient evidence to support ondansetron administration in children, allowing its clinical use to be defined as "off-label/on evidence".

This review aims to provide an overview of the therapeutic use, safety, and main pharmacological properties of antiemetic drugs in children. A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed MEDLINE database was conducted to identify all articles published in English from 1998 to February 2018. At present, the "off-label/on-evidence" use of some antiemetics could improve the success rate of oral rehydration therapy in pediatric emergency settings and change the management of vomiting with the prevention of complications.

### Gastroenteritis in children [^117VVp7x]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is defined as a diarrheal disease of rapid onset, with or without nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain. In the United States, acute gastroenteritis accounts for 1.5 million office visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths in children each year. Evaluation of a child with acute gastroenteritis should include a recent history of fluid intake and output. Significant dehydration is unlikely if parents report no decrease in oral intake or urine output and no vomiting. The physical examination is the best way to evaluate hydration status. The four-item Clinical Dehydration Scale can be used to determine the severity of dehydration based on physical examination findings.

In children with mild illness, stool microbiological tests are not routinely needed when viral gastroenteritis is the likely diagnosis. Mild gastroenteritis in children can be managed at home. Oral rehydration therapy, such as providing half-strength apple juice followed by the child's preferred liquids, is the mainstay of treatment for mild dehydration and is as effective as intravenous rehydration for preventing hospitalization and return to the emergency department. Oral rehydration solutions are recommended for moderate dehydration. Ondansetron may be prescribed if needed to prevent vomiting and improve tolerance of oral rehydration solutions.

Hospitalization and intravenous fluids are recommended for children who do not respond to oral rehydration therapy plus an antiemetic, and for patients with severe dehydration (i.e. signs of shock or more than 10% dehydration). Handwashing remains an essential preventive measure.

### Update on nonantibiotic therapies for acute gastroenteritis [^1134Czzk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to provide an update on nonantibiotic therapies for acute gastroenteritis (AGE), focusing on antiemetics and probiotics.

The mainstay of therapy for nonsevere AGE remains oral rehydration therapy (ORT). Recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have further strengthened the evidence base supporting single-dose ondansetron administration in emergency departments to facilitate ORT based on evidence that it safely reduces intravenous fluid administration and hospitalization rates. Intravenous ondansetron administration and multiple-dose use should be avoided. A bimodal release ondansetron formulation was shown to improve outcomes in adolescents and adults with AGE in one study, but further evidence is required to support its use. Recent large trials evaluating probiotic administration demonstrated a lack of benefit, and guidelines that recommend their use should reassess their positions in light of this evidence. Furthermore, caution should be exercised when use is considered in high-risk populations and settings.

The benefits, dosing/route, and target populations most likely to benefit from ondansetron have been further clarified. Optimization of the real-life effectiveness of this therapy will require implementation strategies. Recent high-quality evidence showing a lack of efficacy and potential harm associated with probiotic use suggests that routine use for AGE should be discouraged.

### Rapid advances in understanding viral gastroenteritis from domestic surveillance [^113boS9i]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

"Winter vomiting disease" was the clinical moniker for viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE), including illnesses caused by norovirus and rotavirus, nearly 100 years ago. This nonspecific diagnosis represented a frequently observed illness with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea particularly prevalent in the colder months. One hundred years later, diagnosing specific AGE pathogens in clinical settings continues to be an elusive task. Clinical treatment options are nonspecific as well — primarily rehydration and supportive therapies. The identification of the viral pathogens is considered relatively time-consuming and costly.

In truth, viral AGE has likely caused misery, illness, and death among human populations for thousands of years, since people first facilitated disease transmission by congregating in groups. However, it has been only during the lifetime of many readers, beginning in the early 1970s, that norovirus, rotavirus, and an expanding collection of other viral AGE pathogens have been discovered. The advent of sensitive laboratory tools to detect and study the genetic evolution of these viruses has uncovered their critical role in the etiology of AGE. The flow of information is now so great that each year since 2008, more than 800 scientific papers have been published on this topic, as determined by a search of PubMed using the term acute gastroenteritis.

The field of viral gastroenteritis is in the midst of an extraordinary period of rapid development and transition. Vaccines to prevent rotavirus, the leading cause of AGE globally, have been developed and deployed, leading to significant reductions in disease burden.

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: Pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^116oY9j6]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The objective was to determine if rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration results in improved hydration and clinical outcomes when administered to children with gastroenteritis.

- **Design**: Single centre, two arm, parallel randomised pragmatic controlled trial. Blocked randomisation was stratified by site. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, investigators, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment assignment.

- **Setting**: Paediatric emergency department in a tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada.

- **Participants**: The study involved 226 children aged 3 months to 11 years; complete follow-up was obtained on 223 (99%). Eligible children were aged over 90 days, had a diagnosis of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis, had not responded to oral rehydration, and had been prescribed intravenous rehydration. Children were excluded if they weighed less than 5 kg or more than 33 kg, required fluid restriction, had a suspected surgical condition, or had an insurmountable language barrier. Children were also excluded if they had a history of a chronic systemic disease, abdominal surgery, bilious or bloody vomit, hypotension, hypoglycaemia, or hyperglycaemia.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either rapid (60 mL/kg) or standard (20 mL/kg) rehydration with 0.9% saline over an hour. Subsequent fluids were administered according to protocol.

- **Primary outcome**: Clinical rehydration was assessed with a validated scale two hours after the start of treatment.

- **Secondary outcomes**: These included prolonged treatment, mean clinical dehydration scores over the four-hour study period, time to discharge, repeat visits to the emergency department, and adequate follow-up.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116YLzzu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

- **Initial presentation in primary care**: In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders, and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care, and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action.

### Multidose ondansetron after emergency visits in children with gastroenteritis [^116KLu61]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Ondansetron improves outcomes when administered in emergency departments to children with acute gastroenteritis-associated vomiting. It is commonly prescribed at discharge to reduce symptoms, but evidence to support this practice is limited.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized superiority trial involving children 6 months to less than 18 years of age with acute gastroenteritis-associated vomiting in six pediatric emergency departments. Caregivers were provided with six doses of oral ondansetron or placebo to administer in response to ongoing vomiting during the first 48 hours after enrollment. The primary outcome was moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis, defined by a score of 9 or higher on the modified Vesikari scale (scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater severity), during the 7 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the presence of vomiting, the duration of vomiting (defined as the time from enrollment to the last vomiting episode), the number of vomiting episodes within 48 hours after enrollment, unscheduled physician visits within 7 days after enrollment, and receipt of intravenous fluids.

- **Results**: A total of 1030 children underwent randomization. Moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis occurred in 5.1% (23 of 452 participants for whom data were available) in the ondansetron group and 12.5% (55 of 441) in the placebo group (unadjusted risk difference, -7.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -11.2 to -3.7). After adjustment for site, weight, and missing data, ondansetron was associated with a lower incidence of moderate-to-severe gastroenteritis.

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: Pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^117Bv1Gb]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The objective was to determine if rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration results in improved hydration and clinical outcomes when administered to children with gastroenteritis.

- **Design**: Single centre, two arm, parallel randomised pragmatic controlled trial. Blocked randomisation stratified by site. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, investigators, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment assignment.

- **Setting**: Paediatric emergency department in a tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada.

- **Participants**: 226 children aged 3 months to 11 years; complete follow-up was obtained on 223 (99%). Eligible children were aged over 90 days, had a diagnosis of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis, had not responded to oral rehydration, and had been prescribed intravenous rehydration. Exclusion criteria included children weighing less than 5 kg or more than 33 kg, requiring fluid restriction, having a suspected surgical condition, or having an insurmountable language barrier. Children with a history of a chronic systemic disease, abdominal surgery, bilious or bloody vomit, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia were also excluded.

- **Interventions**: Rapid (60 mL/kg) or standard (20 mL/kg) rehydration with 0.9% saline over an hour; subsequent fluids administered according to protocol.

- **Main outcome measures**: Primary outcome: clinical rehydration, assessed with a validated scale, two hours after the start of treatment. Secondary outcomes included prolonged treatment, mean clinical dehydration scores over the four-hour study period, time to discharge, and repeat visits to the emergency department.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): A phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: who plan C versus slow rehydration [^117XwQth]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

World Health Organization rehydration management guidelines (plan C) for severe dehydration are widely practiced in resource-poor settings but have never been formally evaluated in a trial. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy trial raised concerns regarding the safety of bolus therapy for septic shock, warranting a formal evaluation of rehydration therapy for gastroenteritis.

- **Methods**: A multi-centre open-label phase II randomised controlled trial evaluated two rehydration strategies in 122 Ugandan and Kenyan children aged 60 days to 12 years with severe dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. We compared the safety and efficacy of standard rapid rehydration using Ringer's lactate (100 ml/kg over 3 hours [6 hours if < 1 year]), incorporating 0.9% saline boluses for children with shock (plan C), versus slower rehydration (100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate over 8 hours for all ages) without boluses (slow: experimental). The primary outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) within 48 hours, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included clinical, biochemical, and physiological measures of response to treatment by intravenous rehydration.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-two eligible children (median [IQR] age 8 [6–12] months) were randomised to plan C (n = 61) or slow (n = 61), with two (2%) lost to follow-up at day 7. Following randomisation, the mean (SD) time to start intravenous rehydration was 15 minutes (18) in both arms. The mean (SD) fluid received by 1 hour was greater in plan C (mean 20.2 ml/kg [12.2] and 33.1 ml/kg [17] for children).

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114TZ4FX]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Two reviewers, MI and TS, independently screened the results of the literature search and assessed the eligibility of studies to be included. Level 1 screening involved a broad assessment of study titles and abstracts. Level 2 screening entailed a comprehensive evaluation of the full text of studies that met the inclusion criteria, or in cases where a definite decision could not be made based on the title and/or abstract alone. We compared multiple reports of the same study and selected the most comprehensive report while excluding duplicates. Relevant data relating to the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study design (PICOS) criteria were extracted using a pre-agreed data extraction sheet.

- **Assessment of bias in the included studies**: The reviewers (MI and TS) assessed the risk of bias for each randomized controlled trial using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool. This tool evaluates internal validity in terms of selection (sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance and detection (blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors), attrition (incomplete outcome data), and reporting (selective outcome reporting). We used the summary quality assessment at the analysis stage to interpret the results. For each domain, we assigned the risk of bias categories as: i) 'low risk'; ii) 'unclear risk'; and iii) 'high risk'. A study was rated as being of good methodological quality when the level of bias was low in all four domains, or of lower quality when the level of bias was not consistently low.

### Hospitalizations associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis in the United States, 1993–2002 [^115RufR5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). High credibility.

In the United States, rotavirus gastroenteritis remains a common disease of children, resulting in numerous hospitalizations, clinic visits, and medical costs. It is a prevalent cause of morbidity and is associated with a high economic burden in developing countries. Prevention of hospitalizations is the primary target of rotavirus vaccines.

- **Methods**: To update estimates of rotavirus hospitalization rates in the United States, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 10 years of national hospitalization data associated with gastroenteritis. Both direct and indirect methods were used to estimate the percentage of cases associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis.

- **Results**: During 1993–2002, an average of 18% of all hospitalizations with gastroenteritis among children under 5 years old were associated with rotavirus infection, as determined by the rotavirus-specific International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification code. The annual proportion of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations increased from 15% in 1993–1995 to 21% in 2000–2002. Hospitalizations associated with rotavirus and those associated with nonspecific gastroenteritis exhibited marked winter-time seasonality and a similar age distribution, peaking among children between 3 and 24 months old. Using indirect estimation methods, 58,000 to 70,000 rotavirus-associated hospitalizations were estimated to occur each year in the United States.

- **Conclusions**: Rotavirus gastroenteritis remains an important cause of hospitalizations in the United States, with rates not declining from 1993 through 2002.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^115tX9y8]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins.

A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities.

Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement, small frequent meals, and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest duration necessary.

### Antiemetics for children with gastroenteritis: Off-label but still on in clinical practice [^111YQ6ir]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Antiemetics are not included for the treatment of vomiting associated with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children by standard guidelines. We performed a survey to determine antiemetic prescribing rates by Italian pediatricians. A structured questionnaire was distributed at a national pediatric conference. The majority of responders reported prescribing antiemetics for pediatric gastroenteritis. Although there is insufficient evidence to justify their use, the use of antiemetics is widely present among pediatricians.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: who plan C versus slow rehydration [^115fJBX9]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Following the correction of dehydration based on a review of WHO clinical signs and observations, children were assessed for their ability to take oral rehydration or feeds. Children who could take and retain oral fluids/feeds and who were in neutral or marginally positive fluid balance (with both input and output measured) were considered satisfactorily rehydrated. For protocol adherence, each child completed their allocated intravenous fluid hydration regimen regardless of when they were satisfactorily rehydrated, as WHO recommends completing rehydration first before re-evaluating.

Once able to tolerate oral fluids, children were offered oral rehydration fluids alongside their intravenous rehydration regimen. Each child had an input-output fluid monitoring chart, including urinary catheter volumes (where parents consented) and diaper weights, designed to document the volumes that children in both arms were drinking and retaining, as well as defining clinical endpoints. If a child developed suspected signs of fluid overload, intravenous fluids were stopped. If signs of pulmonary oedema emerged, clinicians were permitted to administer intravenous furosemide (1–2 mg/kg) and supplemental oxygen (if saturations were less than 90% by pulse oximetry). When stable, further fluid management was administered orally or via a nasogastric tube if the child was unable to take fluids orally.

If there were ongoing significant gastrointestinal fluid losses with persisting dehydration, the protocol permitted one repeat of the rehydration regimen as per the study criteria.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in the emergency department: A 10-year review of clinical presentation and management [^1177mtMj]. Pediatric emergency care (2022). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to determine how frequently patients with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with CVS-related symptoms. Furthermore, the study aimed to identify variables in clinical presentation that occur frequently in patients with multiple ED visits and to compare ED management of CVS with recommended guidelines.

This study is a retrospective chart review of all ED visits for CVS between April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2018, at a single center. Patients were identified from a master list of patients diagnosed with CVS in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic at the same center between June 1, 2004, and June 19, 2018.

Of the 181 CVS clinic patients identified, 65 had visited the ED (35.9%). Two hundred twenty-eight visits met inclusion criteria. A total of 42.5% of these visits were made by a small number of high-intensity patients (n = 6) who had an average of 16.1 visits each. These patients represented less than 10% of the total patient group. Patients with frequent visits had longer visits (536.52 vs. 380.55 minutes), more frequent hospital admissions (57.73% vs. 29.01%), and more visits to the ED before a formal diagnosis of CVS was made (5.83 vs. 1.22), but few other distinguishing characteristics. Only 27% of eligible visits were managed with an available order set, and management varied from recommended guidelines.

An ambiguous presentation makes the identification and consistent management of CVS in the ED difficult. Physicians should consider CVS for patients who present multiple symptoms to improve outcomes.

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: Pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^112tphpt]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Other potential explanations could include the existence of a time lag between intravascular volume repletion and the resolution of clinical dehydration, or that the clinical dehydration scale overestimated the severity of dehydration in our study population. While no data are available to support the former hypothesis, the dehydration scale used has previously performed well in evaluating children similar to those enrolled in our study. The scale, however, might have overestimated the severity of dehydration in some children, as our standard rehydration protocol (20 mL/kg) was sufficient to rehydrate many of the study participants.

In addition to lacking evidence of effectiveness, the routine use of intravenous fluid bolus treatment should be reconsidered as children initially diagnosed with gastroenteritis might have alternative or coexistent disease processes that, when treated with rapid intravenous rehydration, might result in important complications. Examples include patients with myocarditis who, if given excessive volumes of intravenous fluids, can suddenly decompensate, and those with diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetes insipidus who can develop cerebral oedema.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: who plan C versus slow rehydration [^113a8hNS]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Worldwide, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis occur annually in children under 5 years. In this age group, gastroenteritis is the second biggest cause of mortality, following acute respiratory illnesses. The vast majority of deaths occur in low-resource settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

A large case-control study, the Global Enteric Multicentre Study of gastroenteritis (GEMS), conducted in Africa and Asia, showed that children with moderate/severe gastroenteritis seeking care at health centres are 8.5 times more likely to die than non-gastroenteritis controls. A third of the fatalities occurred less than 7 days following enrolment, indicating that treatment strategies may not be working in practice and/or are poorly implemented.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced guidance on the management of dehydration in children with diarrhoea, largely based on expert opinion. In children without severe malnutrition, oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for children with diarrhoea with some dehydration. This is defined as having two or more of the following: restlessness/irritability, sunken eyes, drinks eagerly/thirsty, and/or skin pinch goes back slowly (plan B). Intravenous fluids are recommended for the resuscitation of children with severe dehydration, defined as the presence of two or more of the following clinical features: sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back very slowly (≥ 2 seconds), lethargy, and/or inability to drink (under the protocol called 'plan C'), using 100 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or 0.9% saline.

### Hospital management of children with acute gastroenteritis [^112yLZik]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a major cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and the prescription of investigations, drugs, and dietary changes. Several guidelines on management have been produced.

- **Recent findings**: There is new information on different rehydration protocols, and the use of antiemetics and antidiarrheal drugs that could reduce the burden of AGE. The need for intravenous (i.v.) rehydration is the main cause of hospital admission, yet a standardized rehydration scheme is not available. Rehydration therapy through a nasogastric tube is better than i.v. rehydration in children with moderate to severe dehydration. Ultrarapid rehydration has been proposed by enteric or i.v. route to reduce the hospital stay duration and costs. However, reduced rehydration times are associated with high readmission rates and side effects. Antiemetics may reduce the need for i.v. rehydration due to vomiting and the number of hospital admissions; however, the main antiemetic, ondansetron, has a warning for potentially severe side effects. Selected antidiarrheal drugs could reduce the length of stay, but data on their use in inpatients are still not conclusive.

- **Summary**: Inappropriate medical interventions are still common in the hospital setting and have a high impact on costs. A validated management strategy is still needed for inpatients.

### It's not cyclic vomiting syndrome until Dietl's is ruled out: A case for point of care renal ultrasound [^1162b27s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Abdominal pain and vomiting are frequent complaints for pediatric patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). When a diagnosis such as chronic abdominal pain, cyclic vomiting, or abdominal migraine has previously been made, it can lead to diagnostic momentum and confirmation bias on behalf of the treating physician. Dietl's crisis is a commonly missed diagnosis in the pediatric population that presents with intermittent episodes of pain and vomiting. It can be readily diagnosed at the bedside by the emergency physician (EP) through the employment of point of care ultrasound (POCUS).

- **Case series**: We present two cases of pediatric patients with episodic abdominal pain and vomiting who were previously diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. In both cases, pediatric gastroenterology evaluations had occurred with negative diagnostic testing having been performed. Both patients also presented to their primary pediatrician and the ED multiple times, with each encounter resulting in treatment of symptoms and discharge. Each patient eventually presented to the ED when an EP was present who performed a renal POCUS. In each patient, the POCUS revealed severe unilateral hydronephrosis. Subsequent workup confirmed the diagnosis of Dietl's crisis as the etiology of symptoms.

Emergency physicians should be aware of this condition: in pediatric patients, EPs should be wary of the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome until ureteral obstruction has been ruled out. A bedside POCUS can rapidly establish this diagnosis and potentially preclude repeated healthcare visits.

### An unusual infection on an unusual gastroenteritis [^117ET7oj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a rare entity, part of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, characterized by symptoms caused by eosinophilic infiltration in the digestive tract. The clinical presentation is influenced by the layer of the gut involved; diagnosis, especially in the serosal form, is often difficult. The etiology is unclear, possibly multifactorial.

We present a case of a young female with a background of EG, admitted with a severe clinical picture involving both the respiratory and GI tracts. The severity of symptoms and recent steroid use (for EG) broadened the differential diagnosis to include acute pulmonary embolism (PE), community-acquired pneumonias, and eosinophilic pneumonias.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and specifically concerning initial evaluation, BSG 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining workups judiciously. This includes utilizing radiology, radioisotope studies, manometry, autoimmune screens, and histology, in accordance with guidelines. It is important to consider the presence of certain drugs, such as opioids, cyclizine, or anticholinergic drugs, as well as severe malnutrition or an eating disorder when interpreting results.

### The management of children with gastroenteritis and dehydration in the emergency department [^117B7Nr4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is characterized by diarrhea, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. The objective of this study is to review the evidence on the assessment of dehydration, methods of rehydration, and the utility of antiemetics in children presenting with acute gastroenteritis.

- **Evidence and discussion**: The evidence suggests that the three most useful predictors of 5% or more dehydration are abnormal capillary refill, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. Studies are conflicting on whether blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or BUN/creatinine ratio correlates with dehydration, but several studies found that low serum bicarbonate combined with certain clinical parameters predicts dehydration. In most studies, oral or nasogastric rehydration with an oral rehydration solution was equally efficacious as intravenous (i.v.) rehydration. Many experts discourage the routine use of antiemetics in young children; however, children receiving ondansetron are less likely to vomit, have greater oral intake, and are less likely to be treated by intravenous rehydration. The mean length of Emergency Department (ED) stay is also reduced, and very few serious side effects have been reported.

- **Conclusions**: In the ED, dehydration is evaluated by synthesizing the historical and physical examination and obtaining laboratory data points in select patients. No single laboratory value has been found to be accurate in predicting the degree of dehydration, and this is not routinely recommended. The evidence suggests that the majority of children with mild to moderate dehydration can be effectively managed with appropriate rehydration strategies.

### Acute diarrhea [^1128hkTk]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea in adults is a common problem encountered by family physicians. The most common etiology is viral gastroenteritis, a self-limited disease. Increases in travel, comorbidities, and foodborne illness lead to more bacteria-related cases of acute diarrhea. A history and physical examination evaluating for risk factors and signs of inflammatory diarrhea and/or severe dehydration can direct any needed testing and treatment.

Most patients do not require laboratory workup, and routine stool cultures are not recommended. Treatment focuses on preventing and treating dehydration. Diagnostic investigation should be reserved for patients with severe dehydration or illness, persistent fever, bloody stool, or immunosuppression, and for cases of suspected nosocomial infection or outbreak.

Oral rehydration therapy with early refeeding is the preferred treatment for dehydration. Antimotility agents should be avoided in patients with bloody diarrhea, but loperamide/simethicone may improve symptoms in patients with watery diarrhea. Probiotic use may shorten the duration of illness.

When used appropriately, antibiotics are effective in the treatment of shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, Clostridium difficile, traveler's diarrhea, and protozoal infections. Prevention of acute diarrhea is promoted through adequate hand washing, safe food preparation, access to clean water, and vaccinations.

### Effects of rotavirus vaccination coverage among infants on hospital admission for gastroenteritis across all age groups, Japan, 2011–2019 [^1125i3wt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Gastroenteritis is one of the most common infectious diseases, characterized by a rapid onset of diarrhea with or without nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. Enteric viruses and bacteria are major causes of gastroenteritis, although the causes of hospitalizations related to gastroenteritis are often unidentified. This condition affects persons of all ages and is a leading cause of death worldwide. Younger children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients, in particular, are at risk of severe gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits continue to be significant burdens on health systems.

Rotavirus is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and diarrhea, including fatal illnesses, in both young children and persons of all ages. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the pooled rotavirus prevalence was 7.6% (95% CI 6.2%–9.2%) among persons over 5 years of age with diarrhea. Rotavirus infection is estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths annually in children under 5 years of age. Oral live-attenuated rotavirus vaccines for infants have been implemented worldwide since 2006. The World Health Organization in 2009 recommended routine immunization for all infants to prevent rotavirus disease.

In Japan, the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 2011 to be administered to infants 2–8 months of age. Vaccination coverage in Japan gradually increased from 30% in 2012 to 78% in 2019. However, disparity among prefectures in coverage rates remains relatively high, with approximately 30% in 2019. The implementation of rotavirus vaccines has substantially…

Secondary outcomes included the time to correct signs of severe dehydration, time to tolerate oral fluids/feeds, time to discharge, dysnatraemia (defined as ≥ 145 mmol/L) at 8 hours, and readmission to the hospital within 7 days post-discharge.

- **Study procedures**:

- **Screening and randomisation**: Children with suspected severe dehydration, based on presenting symptoms, were clinically assessed for severity and other exclusion criteria. Once eligibility was confirmed, authorised trial staff approached parents/guardians to invite their child to participate in the trial. Where prior written consent from parents/legal guardians could not be obtained, ethics committees approved parental verbal assent and deferred written informed consent as soon as practicable. Otherwise, informed written consent was obtained from parents or guardians before randomisation. The randomisation list and envelopes were prepared by an independent data manager in KWTP Kilifi. These lists were not available to investigators and were stratified by clinical centre. The schedule for each centre contained a list of trial numbers and randomly allocated interventions. The treatment allocation (plan C versus slow intravenous rehydration) was kept in numbered, sealed opaque envelopes. The cards were numbered consecutively and were opened in numerical order.

### Changes in the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of viral gastroenteritis among hospitalized children in the mainland of China: a retrospective study from 2016 to 2020 [^114bwFN4]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is generally a self-limiting condition, resolving within one week, most commonly associated with viral infection. There were no fatal cases in our study; however, patients usually suffered from complications such as dehydration, electrolyte disorders, and acidosis. Our study showed more dehydration in children with norovirus (NV) infections, electrolyte disturbances in children with rotavirus (RV) infections, and electrolyte disorders with adenovirus (ADV) infections. The length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization expense for children with viral gastroenteritis were associated with age, region, and pathogens in children.

Our study has some limitations. The most frequently encountered patients with viral gastroenteritis are outpatients, while our database only contains data from hospitalized children, limiting knowledge of the total incidence of viral gastroenteritis. Additionally, various detection methods for pathogens in different hospitals lead to diversity in the effectiveness of detection methods for the same pathogen, preventing comparisons between different pathogens. In this study, no follow-up information was available for the children with viral gastroenteritis, especially those transferred to other hospitals. Due to a lack of clear information regarding patients' RV vaccination status, assessing the protective effect of RV vaccination in viral gastroenteritis is challenging.

### Viral gastroenteritis [^116UtX9W]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Since the discovery of norovirus in 1972 as a cause of what was contemporarily known as acute infectious non-bacterial gastroenteritis, scientific understanding of viral gastroenteritides has continued to evolve. It is now recognized that a small number of viruses are the predominant cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, in both high-income and low-income settings. Although treatment is still largely restricted to the replacement of fluid and electrolytes, improved diagnostics have allowed attribution of illness, enabling both targeted treatment of individual patients and prioritization of interventions for populations worldwide.

Questions remain regarding specific genetic and immunological factors underlying host susceptibility and the optimal clinical management of patients who are susceptible to severe or prolonged manifestations of the disease. Meanwhile, the worldwide implementation of rotavirus vaccines has led to substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality and has spurred interest in vaccine development to diminish the impact of the most prevalent viruses that are implicated in this syndrome.

### External validation of the clinical dehydration scale for children with acute gastroenteritis [^115xEro7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The objective was to validate the clinical dehydration scale (CDS) for children with gastroenteritis in a different pediatric emergency department (ED) from where it was initially derived and validated. A prospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary care pediatric ED over a 1-year period. A sample of triage nurses was trained in applying the CDS.

The CDS consists of four clinical characteristics: general appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, and tears. Each is scored 0, 1, or 2, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 8. A score of 0 represents no dehydration; 1 to 4, some dehydration; and 5 to 8, moderate/severe dehydration. Children aged 1 month to 5 years with vomiting and/or diarrhea, who had the CDS documented at triage and a final diagnosis of gastroenteritis, gastritis, or enteritis, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included a chronic disease, treatment with intravenous (IV) rehydration within the previous 24 hours, a visit to the ED for the same illness in the 7 days prior to arrival, and diarrhea lasting more than 10 days. The primary outcome was the length of stay (LOS) in the ED from the time of seeing a physician to discharge, analyzed with a Kruskal-Wallis test.

From April 2008 to March 2009, 150 patients with a mean (± SD) age of 22 (± 14) months (range = 4 months to 4 years) were enrolled. Fifty-six patients had no dehydration, 74 had some dehydration, and 20 had moderate/severe dehydration. The median LOS in the ED after being seen by a physician was significantly longer as children appeared more dehydrated according to the CDS.

### Acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction secondary to Sjogren's syndrome in pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^113ZSxQu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

Our patient initially presented with non-specific symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without any inciting factors and was treated for acute gastroenteritis. However, her symptoms continued to worsen despite supportive measures, which eventually led to the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO) is mainly established by an abdominal CT scan; however, it remains difficult in most cases to definitively distinguish between IPO and mechanical obstruction.

In our case, we decided to proceed with conservative management as there were no signs of imminent perforation, ischemia, or necrosis. Clinicians should also be mindful of identifying any secondary causes of IPO, as this could change the management approach, as shown in the present case. We believed IPO was driven by the patient's underlying autoimmune diseases, and the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy eventually led to the resolution of IPO.

### An unusual infection on an unusual gastroenteritis [^113rHo82]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Various GI presentations have been attributed to primary or secondary eosinophilic disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune diseases, reactions to drugs, hypereosinophilia syndrome, and solid organ transplantation. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a heterogeneous disorder affecting both children and adults, characterized by an intense eosinophilic infiltrate in one or multiple segments of the gastrointestinal tract, from the esophagus to the rectum. This infiltration can involve part or the full thickness of the organ wall. A strong history of various allergies is present in up to 25–75% of patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

Mucosal eosinophilic gastroenteritis is the most common form, likely due to easier diagnosis through endoscopy and biopsies. It usually presents with non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, or protein-losing enteropathy. Occasionally, deeper layers may be involved, causing signs and symptoms of gastric outlet or intestinal obstruction. Involvement of the serosal layer occurs in 10–40% of cases and typically presents with ascites. It is associated with significant bloating, higher peripheral eosinophilia, and a better response to steroids, though relapses are common, necessitating repeated steroid treatments. The diagnosis of this entity requires a high index of suspicion and the exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia.

Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for EG, providing rapid and effective relief of symptoms. However, large prospective studies have not demonstrated long-term response and histological improvement. Relapses frequently occur with steroid tapering.

### Diagnostic characteristics of pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113DVHjo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) remains a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific presentation despite consensus-based diagnostic criteria. There is a need for improved, evidence-based diagnostic criteria. We hypothesized that symptoms differ quantitatively between children with CVS versus other vomiting conditions and that diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently sensitive for diagnosing CVS.

- **Methods**: Observational, prospective study of children ages 3–18 years with unexplained vomiting episodes evaluated in the outpatient gastroenterology clinic, emergency department, and inpatient units at Children's Wisconsin. Parents completed symptom surveys at 0, 3, and 6 months. Diagnostic workup and treatment response were monitored by chart review. A final diagnosis (CVS vs. non-CVS) was assigned for group comparisons and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of diagnostic cutoffs.

- **Results**: Of 108 subjects enrolled, 46 CVS and 54 non-CVS patients were analyzed. The groups reported overall different episode frequencies, with more CVS versus non-CVS patients (81% vs. 55%) having ≥ 4 episodes in the preceding 12 months (p = 0.013). CVS patients also had longer vomiting episodes (p = 0.03). To distinguish CVS from non-CVS, ROC analyses demonstrated the highest sensitivity for a frequency of 4–10 episodes/12 months (p = 0.002) and a duration threshold of > 2 hours (p < 0.001). CVS patients reported specific episode characteristics: photophobia (p = 0.003), diaphoresis (p = 0.002), multiple emeses/hour (p = 0.001), stereotypical episodes (p = 0.008), and continued retching after gastric emesis.

### Burden of acute gastroenteritis among children younger than 5 years of age — a survey among parents in the United Arab Emirates [^115WQ7k9]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Despite its high incidence among children under the age of five, little is known about the burden of pediatric gastroenteritis outside the medical setting. The objective of this study was to describe the burden of acute gastroenteritis among children residing in the United Arab Emirates, including those not receiving medical care.

- **Methods**: A quantitative cross-sectional survey of 500 parents of children under 5 years of age who had suffered from acute gastroenteritis in the preceding three months was conducted in the cities of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain. Data collected included respondent characteristics, disease symptoms, medical care sought, parental expenditures, and work loss. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric statistical methods.

- **Results**: Vomiting and diarrhea episodes lasted on average between 3 and 4 days. Overall, 87% of parents sought medical care for their children; 10% of these cases required hospitalization with an average length of stay of 2.6 days. When medical care was sought, the average parental cost per gastroenteritis episode was US$64, 4.5 times higher than with home care only (US$14). Nearly 60% of this difference was attributable to co-payments and medication use: 69% of children used oral rehydration solution, 68% used antiemetics, 65% used antibiotics, and 64% used antidiarrheals. Overall, 38 parents missed work per 100 gastroenteritis episodes for an average of 1.4 days.

- **Conclusions**: Given its high incidence, pediatric gastroenteritis has an important financial and productivity impact on parents in the United Arab Emirates.

To reduce the financial burden, targeted interventions and policies are necessary to support families dealing with pediatric gastroenteritis.

### Estimating foodborne gastroenteritis, Australia [^114qy8Lj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The definition of community gastroenteritis used in this Australian study refers to moderate-to-severe illness, with at least three loose stools or two episodes of vomiting in a single day. To improve the specificity of our definition for enteric illness, we excluded patients with concomitant respiratory symptoms unless they had more severe symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting. Previous studies have found similarly high rates of respiratory symptoms among cases of gastroenteritis. A definition inclusive of milder illness would lead to a higher estimate of foodborne gastroenteritis, while a definition that included only more severe illness would lead to a lower estimate.

We also took account of those with respiratory symptoms in our definition of community gastroenteritis, although most studies estimating the amount of gastroenteritis have not considered this. The United States study adjusted for those with respiratory illness by excluding a proportion of case-patients who were thought likely to have symptoms secondary to respiratory infections rather than a primary enteric infection. The UK definition of gastroenteritis was different from the Australian definition in several ways. While differing arguments can be raised about the best definition of gastroenteritis, the main concern is to have a consistent, reasonable definition for comparative purposes.

### Healthcare-associated gastroenteritis: Outbreak report and systematic review of the literature [^112FrHYx]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). High credibility.

Healthcare-associated gastroenteritis continues to be associated with significant pediatric morbidity and mortality despite the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. Infection prevention (IP) measures are critical in mitigating outbreaks. We describe an outbreak of norovirus, effective IP strategies utilized, and calculated the costs associated with the outbreak. To demonstrate the burden of these events, we conducted a systematic review of pediatric healthcare-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks since 1973 to describe changing epidemiologic trends. Twenty-four publications describing 27 outbreaks were included in the final analysis, with 293 healthcare-associated cases. Rotavirus (14) and norovirus (7) outbreaks were most commonly described. Limitations include the retrospective nature of included reports and nonuniform data ascertainment and reporting among publications. Norovirus has replaced rotavirus as the most common etiology of healthcare-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^1154xBoH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder that is increasingly recognized in adults. It is characterized by episodic nausea and vomiting and is associated with significant morbidity. Approximately one-third of adult patients become disabled.

There is considerable variation in the recognition, diagnosis, and management of CVS. The diagnosis for CVS is based on the Rome criteria, first developed in 2006 and subsequently revised in 2016. Although their sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing CVS have not been determined, the Rome IV symptom-based criteria establish a uniform, symptom-based framework useful in clinical practice. While other disorders of nausea and vomiting, such as gastroparesis, may be confused with CVS, these disorders lack the stereotypical and sudden onset of symptoms, features fairly unique to CVS.

With further research, the clinical features of CVS will become better delineated, likely influencing future iterations of symptom-based CVS diagnostic criteria. For example, many patients with CVS experience abdominal pain during an acute attack. However, this feature is not currently incorporated in the Rome IV CVS criteria and should be considered in future revisions.

Regarding medical management for acute diarrhea, particularly in the context of intravenous fluids, the IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend continuing IV rehydration in cases of severe dehydration. This should be maintained until the patient's pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize, they awaken, and there is no risk of aspiration or evidence of ileus. Consider replacing the remaining deficit with oral rehydration.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: who plan C versus slow rehydration [^111GRniC]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization rehydration management guidelines (Plan C) for severe dehydration are widely practiced in resource-poor settings but have never been formally evaluated in a trial. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy trial raised concerns regarding the safety of bolus therapy for septic shock, warranting a formal evaluation of rehydration therapy for gastroenteritis.

- **Methods**: A multi-centre open-label phase II randomized controlled trial evaluated two rehydration strategies in 122 Ugandan and Kenyan children aged 60 days to 12 years with severe dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. We compared the safety and efficacy of standard rapid rehydration using Ringer's lactate (100 ml/kg over 3 hours (6 hours if < 1 year), incorporating 0.9% saline boluses for children with shock (Plan C) versus slower rehydration: 100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate over 8 hours (all ages) without boluses (slow: experimental). The primary outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) within 48 hours, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included clinical, biochemical, and physiological measures of response to treatment by intravenous rehydration.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-two eligible children (median (IQR) age 8 (6–12) months) were randomized to Plan C (n = 61) or slow (n = 61), with two (2%) lost to follow-up on day 7. Following randomization, the mean (SD) time to start intravenous rehydration was 15 minutes (18) in both arms. The mean (SD) fluid received by 1 hour was greater in Plan C: mean 20.2 ml/kg (12.2) and 33.1 ml/kg (17) for children under 1 year.

### Antiemetics in children with acute gastroenteritis: A meta-analysis [^116jnMej]. Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Several antiemetics have been used in children with acute gastroenteritis; however, there remains controversy over their use. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of antiemetics for controlling vomiting in such cases.

- **Data sources**: Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Latin America and the Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences, and gray literature until December 2018.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials comparing metoclopramide, ondansetron, domperidone, dexamethasone, dimenhydrinate, and granisetron were selected.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed using the random-effects model.

- **Results**: Twenty-four studies were included, incorporating data from 3482 children. Ondansetron showed the largest effect in comparison to placebo for cessation of vomiting (odds ratio = 0.28 [95% credible interval = 0.16 to 0.46]; quality of evidence: high) and for hospitalization (odds ratio = 2.93 [95% credible interval = 1.69 to 6.18]; quality of evidence: moderate). Ondansetron was the only intervention that reduced the need for intravenous rehydration and the number of vomiting episodes. Notably, dimenhydrinate was associated with more side effects than placebo.

- **Limitations**: Many treatment comparisons were hampered by low- or very low-quality evidence due to risks of biases and imprecise estimates.

### Rotavirus infection: A disease of the past [^1171KLXE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhea disease in infants and young children worldwide. Vaccination is the only control measure likely to have a significant impact on the incidence of severe disease. Rotavirus vaccines have reduced the burden of disease in the United States and Europe, and vaccine programs are being introduced in Asia and Africa, where it is hoped that the vaccine will have a significant impact on severe infection. Long-term monitoring and strain surveillance are needed to assess the effects of rotavirus immunization programs and to determine whether changes in strain ecology will affect rotavirus vaccine effectiveness.

### Rumination syndrome: Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^1155sZnY]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on rumination syndrome:

- **Definition**: RS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the effortless and repetitive regurgitation of recently ingested food from the stomach to the oral cavity, followed by either re-swallowing or spitting.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of RS involves a voluntary but unconscious process. This process consists of a coordinated abdominothoracic muscle response, including thoracic suction, crural diaphragm relaxation, and increased intragastric pressure. These factors collectively reverse the esophagogastric pressure gradient due to low lower esophageal sphincter and intrathoracic pressures. The exact trigger for rumination events is unclear, but they may result from dyspeptic symptoms as patients seek relief through regurgitation or venting. GERD and pathological supragastric belching can also provoke or aggravate RS. Enhanced visceral pain perception and poor postprandial accommodation of the stomach have been suggested as mechanisms for epigastric pain and the feeling of bloating in patients with RS.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of RS in the US is estimated at 5.8%, with higher rates observed in children and adolescents.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for RS include female gender, smoking, adherence to a gluten-free diet, and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, a history of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, as well as psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression, have been identified as independent risk factors for RS.

### Oral ondansetron administration to nondehydrated children with diarrhea and associated vomiting in emergency departments in Pakistan: A randomized controlled trial [^112bDBgK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

We also found antibiotic use to be surprisingly common both before ED arrival and in the ED itself despite the fact that international guidelines recommend against antibiotic treatment for nonbloody diarrhea. Our findings align with those of other reports, including the recently completed Malnutrition and Enteric Disease birth cohort study, which involved 2,134 children from eight sites in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, and the United Republic of Tanzania. This study reported antibiotic use in 44% of cases of nonbloody diarrhea.

In summary, our findings do not provide evidence to support the routine administration of a single dose of oral ondansetron for the prevention of intravenous fluid administration in children with gastroenteritis but without evidence of dehydration.

### Oral ondansetron for gastroenteritis in a pediatric emergency department [^111Fwbx2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Vomiting limits the success of oral rehydration in children with gastroenteritis. We conducted a double-blind trial to determine whether a single oral dose of ondansetron, an antiemetic, would improve outcomes in children with gastroenteritis.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 215 children aged 6 months to 10 years who were treated in a pediatric emergency department for gastroenteritis and dehydration. After being randomly assigned to treatment with orally disintegrating ondansetron tablets or placebo, the children received oral rehydration therapy according to a standardized protocol. The primary outcome was the proportion who vomited while receiving oral rehydration. The secondary outcomes were the number of episodes of vomiting and the proportions who were treated with intravenous rehydration or hospitalized.

- **Results**: Compared with children who received a placebo, those who received ondansetron were less likely to vomit (14 percent vs. 35 percent; relative risk, 0.40; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.61). They vomited less often (mean number of episodes per child, 0.18 vs. 0.65; P < 0.001), had greater oral intake (239 mL vs. 196 ml, P = 0.001), and were less likely to be treated by intravenous rehydration (14 percent vs. 31 percent; relative risk, 0.46; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.79). Although the mean length of stay in the emergency department was reduced by 12 percent in the ondansetron group (P = 0.02), compared with the placebo group, the rates of hospitalization (4 percent vs. 5 percent, P = 1.00) and of return visits were comparable.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in 41 adults: the illness, the patients, and problems of management [^113kyFno]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) consists of recurrent, stereotypic episodes of incapacitating nausea and vomiting lasting hours to days and separated by symptom-free intervals, which typically last weeks or months.

The illness has four phases: the inter-episodic phase, during which the patient is relatively symptom-free; the prodrome, which begins when the patient senses the approach of an episode and experiences nausea of varying intensity but is still able to retain oral medications; the emetic phase, characterized by intense, persistent nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms; and the recovery phase, which begins with the subsidence of nausea and ends when hunger, tolerance of oral intake, and vigor return to normal (Figure 1). Episodes typically recur 6–12 times per year. CVS is considered a functional disorder. Some investigators have suggested that it is a manifestation of migraine diathesis.

CVS was first described in the English literature in 1882 by Samuel Gee, who reported a series of nine children ranging in age from 4 to 8 years. Thereafter, CVS was considered a pediatric disorder, and the absence of characteristic physical, laboratory, or radiological markers for CVS resulted in its poor recognition by physicians who practice adult medicine. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome has been reported in adults with onset ranging from childhood to middle age. CVS in adults has been characterized as similar to CVS in children.

### The treatment of pediatric gastroenteritis: A comparative analysis of pediatric emergency physicians' practice patterns [^112udihK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is a very common emergency department (ED) diagnosis, accounting for more than 1.5 million outpatient visits and 200,000 hospitalizations annually among children in the United States. Although guidelines exist to assist clinicians, they do not clearly address topics for which evidence is new or limited, including the use of antiemetic agents, probiotics, and intravenous (IV) fluid rehydration regimens. This study sought to describe the ED treatments administered to children with acute gastroenteritis and to compare management between Canadian and U.S. physicians practicing pediatric emergency medicine (PEM).

Members of PEM research networks located in Canada and the United States were invited to participate in a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey. Participants were included if they are attending physicians and provide care to patients under 18 years of age in an ED.

A total of 235 out of 339 (73%) eligible individuals responded. In total, 103 of 136 Canadian physicians (76%) report initiating oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in children with moderate dehydration, compared with 44 of 94 (47%) of their U.S. colleagues (p < 0.001). The latter more often administer antiemetic agents to children with vomiting (67% vs. 45%; p = 0.001). American physicians administer larger IV fluid bolus volumes (p < 0.001) over shorter time periods (p = 0.001) and repeat the fluid boluses more frequently (p < 0.001). Probiotics are routinely recommended by only 35 of 230 respondents (15%).

In conclusion, the treatment of pediatric gastroenteritis varies significantly between Canadian and U.S. physicians in pediatric emergency care settings.

### Antibiotic therapy in acute gastroenteritis: A single-center retrospective cohort study [^112nJnTW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common reason for emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The role of antibiotics in AGE is unclear, as the literature shows only a minor impact on the duration of symptoms and the overall clinical course. Our goal was to assess whether antibiotic therapy in patients with AGE affects the length of hospital stay (LOS).

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study, we evaluated 479 patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of AGE. The study compared the 219 patients (46%) treated with antibiotics to the remainder who received supportive therapy. The diagnosis of AGE was made either clinically or based on imaging findings. The primary outcome of this study was to compare the LOS in days between both groups.

- **Results**: Patients treated with antibiotics had a similar LOS to those treated with supportive therapy (2.62 vs. 2.66 days, P = 0.77). Patients with presumed sepsis had a higher likelihood of receiving antibiotics compared to those without presumed sepsis (risk ratio 1.49, 62.5% vs. 41.95%; P < 0.001). In this subgroup, patients who received antibiotics had a slightly shorter LOS than those who received only supportive therapy, but the difference was not statistically significant (2.09 vs. 2.54 days, P = 0.69).

We found no difference in the LOS for hospitalized patients with AGE treated with antibiotics when compared to supportive therapy, which calls into question the role of antibiotics in the management of AGE.
