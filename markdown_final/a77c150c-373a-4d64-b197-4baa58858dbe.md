## Question

medication for bipolar II mood managment with the lowest metabolic risks

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications for bipolar II mood management have the lowest metabolic risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline cardiometabolic vulnerability in bipolar disorder and why minimizing metabolic burden matters. Then, I should identify agents with the highest metabolic liability to avoid when possible. Next, I will review lower-risk options and verify how well they fit bipolar II's depressive predominance. After that, I should weigh lithium's trade-offs, clarify monitoring strategies, and consider adjunctive prevention such as metformin. Finally, I will synthesize a bipolar II–specific hierarchy and double-check for any caveats or corrections before concluding [^117KUCLX] [^112yyi9X].

> Let me first confirm the baseline metabolic risk context so I don't understate the stakes. People with bipolar disorder have a high burden of metabolic comorbidity and premature cardiovascular mortality, and metabolic syndrome is common, which makes choosing weight-neutral or metabolically sparing regimens especially important in long-term care, particularly for bipolar II where maintenance is a marathon rather than a sprint [^117KUCLX] [^112yyi9X].

> Next, I should identify the agents with the greatest metabolic liability so we can avoid them when possible. Clozapine and olanzapine have among the highest risks for weight gain and dysglycemia, and hyperglycemic progression risk is clearly elevated with these agents, which can be pivotal in patients who already have metabolic risk factors or who are vulnerable to weight gain and diabetes [^116aQysE] [^112dL4bR].

> Now, I need to check which medications are consistently associated with lower metabolic impact. Lamotrigine and carbamazepine generally do not induce substantive weight changes, while among SGAs, ziprasidone and lurasidone sit at the lower end of weight-gain liability; aripiprazole is variably reported as lower risk, but results are mixed and longer-term weight gain can still emerge, which means I should be cautious about labeling it "weight neutral" without qualification [^112upBcZ] [^114RuC1v].

> Hold on, let me verify bipolar II–specific fit, since depressive burden dominates this phenotype. Lamotrigine has strong practical value for preventing bipolar depression recurrence and is metabolically benign, aligning well with bipolar II maintenance needs, while lurasidone shows a stabilizing effect on fasting glucose and has supportive data for preventing mood episodes in those whose index episode was depressive, which also fits the bipolar II profile where depressive polarity predominates [^115AZncF] [^114BHtbu].

> Wait, I initially considered placing aripiprazole among the "lowest risk" SGAs, but I should correct that to "moderate/acceptable risk" given heterogeneous evidence; longer-term use can be associated with weight gain in some data sets, although other analyses suggest minimal metabolic change compared with mood stabilizer monotherapy, so I will keep it as a conditional option rather than a first choice when metabolic risk is the primary concern [^114RuC1v] [^111nXwTc].

> Let me think about lithium's trade-off explicitly because it often remains in the conversation for bipolar II. Lithium carries moderate weight and metabolic risk compared with valproate and many SGAs but remains highly efficacious for relapse prevention; mechanistic and clinical data suggest potential impacts on glucose tolerance and lipids, so if lithium is chosen, weight and metabolic monitoring need to be proactive from the outset and maintained over time [^116JdF4C] [^112upBcZ].

> I should confirm which options to de-prioritize when metabolic risk is the key driver. Valproate is consistently associated with weight gain and carries additional endocrine risks in women of reproductive age, while SGAs such as quetiapine, risperidone, and paliperidone also have higher weight-gain and metabolic profiles compared with the lower-risk alternatives we're prioritizing for bipolar II [^114RuC1v] [^114HL21t].

> Next, I should review monitoring so the plan is clinically safe even with "low-risk" agents. Baseline and periodic checks of weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and a full lipid panel, along with blood pressure, are warranted; this is particularly crucial when any SGA or lithium is part of the regimen and should be integrated within a collaborative care framework to address the well-documented medical comorbidity burden in bipolar disorder [^117KUCLX] [^116UKuch].

> I need to ensure prevention strategies are embedded when an SGA is used or when baseline risk is high. Lifestyle and behavioral interventions should be first-line, and for medium- to high-risk SGAs — or for high-risk patients — co-prescribing metformin is now guideline-supported to prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain, with stronger recommendations for olanzapine and clozapine and conditional use for agents like quetiapine, paliperidone, or risperidone in at-risk populations including youth and young adults [^115WxHBc] [^115adYcW] [^112hD56s].

> I will now synthesize a bipolar II–focused hierarchy that keeps metabolic risk lowest while preserving efficacy. Lamotrigine should be the anchor for maintenance to prevent depressive episodes given its negligible metabolic impact and favorable tolerability, with lurasidone as a preferred SGA if an antipsychotic is required, particularly after a depressive index episode or for acute bipolar depression when combined with a mood stabilizer; ziprasidone can be considered when an SGA is needed and metabolic neutrality is paramount, while lithium remains a reasonable alternative when broader mood stabilization is necessary, provided enhanced metabolic monitoring is in place [^115AZncF] [^114BHtbu] [^117HSYZq].

> But wait, I should explicitly state the agents to avoid when metabolic risk drives decision-making. Avoid or minimize use of olanzapine and clozapine whenever feasible, and be cautious with quetiapine, risperidone, paliperidone, and valproate, especially in patients with existing obesity, dyslipidemia, or prediabetes, as these agents carry higher risks for weight gain and dysglycemia and can rapidly worsen cardiometabolic profiles in vulnerable patients [^116aQysE] [^114RuC1v] [^112dL4bR].

> Finally, I should double-check key safety caveats so we don't gloss over critical details. Educate patients starting lamotrigine or carbamazepine about rash and SJS/TEN warning signs and drug–drug interactions, and ensure contraception counseling where relevant; if lithium is used, monitor renal and thyroid function longitudinally; and if an SGA must be used in a high-risk patient, consider early metformin plus structured lifestyle support, adjusting choices as the individual's metabolic parameters evolve over time [^116UKuch] [^115WxHBc] [^117KUCLX].

For bipolar II mood management with the lowest metabolic risk, **lamotrigine is the preferred first-line agent** due to its minimal impact on weight, glucose, and lipids. If an antipsychotic is needed [^112yUEVY], **aripiprazole, ziprasidone, or lurasidone are the lowest-risk options** [^112upBcZ] [^116JdF4C]. Lithium is **metabolically neutral** but requires renal and thyroid monitoring. Avoid olanzapine, quetiapine, and valproate due to higher metabolic risk [^116aQysE] [^112upBcZ] [^112yUEVY] [^112FoYht]. Monitor weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and lipids [^114AixsZ] at baseline and regularly thereafter [^116UKuch] [^112yUEVY] [^117KUCLX].

## Mood stabilizers

### Lamotrigine

Lamotrigine is considered **metabolically neutral** [^114RuC1v], with minimal impact on weight, glucose, or lipids. It is effective for bipolar II depression and maintenance but not for hypomania. No specific metabolic monitoring is required beyond standard clinical practice [^116UKuch].

---

### Lithium

Lithium is generally **metabolically neutral**, though modest weight gain occurs in some patients. It is effective for maintenance and mood stabilization but less effective for acute bipolar II depression. Regular renal and thyroid function tests are required because of potential renal and thyroid adverse effects [^114RuC1v] [^114JNkDq].

---

## Antipsychotics with low metabolic risk

### Aripiprazole

Aripiprazole is associated with **minimal weight gain** [^117JRHys] and a low risk of metabolic syndrome [^111nXwTc] [^112yUEVY] [^112upBcZ]. It is effective for hypomanic symptoms and maintenance but has limited efficacy in bipolar II depression. Standard metabolic monitoring is recommended [^116UKuch].

---

### Ziprasidone

Ziprasidone has **minimal weight-gain liability** and a low risk of metabolic disturbances [^112FoYht] [^112yUEVY] [^112upBcZ]. It is effective for hypomanic symptoms and maintenance but has limited efficacy in bipolar II depression. Standard metabolic monitoring is recommended [^117EVfzB].

---

### Lurasidone

Lurasidone is associated with **minimal weight gain** and a low risk of metabolic disturbances [^114BHtbu] [^112yUEVY] [^112upBcZ]. It is effective for bipolar depression [^117HSYZq] but has limited efficacy for hypomanic symptoms. Standard metabolic monitoring is recommended [^117KUCLX].

---

## Medications to avoid due to high metabolic risk

- **Olanzapine**: Significant weight gain, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia [^116aQysE] [^112FoYht] [^112yUEVY] [^112upBcZ].
- **Quetiapine**: Moderate to significant weight gain and metabolic disturbances [^114zKf46] [^112FoYht] [^112yUEVY] [^112upBcZ].
- **Valproate**: Significant weight gain and metabolic disturbances [^114RuC1v] [^116JdF4C] [^112yUEVY] [^112upBcZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line treatment**: Lamotrigine is recommended as the first-line treatment for bipolar II disorder due to its minimal metabolic risk and efficacy in preventing depressive episodes.
- **Second-line treatment**: Lithium is recommended as a second-line treatment, particularly for maintenance therapy, with regular renal and thyroid monitoring.
- **Antipsychotics**: Aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and lurasidone are recommended for patients requiring antipsychotic treatment due to their low metabolic risk profiles.

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Regular monitoring**: Weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and lipid profiles [^112yUEVY] should be monitored regularly in patients receiving pharmacological treatment for bipolar II disorder [^116UKuch] [^114AixsZ] [^117KUCLX].
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Dietary modifications, regular physical activity, and behavioral interventions are recommended to minimize metabolic risks [^114PHL3e] [^112yUEVY] [^114AixsZ].
- **Medication adjustments**: If significant metabolic side effects occur, consider switching to medications with lower metabolic risk profiles or adding adjunctive treatments such as metformin [^115WxHBc] [^112hD56s] [^112yUEVY] [^114AixsZ].

### Safety and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder: Prevalence, monitoring and management [^112yUEVY]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are associated with fewer movement disorders and a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia than conventional antipsychotics but are not without side effects. Metabolic side effects associated with some of the atypical antipsychotics are a concern for both clinicians and patients. Adverse events related to central nervous system effects, weight gain, and alterations in glucose, lipid, and prolactin levels in patients with depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorders have been reported. Balancing the significant benefits of treatment with these agents against the potential risks of metabolic disturbances and other adverse effects is crucial.

Emerging data are making it possible to determine the risk-benefit analysis for specific atypical antipsychotics in individual patients, allowing for targeted selection of treatment. A new concept of effectiveness is emerging that attempts to balance adverse effects of treatment with patient quality of life. Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should have their weight, waist circumference, glucose, and lipids monitored on a regular basis.

Monitoring of prolactin levels is not suggested; however, a baseline measurement before initiating treatment can be useful, with subsequent assessment only if a patient demonstrates symptoms. Prevention of weight gain is important. Diet and exercise should be considered for prevention and management, with the use of pharmacologic strategies approached with caution in patients with mood disorders. If a patient is at high risk of developing diabetes, certain pharmacologic agents should be approached with caution.

### Call to action regarding the vascular-bipolar link: A report from the Vascular Task Force of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders [^112upBcZ]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

- **Medications and the vascular-bipolar link**:

	- The medications commonly used to treat bipolar disorder adversely affect cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), with the potential for substantial changes in weight or other risk factors. While various psychotropic medications have cardiovascular side effects and risks — such as arrhythmia, hypertensive crisis, and orthostatic hypotension — the focus of the report is on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lithium, widely considered the first-line mood stabilizer, has been associated with weight gain, likely less than that associated with valproate or antipsychotics. Lamotrigine or carbamazepine do not commonly induce substantive changes in weight. Antipsychotics, particularly second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), are known to promote weight gain.

	- Clozapine, olanzapine, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, sertindole, quetiapine, risperidone, and paliperidone appear to confer the greatest risk for weight gain. The lowest potential for weight gain is seen with ziprasidone, lurasidone, and cariprazine. Aripiprazole is sometimes also listed as lower in risk, although study results have varied. It is associated with at least double the weight gain observed for adult patients taking mood stabilizers and shows greater weight gain compared to placebo in short-term studies of youth with bipolar disorder.

### Identifying metabolic risks with antipsychotics and monitoring and management strategies [^114AixsZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Mental health providers have an especially important responsibility to monitor the physical changes that patients experience in response to medication. The public health focus is on adiposity as a major risk factor for diabetes, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome, and other diseases. Adiposity adversely affects insulin action, leading to a cycle in which insulin loses its ability to stop the breakdown of fat. Since type 2 diabetes can take approximately two decades to develop, patients with increased BMI can be at risk for adverse physical health effects for many years. Due to the possibility that some antipsychotic treatments can lead to weight gain and metabolic changes, potentially resulting in severe physical illness, regular physical checks should be conducted.

Safety and tolerability of pharmacotherapy: Safety and tolerability issues, in addition to efficacy data, have been considered when determining recommendations for each phase of illness. The most notable concerns are described below, and a summary of their potential impact on treatment selection is included in Table 24, as well as in treatment hierarchy tables in Sections 2‐4. As medication side effects are an important contributor to medication non‐adherence, these potential concerns should be discussed with patients receiving or considering treatment with various agents to help inform decision making.

- **Weight gain**: As described in Section 6, despite normal weight at illness onset, it is common for patients with bipolar disorder (BD) to become overweight or obese, and several medications used to treat the illness may also exacerbate this effect. The likelihood of medications to cause weight gain should be carefully considered, as this is one of the most frequent treatment‐related factors of non‐adherence, contributing to upwards of 60% of cases. The medications most commonly associated with weight gain are olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, gabapentin, divalproex, and lithium; with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and ziprasidone being the safer options associated with less weight gain. Recent reviews further suggest that asenapine and aripiprazole (longer-term use) also may lead to weight gain.

### Metabolic effects of atypical antipsychotics: Molecular targets [^112dL4bR]. Journal of neuroendocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are commonly prescribed drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental diseases with psychotic traits. Although the use of AAPs is associated with beneficial effects in these patients, they are also associated with undesired metabolic side effects, including metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is defined by the presence of metabolic abnormalities such as large waist circumference, dyslipidemia, fasting hyperglycemia, and elevated blood pressure, which predispose to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease.

In this review, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in these undesired metabolic abnormalities induced by AAPs are described. These mechanisms are complex as AAPs have multiple cellular targets which significantly affect the activities of several hormones and neuromodulators. Additionally, AAPs affect all the relevant metabolic organs, namely the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, intestine, and the central and peripheral nervous systems as well. A better understanding of the molecular targets linking AAPs with MetS and of the mechanisms responsible for clinically different side effects of distinct AAPs is needed. This knowledge will help in the development of novel AAPs with fewer adverse effects as well as adjuvant therapies for patients receiving AAPs.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, specifically concerning maintenance therapy, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of other first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, or anticonvulsants (including valproate) as monotherapy or in combination with a mood stabilizer for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115AZncF]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

- **Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)**: Although olanzapine (level 1) is effective in preventing any mood, manic, or depressive episode, it is considered a second-line treatment due to safety issues such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long-acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) or adjunctive therapy (level 2) has demonstrated efficacy in preventing any mood or manic episode, but showed no clear efficacy in depressive episode prevention in these trials. Furthermore, there was a trend for the superiority of oral risperidone adjunctive therapy at 6 months in preventing any mood episode and in preventing mania, but not depression.

Carbamazepine (level 2) has not been assessed in any large placebo-controlled trials, but active comparator trials support its efficacy. Paliperidone (level 2) was more effective than placebo in preventing any mood or manic episode, but less effective than olanzapine.

Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) has shown to be effective in preventing any mood or manic episode, although there are conflicting (positive and negative) data for acute treatment (see Sections 3 and 4). There was a trend for superiority of lurasidone adjunctive therapy in preventing any mood episode (though not manic or depressive episodes individually) in a controlled trial, with significant separation from placebo in preventing mood episodes in those with an index depressive episode. Thus, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be appropriate for those who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

### Metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotics in bipolar youth: Comparison with other psychotic and nonpsychotic diagnoses [^114vdgTw]. Bipolar Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the known metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) on children and adolescents, comparative effects in youth with different diagnoses remain underreported. We compared differences in metabolic changes three months after starting treatment with SGAs in youth with bipolar disorder and with other psychotic and nonpsychotic disorders.

Weight and metabolic differences among diagnostic groups before and three months after starting treatment with SGAs were compared in a naturalistic cohort of children and adolescents (14.9 ± 3.0 years) diagnosed with bipolar disorder (n = 31), other psychotic disorders (n = 29), and other nonpsychotic disorders (n = 30), with no (35.6%) or very little (6.6 ± 9.0 days) previous exposure to antipsychotics. Composite measurements of significant weight gain (weight increase ≥ 5% at three months or increase ≥ 0.5 in body mass index (BMI) z-score) and 'risk for adverse health outcome' (≥ 95th BMI percentile, or ≥ 85th BMI percentile plus the presence of one other obesity-related complication) were included. SGAs (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) were prescribed in comparable proportions among groups.

Baseline weight and metabolic indices were not significantly different among diagnoses. Three months after starting treatment with SGAs, more than 70% of patients had significant weight gain. The BMI z-score increased in all diagnostic groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Total cholesterol increased in the bipolar (p = 0.02) and psychotic (p = 0.01) disorder groups.

### Risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism during antipsychotic treatment: A prospective cohort study [^116aQysE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). High credibility.

Antipsychotic medications increase the risk of abnormal glucose metabolism. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to predict this risk because it is affected by medication-related and background factors. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism during antipsychotic treatment. We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. Patients with prediabetes or possible diabetes were excluded, resulting in a final analysis group of 706 patients.

The hazard ratio (HR) for each factor was calculated for events of progression to hyperglycemia using time-dependent Cox regression analysis stratified according to facility type and adjusted for available background and drug-related factors. Treatments with olanzapine (HR = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–4.05), clozapine (HR = 4.25, 95% CI = 1.56–11.60), and chlorpromazine (HR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.21–16.57), overweight and obesity (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.02–2.41), and hypertriglyceridemia (HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.02–2.88) were associated with a significantly higher occurrence of hyperglycemic progression.

The number and daily dose of antipsychotics were not associated with their occurrence. Our study demonstrated that more careful monitoring is necessary during olanzapine, clozapine, and chlorpromazine treatment because of the higher occurrence of abnormalities in glucose metabolism. Furthermore, patients with obesity or hypertriglyceridemia warrant monitoring for the occurrence of abnormal glucose metabolism.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^117KUCLX]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

The principles of management outlined in these guidelines emphasize the prevalence of medical comorbidities in older adults with bipolar disorder, leading to a 10–15 year lower life expectancy compared to non-psychiatric populations. The most common medical comorbidities include metabolic syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and endocrine disorders. This highlights the necessity for vigilance when treating all patients with bipolar disorder (BD), including regular assessments of their metabolic parameters.

Working collaboratively with other members of a patient's healthcare team is an essential aspect of good clinical care. Comprehensive management of comorbid medical conditions should adopt a multidisciplinary team-based approach. This includes primary care physicians, medical specialists, nurses, psychologists, and social workers as appropriate, with patients actively participating in their care. Treatment strategies should focus on both the psychiatric symptoms and medical issues along with their risk factors.

A promising strategy for improving the medical care of people with BD is through the use of "primary care-based medical homes", where those with a serious mental illness and at least one other chronic condition receive integrated care. While most studies do not separate BD from other major mental illnesses in analyses, matched samples in the North Carolina Medical Homes program indicate that patients with BD (n = 13,406) in primary care medical homes had greater use of primary care and specialty mental health care compared with propensity-matched controls, and marginally lower use.

### Medical risk in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [^112mAueL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are vulnerable to developing key modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotic medications, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, have been linked to the risk of adverse metabolic changes in patients. This article reviews the literature on the prevalence of medical risk factors in the general population as well as in those patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and discusses treatment strategies and lifestyle changes that patients can make in order to reduce their risks for certain diseases.

To perform a detailed, qualitative review of existing literature on the co-occurrence of bipolar disorder and metabolic syndrome, and the impact of metabolic dysregulation on patients with bipolar disorder. Treatment considerations are particularly focused on bipolar depression.

- **Data sources**: Searches of the PubMed database (October 23, 2012) and Cochrane Library (September 20, 2013) were conducted for English-language articles published from January 1980 onward. These articles contained the keywords bipolar AND metabolic, weight, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, OR hypertension in the title or abstract. The searches yielded 1,817 citations, from which case reports, conference abstracts, and pediatric studies were excluded.

- **Study selection**: Abstracts and titles were evaluated for relevance to the stated objectives. The full texts of 176 articles were obtained for further evaluation; additional articles were identified from reference lists.

- **Results**: Metabolic risk factors are highly prevalent yet undertreated in patients with bipolar disorder. Putative factors accounting for the link between bipolar disorder and metabolic syndrome include behavioral/phenomenological features, shared neurobiologic abnormalities, and adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A comprehensive assessment of metabolic risk and regular monitoring of body mass index, waist circumference, lipid profile, and plasma glucose are important for patients with bipolar disorder. Management strategies for the bipolar patient with metabolic risk factors include the use of bipolar disorder medications with better metabolic profile.

### Medical monitoring in patients with bipolar disorder: A review of data [^116q2JPm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder have been found to have high rates of endocrine and cardiovascular disorders, as well as obesity. Some health problems may be influenced by the psychiatric disorder itself, and conversely, health problems may influence the course of bipolar disorder. Additionally, some pharmacologic treatments used for bipolar disorder have been associated with obesity, diabetes, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, prolonged QTc, and thyroid dysfunction. To optimize care and achieve the best possible treatment outcomes, integrated psychiatric and medical care is needed.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: A network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^112FoYht]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

For rate analyses, heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using the I² index. An I² of 25%, 50%, and 75% indicates mild, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively, as shown in the forest plots. An I² > 50% was considered high heterogeneity. In the network analysis, heterogeneity was assumed to be the same for all intervention comparisons. The range of 95% CI in the league tables visually reflects the heterogeneity of the network comparisons.

According to the PRISMA manual of NMA, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation chains in the Bayesian-based framework were used to perform the meta-aggregation. STATA (SE) version 15.1 was applied for data analysis and figure formation. In the network map, each node represents a pharmacological intervention, and their connections refer to the head-to-head comparisons. The area of the nodes corresponds with the number of participants, and the width of their connections corresponds with the number of direct comparisons. Data analyses were based on the last observation carried forward (LOCF), an acknowledged method for endpoint analysis. This method is defined as the participants who drop out of the study halfway, having their last valid scores carried forward until the end of the study.

The hierarchy of the pharmacological interventions was presented as the P score. The P score refers to SUCRA, which is given in percentage and represents the superiority of the corresponding intervention. The interventions were ranked by their ability to evaluate the serum levels of each metabolic indicator. The P score ranges from 0 to…

### Safety of available agents used to treat bipolar disorder: Focus on weight gain [^113yR2v7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapeutic management of bipolar disorder has advanced considerably since the introduction of lithium therapy nearly 50 years ago. The sizable percentage of patients who do not respond adequately to lithium and/or are intolerant to its side effects has served as an impetus for identifying alternative pharmacotherapeutic agents. Recent advances in the understanding of the neurotransmitter systems and their receptors, as it applies to the treatment of bipolar disorder, have in part led to progress in delineating applications of anticonvulsant/antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in this area. Although the efficacy of many drugs has been evaluated in patients with this disorder, issues of medication tolerability and adherence, related to unfavorable side effect profiles, are substantial impediments to the development of novel pharmacotherapies. The potential for excessive weight gain as a side effect of certain psychopharmacologic agents remains a concern for both clinicians and patients.

- **Method**: English-language literature from 1985–2001 in MEDLINE was searched for the terms bipolar disorder, anticonvulsant, antiepileptic, lithium, antipsychotic, weight, and compliance. This article reviewed therapeutic options for bipolar disorder, including newer AEDs and atypical antipsychotic drugs, with an emphasis on the issue of weight gain and possible approaches to minimizing this risk.

- **Results**: Certain newer AEDs are characterized by more favorable safety and tolerability profiles that include weight loss as a desirable side effect. Because bipolar disorder is associated with

### Normalizing the abnormal: Do antipsychotic drugs push the cortex into an unsustainable metabolic envelope [^113i33WF]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Low credibility.

Use of antipsychotic medication to manage psychosis, principally in those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, is well established. Antipsychotics are effective in normalizing positive symptoms of psychosis in the short term, such as delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thought. Their long-term use is, however, associated with side effects, including several types of movement disorders (extrapyramidal syndrome, dyskinesia, akathisia), as well as metabolic and cardiac disorders. Furthermore, higher lifetime antipsychotic dose-years may be associated with poorer cognitive performance and blunted affect, although the mechanisms driving these associations are not well understood.

In this article, we propose a novel model of the long-term effects of antipsychotic administration, focusing on the changes in brain metabolic homeostasis induced by the medication. We suggest that the brain metabolic normalization, which occurs in parallel with the normalization of psychotic symptoms following antipsychotic treatment, may not ultimately be sustainable by the cerebral tissue of some patients. These patients may be characterized by an already reduced oxidative metabolic capacity, potentially pushing the brain into an unsustainable metabolic envelope that results in tissue remodeling.

To support this perspective, we will review existing data on the brain metabolic trajectories of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as indexed using available neuroimaging tools before and after the use of medication. We will also consider data from preclinical studies to provide mechanistic insights.

### Metabolic syndrome and metabolic abnormalities in bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis of prevalence rates and moderators [^112yyi9X]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder have high levels of cardiovascular disease risk factors. The presence of metabolic syndrome significantly influences future cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The authors sought to clarify the prevalence and moderators of metabolic syndrome in bipolar patients, accounting for subgroup differences.

The authors searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL through April 2012 for research reporting metabolic syndrome prevalence rates in bipolar patients. Medical subject headings "metabolic syndrome" and "bipolar" were used in the title, abstract, or index term fields. Manual searches were conducted using the reference lists from identified articles.

The search yielded 81 articles in 37 publications (N = 6,983). The overall metabolic syndrome rate was 37.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 36.1–39.0) using any standardized metabolic syndrome criteria. Compared with general population groups, bipolar patients had higher metabolic syndrome rates (odds ratio = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.74–2.25). In bipolar patients, older age had a modest effect on the metabolic syndrome rate. The strongest moderator was the region in which the study took place, with the highest rates observed in New Zealand and Australia (64.2% [95% CI = 38.3–83.9]) and North America (49.3% [95% CI = 29.7–69.3]). Metabolic syndrome was significantly more prevalent in patients currently treated with antipsychotics (45.3% [95% CI = 39.6–50.9]) than in patients who were antipsychotic free (32.4% [95% CI = 27.5–37.4]; odds ratio = 1.72 [95% CI = 1.24–2.38]).

### Managing weight gain in patients with severe mental illness [^116yAacg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with severe mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, have significantly increased rates of early mortality compared to the general population. This increased mortality is often due to medical comorbidities associated with overweight or obesity. Weight gain can result from the mental disorder itself or from the pharmacotherapy used to treat the disorder. Effective weight-neutral and weight-reducing medical agents are available. Utilizing an appropriate pharmacotherapy regimen, along with behavior modification and patient education, may help manage body weight in patients with serious mental illnesses.

### Metabolic syndrome in patients enrolled in a clinical trial of aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder: a post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111nXwTc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

To compare the effects of maintenance treatment with aripiprazole or placebo on the incidence of metabolic syndrome in bipolar disorder, patients with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder were stabilized on aripiprazole therapy for 6–18 weeks prior to double-blind random assignment to aripiprazole or placebo for 26 weeks. The rate of metabolic syndrome in each group was calculated at maintenance phase baseline (randomization) and endpoint for evaluable patients using a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. The study was conducted from March 2000 to June 2003 at 76 centers in Argentina, Mexico, and the United States.

At entry into the maintenance phase, 45 out of 125 patients (36.0%) overall met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. Mean changes in the five components of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, triglyceride levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, blood pressure, and glucose level) from baseline to week 26 were small, except for a meaningful reduction in triglycerides (placebo: -18.9 mg/dL; aripiprazole: -11.5 mg/dL). By the end of the maintenance phase (endpoint, LOCF), 5 out of 18 placebo-treated patients (27.8%) and 4 out of 14 aripiprazole-treated patients (28.6%) no longer met metabolic syndrome criteria. The proportion of patients with metabolic syndrome was similar in the placebo and aripiprazole groups at both baseline and week 26. There were no significant changes in any of the individual components of metabolic syndrome.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: A network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^117Kgx3n]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

The main outcomes examined were changes in indicators of glucose and lipid metabolism, including fasting serum glucose, serum insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). The pharmacological interventions were ranked based on their ability to increase the levels of these indicators, except for HDL, where interventions were ranked by their ability to reduce serum HDL levels, since lower levels of HDL are associated with health risk.

Additional outcomes included anthropometric measurements (body weight, BMI, and waist circumference), total serum bilirubin, and serum prolactin, all regarded as metabolism-related indicators. To provide comprehensive ranking results, the mean surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and mean ranking of fasting serum glucose, TC, TG, LDL, and body weight were further analyzed after eliminating sensitive comparisons. Only interventions with applicable data for all these indicators were ranked and presented.

Efficacy estimation involved determining the rate of response, shown as the reduction of scale scores to a specific percentage, and full remission, demonstrated by scale scores reaching a particular number. Tolerability was defined as the proportion of participants who dropped out due to any cause during the trial. Head-to-head studies were excluded from rate analyses due to the absence of a controlled (placebo) group. Results of rate analyses were provided in supplementary results.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^115WxHBc]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

People with severe mental illnesses (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, have higher rates of premature mortality than the rest of the population. Much of this increased risk is attributed to cardiometabolic risk factors. Overweight and obesity contribute significantly to cardiometabolic risk, with obesity doubling the risk of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). An estimated three-quarters of people with psychosis have co-morbid overweight or obesity. The trajectory of weight gain in people with SMI is rapid and nonlinear. For example, within a year of treatment, up to 80% of people with first episode psychosis will experience clinically significant weight gain, defined as a ≥ 7% increase in baseline body weight. Furthermore, a UK longitudinal study of changes in weight in the 5 years after the first prescription for an antipsychotic found that over 50% of individuals in the healthy weight category at baseline progress to overweight/obesity. Despite greater awareness and recommendations for the monitoring and management of modifiable risk factors, this health inequality continues to widen, and premature mortality rates have risen consistently in recent years in people with SMI. Nonpharmacological factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and reduced access to and/or utilization of healthcare services contribute to this health inequality. The net positive effect of antipsychotic treatment is demonstrated by the fact that people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who do not take medication have a shorter life expectancy.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^115adYcW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, specifically in the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, the AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with high-risk antipsychotics, such as olanzapine or clozapine, to mitigate this risk.

### Co-prescription of medication for bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus: a nationwide population-based study with focus on gender differences [^114JCe86]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

- **Conflicting results**: Kessing et al. investigated whether some of the co-morbidity between diabetes and bipolar disorder could be the result of conditional probability or Berkson's bias. Patients with osteoarthritis were compared to patients with bipolar disorder. They found a slightly increased rate of diabetes among people with bipolar disorder compared to those with osteoarthritis, aged between 45 and 80 years. However, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus may have been underestimated, and the osteoarthritis control group is not ideal, due to a not yet understood association between osteoarthritis and insulin. For example, osteoarthritis and diabetes share an etiological role of inflammatory pathways, as do mood disorders.

- **Possible mechanisms**: Three of the four mood stabilizers analyzed in this study — carbamazepine, valproate, and lithium — all have the potential to increase weight and, therefore, may increase the risk of type II diabetes. Mood stabilizers may also increase the risk of diabetes mellitus in other ways besides weight gain. Insulin tends to be used more for type I diabetes, and oral hypoglycemic agents more for type II diabetes, with the linkage between diabetes and bipolar disorder being stronger for type II than for type I diabetes. Valproate and lithium both inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3b, as does insulin.

The finding of the high diabetes prevalence in patients with bipolar disorder could indicate that those with this disorder are at higher risk for diabetes by virtue of a shared pathophysiology common to both disorders, such as inflammation.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1141Ycch]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

The DoD/VA 2023 guidelines address medical management for bipolar disorder, focusing on maintenance therapy.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of non-refractory patients with bipolar disorder. Most treatment recommendations and guidelines for managing bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities heavily rely on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little guidance for clinicians on optimizing next steps for non- or partial-responders and for those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given this limitation and the paucity of RCTs at later treatment junctures, we consider it appropriate to begin discussing the quality of data that some field experts might use in choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations.

While acknowledging that many other clinical investigators may prefer different sequences, we propose suggestions that might be useful to some clinicians, stimulate discussions of other options in the literature, and provide a preliminary outline for new clinical trials to better inform practice. Due to the wide range of data quality and clinical principles on which the suggestions are based, only minimal references are included. A comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Call to action regarding the vascular-bipolar link: A report from the Vascular Task Force of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders [^1152wsP5]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder begin to have an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidities in midlife and may die mainly from cardiovascular disease (CVD) before reaching geriatric age, with the average cardiovascular mortality occurring 10 years earlier than the general population. In light of this premature mortality, patients with early-onset bipolar disorder who survive into old age probably represent a healthy survivor bipolar disorder subpopulation with favorable outcomes. Therefore, studies that focus only on individuals in their 60s and beyond may not be truly representative of the larger bipolar disorder population.

A limited number of studies have focused specifically on bipolar disorder in late life. The prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity, including hypertension in older-age (> 60 years) bipolar disorder (OABD), in existing reports appears to be similar to that in community-based geriatric samples or patients with depressive disorder. Furthermore, comparable percentages (about 25%) of older patients with bipolar disorder have coronary heart diseases in both Asian and Western reports. However, OABD patients had significantly higher BMI and a greater burden of endocrine/metabolic diseases. Consequently, approximately two-thirds of OABD patients are reported to have a previous stroke or silent cerebral infarction (SCI). In particular, SCIs are detected in 59.5% of OABD patients, which is dramatically higher than the 20% detected in healthy elderly people.

### Mania and mortality: Why the excess cardiovascular risk in bipolar disorder [^111gqiD8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Individuals with bipolar disorder experience twice the cardiovascular mortality expected from general population estimates. The metabolic syndrome is more common in those with bipolar disorder, with a prevalence ratio of 1.6, and includes many traditional cardiovascular risk factors, which may explain much of the elevated risk. Manic symptom burden also predicts cardiovascular mortality, begging questions regarding other explanations for elevated cardiovascular risk. Ultimately, the mechanisms that lead to elevated cardiovascular risk in bipolar disorder are complex and potentially involve behavior, treatment, access to quality health care, and underlying pathophysiology. Much remains unknown about the etiology of any mechanisms inherent to illness or, for that matter, treatment effects. Addressing access and health behaviors can mitigate risk for individuals with bipolar disorder. Recent evidence indicates that psychiatrists are becoming aware of the vascular risk associated with bipolar disorder, although further education will improve monitoring and subsequent outcomes.

### Valproate, bipolar disorder and polycystic ovarian syndrome [^114HL21t]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Persons with bipolar disorder are often overweight and have clustered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Some anti-bipolar agents adversely impact weight and the lipid milieu. Recent data suggest that valproic acid, a commonly prescribed mood stabilizer, may be associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This adverse event has not been systematically studied in bipolar disorder.

- **Method**: Thirty-eight female subjects, aged 18–50 years, meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or II disorder, in any phase of illness were evaluated. Eighteen females received valproate (sodium valproate and valproic acid), and 20 females received lithium. Patients completed questions regarding their menstrual, reproductive, and medical histories. During the follicular phase, they were assessed for weight, body mass index (BMI kg/m²), and changes in the reproductive endocrine milieu that included morning estradiol, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, free testosterone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The blood was also analyzed for fasting metabolic parameters which included total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding-protein 1 (IGFBP-1), fasting blood glucose, and morning leptin.

- **Results**: Nine (50%) of the valproate-treated females had menstrual abnormalities.

### Metabolomic biomarker signatures for bipolar and unipolar depression [^115RrWf2]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) affects approximately 1% of the population, yet it is frequently misdiagnosed, with nearly 40% of patients with BD initially receiving an incorrect diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). This can be attributed to overlapping symptoms, patients' tendency to seek medical help during depressive rather than manic episodes, and the subjective nature of psychiatric evaluations of patient self-reported symptoms. Biomarker profiling offers a promising approach to overcoming these challenges and enabling earlier and more objective differential diagnosis of mood disorders. However, studies at the time of writing have faced several limitations, such as identifying disease biomarkers in patients with established BD, which can be confounded by the effect of mood-stabilizing medication, using samples from patients with varying symptom polarities and other uncontrolled factors, and lacking independent validation cohorts. We aimed to address these limitations by identifying and validating a dried blood spot (DBS) metabolomic signature distinguishing BD from MDD in the clinically relevant context of misdiagnosed BD in patients presenting with depressive symptoms.

### Cardiometabolic risks and omega-3 index in recent-onset bipolar I disorder [^113Jakd4]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The aims of the present study were to characterize cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of bipolar disorder patients with limited exposure to psychotropic medications, and to evaluate their associations with mood symptoms and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) blood levels.

Cardiometabolic risk assessments were compared in individuals with bipolar I disorder experiencing a first manic or mixed episode or an early depressive episode (n = 117) and healthy subjects (n = 56). Patients were medication-free at assessment and had no or limited exposure to mood-stabilizer or antipsychotic medications prior to the admission. Associations among cardiometabolic parameters and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S), manic (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS]), and depressive (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS]) symptom ratings were evaluated within the bipolar group.

Following adjustment for demographic variables (i.e. age, gender, and parental education), significantly higher fasting triglyceride levels were observed in the bipolar group compared to the healthy group (121.7 mg/dL vs. 87.0 mg/dL; p < 0.01). There were no clear trends for other metabolic indicators, including blood pressure, body mass index, and fasting glucose. Nineteen percent of the bipolar group and 6% of the healthy group met the criteria for metabolic syndrome (P = 0.23). The omega-3 index was lower in the bipolar group (3.4% vs. 3.9%; p < 0.01). Within the bipolar group, no associations were found between the cardiometabolic parameters and CGI-S, YMRS, and HDRS symptom ratings.

### Therapeutic drug and cardiovascular disease risk monitoring in patients with bipolar disorder [^1114hsZc]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The study assessed whether patients with bipolar disorder received serum drug level and toxicity monitoring for mood stabilizers, as well as an assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related risk factors attributed to atypical antipsychotic medications.

- **Methods**: A population-based study was conducted on individuals with bipolar disorder from July 2004 to July 2006. Based on guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and the American Diabetes Association, the study evaluated whether patients received recommended drug level and toxicity monitoring tests within six months for mood stabilizers, and lipid and glucose tests for atypical antipsychotics. Multivariable regression was employed to determine patient factors associated with the receipt of lab tests.

- **Results**: Of the 435 patients (mean age = 49 years, 14.3% female, 22.8% nonwhite), 60.3% were currently prescribed mood stabilizers and 65.5% were prescribed atypical antipsychotics. Overall, 39.7% received serum drug level monitoring for mood stabilizers, 38.8% underwent thyroid function tests for lithium, and the majority (71.4%-75.9%) received complete blood counts and hepatic function tests for valproate or carbamazepine. Among patients prescribed atypical antipsychotics, about half received cholesterol counts (49.6%), and 68.7% received serum glucose levels. After adjusting for patient factors, it was found that women prescribed atypical antipsychotics were less likely than men to receive cholesterol counts (OR = 0.43; p < 0.05).

- **Limitations**: This was a single-site retrospective study with a relatively short observation period.

In conclusion, about half of the patients received the recommended monitoring.

### Association of obesity and treated hypertension and diabetes with cognitive ability in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [^111HTrEX]. Bipolar Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

People with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia are at greater risk for obesity and other cardio-metabolic risk factors, and several prior studies have linked these risk factors to poorer cognitive ability. In a large ethnically homogeneous outpatient sample, we examined associations among variables related to obesity, treated hypertension and/or diabetes, and cognitive abilities in these two patient populations.

In a study cohort of outpatients with either bipolar disorder (n = 341) or schizophrenia (n = 417), we investigated the association of self-reported body mass index and the use of medications for hypertension or diabetes with performance on a comprehensive neurocognitive battery. We examined sociodemographic and clinical factors as potential covariates.

Patients with bipolar disorder were less likely to be overweight or obese than patients with schizophrenia and also less likely to be prescribed medication for hypertension or diabetes. However, obesity and treated hypertension were associated with worse global cognitive ability in bipolar disorder, as well as with poorer performance on individual tests of processing speed, reasoning/problem-solving, and sustained attention, with no such relationships observed in schizophrenia. Obesity was not associated with symptom severity in either group.

Although less prevalent in bipolar disorder compared to schizophrenia, obesity was associated with substantially worse cognitive performance in bipolar disorder. This association was independent of symptom severity and not present.

### Clinical response and metabolic effects of lithium in 323 mood disorder patients [^111DqPnY]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Lithium is the mainstay for the maintenance treatment of mood disorders (MD), but its efficacy needs to be weighed against its side effect profile. Here, we assessed retrospectively the clinical response to long-term lithium treatment, as well as the rate of associated metabolic side effects.

- **Methods**: Clinical data were collected from patients treated with lithium for at least 12 months at the Lucio Bini Center for Mood Disorders in Cagliari, Italy. Clinical response was determined as the difference in the number of mood episodes and the percent of illness time before and during lithium treatment. Symptomatic values of metabolic parameters (plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol, urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, TSH, white blood cells [WBC]), and Body Mass Index (BMI) were determined.

- **Results**: We studied 323 MD patients (60.2% women). The percent of illness time was significantly reduced for both depressive (F = 4.94, p < 0.0001) and manic (F = 3.95, p < 0.0001) episodes, whereas the rates of episodes per year were significantly reduced for mania (F = 2.01, p = 0.02), but not for depression (F = 1.54, p = 0.06). Rates of MD patients with symptomatic values of metabolic parameters were 14.3% for WBC ≥ 10,000/µl, 26.9% for glucose levels ≥ 100 mg/dl, 54.2% for cholesterol levels ≥ 200 mg/dl, 7.5% for BUN ≥ 50 mg/dl, 21.9% for creatinine levels ≥ 1.2 mg/dl, and 20.9% for TSH levels ≥ 3.50 mU/l.

- **Conclusions**: Long-term lithium treatment was clinically effective, but the rates of metabolic effects were substantial, although some of them were also associated with older age.

### Metabolism, lifestyle and bipolar affective disorder [^113KQRp5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Lifestyle, illness, and treatment factors in people with bipolar disorder (BD) may confer additional risk of morbidity and mortality to the increasing rates of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular mortality in the general population. The aim of this review is to examine whether the risk of obesity and related morbidity and mortality are raised in BD, and the possible contributory effects of lifestyle, illness, and treatment factors to this risk. A systematic search of Medline and Cochrane Collaboration for relevant studies followed by a critical review of literature was carried out.

Mortality from cardiovascular causes and pulmonary embolism (standardized mortality ratio approximately 2.0), as well as morbidity from obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, may be increased in BD compared to the general population. Reduced exercise and poor diet, frequent depressive episodes, comorbidity with substance misuse, and poor-quality general medical care contribute to the additional risk of these medical problems in people with BD. There is no evidence that patients with BD are more sensitive than other patients to weight gain and medical problems associated with long-term use of psychotropic medication; in fact, long-term treatment with lithium, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants may reduce overall mortality.

- **Recommendation**: Psychiatrists, general practitioners, and other health professionals should work together to systematically assess and manage weight gain and related medical problems to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity in BD.

There is insufficient evidence to conclude on certain aspects.

### Metabolic risks and effects of atypical antipsychotic treatment [^111Dktvy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Weight gain and the associated increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease may be problems for individuals who receive long-term treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics differ in their propensity to cause obesity and other metabolic disturbances. If a patient gains substantial weight while taking atypical antipsychotics, the physician should consider switching them to a drug with a lower risk of weight gain. The physician should also address patient lifestyle issues such as a poor diet and lack of exercise.

### Impaired glucose metabolism in bipolar patients and response to mood stabilizer treatments [^111iuNxX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Metabolic dysfunctions in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are critical factors that interfere with outcomes; however, only one study evaluated the influence of glucose dysmetabolism on the response to treatment with lithium. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of glucose metabolic status on the clinical characteristics of BD patients and their response to treatment with different mood stabilizers, whether in monotherapy or in combination.

- **Methods**: Forty-five BD patients with insulin resistance (IR) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and forty-six patients with normal glucose metabolism, treated with mood stabilizers for at least one year, were assessed by diagnostic and rating instruments. Their clinical characteristics were compared, and an ordinal logistic regression model was adopted to identify possible predictors of response to mood stabilizer treatments.

- **Results**: Compared to patients with normal glucose metabolism, BD patients with impaired glucose metabolism exhibited a worse clinical presentation of their psychiatric illness and a diminished response to mood stabilizers. Ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that impaired glucose metabolism was the only predictor of poor response to mood stabilizers (OR 4.3; 95% CI: 1.7–11.1; p < 0.002).

- **Limitations**: The cross-sectional design and the relatively small sample size are the main limitations of our study.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings expand on existing literature data, suggesting that BD patients with impaired glucose metabolism are at a greater risk of not responding to lithium and to other mood stabilizer treatments.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^112hD56s]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, more specifically with respect to the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, the AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with medium-risk antipsychotics (such as quetiapine, paliperidone, or risperidone) to prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain in patients with cardiometabolic risk factors or aged 10–25 years.

### Prevalence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome in a sample of patients with bipolar disorder [^116Jjfd8]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The presence of metabolic abnormalities is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There are limited data on the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities in disorders other than schizophrenia, in which antipsychotic medication is part of routine treatment.

Sixty consecutive patients with bipolar disorder (BD) at our university psychiatric hospital and affiliate services were entered in an extensive prospective metabolic study, including an oral glucose tolerance test. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was assessed based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Protocol (ATP-III) criteria, the adapted ATP-III criteria using a fasting glucose threshold of 100 mg/dL, and the recently proposed criteria from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

The analysis of 60 patients showed a prevalence of the metabolic syndrome of 16.7% (ATP-III), 18.3% (adapted ATP-III), and 30.0% (IDF), respectively. A total of 6.7% of the patients met the criteria for diabetes and 23.3% for pre-diabetic abnormalities.

The metabolic syndrome and glucose abnormalities are highly prevalent among patients with BD. They represent an important risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Assessment and monitoring of metabolic abnormalities and their associated risks should be part of the clinical management of patients with BD.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116UKuch]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Medical evaluation and laboratory investigations**: A complete medical history, including assessment of BMI and baseline laboratory investigations, should be performed prior to initiating pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder (BD) or, in the case of an acute clinical situation, as soon as the patient is cooperative. For more detail, readers are referred to comprehensive guidelines for safety monitoring in BD. In women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be ruled out, and they should be counselled about the possibility of lamotrigine and carbamazepine affecting the efficacy of oral contraceptives before initiating pharmacotherapy.

- **Baseline laboratory investigations in patients with bipolar disorder**: For those on maintenance therapy with lithium, thyroid and renal function as well as plasma calcium should be assessed at 6 months and at least annually thereafter or as clinically indicated. Menstrual history (to assess for polycystic ovary syndrome), haematology profile, and liver function tests should be obtained at 3‐ to 6‐month intervals during the first year and yearly thereafter or as clinically indicated, in patients on maintenance treatment with divalproex. Patients initiated on lamotrigine or carbamazepine should be routinely educated about the risks of skin rashes and the potential for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). They should be advised to contact the treating physician if they observe any type of skin rashes or mucosal ulcers, as they require urgent medical evaluation to determine the nature of rashes/ulcers.

### Interventions for the management of obesity in people with bipolar disorder [^114PHL3e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is one of the most common serious mental illnesses, affecting approximately 60 million people worldwide. Characterized by extreme alterations in mood, cognition, and behavior, bipolar disorder can significantly negatively impact the functioning and quality of life of the affected individual. Compared with the general population, the prevalence of comorbid obesity is significantly higher in individuals with bipolar disorder. Approximately 68% of treatment-seeking bipolar patients are overweight or obese. Clinicians are aware that obesity can contribute to other physical health conditions in people with bipolar disorder, including diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death for those with bipolar disorder, occurring a decade or more earlier than in the general population.

Factors contributing to this include illness-related issues (e.g. mania or depression), treatment-related factors (e.g. weight implications and other side effects of medications), and lifestyle factors (e.g. physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, substance abuse). Approaches to managing obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder are diverse and include non-pharmacological interventions (i.e. dietary, exercise, behavioral, or multi-component), pharmacological interventions (i.e. weight loss drugs or medication switching), and bariatric surgery.

The objective is to assess the effectiveness of interventions for the management of obesity in people with bipolar disorder.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^112rjNQu]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Guidance about how this is done is generally not available based on an inadequate treatment literature or spelled out in traditional guidelines, so we present here some preliminary suggestions for pursuing this approach. Berk et al. reported in 2017 that a year of randomized treatment with lithium for first episode manic patients was superior to quetiapine on virtually every measure assessed, including mania, depression, functioning, cognition, and changes on brain imaging. Particularly for patients with characteristics predictive of lithium responsiveness, such as a positive family history of bipolar disorder (especially with a family history of responsivity to lithium), euphoric mania, discrete episodes with well intervals, lack of anxiety and substance abuse comorbidity, and a sequence of mania‐depression‐well interval as opposed to DMI, it is advisable to strongly consider lithium or keep it in the treatment mix if it has already been used but found not sufficiently effective. For the large group without these characteristics, such as those with anxiety or substance abuse comorbidity, a mood-stabilizing anticonvulsant such as valproate, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine, or an atypical antipsychotic could be used in augmentation.

In the presence of psychosis, residual manic, or mixed symptoms, a well-tolerated atypical antipsychotic in addition to lithium and an anticonvulsant might also be necessary. However, in individuals with psychotic symptoms, lithium has clear antipsychotic properties.

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating bipolar disorder: Revised third edition recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113Tn9ox]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of bipolar disorder, particularly in the context of managing comorbidities such as alcohol use, the BAP 2016 guidelines suggest offering disulfiram to patients seeking abstinence if acamprosate and naltrexone have not been effective. It is crucial to counsel patients about the risks associated with taking disulfiram and to monitor their mood closely.

### Aerobic exercise improves the overall outcome of type 2 diabetes mellitus among people with mental disorders [^115eX26x]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder characterized by fluctuations between periods of elevated mood and depression, accompanied by significant physiological, psychological, cognitive, and behavioral disruptions. Globally, approximately 2% of the population is affected by bipolar disorder, with these individuals facing a 52% likelihood of developing insulin resistance or diabetes. The co-occurrence of bipolar disorder and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a more severe and chronic course, characterized by frequent episodes, increased mental hospitalizations, and a 30% reduction in life expectancy.

The neuropsychiatric symptoms of bipolar disorder are influenced by a number of factors, including sleep disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammatory responses. These factors also contribute to the development of T2DM. Disrupted sleep, a core symptom of bipolar disorder, activates the sympathetic nervous system, reduces insulin secretion, and increases insulin resistance, which collectively result in elevated plasma free fatty acid levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder is characterized by decreased aerobic metabolism, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased mitochondrial DNA deletions. These changes are analogous to those observed in muscle mitochondria in T2DM, which exhibit reduced ATP production and structural abnormalities.

It is becoming increasingly evident that immune dysregulation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both bipolar disorder and T2DM. This is evidenced by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers.

### Call to action regarding the vascular-bipolar link: A report from the Vascular Task Force of the International Society for Bipolar Disorders [^114UpWgx]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

**Future directions**: Several medications used to treat bipolar disorder carry a substantial risk for cardiometabolic side effects. There is considerable individual variability in vulnerability to these side effects; their improved prediction could inform stratification for preventive interventions (e.g. lifestyle interventions, metformin, etc) While the extant evidence is not yet strong enough to support the routine use of medications used for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors to target psychiatric symptomatology in bipolar disorder, there are some interesting findings related to statins and ACE inhibitors that invite rigorous clinical trials.

### Associations between bipolar disorder and metabolic syndrome: A review [^111gikQa]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to examine the pathophysiologic mechanisms that may link bipolar disorder and metabolic syndrome, and to discuss whether the consequences of metabolic syndrome underlie a substantive portion of the premature morbidity and mortality observed in persons with bipolar disorder.

A MEDLINE search, citing articles from 1966 onward, supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Keywords used included bipolar disorder, mood disorder, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular illness, and obesity. Criteria used to select studies included: (1) English language, (2) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals, and (3) studies that confirmed the nature of the mood disorder examined.

Ninety-seven studies met these criteria and were reviewed for evidence of dysregulation in various physiologic systems. Bipolar disorder and metabolic syndrome share features of hormonal, immunologic, and autonomic nervous system dysregulation.

Lifestyle features may account, in part, for the premature mortality observed in bipolar disorder, but the somatic correlates of the illness may also predispose patients to metabolic syndrome and the consequent increased risk of diseases such as diabetes and vascular disease.

### Co-prescription of medication for bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus: A nationwide population-based study with focus on gender differences [^114uH7eq]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The results are based on data from the total Norwegian population, and the risk of selection bias is low. Our sample was initially large; however, only 900 persons received medication for both bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus. This number is nevertheless higher than in any other study we know. The lack of inclusion of data from hospitalized and institutionalized patients probably represents a small number, as few patients stay in the hospital throughout an entire year and the majority of the institutionalized patients are 70 years and older in nursing homes. Mood stabilizers are used less frequently by persons younger than 20 and were, therefore, excluded. Treatment with insulin is not indicated for any other disease than diabetes mellitus. Persons at risk for developing diabetes mellitus type II rarely use oral anti-diabetic agents. In Norway, metformin is rarely used prophylactically in psychiatric patients. Lithium is to some extent also used for treatment of unipolar depressed patients; excluding persons on antidepressants did not substantially change the OR.

Mood stabilizers might be used by patients diagnosed with other psychiatric diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, and this presents a possible confounder, as the prevalence of diabetes is increased in patients with schizophrenia. We are not aware of data from Norway on the use of mood stabilizers in schizophrenia, and data from other countries vary widely, so it is difficult to know how important this confounder may be. Of probable greater importance is the ability of antipsychotics to

### Medical monitoring in patients with bipolar disorder: Clinical recommendations [^117EVfzB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Treatments for bipolar disorder can increase the risk for thyroid dysfunction, weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Because of these risks, a planned regimen of patient monitoring is recommended to track health concerns such as fluctuations in thyroid levels, weight, blood pressure, glucose levels, and lipid profile. Different health tests are needed depending on the type of medication the patient is prescribed.

### Cardiometabolic risk markers during mood-stabilizing treatment: Correlation with drug-specific effects, depressive symptoms and treatment response [^114zKf46]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder have higher rates of cardiometabolic comorbidities and mortality. Although guidelines emphasize the importance of cardiovascular monitoring, few studies have characterized the cardiometabolic risk profile during treatment and their relation to symptomatology and treatment response.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from two similar 24-week comparative effectiveness trials, with a combined sample of 770 participants randomized to two different lithium doses, quetiapine (300 mg/day), or standard treatment without lithium. Glucose, lipids, and vital signs were measured before and after 24 weeks of treatment. We calculated several cardiovascular risk scores, assessed baseline correlations, and compared the four treatment arms via multiple linear regression models.

- **Results**: Higher cholesterol and LDL levels were associated with greater depression severity, showing differential correlations to specific symptoms, particularly agitation, low energy, and suicidality. Those randomized to quetiapine showed a significant worsening of cardiometabolic markers during the 24-week trial. Neither baseline nor change in lipid levels correlated with differential treatment response.

- **Limitations**: Study duration was short from the perspective of cardiometabolic risk markers, and all treatment arms included patients taking adjunct antipsychotics. The trials compared quetiapine to lithium, but not to other medications known to affect similar risk factors.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with 300 mg/day quetiapine for 24 weeks, representing a short and common dose course, resulted in significant changes in cardiometabolic markers.

### Equally increased risk for metabolic syndrome in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treated with second-generation antipsychotics [^113aX6vv]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The study explores the impact of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to those with schizophrenia. Both groups are assessed for potential differences in MetS prevalence influenced by the primary psychiatric diagnosis or concurrent mood stabilizer treatment.

The assessment included MetS criteria — abdominal obesity, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hyperglycemia, arterial hypertension — and the calculated 10-year CHD risk among closely matched patients by age, sex, and race.

Results revealed that patients with bipolar disorder exhibited a lower body mass index (27.1 ± 5.3) compared to schizophrenia patients (29.9 ± 8.1, p = 0.0053). Bipolar patients were more frequently treated with mood stabilizers (60.8% versus 36.0%, p = 0.0009) and less often with clozapine (1.3% versus 15.3%, p = 0.0017) or dual antipsychotics (10.8% versus 34.2%, p = 0.0003). Despite these disparities, MetS prevalence was similar between bipolar and schizophrenia patients (43.2% versus 45.9%, p = 0.71), as was the forecasted CHD event rate (10-year risk > 10%: 18.9% versus 23.4%, p = 0.47). Using the adapted glucose criterion of ≥ 100 mg/dL, MetS rates stood at 54.0% for both groups (p = 1.0). Importantly, mood stabilizer co-treatment did not correlate with MetS or its individual components.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: A network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^116LC1Yf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Eligibility criteria**:

	**Inclusion criteria**:
	1. Full text and data could be obtained.
	2. Designed in RCT.
	3. The first psychiatric diagnosis of the patient was bipolar disorder.
	4. Pharmacological interventions included mood stabilisers or antipsychotics.
	5. Outcomes included metabolic indicators.

	**Exclusion criteria**:
	1. Data of metabolic indicators were not presented as continuous variables.
	2. Patients reported primary metabolic disorder (e.g. diabetes), liver dysfunction, endocrine diseases, neuropathologic diseases, as well as women in pregnancy or lactation.
	3. Baseline medication could significantly influence metabolism (e.g. contraceptive drugs, hormone supplements).
	4. Any other items contrary to the inclusion criteria.

Baseline medication for affective disorders is limited to antidepressants, and RCTs involving augmentation, adjunct therapies, or physical therapies were excluded. To best inform clinical practice, we purposefully included all RCTs comparing any antipsychotics or mood stabilisers versus placebo, as well as head-to-head comparisons within or between the two types of drugs. There is no limitation on language, age, race, nationality, completion rate of the trials, or the mood states (euthymia, mania, hypomania, mixed state, or depression). The diagnosis of BD should be based on standard diagnostic criteria including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (DSM-III), DSM-IV / DSM-IV-TR, DSM-V, and ICD-10 (with or without other assessing tools, such as baseline psychiatric scales).

### Medical risk in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia [^1175ZHMt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are vulnerable to developing key modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotic medications, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, have been linked to the risk for adverse metabolic changes in patients. This review reports the prevalence of medical risk factors in the general population, as well as in those patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and discusses treatment strategies and lifestyle changes that patients can make in order to reduce their risks for certain diseases.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: A network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^116JdF4C]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Although the efficacy of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder has been confirmed, the metabolic effects of these drugs raise another dilemma. Increased risks of obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and weight gain have been frequently reported among patients of all age groups treated with these drugs. Previous studies revealed that antipsychotics interfered with the neural centre for energy balance regulation by acting on dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) receptors, which in turn increased appetite for food rich in sweets and fat. Antipsychotics also affect neurotransmission mediated by 5-HT, which has been confirmed to be associated with metabolic disturbance and weight gain.

It is also reported that the intra- and inter-cellular signaling mediated by antipsychotics attenuates insulin sensitivity of muscular cells and adipocytes, as well as influences endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake, and insulin secretion, which eventually increases the risk of obesity and diabetes. Antipsychotics might also promote the proliferation and differentiation of adipose tissue, contributing to abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism.

As for mood stabilisers, evidence suggests that long-term lithium intervention might lead to glucose tolerance impairment and insulin resistance, which might be attributed to the inhibition of glucophosphomutase. It was also reported that lithium could induce lipoprotein metabolism dysfunction and elevate serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). Furthermore, combined therapy of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers showed more metabolic impact.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: a network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^114BHtbu]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

The stabilizing effect on fasting serum glucose of lurasidone has been previously observed, with a recommendation as an alternative for patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and diabetes or other drug-induced metabolic issues. A mild decrease in fasting serum glucose was also recently detected to be correlated with symptom improvement among patients with BD who received lurasidone treatment. However, few studies focused on the difference in mood states, which was addressed in this network meta-analysis (NMA). The changeable mood states of BD are correlated to glucose metabolism, as activating SIRT-1, a gene regulating glucose uptake and insulin signaling, helped improve bipolar depression. A significantly lower ratio of glucose metabolic rates was detected in the left dorsal anterolateral prefrontal cortex divided by the rate for the ipsilateral hemisphere in patients with bipolar depression. Meanwhile, neuroimaging and pharmacological studies on the "switch" mechanism of BD addressed the periodic functional changes in brain regions such as the temporal cortex, frontal-striatal-thalamic, and default-mode network regions for mood state switching. In consideration of the evidence that bipolar depression is associated with insulin resistance and sensitivity of developing hyperglycemia, it can be speculated that linked glucose metabolic deficits in specific brain regions might be responsible for the apparent metabolic disorder induced by lurasidone in bipolar depression.

Another emerging finding concentrates on quetiapine. When co-intervention at the baseline existed, quetiapine showed a more vital ability to affect glucose metabolism.

### Investigation into the long-term metabolic effects of aripiprazole adjunctive to lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine [^117JRHys]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar I disorder (BPD) patients are often overweight or obese and likely to have metabolic syndrome. Several medications used to treat BPD are associated with increased body weight and/or worsening metabolic parameters.

- **Methods**: Metabolic data were analyzed from two efficacy studies of aripiprazole plus the mood stabilizers, lithium/valproate (Study CN138–189), or lamotrigine (Study CN138–392), in the long-term treatment (52 weeks) of BPD. Changes in body weight, individual metabolic parameters, and incidence of metabolic syndrome were assessed.

- **Results**: In the lithium/valproate study, modest increases in body weight were observed at Week 52 in both groups: 1.7 ± 0.8 kg in the lithium/valproate group, and 1.6 ± 0.7 kg in the adjunctive aripiprazole group; this difference was nonsignificant. In the lamotrigine study, decreases in body weight were observed at Week 52 with lamotrigine alone (-2.2 ± 1.0 kg), whereas a modest increase was observed when combined with aripiprazole (0.4 ± 1.0 kg). In both studies, rates of metabolic syndrome at 52 weeks did not increase from baseline with aripiprazole, and median changes from baseline in individual metabolic syndrome parameters were similar with both mood stabilizer monotherapy and the addition of aripiprazole as an adjunctive therapy.

- **Limitations**: This was a post-hoc analysis, and a low percentage of patients completed the lamotrigine study.

- **Conclusions**: Aripiprazole plus a mood stabilizer has minimal impact on metabolic changes in predominantly overweight/obese BPD patients over a 52-week period.
