## Question

Moderate intensity statin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use moderate-intensity statins, including definitions, indications, dosing, expected LDL-C reductions, safety, adherence, and how to escalate therapy if needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and dose ranges for moderate-intensity statins. Then, I should verify the clinical scenarios where moderate-intensity therapy is indicated versus when high-intensity is preferred. Next, I will review expected LDL-C lowering and how to monitor response. After that, I need to check safety, tolerability, and adherence considerations. Finally, I will examine escalation strategies, including when to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors, and summarize practical takeaways with guideline alignment.

> Let me first confirm the definition and dose ranges. Moderate-intensity statin therapy is defined by an expected LDL-C reduction of approximately 30% to 49%, with representative doses including atorvastatin 10–20 mg daily, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg daily, simvastatin 20–40 mg daily, pravastatin 40–80 mg daily, fluvastatin XL 80 mg daily or 40 mg twice daily, and pitavastatin 1–4 mg daily, recognizing that individual responses vary and some populations, including certain Asian groups, may have greater sensitivity to specific statins [^111nMPzC] [^113r5aGL] [^1166i8US] [^112aknaY].

> Now, I should verify the clinical indications where moderate-intensity statins are recommended. In primary prevention for adults 40–75 years without diabetes, moderate-intensity statins are indicated when the 10-year ASCVD risk is intermediate (≥ 7.5% to < 20%), with the goal of achieving at least a 30% LDL-C reduction; in borderline-risk adults (5% to < 7.5%), risk enhancers may justify moderate-intensity therapy after shared decision-making, and CAC scoring can refine decisions and timing of initiation [^111CzrrQ] [^115KfJhV] [^115c4Mvu]. For adults 40–75 years with diabetes, moderate-intensity statins are indicated regardless of calculated risk, with consideration of high-intensity therapy in those with additional risk factors; in adults > 75 years with diabetes, individualized assessment is advised, often favoring moderate intensity due to competing risks and tolerability [^117SzPjZ] [^116DoW87]. In secondary prevention, moderate-intensity statins are appropriate when high-intensity therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated, or in adults > 75 years where the balance of benefit and risk may favor moderate intensity [^112nizyu] [^11614XAq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intensity in all secondary prevention. I initially thought moderate-intensity might suffice broadly in older adults, but wait, I should double-check the age-stratified guidance. For adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statins are first-line unless contraindicated; moderate-intensity is the alternative if high-intensity is not tolerated or is contraindicated, whereas in adults > 75 years, it is reasonable to initiate or continue either moderate- or high-intensity therapy based on expected benefit, frailty, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^112nizyu] [^11614XAq] [^117Jsk1g]. Let me reconsider the mortality signal: observational data suggest a graded mortality benefit with higher intensity, but this must be balanced against tolerability and competing risks in older adults, reinforcing the need for individualized decisions in those > 75 years [^115rxdHG].

> Next, I should review expected LDL-C lowering and how to monitor. Moderate-intensity statins are expected to lower LDL-C by about 30–49% on average, and guidelines recommend checking a fasting or nonfasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change to assess adherence and percent reduction; if the response is inadequate (< 30% reduction or LDL-C remains above goal thresholds in higher-risk patients), intensification should be considered [^111nMPzC] [^111CzrrQ] [^1156932H]. I need to ensure I align with the treat-to-percent-reduction framework rather than fixed LDL-C targets in most primary prevention contexts, while acknowledging that some trials and pathways have operationalized treat-to-LDL-C thresholds in very high-risk secondary prevention settings, which can guide but do not replace the percent-reduction principle [^111CzrrQ] [^1156932H].

> I will now examine safety, tolerability, and adherence. More intensive statin regimens are associated with a modest relative increase in muscle symptoms of about 8% versus less intensive regimens, with the excess risk largely concentrated in the first year and attenuating thereafter; this supports careful intensity selection and monitoring early after initiation or uptitration [^114rv78s]. Intensive-dose statins also carry a higher risk of hepatotransaminase elevations and a small increase in new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose therapy, reinforcing the need to balance potency with patient-specific risk and tolerability [^113fkDu5] [^115wxsWc]. Adherence appears slightly better with moderate- versus high-intensity regimens in large observational cohorts, though the absolute difference is small and may be clinically modest, yet still meaningful at the population level [^113TtxoW].

> Let me think about special populations and drug–drug interactions. In older adults, especially ≥ 75 years, moderate-intensity statins are often preferred due to higher rates of intolerance and polypharmacy; when additional LDL-C lowering is needed, adding ezetimibe to a moderate-intensity statin is a reasonable strategy that maintains efficacy with improved tolerability compared with pushing statin monotherapy to high intensity [^11614XAq] [^115MUVFk] [^1176JZZp]. For patients with HIV, pitavastatin is favored due to fewer interactions with antiretrovirals, and moderate-intensity therapy is generally recommended based on ASCVD risk estimates and HIV-specific risk enhancers [^116iJYWW]. I should confirm that simvastatin 80 mg is avoided due to myopathy risk and that CYP3A4 inhibitors prompt preference for rosuvastatin or pitavastatin to mitigate interaction risk [^111nMPzC] [^115wBqQf].

> Next, I should review escalation strategies when moderate-intensity therapy is insufficient. If the LDL-C reduction is < 30% or thresholds such as LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL) are not met in intermediate-risk primary prevention, guidelines recommend escalating to high-intensity statin if tolerated; if high-intensity is not tolerated or LDL-C goals remain unmet, adding ezetimibe to moderate-intensity therapy is reasonable and often achieves greater LDL-C lowering with fewer intolerance-related discontinuations than high-intensity monotherapy [^1156932H] [^1178yDu1] [^1176JZZp]. In very high-risk ASCVD, if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin ± ezetimibe, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor can be considered after clinician–patient discussion of benefit, safety, and cost, recognizing the cost-effectiveness constraints at typical list prices [^112nizyu] [^117Jsk1g].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe versus high-intensity monotherapy. The RACING randomized trial showed that rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg was noninferior to rosuvastatin 20 mg for a 3-year composite cardiovascular outcome, achieved higher rates of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, and had fewer intolerance-related discontinuations or dose reductions; post hoc analyses suggest consistent effects across age strata, including patients ≥ 75 years, supporting the combination strategy when high-intensity monotherapy is problematic [^1176JZZp] [^112onuwQ]. A subsequent randomized study in adults ≥ 70 years similarly found fewer statin-associated muscle symptoms with moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe compared with high-intensity monotherapy, with similar attainment of LDL-C targets, reinforcing the safety advantage of the combination approach in older adults [^113SrUQq].

> I should double-check the treat-to-target versus high-intensity paradigm in established coronary disease. The TREAT-CAD randomized trial demonstrated that a treat-to-target strategy aiming for LDL-C 50–70 mg/dL using moderate- and high-intensity statins as needed was noninferior to routine high-intensity monotherapy for 3-year cardiovascular outcomes, supporting flexibility in intensity selection when guided by LDL-C response and patient factors [^111QzQMo]. But wait, what if baseline LDL-C is very high? Post hoc analyses from RACING suggest the noninferiority of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe holds across higher and lower baseline LDL-C subgroups, which strengthens the generalizability of the combination strategy when additional lowering is required [^116DdmVk].

> Let me synthesize practical takeaways. Moderate-intensity statins are appropriate first-line for intermediate-risk primary prevention, for most adults with diabetes, and as an alternative in secondary prevention when high-intensity therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated; expected LDL-C reduction is 30–49%, and response should be verified 4–12 weeks after initiation with consideration of intensification if the percent reduction is inadequate or thresholds are unmet [^111CzrrQ] [^111nMPzC]. Safety advantages, including fewer muscle symptoms and lower discontinuation rates, favor moderate-intensity strategies in older adults and those at higher risk of adverse effects, with ezetimibe add-on providing additional LDL-C lowering when needed; shared decision-making remains essential, especially in borderline-risk primary prevention and in adults > 75 years with clinical ASCVD [^11614XAq] [^114rv78s] [^112nizyu].

---

Moderate-intensity statins lower LDL-C by 30–49% [^111nMPzC] and are **first-line for adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes** [^117SzPjZ], those at intermediate ASCVD risk (7.5– < 20% 10-year) [^111CzrrQ], and for secondary prevention when high-intensity therapy is not tolerated or contraindicated [^112nizyu]. They reduce cardiovascular events by ~25% in primary prevention [^117SzPjZ] and are preferred in older adults due to better tolerability and adherence [^11614XAq] [^113TtxoW]. Common regimens include **atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, simvastatin 20–40 mg, and pravastatin 40–80 mg** [^113r5aGL] [^1166i8US]. If LDL-C reduction is inadequate (< 30%) [^1156932H], **escalate to high-intensity or add ezetimibe** [^114xhPUB]; monitor lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation or changes [^111nMPzC].

---

## Definition and mechanism of action

Moderate-intensity statins are defined by their ability to lower LDL-C by approximately 30–49% [^111nMPzC] [^114ST8Up]. They inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, thereby reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis, increasing LDL receptor expression, and lowering circulating LDL-C [^notfound].

---

## Clinical indications

Moderate-intensity statins are recommended for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Primary prevention in diabetes**: Adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes should receive moderate-intensity statins regardless of calculated ASCVD risk [^111CzrrQ] [^114vwJV6].

- **Intermediate-risk primary prevention**: Adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5– < 20% should initiate moderate-intensity statins after risk discussion [^111CzrrQ] [^115KfJhV].

- **Secondary prevention when high-intensity is not tolerated**: Patients with clinical ASCVD who cannot tolerate high-intensity statins should receive moderate-intensity therapy [^112nizyu] [^1114nMiT].

---

## Recommended moderate-intensity statin regimens

| **Statin** | **Moderate-intensity dose (mg/day)** |
|-|-|
| Atorvastatin | 10–20 |
| Rosuvastatin | 5–10 |
| Simvastatin | 20–40 |
| Pravastatin | 40–80 |
| Fluvastatin XL | 80 |
| Pitavastatin | 1–4 |

---

These regimens are consistent with ACC/AHA and AACE guidelines [^111nMPzC] [^1166i8US].

---

## Clinical benefits

Moderate-intensity statins provide substantial cardiovascular benefits:

- **Primary prevention**: Reduce ASCVD events by approximately 25% in intermediate-risk adults [^117BSkmW] [^117SzPjZ].

- **Secondary prevention**: Lower cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with established ASCVD [^113fkDu5] [^115rxdHG].

- **Elderly patients**: Preferred due to better tolerability and adherence, with similar or non-inferior outcomes compared to high-intensity regimens in some studies [^112onuwQ] [^1176JZZp].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Moderate-intensity statins are generally well tolerated. Muscle symptoms occur in ~5% and are usually mild and reversible [^notfound]; **serious myopathy** is rare. Hepatic **enzyme elevations** are uncommon and often transient. The risk of **new-onset diabetes** is low and comparable to other intensities [^116pGtXH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Lipid panels should be checked **4–12 weeks** after initiation or dose changes to assess adherence and response [^1119L2xg]. If **LDL-C reduction** is inadequate (< 30%) [^1156932H], escalate to high-intensity or add **ezetimibe** [^1178yDu1]. Routine liver enzyme monitoring is not required unless clinically indicated.

---

## Comparison with high-intensity statins

High-intensity statins lower LDL-C by ≥ 50% [^111nMPzC] and are recommended for very high-risk patients, such as those with clinical ASCVD or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [^112nizyu] [^116g1c8J]. However, they have higher rates of muscle symptoms and discontinuation, making moderate-intensity statins preferable for many older adults or those at risk of intolerance [^114rv78s] [^113fkDu5] [^11614XAq].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly patients**: Moderate-intensity statins are preferred due to better tolerability and adherence; combination with ezetimibe can achieve LDL-C goals without increasing adverse effects [^11614XAq] [^1176JZZp].

- **Patients with HIV**: Moderate-intensity statins, particularly pitavastatin, are recommended due to fewer drug interactions [^116iJYWW].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: Moderate-intensity statins are recommended, with careful monitoring for adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

- **ACC/AHA 2019**: Moderate-intensity statins for primary prevention in intermediate-risk adults and for secondary prevention when high-intensity is not tolerated [^111CzrrQ] [^112nizyu].

- **AACE 2022**: Moderate-intensity statins for primary prevention in patients with diabetes and for those at intermediate risk [^111QWr6D].

- **NLA 2015**: Emphasizes patient-centered care, targeting at least a 30% LDL-C reduction with moderate-intensity statins [^1154wzMH].

---

Moderate-intensity statins are a cornerstone of lipid management, providing substantial cardiovascular risk reduction with favorable tolerability across diverse populations. They are especially valuable for primary prevention in intermediate-risk adults, patients with diabetes, and older adults, with escalation strategies available when additional LDL-C lowering is needed.

### Is high-intensity statin therapy associated with lower statin adherence compared with low-to moderate-intensity statin therapy? Implications of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol management guidelines [^113TtxoW]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The recent cholesterol guideline recommends high-intensity statins in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. High-intensity statins are associated with more frequent side effects. Therefore, it may be of concern that these recommendations might reduce statin adherence.

Hypothesis

High-intensity statins are associated with lower adherence compared with low- to moderate-intensity statins.

Methods

In a national database of 972,532 CVD patients from the Veterans Health Administration, we identified patients receiving statins between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2011. We assessed statin adherence by calculating proportion of days covered (PDC) and determined whether high-intensity statin therapy was independently associated with a lower PDC.

Results

Statins were prescribed in 629,005 (64.7%). Of those, 229,437 (36.5%) received high-intensity statins. Mean PDC (0.87 vs 0.86, P < 0.0001) and patients with PDC ≥ 0.80 (76.3% vs 74.2%, P < 0.0001) were slightly higher for those receiving low- to moderate-intensity compared with high-intensity statins. In adjusted analyses, high-intensity statin use was associated with a significant but modest PDC reduction compared with low- to moderate-intensity statin use, whether PDC was assessed as a continuous (β-coefficient: -0.008, P < 0.0001) or categorical (PDC ≥ 0.80 [odds ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.93–0.96]) measure of statin adherence.

Conclusions

An approach of high-intensity statin therapy will lead to a significant practice change, as the majority of CVD patients are not on high-intensity therapy. However, this change may be associated with a very modest reduction in statin adherence compared with low- to moderate-intensity therapy that is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

ACC/AHA guideline recommendations for statin intensity in clinical ASCVD — High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated, and when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated. In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it. Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117SzPjZ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115qPn4T]. ClinicalInfo (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for human immunodeficiency virus infection, more specifically with respect to statin therapy, CDC/HIVMA/IDSA/NIH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients with HIV infection and a 10-year ASCVD risk estimate of < 5%.
Recognize that the absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, consider the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk when deciding to initiate a statin. Use the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QWr6D]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^1176kiRR]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment; those with: 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, were identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group, and with rosuvastatin 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57% and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

Conclusions

The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Percent reduction in LDL cholesterol following high-intensity statin therapy: potential implications for guidelines and for the prescription of emerging lipid-lowering agents [^115gAEZJ]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Current statin guidelines in Europe and Canada advocate achieving a fixed LDL target or the attainment of a ≥ 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), while current US guidelines advocate the use of statin therapies that reduce LDLC by < 50% (moderate intensity) or ≥ 50% (high intensity). Data are limited, however, linking the achievement of these % reduction thresholds to subsequent cardiovascular outcomes particularly for contemporary high-intensity regimens.

Methods and Results

In a randomized trial of 17 082 initially healthy men and women with median baseline LDLC of 108 mg/dL (interquartile range 94–119), we (i) used waterfall plots to assess the variability in LDLC response to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and (ii) evaluated the impact of reaching ≥ 50% reductions in LDLC on risk of developing the first cardiovascular events. Among rosuvastatin allocated participants, 3640 individuals (46.3%) experienced an LDLC reduction ≥ 50%; 3365 individuals (42.8%) experienced an LDLC reduction > 0 but < 50%; and 851 individuals (10.8%) experienced no reduction or an increase in LDLC compared with baseline. These % LDLC reductions directly related to the risks of first cardiovascular events; at trial completion, incidence rates for the primary endpoint were 11.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 4.8 per 1000 person-years for those in the placebo, no LDLC reduction, LDLC reduction < 50%, and LDLC reduction ≥ 50% groups, respectively. Compared with placebo, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for sequentially greater on-treatment per cent reductions in LDLC were 0.91 (95%CI 0.54–1.53), 0.61 (95%CI 0.44–0.83), and 0.43 (95%CI 0.30–0.60) (P < 0.00001). Similar relationships between % reduction and clinical outcomes were observed in analyses focusing on non-HDLC or apolipoprotein B.

Conclusions

As documented for low- and moderate-intensity regimens, variability in % LDLC reduction following high-intensity statin therapy is wide yet the magnitude of this % reduction directly relates to efficacy. These data support guideline approaches that incorporate % reduction targets for statin therapy as well as absolute targets, and might provide a structure for the allocation of emerging adjunctive lipid-lowering therapies such as PCSK9 inhibitors should these agents prove broadly effective for cardiovascular event reduction.

### Combination moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe therapy for elderly patients with atherosclerosis [^112onuwQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The routine use of high-intensity statins should be considered carefully in elderly patients because of their higher risk of intolerance or adverse events.

Objectives

We evaluated the impact of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy compared with high-intensity statin monotherapy in elderly patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

In this post hoc analysis of the RACING (RAndomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lipid-lowerING With Statin Monotherapy Versus Statin/Ezetimibe Combination for High-risk Cardiovascular Diseases) trial, patients were stratified by age (≥ 75 years and < 75 years). The primary endpoint was a 3-year composite of cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular events, or nonfatal stroke.

Results

Among the 3,780 enrolled patients, 574 (15.2%) were aged ≥ 75 years. The rates of the primary endpoint were not different between the moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy group and the high-intensity statin monotherapy group among patients aged ≥ 75 years (10.6% vs 12.3%; HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.54–1.42; P = 0.581) and those < 75 years (8.8% vs 9.4%; HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.74–1.18; P = 0.570) (P for interaction = 0.797). Moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy was associated with lower rates of intolerance-related drug discontinuation or dose reduction among patients aged ≥ 75 years (2.3% vs 7.2%; P = 0.010) and those < 75 years (5.2% vs 8.4%; P < 0.001) (P for interaction = 0.159).

Conclusions

Moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy showed similar cardiovascular benefits to those of high-intensity statin monotherapy with lower intolerance-related drug discontinuation or dose reduction in elderly patients with ASCVD having a higher risk of intolerance, nonadherence, and discontinuation with high-intensity statin therapy.

### The risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis in the era of high-intensity statin therapy: does statin type matter? [^116pGtXH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on cholesterol management have placed greater emphasis on high-intensity statin dosing for those with known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Differences in risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis specifically between the high-intensity statins and the most common moderate-intensity statin, simvastatin, were not found to a significant degree in this review. Rather, baseline characteristics and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) appear to be more important regarding the risk of these adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic differences in statin metabolism may explain individual susceptibility, however genetic testing is not felt to be cost effective at this time. More importantly, statin choice should consider concomitant use of the many prevalent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and when present, rosuvastatin selection is recommended to reduce DDIs and risk of statin-induced adverse effects.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy versus high-intensity statin monotherapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (RACING): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^1176JZZp]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Drug combinations rather than increasing doses of one drug can achieve greater efficacy and lower risks. Thus, as an alternative to high-intensity statin monotherapy, moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy can lower LDL cholesterol concentrations effectively while reducing adverse effects. However, evidence from randomised trials to compare long-term clinical outcomes is needed.

Methods

In this randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at 26 clinical centres in South Korea were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy (rosuvastatin 10 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg) or high-intensity statin monotherapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg). The primary endpoint was the 3-year composite of cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular events, or non-fatal stroke, in the intention-to-treat population with a non-inferiority margin of 2.0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03044665 and is complete.

Findings

Between Feb 14, 2017, and Dec 18, 2018, 3780 patients were enrolled: 1894 patients to the combination therapy group and 1886 to the high-intensity statin monotherapy group. The primary endpoint occurred in 172 patients (9.1%) in the combination therapy group and 186 patients (9.9%) in the high-intensity statin monotherapy group (absolute difference -0.78%; 90% CI -2.39 to 0.83). LDL cholesterol concentrations of less than 70 mg/dL at 1, 2, and 3 years were observed in 73%, 75%, and 72% of patients in the combination therapy group, and 55%, 60%, and 58% of patients in the high-intensity statin monotherapy group (all p < 0.0001). Discontinuation or dose reduction of the study drug by intolerance was observed in 88 patients (4.8%) and 150 patients (8.2%), respectively (p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Among patients with ASCVD, moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy was non-inferior to high-intensity statin monotherapy for the 3-year composite outcomes with a higher proportion of patients with LDL cholesterol concentrations of less than 70 mg/dL and lower intolerance-related drug discontinuation or dose reduction.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 ECDP — Adults with diabetes without ASCVD and baseline LDL-C < 190 mg/dL on statin therapy for primary prevention: The guideline recommends that all adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes receive at least a moderate-intensity statin, and higher-risk subgroups (including reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and ankle brachial index < 0.9) are potential candidates for high-intensity statin therapy. For the small proportion with 10-year predicted ASCVD risk < 7.5% and no additional high-risk features, moderate-intensity statin therapy with anticipated LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) reduction 30%-49% is supported; soluble dietary fiber and phytosterols may also be considered. Because elevated non-HDL-C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is common in diabetes, non-HDL-C thresholds are important to consider. If, despite adherence to lifestyle recommendations and moderate-intensity statin therapy, patients have < 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), consideration of intensification of therapy is indicated and routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted. If the response reaches a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy. If still inadequate after these steps, the patient and clinician may consider increasing the statin dose to a high-intensity statin. If high-intensity statin therapy still results in inadequate percent LDL-C reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on adding a nonstatin; ezetimibe 10 mg daily may be considered as the initial nonstatin agent for most patients when additional LDL-C lowering is desired.

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^115LtqVY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

How can we stratify cardiovascular risk in diabetes?

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology approach

The 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines propose an approach based on the global risk estimation. The panel considers that patients with diabetes, either type 1 or 2, aged between 40 and 75 years, who have a baseline non-treated LDL-c between 70 and 189 mg/dL, should be stratified into a higher or a lower risk category to receive either high or moderate intensity treatment with statins. This categorization is based on the calculation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes.

The ACC/AHA calculator was developed to estimate the 10-year risk for the first ASCVD event (non-fatal myocardial infarction or CHD death, or fatal/non-fatal stroke) by entering definite risk factors. It uses a risk equation derived from a pool of 4 cohorts obtained from the American population. The 10-year risk is based on the first ASCVD event over a 10-year period among people previously free from ASCVD. The calculator should be used in non-Hispanic African Americans and in non-Hispanic whites in the range of 40–79 years of age. For patients with diabetes, the guidelines indicate intensive statin treatment for patients with an ASCVD risk above 7.5% in 10 years. If the risk is below this cut-off, moderate-intensity statin treatment is indicated.

The panel defines high-intensity treatment as the statin therapy able to reduce LDL-c in more than 50% from baseline. Moderate-intensity treatment is defined as the reduction of LDL-c in about 30 to < 50%. In patients aged less than 40 years, or above 75 years, the evidence of benefit is less clear. In these cases, when deciding to initiate or intensify statin therapy, the AHA/ACC panel consider reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD benefits, considering the preferences of the patient and the potential for adverse effects.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UxjEg]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality and disability, with elevated serum lipid levels, particularly low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) as one of its major risk factors. Lowering LDL‐C is crucial in mitigating the negative outcomes of CVD, especially in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the first‐line therapy for patients with ASCVD for LDL‐C elevations, but many patients on low/moderate‐intensity statin regimens fail to attain target LDL‐C levels. Contemporary guidelines recommend high‐intensity statins for hyperlipidemia treatment, but they come with challenges such as drug interactions and dose‐dependent adverse events. An alternative approach is combining ezetimibe, a non‐statin drug, with tolerated stain dosage. Ezetimibe has shown efficacy in lowering LDL‐C alongside a more favorable safety profile. However, previous meta‐analyses have shown conflicting information regarding the superiority in efficacy or safety profile of high‐intensity statin monotherapy compared to low/moderate‐intensity statin combined with ezetimibe therapy. Given the recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these two lipid‐lowering strategies in ASCVD patients.

NLA recommendations — older adults with dyslipidemia: In primary prevention, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of < 130 mg/dL and < 100 mg/dL are appropriate targets, and after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended whenever feasible; the NLA high-risk thresholds are ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event using the Pooled Cohort Equations and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator, and in patients ≥ 65 years of age with uncertainty about drug therapy it is reasonable to recommend moderate intensity statin therapy when there is 1 or more major ASCVD risk factor or when risk exceeds 15% or 10% by the respective calculators; in situations requiring additional objective information, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring may be considered and a score of zero in asymptomatic patients may suggest that non-pharmacologic approaches are reasonable; for those ≥ 80 years of age with atherogenic lipoproteins above goals, a provider-patient discussion should be undertaken and if statin intolerance is the primary issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens including low intensity or non-daily moderate intensity statin therapy, low dose statin combination therapy with ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, or niacin, or non-statin monotherapy, and in general, we recommend that providers try to achieve at least a 30% LDL-C reduction.

### Moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe vs high-intensity statin according to baseline LDL-C in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a post-hoc analysis of the RACING randomized trial [^116DdmVk]. Atherosclerosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Whether the effect of a combination strategy rather than increasing doses of one drug to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is consistent across baseline LDL-C levels remains uncertain.

Methods

In the RACING trial, which showed a non-inferiority of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe (rosuvastatin 10 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg) to high-intensity statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg) for the primary outcome (3-year composite of cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular event, or stroke), the heterogeneity in treatment effect according to baseline LDL-C levels was assessed for the primary and secondary outcomes (clinical efficacy and safety).

Results

Of 3780 participants, 2817 participants (74.5%) had LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and 963 participants (25.5%) had LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL. The treatment effect of combination therapy versus high-intensity statin monotherapy was similar among the lower LDL-C subset (8.8% vs. 10.2%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.08, p = 0.19) and the higher LDL-C subset (10.8% vs. 9.6%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.7, p = 0.53) without a significant interaction (interaction p = 0.22). Of the secondary outcomes, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL was greater in the combination therapy group regardless of baseline LDL-C levels.

Conclusions

Among ASCVD patients, there was no heterogeneity in the effect of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy in the higher and lower baseline LDL-C levels for the 3-year composite of cardiovascular outcomes.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1178KwtC]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk-reduction therapy — absolute risk–aligned intensity and lifestyle versus drug therapy: The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event. Lifestyle therapy is considered to be first-line intervention, with LDL-C (and non–HDL-C) reductions with lifestyle changes most often in the range of 5% to 15%, but in individuals at moderate to higher risk for ASCVD, a larger magnitude of atherogenic cholesterol lowering than can be achieved with lifestyle changes alone is generally warranted; decisions regarding adding atherogenic cholesterol– lowering drug therapy should include an investigation of the patient's absolute risk for ASCVD, including long-term risk.

### Comparative outcomes of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe vs high-intensity statin therapy: a retrospective observational cohort study [^115wh8gQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence supports that more aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering improves outcomes in patients at high cardiovascular risk, but whether one therapeutic strategy is superior to another remains unclear.

Objective

This study compared the effectiveness of moderate-intensity statin therapy combined with ezetimibe vs high-intensity statin monotherapy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study at a large tertiary university hospital. The study included patients prescribed either moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe or high-intensity statin between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020. Propensity score matching was performed to balance clinical characteristics between the groups. The primary endpoint was an ischemic outcome, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, revascularization, and all-cause mortality.

Results

Before matching, 1380 patients were prescribed moderate-intensity statin-ezetimibe combination therapy, and 1105 patients were prescribed high-intensity statin therapy. After matching, 971 patients were included in each group. Over a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 1.7% of patients in the moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe group and in 2.1% of patients in the high-intensity statin group. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI: 0.41–1.61, P = 0.558). No statistically significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, revascularization, and all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

In this retrospective cohort study, moderate-intensity statin combined with ezetimibe was as effective as high-intensity statin monotherapy in preventing cardiovascular events.

Lipid management for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with diabetes — age‑stratified recommendations specify: in people 20–39 years of age, consider statin therapy if there are additional ASCVD risk factors. In people 40–75 years of age, use moderate-intensity statin therapy in those without ASCVD risk factors, and use a high-intensity statin in those with ≥ 1 ASCVD risk factor, with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L); it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved, and use bempedoic acid for those who are statin intolerant. In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112UD3pm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Candidates for statin combination therapy — indications and decision factors: More intensive atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be indicated in high or very high risk patients with a less-than-desirable response to moderate or high intensity statin therapy; in patients who have recurrent ASCVD events or progressive atherosclerotic vascular symptoms in spite of high intensity statin therapy; in patients with FH, especially with ASCVD or poorly controlled non-lipid risk factors and less than optimal non-HDL-C or LDL-C levels; and in patients after acute coronary syndromes on at least moderate intensity statin therapy. Generally, if a patient in the categories above at high or very high ASCVD risk is not at non-HDL-C and LDL-C goals, strong consideration should be given to statin combination therapy (i.e., a statin with an additional lipid-altering agent). Clinical ASCVD event benefits of combination therapy were demonstrated in a recent clinical trial of ezetimibe added to statin therapy and with investigational PCSK9 inhibitors added to statin therapy. The clinician should determine whether statin combination therapies are indicated based on re-evaluation of the patient's risk factor status and quantitative risk scoring, reconsideration of the nature of the patient's history of vascular events, reconsideration of possible genetic dyslipidemias, examination of affordability and polypharmacy risks, and consideration of the patient's preferences.

### High-intensity versus non-high-intensity statins in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal after percutaneous coronary intervention [^116YpG7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

High‐intensity statins have demonstrated consistent benefits for secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events compared with moderate‐intensity statins in several randomized trials. 1, 2 Therefore, the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on treatment of blood cholesterol recommends high‐intensity statins, including atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg and rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg, for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 3 However, whether beneficial effects of high‐intensity statins can be attributable to statin intensity per se or to merely lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) level achieved by high‐intensity statins compared with moderate‐intensity statins is uncertain. It has been reported that lowering of LDL‐C with statin therapy reduces major cardiovascular events regardless of types or intensities of statins. 4 Therefore, European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia still propose the target goal for LDL‐C of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or a reduction of at least 50% from baseline for subjects at very high risk without specific recommendation for type or intensity of statin. 5 The differences between the 2 guidelines have caused many debates and much confusion in daily practice. 6 To date, it remains controversial whether outcomes differ according to statin intensity in patients with similar LDL‐C level. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association between statin intensity and long‐term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and achieving treatment target for LDL‐C.

Secondary prevention — ASCVD not at very high-risk: High-intensity statin (Goal: ↓ LDL-C ≥ 50%) (Class I) is recommended, and if high-intensity statin not tolerated, use moderate-intensity statin (Class I). If on maximal statin therapy and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), adding ezetimibe may be reasonable (Class IIb). For older adults, initiation of moderate- or high-intensity statin is reasonable (Class IIa), and continuation of high-intensity statin is reasonable (Class IIa); in patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD, potential benefits versus adverse effects of statin therapy should be considered before initiation of statin therapy.

### Adoption of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol management guideline in cardiology practices nationwide [^116mzRBW]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Cholesterol Management Guideline recommends moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin therapy in eligible patients.

Objective

To examine adoption of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline in US cardiology practices.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Among 161 cardiology practices, trends in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were analyzed before (September 1, 2012, to November 1, 2013) and after (February 1, 2014, to April 1, 2015) publication of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline among 4 mutually exclusive risk groups within the ACC Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence Registry. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate for differences in trend in use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT use in hierarchical logistic regression models. Participants were a population-based sample of 1 105 356 preguideline patients (2 431 192 patient encounters) and 1 116 472 postguideline patients (2 377 219 patient encounters). Approximately 97% of patients had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Exposures

Moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT use before and after publication of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Time trend in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin and nonstatin LLT.

Results

In the study cohort, the mean (SD) age was 69.6 (12.1) years among 1 105 356 patients (40.2% female) before publication of the guideline and 70.0 (11.9) years among 1 116 472 patients (39.8% female) after publication of the guideline. Although there was a trend toward increasing use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statins overall and in the ASCVD cohort, such a trend was already present before publication of the guideline. No significant difference in trend in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statins was observed in other groups. The use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin therapy was 62.1% (before publication of the guideline) and 66.6% (after publication of the guideline) in the overall cohort, 62.7% (before publication) and 67.0% (after publication) in the ASCVD cohort, 50.6% (before publication) and 52.3% (after publication) in the cohort with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (ie, ≥ 190 mg/dL), 52.4% (before publication) and 55.2% (after publication) in the diabetes cohort, and 41.9% (before publication) and 46.9% (after publication) in the remaining group with 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher. In hierarchical logistic regression models, there was a significant increase in the use of moderate-intensity to high-intensity statins in the overall cohort (4.8%) and in the ASCVD cohort (4.3%) (P < .01 for slope for both). There was no significant change for other risk cohorts. Nonstatin LLT use remained unchanged in the preguideline and postguideline periods in the hierarchical logistic regression models for all of the risk groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Adoption of the 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Management Guideline in cardiology practices was modest. Timely interventions are needed to improve guideline-concordant practice to reduce the burden of ASCVD.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in older adults and ezetimibe add-on — It is reasonable to consider continuation of high-intensity therapy in patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD if they are tolerating the statin and have a low risk of competing morbidities. It may be reasonable to add ezetimibe to moderate-intensity therapy in patients with ASCVD for whom high-intensity therapy is indicated but cannot be used, provided their LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on moderate-intensity therapy; the same reasoning holds for any patient whose LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116iJYWW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy as primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with HIV — For those aged 40–75 years with 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%, the Panel recommends initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (AI); recommended options are pitavastatin 4 mg once daily (AI), atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (AII), and rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily (AII). When 10-year ASCVD risk estimates are < 5%, the Panel favors initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (CI), using the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%. The absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, the decision to initiate a statin should take into account the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk. For people aged < 40 years, data are insufficient to recommend for or against statin therapy as primary prevention of ASCVD in people with HIV. Estimates are based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator from the American College of Cardiology (ACC).

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^111QzQMo]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In patients with coronary artery disease, some guidelines recommend initial statin treatment with high-intensity statins to achieve at least a 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). An alternative approach is to begin with moderate-intensity statins and titrate to a specific LDL-C goal. These alternatives have not been compared head-to-head in a clinical trial involving patients with known coronary artery disease.

Objective

To assess whether a treat-to-target strategy is noninferior to a strategy of high-intensity statins for long-term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, multicenter, noninferiority trial in patients with a coronary disease diagnosis treated at 12 centers in South Korea (enrollment: September 9, 2016, through November 27, 2019; final follow-up: October 26, 2022).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the LDL-C target strategy, with an LDL-C level between 50 and 70 mg/dL as the target, or high-intensity statin treatment, which consisted of rosuvastatin, 20 mg, or atorvastatin, 40 mg.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was a 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization with a noninferiority margin of 3.0 percentage points.

Results

Among 4400 patients, 4341 patients (98.7%) completed the trial (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [9.9] years; 1228 females [27.9%]). In the treat-to-target group (n = 2200), which had 6449 person-years of follow-up, moderate-intensity and high-intensity dosing were used in 43% and 54%, respectively. The mean (SD) LDL-C level for 3 years was 69.1 (17.8) mg/dL in the treat-to-target group and 68.4 (20.1) mg/dL in the high-intensity statin group (n = 2200) (P = 0.21, compared with the treat-to-target group). The primary end point occurred in 177 patients (8.1%) in the treat-to-target group and 190 patients (8.7%) in the high-intensity statin group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points [upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5% CI, 1.1 percentage points]; P < .001 for noninferiority).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with coronary artery disease, a treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal was noninferior to a high-intensity statin therapy for the 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization. These findings provide additional evidence supporting the suitability of a treat-to-target strategy that may allow a tailored approach with consideration for individual variability in drug response to statin therapy.

### Evaluating algorithmic fairness in the presence of clinical guidelines: the case of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation [^116CDEtq]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

While risk stratification models are central to personalising care, their use can worsen health inequities. In an effort to mitigate harms, several recent works propose algorithmic group fairness — mathematical criteria which require that certain statistical properties of a model's predictions not differ across groups. However, identifying which statistical properties are most relevant to fairness in a given context is non-trivial. Hence, before applying fairness criteria for evaluation or model adjustment, it is crucial to examine how the model's predictions will inform treatment decisions — and what effect those decisions will have on patients' health.

Here, we consider the 2019 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which codify the use of 10-year ASCVD risk predictions to inform a clinician-patient shared decision-making on initiating statin therapy. These guidelines recommend that individuals estimated to be at intermediate risk (> 7.5%–20%) be considered for initiation for moderate-intensity to high-intensity statin therapy, and that those at high risk (> 20%) be considered for high-intensity statin therapy. Individuals at borderline risk (> 5%–7.5%) may be considered for therapy under some circumstances.

Figure 4
Effect of less intensive or moderate-intensity statin regimens on any muscle pain or weakness, by participant characteristics

Bold indicates the overall summary result. White squares indicate missing data. Tests of heterogeneity (or trend) listed after each prognostic characteristic are of the log rate ratio for each of the subgroups of that characteristic, and are uncorrected for multiple comparisons. GFR = glomerular filtration rate. LDL = low-density lipoprotein. O–E = observed minus expected. Var = variance.

Analyses of statin intensity used data from two randomised trials of more intensive statin therapy versus placebo, combined with data from four randomised trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin therapy that included 30 724 participants (median duration 4.9 years, mean age 62 years; SD 9 years; all with known vascular disease; table 1). As compared with a moderate-intensity regimen, more intensive statin regimens resulted in a 5% relative increase in the rate of reporting of a first episode of muscle pain or weakness (two trials RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.99–1.11; table 2; appendix pp 7,15). There was a similar 5% relative increase in the comparisons of different statin regimens, where both regimens fell within the moderate-intensity range (two trials 1.05; 1.00–1.11; appendix p 15). There were broadly similar increases in any muscle pain or weakness for any type of more-intensive versus less-intensive statin therapy, both in the first and subsequent years (heterogeneity p = 0.61; appendix p 16). There was no evidence that the increase in muscle symptoms varied significantly within any of the subgroups, including sex (heterogeneity p = 0.61; appendix p 17). To obtain a reliable estimate of the effects of more intensive regimens, we combined the results of a direct comparison of more intensive statin regimens versus placebo in two trials, with the results of an indirect comparison involving two trials of more intensive versus moderate-intensity regimens, and 16 trials of moderate-intensity regimens versus placebo. The direct comparison of more intensive statin regimens versus placebo during a median follow-up of 2.6 years yielded, for the rate of reporting a first episode of muscle pain or weakness, an RR of 1.09 (95% CI 1.03–1.16; table 2, appendix pp 7, 12). In the indirect comparison, the estimated RR for more intensive statin was 1.07 (1.01–1.14; table 2). Combining these direct and indirect comparisons yielded an overall RR of muscle pain or weakness with more intensive statin regimens of 1.08 (1.04–1.13), with RRs of 1.11 (1.05–1.17) in year 1 and 1.05 (0.99–1.12) after 1 year.

### Safety and efficacy of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe in elderly patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113SrUQq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

High-intensity statin therapy significantly reduces mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, moderate-intensity statins are often preferred for elderly patients due to their higher risk of intolerance to high-intensity statins.

Objective

To compare the incidence of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and the effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between elderly ASCVD patients receiving high-intensity statin monotherapy and those receiving moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe in a combination therapy.

Method

In a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial conducted in South Korea, 561 patients aged 70 years or above with ASCVD were randomly assigned to receive either moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy (rosuvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg) or high-intensity statin monotherapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg) over 6 months. The primary endpoint was the incidence of SAMS, and the key secondary endpoint was the achievement of target LDL-C levels (< 70 mg/dL) within 6 months.

Results

The primary endpoint showed a lower incidence of SAMS in the combination therapy group (0.7%) compared to the high-intensity statin monotherapy group (5.7%, p = 0.005). Both groups achieved similar LDL-C levels, with 75.4% in the combination therapy group and 68.7% in the monotherapy group reaching target levels.

Conclusion

Moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy offers a lower risk of SAMS and similar LDL-C reduction in elderly patients with ASCVD, compared to high-intensity statin monotherapy.

### Association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115rxdHG]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, statin therapy in general, and high-intensity statin therapy in particular, is underused in patients with established ASCVD.

Objective

To determine the association between all-cause mortality and intensity of statin therapy in the Veterans Affairs health care system.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of patients aged 21 to 84 years with ASCVD treated in the Veterans Affairs health care system from April 1, 2013, to April 1, 2014. Patients who were included had 1 or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for ASCVD on 2 or more different dates in the prior 2 years.

Exposures

Intensity of statin therapy was defined by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, and use was defined as a filled prescription in the prior 6 months. Patients were excluded if they were taking a higher statin dose in the prior 5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was death from all causes adjusted for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins.

Results

The study sample included 509 766 eligible adults with ASCVD at baseline (mean [SD] age, 68.5 [8.8] years; 499 598 men and 10 168 women), including 150 928 (29.6%) receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 232 293 (45.6%) receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 33 920 (6.7%) receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 92 625 (18.2%) receiving no statins. During a mean follow-up of 492 days, there was a graded association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality, with 1-year mortality rates of 4.0% (5103 of 126 139) for those receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 4.8% (9703 of 200 709) for those receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 5.7% (1632 of 28 765) for those receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 6.6% (4868 of 73 728) for those receiving no statin (P < .001). After adjusting for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins, the hazard ratio for mortality was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88–0.93) for those receiving high- vs moderate-intensity statins. The magnitude of benefit of high- vs moderate-intensity statins was similar, for an incident cohort hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–1.01). For patients aged 76 to 84 years, the hazard ratio was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87–0.95). Patients treated with maximal doses of high-intensity statins had lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94) compared with those receiving submaximal doses.

Conclusions and Relevance

We found a graded association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in a national sample of patients with ASCVD. High-intensity statins were associated with a small but significant survival advantage compared with moderate-intensity statins, even among older adults. Maximal doses of high-intensity statins were associated with a further survival benefit.

### Efficacy and diabetes risk of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe versus high-intensity statin after percutaneous coronary intervention [^113u8Yf6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

High-intensity statin therapy and low to moderate-intensity statin therapy combined with ezetimibe are two different approaches that can be used to treat cardiovascular disease. Although high-intensity statins are essential for lowering LDL-C, they are associated with more side effects than lower-intensity statins. Reducing the dose from a high-intensity statin to a moderate-intensity statin may modulate the side effects of a high-intensity statin, while adding ezetimibe to a moderate-intensity statin can maintain the LDL-C lowering capacity similar to a high-intensity statin. Adding ezetimibe to low or moderate-intensity statins showed similar or superior LDL-C lowering capacity compared to high-intensity statins. Though achieving an excellent reduction of LDL-C, a small study reported that platelet reactivity and proinflammatory chemokine were reduced more by the high-intensity than by ezetimibe plus lower-intensity statin. A large, randomized controlled trial, RACING (randomized comparison of efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering with statin monotherapy versus statin/ezetimibe combination for high-risk cardiovascular diseases) trial, demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy, which was non-inferior to high-intensity statin monotherapy in the 3-year risk of MACCE among high-risk patients. Our study also revealed a consistent outcome whereby both the combination regimen of moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe and high-intensity statin monotherapy was associated with a similar risk reduction of MACCEs among patients undergoing PCI, as demonstrated by a large population-based real-world data analysis. Risk reduction achieved through LDL-C lowering, rather than statin intensity alone, is now supported by multiple studies, including earlier trials and meta-analyses, as well as recent randomized controlled trials with non-statin therapies.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^113zFgXy]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Risk classification and lipid-lowering therapy by CAC — CAC scoring is used to guide the initiation and intensity of statin therapy. High intensity statin therapy is recommended in any patients with a CAC ≥ 300 or above the 75th percentile for age/gender/race, consistent with the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention Guidelines. Moderate to high intensity statin treatment is recommended for patients with CAC 100–299; for CAC 1–99, moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended for those with CAC percentile < 75% and moderate to high intensity for those with CAC percentile ≥ 75%. Patients with CAC = 0 are considered to be at lowest risk and statins are not uniformly recommended, with the exception of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or diabetes.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) primary prevention — statin therapy by age, diabetes status, and risk categories is specified as follows: For LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L), no risk assessment is performed and high-intensity statin (Class I) is used. For diabetes mellitus and age 40–75 y, moderate-intensity statin (Class I) is indicated, with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa). In adults age 40–75 y without diabetes mellitus, 10-year ASCVD risk percent begins risk discussion with categories of < 5% "Low Risk" with emphasis on lifestyle (Class I); 5%– < 7.5% "Borderline Risk", where if risk enhancers are present then discuss moderate-intensity statin therapy (Class IIb); 7.5%– < 20% "Intermediate Risk", where risk enhancers favor statin and initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I); and ≥ 20% "High Risk", where initiating statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% is advised (Class I). For age > 75 y, clinical assessment and risk discussion are recommended, and for age 20–39 y clinicians estimate lifetime risk to encourage lifestyle and consider statin if family history of premature ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L).

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

### Meta-analysis of drug-induced adverse events associated with intensive-dose statin therapy [^113fkDu5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized trials evaluating intensive dose statin therapy have found enhanced protection against cardiovascular (CV) events compared with moderate-dose statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the potential for an increase in the risk of drug-induced adverse events with such therapy has not been quantified.

Objective

This meta-analysis was performed to compare the incremental risks associated with intensive- and moderate-dose statin therapy.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1995 to 2006 using the following terms: acute, coronary syndrome, stable coronary artery disease, atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin. Prospective, randomized controlled trials evaluating intensive- and moderate-dose statin therapy for the reduction of CV events were included in the review. The safety end points examined were elevations in creatine kinase (CK) ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), elevations in alanine or aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 times the ULN, rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy, and any drug-induced events. The efficacy end points examined were all-cause mortality, CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Each analysis compared the effect of intensive- or moderate-dose statin therapy on statin-induced adverse events and clinical efficacy outcomes. Simple absolute risk, the number needed to treat, and the number needed to harm were also calculated to quantify the incremental benefit or harm associated with intensive-dose statin therapy.

Results

Four trials were included in the analysis. Together, they included 27,548 patients with ACS or stable CAD followed for a mean of 3.4 years, representing 108,049 patient-years of clinical-trial experience. Intensive-dose therapy with atorvastatin or simvastatin 80 mg was associated with a significant increase in the risk for any adverse event (odds ratio [OR] = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.33–1.55; P < 0.001) and adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18–1.39; P < 0.001). Intensive-dose therapy also was associated with an increased risk for abnormalities on liver function testing (OR = 4.48; 95% Cl, 3.27–6.16; P < 0.001) and elevations in CK (OR = 9.97; 95% CI, 1.28–77.92; P = 0.028). The benefits of intensive-dose statin therapy included reductions in CV death (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.99; P = 0.031), MI (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93; P < 0.001), and stroke (OR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Although intensive-dose statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk for important CV events, it was also associated with an increased risk for statin-induced adverse events. Therefore, moderate-dose statin therapy may be the most appropriate choice for achieving CV risk reduction in the majority of individuals, whereas intensive-dose statin therapy may be reserved for those at highest risk.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults [^1119L2xg]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicate that lipid-lowering drugs have benefit for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Severe hypercholesterolemia — synopsis highlights that patients with severe hypercholesterolemia have a high lifetime risk, and decisions about statins in these patients do not require ASCVD risk scoring; these patients derive the greatest ASCVD risk reduction benefit from interventions that increase expression of LDL receptors; the strongest data have been derived from statin RCTs, which have demonstrated greater risk reduction from high-intensity statin therapy than with moderate-intensity statin therapy; ezetimibe plus a moderate-intensity statin is associated with greater LDL-C reduction than statin monotherapy in patients with heterozygous FH, and the combination reduces ASCVD risk more than moderate-intensity statin monotherapy in patients who have had a recent ACS.

### Risk of incident diabetes with intensive-dose compared with moderate-dose statin therapy: a meta-analysis [^115wxsWc]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy is associated with excess risk of developing diabetes mellitus.

Objective

To investigate whether intensive-dose statin therapy is associated with increased risk of new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose statin therapy.

Data Sources

We identified relevant trials in a literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1, 1996, through March 31, 2011). Unpublished data were obtained from investigators.

Study Selection

We included randomized controlled end-point trials that compared intensive-dose statin therapy with moderate-dose statin therapy and included more than 1000 participants who were followed up for more than 1 year.

Data Extraction

Tabular data provided for each trial described baseline characteristics and numbers of participants developing diabetes and experiencing major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, coronary revascularization). We calculated trial-specific odds ratios (ORs) for new-onset diabetes and major cardiovascular events and combined these using random-effects model meta-analysis. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic.

Results

In 5 statin trials with 32,752 participants without diabetes at baseline, 2749 developed diabetes (1449 assigned intensive-dose therapy, 1300 assigned moderate-dose therapy, representing 2.0 additional cases in the intensive-dose group per 1000 patient-years) and 6684 experienced cardiovascular events (3134 and 3550, respectively, representing 6.5 fewer cases in the intensive-dose group per 1000 patient-years) over a weighted mean (SD) follow-up of 4.9 (1.9) years. Odds ratios were 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.22; I² = 0%) for new-onset diabetes and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75–0.94; I² = 74%) for cardiovascular events for participants receiving intensive therapy compared with moderate-dose therapy. As compared with moderate-dose statin therapy, the number needed to harm per year for intensive-dose statin therapy was 498 for new-onset diabetes while the number needed to treat per year for intensive-dose statin therapy was 155 for cardiovascular events.

Conclusion

In a pooled analysis of data from 5 statin trials, intensive-dose statin therapy was associated with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes compared with moderate-dose statin therapy.

### Intensity of statin therapy after ischaemic stroke and long-term outcomes: a nationwide cohort study [^111TPJDB]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

A total of 27 647 patients died during the follow-up of 290 556 patient-years. All-cause mortality was 48.2% among those with high-intensity statin, 53.6% with moderate-intensity and 62.3% with low-intensity (figure 1). Higher intensity of treatment is associated stepwise with a lower risk of death (table 1). The NNTs of higher intensity statin after IS for death during follow-up were 32.0 (95% CI 20.1 to 79.8) for high-intensity versus moderate-intensity, 27.5 (95% CI 19.0 to 49.6) for moderate-intensity versus low-intensity and 14.6 (95% CI 10.9 to 22.3) for high-intensity versus low-intensity. The E-value stood at 1.41 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.57) in high-intensity versus moderate-intensity, 1.44 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.58) in moderate-intensity versus low-intensity and 1.70 (CI 1.51 to 1.90) in high-intensity versus low-intensity groups with regard to mortality. Increased statin intensity was associated with a reduced risk of death across all studied subgroups (online supplemental table 3).

ACC/AHA statin therapy performance measure for chronic stable coronary artery disease defines the "Percentage of patients 18–75 y of age with CAD who were offered moderate- to high-intensity statin", with a numerator including those who "Have been offered* high-intensity statin†" or "Have been offered* moderate-intensity statin† and have documentation of a medical reason for not prescribing high-intensity statin". A statin is "offered" if it is prescribed or if a patient reason exception is documented. The denominator is "All patients 18–75 y of age with CAD who were seen within a 12-mo period", with "Denominator Exclusions: None" and "Denominator Exceptions: Documentation of medical reason(s) for not prescribing a statin (e.g., allergy, intolerance to statin(s), other medical reasons)". The period of assessment is "12 mo", attribution is "Clinician practices caring for patients with CAD", and "Moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin doses are defined in Table 5 of the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults (5)".

### Population impact&efficiency of benefit-targeted versus risk-targeted statin prescribing for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112zzKEP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Estimating Reduced Cardiovascular Risk With Moderate‐Intensity Statins

We modeled statin effectiveness using methods and assumptions developed by Thanassoulis et al. 3 We defined moderate‐intensity statins as statin therapy that achieves an LDL reduction of 40% in persons who were not already taking a statin. We translated the effects of LDL‐lowering from statins into a reduced event risk by applying the ARR formulation developed by Thanassoulis et al, 3 which is derived from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) meta‐analysis that demonstrated an interaction in statin efficacy by baseline level of risk (formulas provided by Thanassoulis et al in their online appendix 1). We used this calculated value — the expected ARR — both to estimate the reduction in risk from statins for each NHANES participant treated with statins (for both benefit‐ and risk‐targeted therapy) as well as to target that therapy (for benefit‐targeted therapy only). The PIE Model Stata code implementing calculation of the expected ARR is archived and available on the website 4; the critical steps are described below:
lnRRthanassoulis = −0.10821+0.12346*ln(baselinerisk) (from Thanassoulis et al 3)
RRthanassoulis = exp(lnRRthanassoulis) (RR per mmol/L LDL reduction)
RR = RRthanassoulis^(LDLreduction in mmol/L) (Calculated RR for given patient)

To focus our base‐case analysis on comparison of risk‐targeting versus benefit‐targeting of statins for primary prevention, we did not apply statin therapy in persons with previous cardiovascular disease or diabetes, or with LDL ≥ 190 mg/dL, because statins are indicated in these groups regardless of risk or expected statin benefit. 2 These persons are effectively omitted from our analysis, except that they figure into the overall impact calculation given that they are still part of the US population.

Adults aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus — primary prevention statin therapy — are generally at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, a meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy is associated with a risk reduction of 25%, and therefore moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus for primary prevention. The ASCVD risk score, however, does not determine whether statin intensity should be increased; residual risk in trials remained high (eg, 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes mellitus as they age or develop risk modifiers (Table 5), although no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out in cohorts of patients exclusively with diabetes mellitus.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1122HadQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association Chart 4 — first-line and combination pharmacotherapy: First-line cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, unless contraindicated, is moderate- to high-intensity statin, and the statin dosage may be increased or the patient switched to a more efficacious agent, if goal levels of atherogenic cholesterol are not achieved. Nonstatin drug therapy (cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, fibric acids, long-chain omega-3 fatty acid concentrates, and nicotinic acid) may be considered for patients with contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy. Combination drug therapy with a statin plus a second (or third) agent that further lowers non–HDL-C and LDL-C may be considered for patients who have not attained their atherogenic cholesterol levels after the maximum tolerated statin dosage has been reached and for those who have contraindications or are intolerant to statin therapy. If drug therapy is used, at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted, and after atherogenic cholesterol–lowering targets are achieved with drug therapy, response to therapy should be monitored within 4–12 mo.

### Selected moderate-strength… [^114mpP3Y]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. SEVERE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater.

DIABETES MELLITUS Based on high-quality evidence from RCTs, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for all patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk. Moderate-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years without diabetes who have a 10-year risk of 7. 5% to

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^116nDcCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations. Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl.

### Overview of new ACC / AHA lipid guidelines… [^115SCw1C]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Rather than a "fire and forget" strategy involving a risk-based prescription of a moderate- or high-intensity statin, we are supposed to go back to monitoring low-density lipoprotein levels and targeting a percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol — and in very high-risk patients targeting an LDL level of less than 70 mg per dL. Statins are divided into high intensity, moderate-intensity, and low-intensity groups. For patients 40 years and older, a high-intensity statin is recommended for an LDL level greater than 190 mg per dL and a moderate- or high-intensity statin for those with diabetes mellitus.

For all other patients, the Pooled Cohort Equations are used to place patients into one of four risk groups; the old guideline had only three. If the 10-year risk of an ASCVD event is less than 5%, no statin is recommended. If the 10-year risk is 5% to 7. 5%, consider a moderate-intensity statin if there is also a "risk enhancer, " such as LDL level greater than 160 mg per dL, family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, South Asian ancestry, preeclampsia, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis. For persons with a 7. 5% to 20% risk, they recommend a moderate-intensity statin for most patients to target a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL cholesterol. Finally, if the risk is greater than 20%, a statin to target a 50% or more reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended. Patients in this category should be taking a high-intensity statin, adding ezetimibe if necessary, to target an LDL level of 70 mg per dL.

If that is not achieved, a PSK9 inhibitor should be considered.
