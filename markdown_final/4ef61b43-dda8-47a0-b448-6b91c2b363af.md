## Question

does bactrim cause melanotic stool?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) causes melanotic stool, i.e., melena. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "melanotic stool" means clinically and how it differs from benign dark stools. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and authoritative reviews say about gastrointestinal bleeding with Bactrim. Next, I will examine mechanistic pathways that could plausibly lead to melena, including hematologic and mucosal effects. After that, I should review direct evidence such as case reports and trials for signals of melena. Finally, I will synthesize a risk assessment and provide practical clinical guidance, including when to stop the drug and what to do if melena occurs.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. "Melanotic stool" in clinical usage typically refers to melena, which is black, tarry stool from oxidized hemoglobin due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding; this is distinct from dark stools from non-bleeding causes like bismuth, iron, or certain foods, which can mimic melena but are benign, so I need to keep that distinction front-of-mind as I interpret any reports of "black stool" in the literature or labeling.

> Next, I should review the FDA labeling and adverse reaction sections for Bactrim to see if melena is explicitly listed. Wait, let me verify the official sources: the current FDA materials detail gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and they extensively catalog hematologic and hepatic risks, but I do not see melena listed as a labeled adverse reaction, which suggests no direct, specific signal in the core safety profile for melena itself [^114r2Ksk] [^113RRnHU] [^1148veyB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — absence from labeling doesn't prove absence of risk, so I need to check mechanistic pathways that could plausibly cause melena. I will now examine hematologic toxicity: Bactrim is associated with thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and hypoprothrombinemia, any of which could predispose to bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding that would present as melena; this mechanistic plausibility is strong even if melena isn't named explicitly in the label [^114r2Ksk] [^116Fifj1] [^113RRnHU].

> But wait, what if the bleeding risk is indirect via vitamin K effects rather than direct mucosal injury? I should double-check that angle. There is a published case report describing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole–associated vitamin K deficiency leading to coagulopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding; this provides direct clinical evidence that Bactrim can, albeit rarely, precipitate melena through a coagulopathic mechanism rather than primary mucosal ulceration, which aligns with the hematologic safety profile [^115UBcK8].

> Next, I should review large clinical trials and cohorts for any gastrointestinal bleeding signals. Let me consider the randomized trials in melioidosis where patients receive prolonged high-dose TMP-SMX; adverse event tables emphasize rash, gastrointestinal upset, hematologic toxicity, and electrolyte disturbances, but I do not find explicit reports of melena as a frequent event, which supports the notion that melena, if it occurs, is uncommon or not a prominent signal in these datasets [^111Q3Ze8] [^111MeS4J].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking dyshemoglobinemias that could confuse the picture. Sulfhemoglobinemia has been reported with sulfonamides including TMP-SMX and can cause slate-gray or bluish discoloration of skin and blood, but this is a different pathophysiology from melena and would not typically cause black, tarry stools; still, recognizing this helps avoid misattributing cyanosis or unusual discoloration to gastrointestinal bleeding when the stool is not actually melenic [^116k3Prp].

> Let me synthesize the risk. Mechanistically, Bactrim can cause thrombocytopenia, marrow suppression, and coagulopathy (e.g., hypoprothrombinemia or vitamin K deficiency), all of which can lead to bleeding and thus melena; clinically, there is at least one case report documenting GI bleeding from vitamin K deficiency on TMP-SMX, and labeling acknowledges GI adverse effects and hematologic toxicity without listing melena per se, suggesting a rare but plausible association rather than a common or expected effect [^114r2Ksk] [^115UBcK8] [^113RRnHU].

> Now, I should translate this into practical guidance. If a patient on Bactrim develops melena, I need to check immediately for serious hematologic toxicity or coagulopathy and stop the drug, because the label instructs discontinuation at the first sign of serious adverse reaction; I should obtain CBC, platelets, PT/INR, renal and hepatic function, and consider vitamin K status, while initiating standard evaluation for upper GI bleeding and managing per guideline-directed care for GI hemorrhage [^116cnh5b] [^115UBcK8] [^1148veyB].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Does Bactrim cause melanotic stool? No, melena is not a commonly listed or expected adverse effect of Bactrim; however, via hematologic toxicity and coagulopathy (including vitamin K deficiency), Bactrim can rarely precipitate upper GI bleeding presenting as melena, so clinicians should maintain vigilance and evaluate promptly if melena occurs during therapy [^114r2Ksk] [^115UBcK8] [^113RRnHU].

Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) **does not directly cause melanotic stool** (melena). Melena results from upper gastrointestinal bleeding, not from the drug itself. However, Bactrim can cause **gastrointestinal bleeding** indirectly through:

- **Hematologic toxicity**: thrombocytopenia [^116Fifj1], leukopenia, or aplastic anemia [^114r2Ksk], increasing bleeding risk.
- **Gastrointestinal mucosal injury**: gastritis, ulcers, or esophagitis [^notfound] from irritation or inflammation.
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: severe colitis with bleeding [^116Fifj1] [^1148veyB].

If melena occurs while taking Bactrim, **evaluate for bleeding** and discontinue the drug if an adverse reaction is suspected [^116cnh5b].

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking BACTRIM immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving BACTRIM. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue BACTRIM if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.

Drug Interactions

Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.

### A comparison between 12 versus 20 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication treatment for melioidosis: an open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^114F6K8v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between August 2011 and June 2018, we enrolled 667 patients; 9 patients were found to be ineligible (Figure 1). Of 658 patients who had TMP-SMX as oral eradication treatment for 12 weeks and had no clinical evidence of active melioidosis, 322 (49%) were randomly assigned to stop the treatment (12-week regimen) and 336 (51%) were randomized to continue the treatment for another 8 weeks (20-week regimen). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups (Table 1). There were no missing data for baseline characteristics. Overall, 30 patients (5%) did not require parenteral antimicrobial treatment, and 366 (56%) were deemed to require longer than 14 days of parenteral therapy before starting oral treatment. Most patients had a bodyweight of 40–60 kg and received 240/1200 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily. During their first 12 weeks of oral eradication treatment prior to enrollment, 615 (93%) patients received TMP-SMX alone, while 43 (7%) patients received TMP-SMX plus doxycycline.

Table 2.
Outcomes of the Study

Figure 2.
Non-inferiority of 12-week regimen relative to 20-week regimen. Data points are the point estimate of the HR between the 12-week regimen and 20-week regimen. Error bars are 95% CIs. Clinical equivalence of 12-week regimen would be accepted if the upper bound of the 95% CI of the HR for culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (primary end point) was below the predefined noninferiority margin (HR 2.0; dotted line). Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.

A comparison of secondary end points in the 2 arms is shown in Table 2. We observed no difference for overall recurrent melioidosis (P = 0.14). However, overall mortality was lower in the 12-week group (0.3%; 1/322), compared with the 20-week group (3%; 11/336; HR, 0.10; 95% CI,.01–.74; p = 0.03). The causes of death were culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (1 patient), clinical recurrent melioidosis (3 patients), and other causes (8 patients). No deaths were attributed to an adverse reaction to TMP-SMX. A composite secondary end point combining overall recurrent melioidosis and mortality was not different between the 2 groups (HR, 0.93; 95% CI,.44–1.96; p = 0.85; Figure 3). The criterion for noninferiority was met because the upper bound of the 95% CI was lower than the predefined noninferiority margin (1-sided P = 0.022; Figure 2).

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- **Blood dyscrasias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Crystalluria**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- **Hemolysis**: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- **Hepatic necrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- **Increased risk of adverse events**: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- **Lung injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute generalized erythematous pustulosis.

OVERDOSAGE

Acute

The amount of a single dose of BACTRIM that is either associated with symptoms of overdosage or is likely to be life-threatening has not been reported. Signs and symptoms of overdosage reported with sulfonamides include anorexia, colic, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, drowsiness and unconsciousness. Pyrexia, hematuria and crystalluria may be noted. Blood dyscrasias and jaundice are potential late manifestations of overdosage.

Signs of acute overdosage with trimethoprim include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, mental depression, confusion and bone marrow depression.

General principles of treatment include the institution of gastric lavage or emesis, forcing oral fluids, and the administration of intravenous fluids if urine output is low and renal function is normal. Acidification of the urine will increase renal elimination of trimethoprim. The patient should be monitored with blood counts and appropriate blood chemistries, including electrolytes. If a significant blood dyscrasia or jaundice occurs, specific therapy should be instituted for these complications. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective and hemodialysis is only moderately effective in eliminating sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Chronic

Use of BACTRIM at high doses and/or for extended periods of time may cause bone marrow depression manifested as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and/or megaloblastic anemia. If signs of bone marrow depression occur, the patient should be given leucovorin 5 to 15 mg daily until normal hematopoiesis is restored.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions associated with the use of BACTRIM or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were identified in clinical trials, postmarketing or published reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria). Fatalities and serious adverse reactions, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM(see WARNINGS).

Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, eosinophilia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### A comparison between 12 versus 20 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication treatment for melioidosis: an open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^1124dZ4q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

All centers committed to follow the most up-to-date guidelines for treatment of melioidosis, including a weight-based dosage of TMP-SMX during the oral eradication treatment. In short, if patients had a body weight of < 40 kg, the dose used was 160/800 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily; for a body weight of 40–60 kg, the dose was 240/1200 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily; and for a body weight > 60 kg, the dose was 320/1600 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily. The dose was adjusted according to the glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment.

The methods and results are reported according to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement for noninferiority trials (Supplementary File 1). The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee and the institutional review boards of all participating hospitals. The study was reviewed and monitored by an independent data safety and monitoring board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01420341.

Randomization and Masking

We randomly allocated participants in a 1:1 ratio to either a 12-week or a 20-week regimen of oral eradication treatment. Randomization codes were computer generated and were stratified by center with the use of random permuted block (block sizes of 10) using an open-access Random Allocation Software program. Centers were provided with sealed envelopes with tamper-proof closure strips, to be opened in ascending order. Each envelope contained the random regimen allocation. Periodic checks ensured that sites had the correct number of envelopes, that they were intact, and that the sequential numbering system was maintained. Participants and clinicians were all informed of the allocated regimens.

The proportion of patients reporting adverse drug reactions was lower in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group than in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (table 3). Common adverse drug reactions were allergic reactions and gastrointestinal disorders. Serious adverse events (grade 4) were reported in five patients (2%) given TMP-SMX plus placebo and eight patients (3%) given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline. These serious adverse events included Stevens-Johnson syndrome (three patients), severe hyponatraemia (< 120 mmol/L; two patients), and severe hyperkalaemia (> 7 mmol/L; one patient).

Results

Between Oct 24, 2005, and Feb 1, 2010, we randomly assigned 626 patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis to receive either oral TMP-SMX plus placebo (n = 311), or oral TMP-SMX plus doxycycline (n = 315; figure 1). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two treatment groups (table 1). There were no missing data for baseline characteristics. Overall, 40 patients (6%) did not require parenteral antimicrobial treatment before enrolment, and 357 patients (57%) were deemed to need longer than 14 days of parenteral treatment before starting oral treatment. Most patients had a bodyweight between 40 kg and 60 kg and received 320 mg of TMP with 1600 mg of SMX twice daily (table 1).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics

Follow-up was completed in Feb 21, 2011, 1 year after we enrolled the last patient. 618 patients (99%) had at least one follow-up assessment. Median follow-up duration was 17 months (IQR 13–28) in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 19 months (16–31) in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (p = 0.06). Total duration of follow-up was 536 person-years in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 583 person-years in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group.

We recorded no between-group difference in our primary analysis for culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (p = 0.64; table 2). Non-inferiority of TMP-SMX plus placebo was shown because the upper bound of the 95% CI was below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin (one-sided p = 0.01; figure 2). The probability of having culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis within 1 year of enrolment was 3% and within 3 years of enrolment was 10% (figure 3). Of 37 culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis cases, seven (19%) occurred during 20 weeks of oral treatment, 17 (46%) occurred during the first year of follow-up, four (11%) occurred between year 1 and year 2 of follow-up, and nine (24%) occurred after 2 years.

### A comparison between 12 versus 20 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication treatment for melioidosis: an open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^111MeS4J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of melioidosis comprises intravenous drugs for at least 10 days, followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 12 to 20 weeks. Oral TMP-SMX is recommended for 12 weeks in Australia and 20 weeks in Thailand.

Methods

For this open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial, we enrolled patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis who had received oral eradication treatment for 12 weeks and had no clinical evidence of active melioidosis. We randomly assigned patients to stop treatment (12-week regimen) or continue treatment for another 8 weeks (20-week regimen). The primary end point was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis within 1 year after enrollment. The noninferiority margin was a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.0. The secondary composite end point, combining overall recurrent melioidosis and mortality, was assessed post hoc.

Results

We enrolled 658 patients: 322 to the 12-week regimen and 336 to the 20-week regimen. There were 5 patients (2%) in the 12-week regimen and 2 patients (1%) in the 20-week regimen who developed culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (HR, 2.66; 95% confidence interval, .52–13.69). The criterion for noninferiority of the primary event was not met (1-sided P = 0.37). However, all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the 12-week regimen group than in the 20-week regimen group (1 [.3%] vs 11 [3%], respectively; HR, 0.10; 95% CI, .01-.74). The criterion for noninferiority of the secondary composite end point, combining overall recurrent melioidosis and mortality, was met (1-sided P = 0.022).

Conclusions

Based on the lower total mortality and noninferiority of the secondary composite end point observed, we recommend the 12-week regimen of TMP-SMX for oral eradication treatment of melioidosis.

### A comparison between 12 versus 20 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication treatment for melioidosis: an open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^113Ka9KW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

We derived our suggestion based on the thought processes recommended when the primary outcome is negative. As we observed the lower total mortality and noninferiority of the secondary composite end point in the 12-week regimen group, we considered that our study should be interpreted constructively. We consider that the primary end point defined is appropriate. This is because the main objective of oral eradication treatment is to reduce the risk of recrudescence or relapse of the primary infection, which commonly occurs during the first year after the completion of initial parenteral antimicrobial treatment. Although there is a concern that the 12-week regimen may be associated with a higher risk of recurrent melioidosis, the risk is not observed in our study. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the largest RCT of oral eradication treatment. We carefully considered whether findings of secondary outcomes could be used to support 1 recommendation (12-week regimen in Australia) over the other (20-week regimen in Thailand). The lower overall mortality in the 12-week regimen could be due to chance. This is because many of the causes of mortality in the 20-week regimen group are noncommunicable diseases and infections caused by other organisms. Longer and unnecessary exposure to TMP-SMX might reduce liver and kidney functions of patients, as shown by higher adverse events at the Week 8 follow-up, but this is unlikely to be a direct explanation for the higher mortality. The secondary composite end point could increase the power of the study, and provide some additional evidence. The noninferiority of the secondary composite end point is also supported by preexisting evidence in Australia, showing that 12 weeks of TMP-SMX alone is adequate, and in Thailand, showing that risk of relapse is not significantly different if the treatment is longer than 8 weeks.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus doxycycline as oral eradicative treatment for melioidosis (MERTH): a multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^113w4N9r]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei, is difficult to cure. Antimicrobial treatment comprises intravenous drugs for at least 10 days, followed by oral drugs for at least 12 weeks. The standard oral regimen based on trial evidence is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxaxole (TMP-SMX) plus doxycycline. This regimen is used in Thailand but is associated with side-effects and poor adherence by patients, and TMP-SMX alone is recommended in Australia. We compared the efficacy and side-effects of TMP-SMX with TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment.

Methods

For this multi-centre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled patients (aged ≥ 15 years) from five centres in northeast Thailand with culture-confirmed melioidosis who had received a course of parenteral antimicrobial drugs. Using a computer-generated sequence, we randomly assigned patients to receive TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for 20 weeks (1:1; block size of ten, stratified by study site). We followed patients up every 4 months for 1 year and annually thereafter to the end of the study. The primary endpoint was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis, and the non-inferiority margin was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.7. This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN86140460.

Findings

We enrolled and randomly assigned 626 patients: 311 to TMP-SMX plus placebo and 315 to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline. 16 patients (5%) in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 21 patients (7%) in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group developed culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.42–1.55). The criterion for non-inferiority was met (p = 0.01). Adverse drug reactions were less common in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group than in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (122 [39%] vs 167 [53%]).

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that TMP-SMX is not inferior to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment, and is preferable on the basis of safety and tolerance by patients.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^113rYBoh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

BACTRIM is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound and metabolized forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in humans to at least 5 metabolites: the N4-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N4-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy- sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The formulation of N4-hydroxy metabolite is mediated via CYP2C9.

Trimethoprim is metabolized in vitro to 11 different metabolites, of which, five are glutathione adducts and six are oxidative metabolites, including the major metabolites, 1- and 3-oxides and the 3- and 4-hydroxy derivatives.

The free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be the therapeutically active forms.

In vitro studies suggest that trimethoprim is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, OCT1 and OCT2, and that sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein.

Approximately 70% of sulfamethoxazole and 44% of trimethoprim are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an insignificant degree; trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.

After enrolment, we followed patients up at weeks 4, 12, and 20 of oral treatment, every 4 months for 1 year after completion of treatment, and annually thereafter to the end of the study. Patients who did not attend scheduled appointments were contacted by telephone. The trial was designed to stop 1 year after the last participant was enrolled. At each clinical visit, we undertook a clinical examination and laboratory analyses, including complete blood count, blood sugar, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolyte, and liver function tests. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography were done at enrolment, and repeated at weeks 12 and 20 if an abnormality was detected on the first test. We asked patients to bring the study drug bottles to follow-up visits, at which drug compliance was checked by pill counts. Treatment with the randomised drugs was extended beyond 20 weeks if clinically indicated because of evidence of residual infection, as decided by the treating physician. Concealed study drug bottles labelled with unique spare sequential code numbers were separately prepared for patients who needed treatment for more than 20 weeks. As needed, the site investigator contacted the coordinating centre by telephone to receive the code number of the extended study drug bottles for a specific study participant.

Study treatment was stopped immediately if a patient developed symptoms or signs of a severe allergic reaction (grade 4), and treatment was completed with the second-line regimen (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid). Patients who were not able to tolerate the study drugs because of other adverse drug reactions and those who had an inadequate response to the study drugs as judged by the treating physician were also switched to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was prescribed according to a weight-based dosage, as follows: bodyweight less than 60 kg: 1000 mg amoxicillin and 250 mg clavulanic acid three times daily, and bodyweight greater than 60 kg: 1500 mg amoxicillin and 375 mg clavulanic acid three times daily.

Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever

The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

Thrombocytopenia

BACTRIM-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of BACTRIM.

Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including BACTRIM, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Risk Associated with Concurrent Use of Leucovorin for Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia

Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when BACTRIM was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.4Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia.

Randomisation and masking

We randomly allocated patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive TMP-SMX with either placebo doxycycline (hereafter referred to as placebo) or doxycycline, which were identical in appearance. Randomisation and masking was done at the coordinating centre at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (Bangkok, Thailand). The allocation sequence was computer generated with a block size of ten and was stratified by study site. To achieve treatment concealment, TMP-SMX and either placebo or doxycycline were dispensed into sequential, identical, tamper-proof bottles for each participant for 20 weeks. The study drug bottles were labelled with sequential code numbers and distributed to the study sites. TMP-SMX, placebo, and doxycycline were manufactured and provided by the Siam Pharmaceutical Company (Bangkok, Thailand). All patients and study investigators were unaware of the drug allocation throughout the study. The randomisation codes remained sealed until after data collection, data cleaning, and completion of a masked analysis.

Procedures

All patients received TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for a minimum of 20 weeks. TMP-SMX (80 mg TMP and 400 mg SMX) tablets were prescribed using a weight-based dosage, as follows: bodyweight less than 40 kg or estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–29 mL/min, 160 mg TMP and 800 mg SMX twice daily; bodyweight of 40 kg to 60 kg, 240 mg TMP and 1200 mg SMX twice daily; and bodyweight greater than 60 kg, 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX twice daily. Doxycycline or placebo was prescribed as a 100 mg tablet to be taken twice daily. Patients were advised to repeat the dose if vomiting occurred within 30 min of their taking the tablet. The minimum duration of 20 weeks was based on a combination of current practice and available evidence. The recommended duration for oral antimicrobials is 12–20 weeks in Thailand, and 3–6 months in Australia, a discrepancy that shows the uncertainty about the optimum duration. Findings from a retrospective study in Thailand showed that treatment for longer than 12 weeks was associated with lower risk of relapse. We therefore chose to use 20 weeks as a minimum duration rather than 12 weeks or an empirically chosen point between the two.

We did bacterial genotyping for 29 (78%) of 37 patients with culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis for whom paired isolates (from the primary and recurrent episode) were available. 14 recurrent cases (48%) were defined as relapse, and 15 recurrent cases (52%) were defined as re-infection. Median time to relapse (7 months, IQR 6–13) was shorter than median time to re-infection (29 months; 13–37; p = 0.0009).

In a sensitivity analysis (n = 603), we excluded 15 patients who developed genotype confirmed re-infection and eight patients who did not have paired isolates for genotyping (appendix). These results did not differ substantially from the main analysis, although the 95% CIs were wider as a consequence of the inclusion of fewer failure outcomes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two treatment groups (appendix). Of the 14 patients with culture-confirmed relapse, five were in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group (2% of 300 patients in this group included in the sensitivity analysis), and nine were in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (3% of the 303 patients in the group; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.19–1.73; p = 0.33; appendix). The lower boundary of the 95% CI for the HR for culture-confirmed relapse was slightly greater than the non-inferiority margin (1.73 vs 1.70). In this analysis, 14 patients (5%) given TMP-SMX plus placebo and 24 patients (8%) given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline died during the study period (HR 0.61, 0.31–1.17; p = 0.14; appendix). Patients given TMP-SMX plus placebo also had about a 40% lower chance of switching to the second-line regimen due to adverse drug reactions than did those given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline (HR 0.56, 0.3–0.85; p = 0.01; appendix).

### Sulfatrim [^1178D14i]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Information for patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension or other antibaceterial drugs in the future.

Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with and without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Procedures

The patients either stopped oral eradication treatment (12-week regimen) or continued treatment for another 8 weeks (20-week regimen). In cases where patients had received TMP-SMX plus doxycycline during the first 12 weeks of treatment, only TMP-SMX was continued for another 8 weeks.

After enrollment, we followed up patients at Week 8 and Months 4, 8, and 12. Patients who did not attend scheduled appointments were contacted by telephone. At each clinical visit, we undertook a clinical assessment. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood sugar, creatinine, electrolyte, and liver function tests were tested at enrollment and at Week 8. Drug compliance was assessed at enrollment and at Week 8 by pill counts and interviews by a study nurse. In the 20-week group, co-trimoxazole was stopped if patients developed severe adverse drug reactions or were unable to tolerate the drug, and the treatment was switched to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to complete 20 weeks of eradication treatment.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of the study was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis, which was defined as the new clinical presentation of infection, in association with at least 1 culture from any site positive for B. pseudomallei, within 1 year after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were overall recurrent melioidosis (culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis plus clinical recurrence), mortality, adverse drug reactions, and drug compliance. Clinical recurrent melioidosis was defined as the development of new symptoms and signs of infection that were consistent with melioidosis, but in the absence of a positive B. pseudomallei culture from any site. Adverse drug reactions were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. The secondary composite end point, combining overall recurrent melioidosis and mortality, was assessed in a post hoc analysis.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^112SyHHX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- **Porphyria**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- **Possible folate deficiency**: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.
- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides fo not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^114r1BjF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Folate Deficiency

Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma.

Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

Hemolysis

In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related.

Hypoglycemia

Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with BACTRIM are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of BACTRIM are particularly at risk.

Impaired Phenylalanine Metabolism

The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

Porphyria and Hypothyroidism

Like other drugs containing sulfonamides, BACTRIM can precipitate porphyria crisis and hypothyroidism. Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction.

Potential Risk in the Treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to BACTRIM in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of adverse reactions, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with BACTRIM therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for P. jirovecii pneumonia has been reported to be increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of BACTRIM in non-AIDS patients. If a patient develops skin rash, fever, leukopenia or any sign of adverse reaction, reevaluate benefit-risk of continuing therapy or re-challenge with BACTRIM (see WARNINGS).

Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia (see WARNINGS).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus doxycycline as oral eradicative treatment for melioidosis (MERTH): a multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^116KC9Af]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes and data management

The primary outcome of the study was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis, which was defined as the development of new symptoms and signs of infection in association with at least one culture from any site positive for B pseudomallei at any time between enrolment and study completion. Secondary endpoints were overall recurrent melioidosis (culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis plus clinical recurrence), mortality, treatment failure, extension of treatment, and adverse drug reactions. The published protocol contains an error and states that mortality was a primary rather than a secondary outcome measure (appendix). Clinical recurrence was defined as the development of new symptoms and signs of infection that were consistent with melioidosis but in the absence of a positive B pseudomallei culture from any site. Treatment failure was defined as the clinical decision to change oral treatment as a result of inadequate response. Extension of treatment was defined as a decision by the treating physician to continue the study drug beyond 20 weeks. Adverse drug reactions were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.

Genotyping and definition of relapse and re-infection

We compared B pseudomallei isolated on enrolment and at the recurrent episode using a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing, as described previously. Relapse and re-infection were defined on the basis of bacterial typing. Isolates from the same patient with an identical banding pattern on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were considered to be from the same strain and these patients were classified as having had a relapse. Isolates from the same patient that differed by one or more bands were further examined with multilocus sequence typing. Isolates from the same patient with a different sequence type were classified as representing re-infection, whereas those with an identical sequence type were classified as being a relapse.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) [^111csPny]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF SULFONAMIDES, ALTHOUGH RARE, HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO SEVERE REACTIONS, INCLUDING STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, FULMINANT HEPATIC NECROSIS, AGRANULOCYTOSIS, APLASTIC ANEMIA AND OTHER BLOOD DYSCRASIAS.

SULFONAMIDES, INCLUDING SULFONAMIDE-CONTAINING PRODUCTS SUCH AS SULFAMETHOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM, SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF SKIN RASH OR ANY SIGN OF ADVERSE REACTION. In rare instances, a skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis, and serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, sore throat, fever, arthralgia, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates are hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in association with sulfonamide treatment.

Thrombocytopenia

Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group alpha beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced vitamin K deficiency [^115UBcK8]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

There is a well-known association between vitamin K deficiency and haemorrhagic events including gastrointestinal bleeding. There is also a well-known association between both poor dietary intake of vitamin K and chronic antibiotic use and the development of vitamin K deficiency. Although the medical literature notes that cephalosporin antibiotics have a propensity to cause vitamin K deficiency due to the molecular structure of the medications and their ability to suppress the synthesis of clotting factors, there are other antibiotics that have also been implicated in the development of vitamin K deficiency. There are very few reports of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole causing vitamin K deficiency and further leading to bleeding episodes. We present such a case and discuss the risk factors leading to such complications.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^113bHcUU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast milk are approximately 2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus.

Pediatric Use

BACTRIM is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections).

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. BACTRIM Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. BACTRIM DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.

Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics).

### Randomized, double-blind, controlled study of cefoperazone-sulbactam plus cotrimoxazole versus ceftazidime plus cotrimoxazole for the treatment of severe melioidosis [^1152tEZf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective randomized, double-blind, controlled study of cefoperazone-sulbactam (ratio, 1:1; cefoperazone 25 mg/kg/day) plus cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMZ] at a ratio of 80:400; TMP, 8 mg/kg/day) versus ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/day) plus cotrimoxazole (TMP, 8 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of severe melioidosis. Of 219 patients enrolled in the study, 102 (47%) had culture-proven melioidosis. These patients were assigned randomly to 2 treatment groups, each with 50 patients (2 patients were excluded). Mortality rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups: 18% in the cefoperazone-sulbactam group versus 14% in the ceftazidime group. The crude difference in the mortality rate was 4%, but when adjusted for type of infection the difference was 0.9% (95% confidence interval, -3.6% to 5.4%; p = 0.696). The duration of defervescence and the bacteriological response of successfully treated patients were similar in both groups, and both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Cefoperazone-sulbactam plus cotrimoxazole might be used as an alternative to ceftazidime plus cotrimoxazole as treatment for severe melioidosis.

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions

Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions of the Respiratory Tract

Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment.

Respiratory Failure

Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days to week of BACTRIM initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products.

Circulatory Shock

Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM, in patients with history of recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions

BACTRIM should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in patients treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver enzyme and coagulation abnormalities. If HLH is suspected, discontinue BACTRIM immediately and institute appropriate management.

WARNINGS

FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF
SULFONAMIDES, ALTHOUGH RARE, HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO SEVERE REACTIONS, INCLUDING
STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, FULMINANT HEPATIC
NECROSIS, AGRANULOCYTOSIS, APLASTIC ANEMIA AND OTHER BLOOD DYSCRASIAS.

SULFONAMIDES, INCLUDING SULFONAMIDE-CONTAINING PRODUCTS SUCH
AS SULFAMETHOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM, SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE
OF SKIN RASH OR ANY SIGN OF ADVERSE REACTION. In rare instances, a skin
rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis, and serious blood

disorders (see PRECAUTIONS). Clinical signs,
such as rash, sore throat, fever, arthralgia, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be
early indications of serious reactions.

Cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates are
hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in
association with sulfonamide treatment.

The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic
streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate
the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic
fever.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD)
has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea
to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of
the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which
contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as
these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require
colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea
following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has
been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial
agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed
against C. difficile may need to be discontinued.
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation,
antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical
evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^114ncBJf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

BACTRIM, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).

The presence of BACTRIM may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole; equivalent to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day).

Mutagenesis

In vitro reverse mutation bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was negative. In in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities.

Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay and in in vitro micronucleus assays using cultured human lymphocytes.

Trimethoprim alone was negative in in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assays and in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays with Chinese Hamster ovary or lung cells with or without S9 activation. In in vitro Comet, micronucleus and chromosomal damage assays using cultured human lymphocytes, trimethoprim was positive. In mice following oral administration of trimethoprim, no DNA damage in Comet assays of liver, kidney, lung, spleen, or bone marrow was recorded.

Impairment of Fertility

No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given oral dosages as high as 350 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole plus 70 mg/kg/day trimethoprim, doses roughly two times the recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis.

### Management of subcutaneous abscesses: prospective cross-sectional study (MAGIC) [^114TVJNM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Whilst the use of antibiotics after surgical drainage is not routine in the UK, their use was advocated in a practice recommendation published in 2018. This drew on a systematic review of 14 RCTs, demonstrating modest benefits with oral agents, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin. The data demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrence at 1 month (OR 0.48, 95% c.i. 0.30 to 0.77 (moderate quality)), as well as a reduction in re-hospitalization (OR 0.55, 95% c.i. 0.32 to 0.94 (moderate quality)). Conversely, the review showed that antibiotics increased gastrointestinal side effects (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: OR 1.28, 95% c.i. 1.04 to 1.58 (moderate quality); and clindamycin: OR 2.29, 95% c.i. 1.35 to 3.88 (high quality)), including the incidence of diarrhoea. In the present study, approximately half of all patients received antibiotics after surgery, with many receiving antibiotics for greater than or equal to 3 days. The modest benefits conferred by these antibiotics should be weighed carefully against potential harms of side effects and the societal impact of antimicrobial resistance.

We report a case of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura occurring as an allergic response to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy (Bactrim, Septra) in a Jehovah's Witness patient. The patient presented with fulminant microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia within 48 hr of initiating therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Other symptoms of drug hypersensitivity included nausea, vomiting, urticarial rash, and leukopenia. Because of her religious faith, the patient was supported without plasma therapy with use of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, rituximab, and erythropoietin.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was fever clearance time (FCT): that is, the time from the first dose of the study drug until a temperature of ≤ 37.5°C was recorded for at least 48 hours.

The secondary endpoint was treatment failure, defined as the occurrence of at least 1 of the following events: FCT > 7 days (168 hours) after treatment initiation; clinical failure and requirement for rescue treatment as judged by the study physician and the attending physician; blood culture positive for S. Typhi or paratyphoid fever on day 7 of treatment (microbiological failure); culture-confirmed or syndromic enteric fever relapse within 28 days of initiation of treatment; development of any complication (eg, clinically significant bleeding, decline in Glasgow Coma Scale, perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, and need for hospital admission within 28 days after the initiation of treatment). The time to treatment failure was defined as the time from the first dose of treatment until the date of the earliest failure event. Adverse events were also secondary endpoints and defined as grade 3/4 adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of any grade leading to modification of study drug dose, or interruption/early discontinuation.

Patients who met the criteria for treatment failure were given intravenous ceftriaxone 60 mg/kg once daily (maximum dose 2 g/day) for 7 days if they had culture-confirmed enteric fever. Those with sterile blood cultures were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone 60 mg/kg once daily (maximum dose 2 g/day) and oral doxycycline (4 mg/kg/day) in 2 divided doses (maximum 200 mg/day) for 7 days.

WARNINGS

FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF SULFONAMIDES, ALTHOUGH RARE, HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO SEVERE REACTIONS, INCLUDING STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, FULMINANT HEPATIC NECROSIS, AGRANULOCYTOSIS, APLASTIC ANEMIA AND OTHER BLOOD DYSCRASIAS.

SULFONAMIDES, INCLUDING SULFONAMIDE-CONTAINING PRODUCTS SUCH AS SULFAMETHOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM, SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF SKIN RASH OR ANY SIGN OF ADVERSE REACTION. In rare instances, a skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis and serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, sore throat, fever, arthralgia, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates are hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in association with sulfonamide treatment.

Thrombocytopenia

Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

The sulfonamides should not be used for the treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antiobiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Intestinal microbiology and urinary tract infection associated risk in long-term aged care residents [^116kaEb4]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Participant data and UTI history

Participant data, including medication use, healthcare service utilisation (including pathology services), and comorbidities, were derived from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), and Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) assessment, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).

UTI was defined as pyuria (> 10 white blood cells per µL) and growth of > 10 4 of a single or mixed pathogen/s, and/or prescription of a medication used exclusively in the treatment of UTIs, including trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin and/or methenamine hippurate. Other antibiotics were characterised by exposure to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, azithromycin, cefaclor, cefalexin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, flucloxacillin, metronidazole, norfloxacin, roxithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Urosepsis was defined as bacteraemia with the same pathogen as cultured in urine culture during the same episode of care.

Stool DNA extraction

All stool was collected and stored using Norgen Stool Nucleic Acid Collection and Preservation Tubes (Norgen Biotek, ON, Canada) as outlined in the Supplementary Methods. DNA was extracted using the Powerlyzer PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's specifications.

### Rifaximin: a new treatment for travelers' diarrhea [^115o4Ptz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions and precautions, and dosing recommendations of rifaximin, a new nonabsorbed antimicrobial agent for travelers' diarrhea.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-July 2004) was conducted to extract human and animal research data in the English language on rifaximin.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were reviewed and included to evaluate the efficacy of rifaximin in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Data Synthesis

Rifaximin is approved for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea in patients ≥ 12 years of age with diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli. Rifaximin was superior to placebo and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and equivalent to ciprofloxacin in the primary clinical endpoint of the time to the last unformed stool passed.

Conclusions

Rifaximin is a viable alternative to ciprofloxacin for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea. As rifaximin is not systemically absorbed, it offers the advantage of leading to the development of less resistance compared with systemically absorbed antibiotics, in addition to fewer systemic adverse effects and drug interactions. However, the potential for cross-resistance between rifaximin and rifampin, as well as with other classes of antibiotics, is of concern and needs to be elucidated.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^111WQ8x7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding epidemiology and definitions — acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for ~20% of all cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually leads to hospital admission with invasive diagnostic evaluations, and consumes significant medical resources. Although most patients with acute LGIB stop bleeding spontaneously and have favorable outcomes, morbidity and mortality are increased in older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions. An individual with acute LGIB classically presents with the sudden onset of hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed per rectum), although in rare cases patients with bleeding from the cecum/right colon can present with melena (black, tarry stools), and hematochezia can be seen in patients with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Approximately 15% of patients with presumed LGIB are ultimately found to have an upper GI source for their bleeding, and for the purposes of this guideline, we define LGIB as the onset of hematochezia originating from either the colon or the rectum.

### Transient psychosis in an immune-competent patient after oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration [^1122XfGz]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

We describe a rare adverse reaction to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; Septra, Bactrim) in an immune-competent female adolescent. She was prescribed TMP-SMX for a urinary tract infection, which she had developed while being treated in the hospital for an extensive leg cellulitis. Shortly after receiving her third dose of TMP-SMX, she developed an acute altered mental status with agitation as well as vivid visual and auditory hallucinations. After prompt discontinuation of TMP-SMX, the patient slowly began to improve and was able to return to her baseline mental status within 10 days. No residual mental status changes were present. Despite the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, TMP-SMX, one of the first-generation broad-spectrum antibiotics, continues to be widely prescribed, in part because of its low cost and its easy availability. It is generally well tolerated and is associated with relatively few adverse effects. More common toxicities associated with TMP-SMX include hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, and gastrointestinal side effects. Central nervous system toxicity is very rare; when reported, it has been in an immune-compromised or an elderly patient.

Antimicrobial Drug Treatments

The clinical management of melioidosis usually consists of 2 phases: an intensive phase consisting of intravenous meropenem or ceftazidime for a minimum of 14 days, then an eradication phase of oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for a minimum of 12 weeks. Case-patient 1 received intravenous ceftazidime for 14 days, then TMP/SMX. However, 9 days after commencing TMP/SMX, a widespread, erythematous, pruritic rash developed (Figure 5, panel A). Her antibiotics were ceased, and her rash improved after 5 days. Case 2 also had an adverse reaction to TMP/SMX (Figure 5, panel B). The remaining cases also had adverse reactions to TMP/SMX, necessitating cessation of the drug and prompting an investigation of the adverse drug event (Figure 1).

As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advisable in patients

Use in the
Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia in Patients with
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side
effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase
(transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS
patients who are being treated for Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with
the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. The incidence of hyperkalemia appears to be
increased in AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Adverse
effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of
subsequent secondary prophylaxis.6However, if a patient
develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS).

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with Pneumocystis carini i pneumonia, induces aprogressive but
reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of
patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when
trimethoprim is administered topatients with underlying disorders of potassium
metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia
are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in
these patients.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured
to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone
to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and metronidazole were used for 14 days to treat 20 children with small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO was diagnosed using the lactulose hydrogen breath test. The breath test was repeated 1 month after treatment, and 19 (95.0%) of 20 children showed no evidence of SIBO (P < 0.001). The area under the individual curves showed that children with SIBO exhibited greater hydrogen production before treatment in both the first hour and between 60 and 180 minutes after the breath test. The treatment did not decrease methane production. In conclusion, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and metronidazole was effective in treating children with SIBO.

### Outcomes of patients with melioidosis treated with cotrimoxazole alone for eradication therapy [^116e6sVB]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed a 10-year experience of administration of cotrimoxazole alone in 31 patients compared with 109 patients who received conventional eradication therapy (cotrimoxazole plus doxycycline). The baseline characteristics, the clinical manifestations, the initial intravenous antibiotic treatments, and the mean duration of eradication therapy between the two groups were similar. The culture-confirmed recurrences among the patients who received cotrimoxazole alone and those who received the conventional regimen were not significantly different (1/31 [3.2%] versus 5/109 [4.5% odds ratio = 0.69 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08–6.17]). Gastrointestinal side effects were more common among the conventional regimen group (28/109 [25.7%] versus 2/31 [6.5%], P = 0.02) and the proportion of patients who could complete at least 20 weeks of therapy without having switched to the other regimen was significantly lower (91/109 [83.5%] versus 31/31 [100.0%] P = 0.01). Cotrimoxazole alone is as effective as and better tolerated than cotrimoxazole plus doxycycline for the eradication treatment of melioidosis.

### Effectiveness of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for children with chronic active otitis media: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115e84Wz]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to determine the clinical effectiveness of prolonged outpatient treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for children with chronic active otitis media.

Methods

We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 101 children (1–12 years of age) with chronic active otitis media (defined as otorrhea for ≥ 12 weeks). In addition to a short course of steroid and antibiotic eardrops, children were assigned randomly to receive 6 to 12 weeks of orally administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (18 mg/kg, 2 times per day) or placebo and were monitored for 1 year.

Results

At 6 weeks, 28% of children in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group and 53% of children in the placebo group had otomicroscopic signs of otorrhea. At 12 weeks, these values were 32% and 47%, respectively. At 1 year, the numbers of children with otorrhea were similar in the 2 groups (25% and 20%, respectively). One child in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group developed a skin rash. Vomiting or diarrhea was reported for 9% of the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group and 2% of the placebo group. Pure-tone hearing levels and health-related quality of life improved during the study but did not differ between the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group and the placebo group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacteria in the otorrhea samples from both groups.

Conclusions

A 6- to 12-week course of high-dose, orally administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy is beneficial for children with chronic active otitis media. The treatment effect is most pronounced with the shorter course and disappears if administration of the medication is discontinued.

He had received several courses of antibiotics from various hospitals but continued to have recurrent episodes of loose stools. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 months earlier and was currently on anti-retroviral therapy. On physical examination, he was dehydrated and emaciated and had pallor with temporal and supraclavicular hollowing. His sodium and potassium were 136.4 mmol/L (reference range: 135–145) and 2.75 mmol/L (reference range: 3.4–4.8), respectively. He was administered intravenous fluids, and hypokalemia was aggressively replenished. His CD4 cell count was 270 cells/mm 3.

The stool sample of the patient was sent for microscopic examination, which revealed Cystoisospora belli oocysts. The immature (unsporulated) and mature (sporulated) forms of the oocysts were seen in the wet mount (Figure 1A–C) and by modified acid-fast staining (Figure 1D–E) microscopy. He was started on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (160/800 mg) four times daily. The patient responded to the treatment and the diarrhea was resolved.

Cystoisospora belli infection occurs by ingestion of water or food contaminated with oocysts. It causes chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. The stool examination may show the various forms of the oocysts — immature unsporulated (Figure 1A, B, D, and E) or mature sporulated oocysts (Figure 1C and F). Cystoisosporiasis is treated with TMP-SMX. However, relapse is common in patients with HIV who may require long-term maintenance therapy with TMP-SMX. Thus, follow-up of such patients is essential.

### Interventions for preventing diarrhoea-associated haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^1122Gcon]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a common cause of acquired kidney failure in children and rarely in adults. The most important risk factor for development of HUS is a gastrointestinal infection by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). This review addressed the interventions aimed at secondary prevention of HUS in patients with diarrhoea who were infected with a bacteria that increase the risk of HUS.

Objectives

Our objective was to evaluate evidence regarding secondary preventative strategies for HUS associated with STEC infections. In doing so, we sought to assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions as well as their potential to impact the morbidity and death associated with this condition.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 12 November 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Studies were considered based on the methods, participants, and research goals. Only randomised controlled trials were considered eligible for inclusion. The participants of the studies were paediatric and adult patients with diarrhoeal illnesses due to STEC. The primary outcome of interest was incidence of HUS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We identified four studies (536 participants) for inclusion that investigated four different interventions including antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), anti-Shiga toxin antibody-containing bovine colostrum, Shiga toxin binding agent (Synsorb Pk: a silicon dioxide-based agent), and a monoclonal antibody against Shiga toxin (urtoxazumab). The overall risk of bias was unclear for selection, performance and detection bias and low for attrition, reporting and other sources of bias. It was uncertain if trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduced the incidence of HUS compared to no treatment (47 participants: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11–2.81, very low certainty evidence). Adverse events relative to this review, need for acute dialysis, neurological complication and death were not reported. There were no incidences of HUS in either the bovine colostrum group or the placebo group. It was uncertain if bovine colostrum caused more adverse events (27 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.03; very low certainty evidence). The need for acute dialysis, neurological complications or death were not reported. It is uncertain whether Synsorb Pk reduces the incidence of HUS compared to placebo (353 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.22; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events relevant to this review, need for acute dialysis, neurological complications or death were not reported. One study compared two doses of urtoxazumab (3.0 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) to placebo. It is uncertain if either 3.0 mg/kg urtoxazumab (71 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.14) or 1.0 mg/kg urtoxazumab (74 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.13) reduced the incidence of HUS compared to placebo (very low certainty evidence). Low certainty evidence showed there may be little or no difference in the number of treatment-emergent adverse events with either 3.0 mg/kg urtoxazumab (71 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18) or 1.0 mg/kg urtoxazumab (74 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.13) compared to placebo. There were 25 serious adverse events reported in 18 patients: 10 in the placebo group, and 9 and 6 serious adverse events in the 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg urtoxazumab groups, respectively. It is unclear how many patients experienced these adverse events in each group, and how many patients experienced more than one event. It is uncertain if either dose of urtoxazumab increased the risk of neurological complications or death (very low certainty evidence). Need for acute dialysis was not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies assessed antibiotics, bovine milk, and Shiga toxin inhibitor (Synsorb Pk) and monoclonal antibodies (Urtoxazumab) against Shiga toxin for secondary prevention of HUS in patients with diarrhoea due to STEC. However, no firm conclusions about the efficacy of these interventions can be drawn given the small number of included studies and the small sample sizes of those included studies. Additional studies, including larger multicentre studies, are needed to assess the efficacy of interventions to prevent development of HUS in patients with diarrhoea due to STEC infection.

Diagnostics — suspected outbreaks: A broader set of bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents should be considered regardless of the presence of fever, bloody or mucoid stools, or other markers of more severe illness in the context of a possible outbreak of diarrheal illness, and selection of agents for testing should be based on a combination of host and epidemiologic risk factors and ideally in coordination with public health authorities (strong, moderate).

### Sulfamethoxazole-induced sulfamethoxazole urolithiasis: a case report [^112xLYku]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug-induced kidney stones account for up to 2% of all urinary tract calculi. Typically, these drugs fall into one of two categories: (1) drugs that have high renal excretion and are poorly soluble in urine; and (2) drugs that induce metabolic changes that favor urinary stone formation. Drugs in the first category, or metabolites thereof, are identified as components of calculi whereas drugs in the second category lead to formation of calcium- and/or uric acid-containing stones. Select drugs within the drug-containing calculi category, including the antihypertensive diuretic triamterene and the nonsteroidal analgesic glafenine, are now used less frequently due to their lithogenic potential; others continue to be used due to their treatment efficacy — these include indinavir and other protease inhibitors used in the treatment of HIV. Metabolically-induced calculi containing calcium can be caused by hypercalciuria from excessive calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Other metabolism-altering drugs, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. acetazolamide, topiramate) contribute to calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stone formation by dramatically lowering urinary citrate excretion. Because they significantly raise urine pH, the risk for calcium phosphate stones in particular is increased. Uric acid-containing metabolic calculi can be induced by laxative abuse or by uricosuric agents such as benzbromarone used to treat gout.

Several antimicrobial agents are associated with urinary tract calculi. Some act by altering the gut microbiome and its ability to degrade oxalate, leading to the formation of hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate stones. Others, especially when taken in large doses over a long period of time, are known to form urinary crystals and calculi that contain the drug itself or its metabolite(s); these include ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and sulfonamides. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a combination antibiotic of the sulfonamide family used to treat a wide variety of commonly encountered infections, including those affecting the urinary tract, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal tract. It is also indicated in the treatment and prophylaxis of opportunistic infections by Pneumocystis carinii and Nocardia spp. While first-generation sulfonamides were well-known to provoke drug-induced urolithiasis, it is significantly less common with newer sulfonamides and even less common with TMP-SMX. Cases of sulfonamide urolithiasis occurring in patients with known stone disease have rarely been reported.

### Three new cases of melioidosis, Guadeloupe, French west indies [^114HC1L7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Melioidosis, caused by the telluric gram-negative rod Burkholderia pseudomallei, is endemic in Southeast Asia and northern Australia but may be underdiagnosed in other tropical regions. Increasing occurrences have been reported in the Caribbean during the past few decades among persons with no exposure to known endemic areas. Tropical environmental conditions and the presence of this bacterium in soil samples in the Caribbean support the plausibility of endemicity. We describe 3 new cases detected in Guadeloupe during 2016–2017.

Patient 1 was a 54-year-old man, receiving renal replacement therapy, with a history of hypertensive vascular nephropathy. He developed a pulmonary form of melioidosis in November 2016. Thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral nodular lesions. B. pseudomallei grew from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Treatment with ceftazidime (6 g/d intravenously) was given for 2 weeks and switched to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (320/1,600 mg 2×/d orally) for 1 month, then changed to doxycycline because rash developed. The patient complied poorly with treatment; he died in March 2017 under unknown circumstances.

Patient 2 was a 66-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, a subcutaneous abscess in the prepubic area surgically treated without microbiological identification (June 2016), a lumbar hematoma (March 2017), and bacteremic obstructive pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli (April 2017). In April 2017, she developed a severe and disseminated form of melioidosis with pneumonia, bacteremia, and deep abscess. CT scan showed multiple pulmonary nodes consistent with hematogenous pneumonia, a deep abscess between kidney and psoas, and splenic emboli. B. pseudomallei was isolated from blood cultures performed at admission and from the abscess. The patient developed multiple complications: acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic candidiasis, renal failure, hemodynamic failure, nonspecific encephalopathy, refractory septic shock related to catheter infection, and bacteremia caused by extended spectrum β-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the intensive care unit, she was treated with ceftazidime (6 g/d for 24 d), then with meropenem (1 g 3×/d) plus TMP/SMX (320/1,600 mg 2×/d). Blood cultures grew B. pseudomallei until day 40. The patient died on day 60 from multiple organ failure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample and Metadata Collection

Ethical approval was obtained from the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (BFC212/13). Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from mothers visiting the Cato Manor and Lancers Road Clinics in Durban, South Africa, for routine clinic appointments. Infants with birthweights > 2000 g born to HIV-infected mothers were included and followed for 1 year. Infants and their mothers had to be receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis prior to enrollment. Infants had to have a negative HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction result by COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 qualitative test prior to enrollment and their first sample collection timepoint at approximately 6 weeks of age. Infants were excluded if they had any illnesses, antibiotics (including cotrimoxazole), or traditional medicines, and all infants were exclusively breastfed. HEUs were randomized at their first timepoint (6-week) clinic visit to receive or not receive cotrimoxazole therapy. Cotrimoxazole was administered once daily during the study period; infants < 5 kg received 20 mg trimethoprim/100 mg sulfamethoxazole orally and infants 5–15 kg received 40 mg trimethoprim/200 mg sulfamethoxazole orally. Stool samples were collected from infants at 3 timepoints (6 weeks, 4 months, and 6 months). Fresh stool from plastic-lined diapers was transferred to 2 mL BD cryovials using disposable wooden sticks. Samples were frozen within 6–8 hours of collection and stored at −80°C until analysis as described previously by Dan et al and Agapova et al. Two hundred thirteen stool specimens were collected from 70 infants during the study. Infants with an initial 6-week stool and at least 1 subsequent sample (63 infants) were shotgun-sequenced and included.

Metagenomic DNA Extraction

PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories) was used to extract metagenomic DNA from approximately 150 mg of each stool sample. Manufacturer protocol was used with minor modifications for sample lysis: 2 rounds of 2 minutes of bead beating at 2.5 k oscillations per minute for 2 minutes followed by 1 minute on ice and 2 additional minutes of beadbeating using a Mini-Beadbeater 24 (Biospec Products). DNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer dsDNA HS Assay (Invitrogen) and stored at −20°C.

### Conducting randomized controlled trials for the treatment of enteric fever [^113Kzmj9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

It is also difficult to accurately diagnose enteric fever, and blood culture is positive in only 40%–60% of presumptive cases. There indeed must have been other travelers returning from Nepal who had similar clinical features and needed the same courses of antimicrobials but whose blood cultures did not grow any organism. The proper identification of the subset of culture-negative patients is also immensely important. Given the good surveillance system in Israel, the report would have been more informative if the authors had included these patients as well.

Discussion

Sulfhemoglobin is an abnormally altered hemoglobin molecule with a green pigment, and reports of sulfhemoglobinemia date back to the very beginning of the twentieth century. Sulfhemoglobinemia is a rare entity, and there are no estimates of population-level incidence in the literature. Early reports from the first half of the twentieth century linked sulfhemoglobinemia to nitro and amino compounds, specifically several compounds since removed from the market, including acetanilid and phenacetin (also called acetophenetidin). More recently, sulfhemoglobinemia has been associated with phenazopyridine, modern sulfonamides such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dapsone, and metoclopramide, as well as toxins such as hydroxylamine sulfate. A list of implicated drugs was recently published by Rangan et al.

Normal hemoglobin is composed of globin molecules and a heme group, which contains an iron molecule surrounded by a porphyrin ring. The iron usually exists in the reduced (Fe 2+) state, and oxidative stress can oxidize iron from the reduced to the oxidized state (Fe 3+) to produce methemoglobinemia. Sulfhemoglobin results when a sulfur atom becomes incorporated into the porphyrin ring. Some offending agents may themselves contain sulfur, but hydrogen sulfide-producing gut flora or glutathione may serve as the sulfur source in some patients.

The presentation is dominated by cyanosis and fatigue without dyspnea. In 1907, West and Clarke described a 37-year-old woman with a "leaden hue, resembling in tint that of silver staining, which made her look when asleep as if she was moribund". In 1948, Finch noted that normal whole blood becomes bright red over time as the hemoglobin molecules bind oxygen, and a persistent dark shade suggests a dyshemoglobinemia. By the mid-twentieth century, it was known that sulfhemoglobin causes cyanosis at a much lower concentration (only 0.5 g/dL) compared with methemoglobin (1.5 g/dL) and deoxyhemoglobin (5.0 g/dL). Notably, patients do not usually exhibit signs of respiratory distress, and the results of cardiopulmonary examination are classically unremarkable. When the microbiome is involved in the generation of sulfur, constipation may be another presenting symptom.

### Case report: molecular diagnosis of cystoisospora belli in a severely immunocompromised patient with HIV and kaposi sarcoma [^115xaVTs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea in an immunocompromised patient has a broad infectious differential. Diagnosis is difficult despite advances in diagnostic modalities. We report a case of a 45-year-old Nigerian woman who immigrated to the United States 2 years ago. She presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding, newly diagnosed HIV, and disseminated Kaposi sarcoma. During hospitalization, the patient had an onset of watery diarrhea and high eosinophilia. Subsequent stool analysis using multi-parallel real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 13 parasites was positive for Cystoisospora belli. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but had relapsed disease when her antibiotics were stopped prematurely. After restarting trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, her diarrhea and eosinophilia improved, and she had undetectable Cystoisospora belli DNA on repeat stool quantitative polymerase chain reaction. This case highlights the importance of a thorough workup for diarrhea, including parasites, especially for immunocompromised patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients with Cystoisospora belli and HIV/AIDS.

### Two cases of bacteriemia caused by nontoxigenic, non-O1, non-O139 Vibrio cholerae isolates in Ho chi minh city, Vietnam [^114cngAJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

TABLE 1
Initial laboratory test results of two patients withnon-O1, non-O139 bacteremia

An aerobic BacT/Alert bottle was used for a blood culture and incubated in a Bactec 9240 system (Becton Dickinson). The contents of the incubated bottle became positive after 12 h. A Gram stain on the positive BacT/Alert bottle revealed small curved Gram-negative bacilli, which were subcultured onto blood and MacConkey agar plates. The colonies displayed hemolysis on the blood agar plates and were oxidase positive. API20E and VITEK2 identification (bioMérieux, France) confirmed the organism to be. Results of slide agglutination tests performed with polyvalent O1 and O139 antisera were negative. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion, and the results were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The isolate was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline and susceptible to chloramphenicol, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone. The patient became afebrile after 2 days of ceftriaxone treatment, and yet the antimicrobial therapy was continued, with the other treatments, for an additional 8 days. The patient was ultimately discharged after 24 days of hospitalization.

In July 2013, a 73-year-old man was admitted to HTD with fever and confusion. He had been diagnosed with severe cirrhosis due to hepatitis C infection in a private health care facility 4 years previously and was actively receiving an unspecified treatment regimen. He had been unwell for 4 days with fever and constipation. Initial examination on the day of admission to hospital revealed the man to be thin, pale, and icteric, with peripheral edema and spider angiomata. His pulse was 97 bpm, his blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg, and his respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. He was febrile, with a temperature of 39°C. His mental state was confused, and he was somnolent and had amnesia. A chest X-ray suggested that the patient had pneumonia, and an abdominal examination showed marked ascites with tenderness. An abdominal ultrasound revealed large amount of ascitic fluid and splenomegaly. A bacterial infection was suspected; therefore, the patient was prescribed 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone/day, along with metronidazole (250 mg/day), furosemide (25 mg/day), and lactulose.

A 9-year-old girl without chronic medical conditions is brought to the emergency department for a complaint of diffuse abdominal pain and new-onset diffuse abdominal blue discoloration of the skin. She was diagnosed 11 days previously as having a urinary tract infection after 2. 5 weeks of dysuria and completed a 7-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with resolution of symptoms. She has no history of allergies or reaction with previous courses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. On waking the morning of presentation she noticed that her abdomen was bluish in color with diffuse abdominal pain, spreading and intensifying in color throughout the day. The discoloration spread to her back and thighs, with associated spread of pain. The discoloration spares the skin folds and underwear lines. She denies any history of trauma, fevers, nausea/vomiting, upper respiratory tract symptoms, or other rashes.
