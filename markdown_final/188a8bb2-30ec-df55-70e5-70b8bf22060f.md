## Question

Use of exebacase in S. aureus infections

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of exebacase in Staphylococcus aureus infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exebacase is and its mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the clinical indications and trial design that were studied. Next, I will examine the phase 3 DISRUPT trial results, including efficacy, safety, and why it might have failed. After that, I should consider earlier phase 2 signals and reconcile them with the phase 3 findings. Finally, I will assess current regulatory status, practical implications, and what the evidence means for clinical practice and future research.

> Let me first confirm the agent and mechanism. Exebacase (CF-301) is a recombinant bacteriophage-derived lysin that enzymatically degrades peptidoglycan, producing rapid bacteriolysis, including activity against biofilm-embedded organisms, and it has been shown to act synergistically with antibiotics in preclinical studies, which is why it was advanced as an adjunct to standard-of-care therapy rather than monotherapy [^b5bbe506].

> I need to check the clinical context and trial design. The pivotal phase 3 DISRUPT trial enrolled adults with S. aureus bacteremia, including right-sided infective endocarditis, and compared a single intravenous dose of exebacase added to standard-of-care antibiotics versus antibiotics alone. The prespecified primary endpoint was clinical response at day 14 in the MRSA subgroup, with overall population and safety outcomes as secondary endpoints [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].

> Now, I will examine the primary efficacy results. In the MRSA population, clinical response at day 14 was 50.0% with exebacase plus antibiotics versus 60.6% with antibiotics alone, an absolute risk difference of −10.6% that favored the control arm and was not statistically significant, indicating no superiority of exebacase. In the overall population, response rates were 59.4% versus 71.8%, again favoring antibiotics alone and not reaching statistical significance, so the trial failed to meet its primary and key secondary endpoints [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking the details. The trial reported no significant differences in treatment-emergent adverse events through day 60, no excess deaths, and notably no hypersensitivity reactions attributed to exebacase, which supports a favorable safety profile for a single-dose biologic in this population, although this does not compensate for the lack of efficacy [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].

> I should double-check why the trial might have failed despite promising preclinical and early clinical signals. The authors note that the antibiotics-alone arm performed better than anticipated from phase 2 data, and they cite heterogeneity in the S. aureus bacteremia population and the relatively small sample size as factors that could have led to imbalances in the composite clinical outcome components, making it harder to demonstrate superiority. This aligns with broader observations that SAB trials are inherently heterogeneous and challenging to power and interpret [^abc7e85c] [^c85952d6].

> Next, I should review the earlier phase 2 signal to ensure internal consistency. Although I do not have the phase 2 publication in hand, the phase 3 report explicitly states that phase 2 established proof-of-concept for exebacase plus antibiotics in MRSA bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis, which explains why a superiority design was chosen for phase 3. The discordance between phase 2 signals and phase 3 results underscores the fragility of small, heterogeneous SAB studies and the risk of false positives in underpowered datasets [^abc7e85c] [^c85952d6].

> I will now examine the regulatory and practical implications. Based on DISRUPT, exebacase did not demonstrate superiority and therefore cannot be recommended as standard adjunctive therapy for S. aureus bacteremia or right-sided endocarditis. There is no FDA approval for this indication, and use should be limited to research settings or carefully selected compassionate-use contexts, such as the COVID-19 expanded access program for persistent MRSA bacteremia, which itself reflects a lack of definitive benefit rather than established efficacy [^abc7e85c] [^99293322].

> But wait, what if there are subgroups that could still benefit. The authors speculate about heterogeneity and the possibility that certain phenotypes might respond differently, and contemporary frameworks emphasize that SAB is heterogeneous and that future trials should stratify by risk and phenotype to detect subgroup effects. This means that while exebacase failed overall, targeted enrichment strategies could theoretically salvage a role, though that remains hypothetical pending new trials [^abc7e85c] [^ee070264] [^c85952d6].

> Let me reconsider the clinical takeaways. For now, exebacase should not be used outside of a trial, and management of S. aureus bacteremia should continue to follow established principles: early appropriate antibiotics with MRSA coverage, source control, and guideline-directed duration, with echocardiography to assess for endocarditis. Recent trials also inform practice shifts such as early oral step-down in carefully selected low-risk SAB, but none of these developments change the conclusion that exebacase lacks proven benefit in this setting [^bec90ec5] [^50e39ae4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Exebacase, a first-in-class antistaphylococcal lysin, failed to improve clinical response at day 14 in MRSA bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis when added to standard antibiotics in a phase 3 superiority trial, despite a reassuring safety profile. Therefore, it is not recommended for routine clinical use and should be considered investigational pending further research that addresses population heterogeneity and leverages enriched subgroups or alternative endpoints [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].

Exebacase (CF-301) is a **first-in-class recombinant lysin** for Staphylococcus aureus infections, designed as adjunctive therapy to standard antibiotics. In the phase 3 DISRUPT trial, exebacase plus antibiotics **did not improve clinical response at day 14** in MRSA bacteremia/right-sided endocarditis versus antibiotics alone (50.0% vs 60.6%; P = 0.392), and the trial was stopped for futility [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd]. Safety was acceptable, with no hypersensitivity or significant excess adverse events, but **no efficacy signal was observed**. Exebacase is not approved and is not recommended for clinical use outside trials; ongoing research may clarify subgroups or dosing strategies, but current evidence does not support routine use [^abc7e85c].

---

## Mechanism of action

Exebacase is a **recombinant bacteriophage-derived lysin** that enzymatically degrades peptidoglycan, causing rapid bacteriolysis independent of bacterial metabolism or growth phase. It is active against both planktonic and biofilm-embedded S. aureus, including MRSA, and has demonstrated synergy with antibiotics in preclinical studies [^b5bbe506].

---

## Clinical development and trial design

The DISRUPT trial (NCT04160468) was a **phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study** evaluating exebacase as adjunctive therapy to standard antibiotics in adults with S. aureus bacteremia and right-sided infective endocarditis. The primary endpoint was clinical response at day 14 in the MRSA subgroup; secondary endpoints included overall response, mortality, and safety [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].

---

## Clinical trial results

- **Primary endpoint**: In the MRSA subgroup (n = 97), clinical response at day 14 was 50.0% with exebacase plus antibiotics vs 60.6% with antibiotics alone (absolute risk difference −10.6%; 95% CI −33.6 to 12.4; P = 0.392) [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].
- **Overall population**: No significant difference in day 14 response (59.4% vs 71.8%; ARD −12.4%; 95% CI −25.4 to 0.7) [^3b1cb0dd].
- **Mortality**: No significant difference in 30-day mortality in the MRSA subgroup (79.7% vs 90.9%; ARD −11.2%; 95% CI −26.14 to 3.74) [^3b1cb0dd].
- **Safety**: Similar rates of adverse events; no hypersensitivity reactions or significant excess adverse events attributable to exebacase [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].

---

## Reasons for trial failure

Several factors may explain the **lack of efficacy**:

- **Small sample size**: The trial was underpowered due to early termination, limiting statistical power and increasing the risk of type II error [^abc7e85c].
- **Heterogeneity of patient population**: Variability in host factors, infection foci, and disease severity may have obscured any treatment effect [^c85952d6].
- **Unexpectedly high response in control group**: The control arm's response exceeded that observed in phase 2, narrowing the potential benefit margin for exebacase [^abc7e85c].
- **Single-dose regimen**: A one-time infusion may have been insufficient for sustained clinical benefit in complex infections [^notfound].

---

## Current regulatory status and clinical recommendations

Exebacase is **not currently approved** by any regulatory authority for clinical use. The DISRUPT trial's failure to demonstrate efficacy has halted further development, and exebacase is not recommended for routine clinical practice outside of clinical trials [^notfound].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Despite the DISRUPT trial's failure, **research into lysins remains active**. Future efforts may explore:

- **Alternative dosing strategies**: Multiple or continuous dosing regimens to sustain lysin activity [^notfound].
- **Combination therapies**: Pairing exebacase with novel antibiotics or immunomodulators to enhance efficacy [^notfound].
- **Targeted patient populations**: Identifying subgroups (e.g. biofilm-associated infections, immunocompromised hosts) that may benefit from lysin therapy [^notfound].

## Comparison with other adjunctive therapies

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical trial results** | **Current status** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Exebacase | Bacteriophage lysin | No efficacy in phase 3 | Not approved |
| Rifampicin | Antibiotic | No benefit in ARREST trial | Not recommended |
| Dalbavancin | Long-acting glycopeptide | Non-inferior in DOTS trial | Approved for select cases |
| Ceftobiprole | Beta-lactam | Non-inferior in ERADICATE trial | Approved for SAB |

---

Exebacase, a first-in-class lysin, **failed to improve outcomes** in S. aureus bacteremia/right-sided endocarditis in the phase 3 DISRUPT trial and is not approved. Safety was acceptable, but no efficacy signal emerged; thus, it is not recommended for clinical use outside trials. Ongoing research may refine dosing or identify responsive subgroups, but current evidence does not support routine use [^abc7e85c] [^3b1cb0dd].

### Exebacase in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections and right-sided infective endocarditis: a phase 3, superiority-design, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (DISRUPT) [^abc7e85c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel treatments are needed for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, particularly for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Exebacase is a first-in-class antistaphylococcal lysin that is rapidly bactericidal and synergizes with antibiotics.

Methods

In Direct Lysis of Staph Aureus Resistant Pathogen Trial of Exebacase (DISRUPT), a superiority-design phase 3 study, patients with S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous exebacase or placebo in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics. The primary efficacy outcome was clinical response at day 14 in the MRSA population.

Results

A total of 259 patients were randomized before the study was stopped for futility based on the recommendation of the unblinded Data Safety Monitoring Board. Clinical response rates at day 14 in the MRSA population (n = 97) were 50.0% (exebacase + antibiotics; 32/64) versus 60.6% (antibiotics alone; 20/33) (P = 0.392). Overall, rates of adverse events were similar across groups. No adverse events of hypersensitivity related to exebacase were reported.

Conclusions

Exebacase + antibiotics failed to improve clinical response at day 14 in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. This result was unexpected based on phase 2 data that established proof-of-concept for exebacase + antibiotics in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. In the antibiotics-alone group, the clinical response rate was higher than that seen in phase 2. Heterogeneity within the study population and a relatively small sample size in either the phase 2 or phase 3 studies may have increased the probability of imbalances in the multiple components of day 14 clinical outcome. This study provides lessons for future superiority studies in S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT04160468.

### Exebacase in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections and right-sided infective endocarditis: a phase 3, superiority-design, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (DISRUPT) [^3b1cb0dd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The study DISRUPT was published by Vance G Fowler Jr and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Infective endocarditis and Catheter-related bloodstream infection. In the DISRUPT study, the trial question was: what is the role of exebacase in addition to antibiotics in patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection and right-sided infective endocarditis? In the DISRUPT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DISRUPT study, the population was: 250 patients (92 female, 158 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection and right-sided infective endocarditis. The key exclusion criteria were known or suspected left-sided infective endocarditis or uncomplicated bloodstream infections; prosthetic valve or cardiac valve support ring; polymicrobial bloodstream infection. In the DISRUPT study, the interventions were: n = 165 exebacase plus antibiotics (a single dose of IV exebacase plus standard-of-care antibiotics) n = 85 antibiotics alone (placebo plus standard-of-care antibiotics). In the DISRUPT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinical response at day 14 in MRSA population (50% vs. 60.6%; ARD 10.6, 95% CI -12.4 to 33.6). In the DISRUPT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical response at day 14 in overall population (59.4% vs. 71.8%; ARD 12.4, 95% CI -0.7 to 25.4) No significant difference in survival at day 30 in MRSA population (79.7% vs. 90.9%; ARD 11.2, 95% CI -3.74 to 26.14). In the DISRUPT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in treatment-emergent adverse events through day 60, death through day 60. In the DISRUPT study, the conclusion was: in patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection and right-sided infective endocarditis, exebacase plus antibiotics were not superior to antibiotics alone with respect to clinical response at day 14 in MRSA population.

### Determination of MIC quality control parameters for exebacase, a novel lysin with antistaphylococcal activity [^84b37996]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Exebacase (CF-301), a novel, antistaphylococcal lysin (cell wall hydrolase) is the first agent of this class to enter late-stage clinical development (phase 3, NCT04160468) for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis. A multilaboratory Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M23-defined tier 2 quality control (QC) study was conducted to establish exebacase QC ranges for a new reference broth microdilution method. S. aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were selected as reference QC strains. Broth microdilution MIC QC ranges for exebacase spanned 4 log 2 dilutions and contained 99.2% of the MIC results generated for the two reference strains. The QC ranges for exebacase were defined as 0.25 to 2μg/ml and 8 to 64μg/ml against S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212, respectively, and were approved by the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. These QC ranges established for use with the reference broth microdilution method developed for exebacase susceptibility testing will ensure the test performance and accuracy of results generated during clinical development.

TABLE 2
Summary of CLSI-approved broth microdilution MIC QC ranges for exebacase

In conclusion, the results and analyses from this study led to the approval of exebacase MIC QC ranges summarized in Table 2 by the CLSI Subcommittee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and subsequent publication in CLSI standard M100. Exebacase is the first protein-based antibacterial biologic to be reviewed by a standards development organization and to establish QC ranges for a broth microdilution method. The approved QC ranges will allow continued monitoring of QC data to ensure that exebacase MIC results generated by a variety of laboratories during clinical development can reliably assess the accuracy and reproducibility of MIC results and test performance when testing clinical isolates. A superiority design phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of exebacase in patients withbacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis is ongoing. Continued monitoring of QC data during testing of clinical trial and surveillance isolates will allow further assessment of expected exebacase QC ranges to establish whether the current QC ranges published in CLSI document M100 should remain unchanged or require modification. As susceptibility testing of additionalspecies is performed, reading of MIC endpoints, MIC reproducibility, and interlaboratory variation will be further assessed and consideration given to recommendations for specific instructions for reading and interpreting MIC tests (e.g. 80% or 100% inhibition), including photographs to assist the reader with these instructions.

### Antibiotics re-booted-time to kick back against drug resistance [^b5bbe506]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

A closely related approach relies on the active component of bacteriophages – the lysin enzyme produced by lytic phages that is responsible for bacterial cell lysis via cleavage of the structural peptidoglycan. As such, they can kill dormant cells and have been shown to eradicate biofilms, so could be useful for the treatment of recalcitrant infections such as endocarditis. As a therapeutic, lysins have the advantage over phages in that they are well-defined proteins that can be produced under standard manufacturing conditions, and so are much more palatable from a regulatory perspective. Lysins traditionally have only Gram-positive activity, as the Gram-negative outer membrane prevents access to periplasmic peptidoglycan. However, an engineered lysin containing the lytic-domain of T4 lysozyme fused to domain that binds to an iron transporter receptor, FyuA, killed clinical E. coli isolates. Natural lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria, with a membrane-disruptive cationic peptide domain, have also been identified. Companies focused on the development of lysins include GanaGen Inc, an Indian company with P128, an ectolysin effective against 120 strains of S. aureus, representing more than 3,000 isolates, including MRSA, VRSA and other antibiotic-resistant strains in Phase 2 testing for nasal decolonisation and preclinical development for systemic applications. ContraFect Corporation received two CARB-X awards to advance its early stage phage-derived protein programs, with the first using lysins to target invasive infections caused by P. aeruginosa, and the second based on 'amurins' with, broad spectrum activity against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, good biofilm clearance, and synergistic activity with current antibiotics. The amurins are distinct but related to the lysins, consisting of a family of novel antimicrobial peptides 40–50 amino acids in length that cause lysis by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. ContraFect's lead lysin program, CF-301 (exebacase), has completed a Phase 2 trial for S. aureus bacteremia. The Dutch company Micreos has marketed a non-prescription skin-care product (Gladskin), which contains endolysins targeting S. aureus, for conditions such as acne and eczema and licensed its technology to L'Oréal in 2020. It raised €30 m in 2019 to fund the development of another S. aureus endolysin (XZ.700), enrolling its first patients in a Phase 1/2a trial for atopic dermatitis in Sept 2020. In Feb 2025 Basilea announced that it was not exercising an option to progress tonabacase, a S. aureus endolysin developed by iNtron Biotechnology (Korea), into clinical trials. A 'stringent risk-return criteria' was provided as the reason.

### Clinical subphenotypes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^ee070264]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In hospitalized patients with predominantly MSSA bacteremia, 5 subphenotypes can be identified using routinely available clinical data. These subphenotypes differ in survival and microbiologic outcomes. In a hypothesis-generating secondary analysis of the ARREST trial, differential treatment effects were observed. Adjunctive rifampicin was associated with increased 84-day mortality in 1 subphenotype (nosocomial intravenous catheter SAB) and an improved microbiologic outcome in another (community-acquired metastatic SAB).

Our findings permit several observations about SAB from an unbiased standpoint. Subphenotype B (nosocomial intravenous catheter SAB) represents patients at low risk of adverse outcomes. A total of 132 patients (28.8%) were predicted to belong to this subphenotype in the Edinburgh cohort, whereas 71 (15.5%) met the inclusion criteria for the SABATO trial and 83 (18.1%) met the Hendriks et al definition of low-risk SAB, with the majority predicted to belong to subphenotype B. Subphenotype B could therefore represent a rational target for expanded investigation of earlier oral switch in SAB, providing a data-driven definition of low-risk SAB. Furthermore, the risks of adjunctive agents might outweigh the limited potential to improve on already good outcomes, as exemplified by our finding that adjunctive rifampicin potentially caused increased mortality in this subphenotype. Inclusion of this subphenotype in trials of combination therapy should be done cautiously. Subphenotype E (IDU SAB) was associated with complicated disease and, despite this, low mortality. Subphenotype C (community-acquired metastatic SAB) had complicated disease and worse microbiologic outcomes but without clear predisposing factors. Patients in this subphenotype had a lower Charlson comorbidity index and generally lacked an obvious source for bacteremia. The possible benefit of adjunctive rifampicin warrants further investigation in this subphenotype, in addition to alternative adjunctive agents including antimicrobials (eg, clindamycin, currently being evaluated in the adjunctive treatment domain of the SNAP trial) and anti-staphylococcal lysins (Exebacase). These subphenotypes also provide a framework for investigation of immunobiology in SAB and could facilitate identification of treatable traits, for example, defective phagocyte responses that could be therapeutically recalibrated.

### Identification of covalent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus serine hydrolases important for virulence and biofilm formation [^9c3da06c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, coccus-shaped, pathogenic bacteria that causes a range of clinical manifestations including skin and soft tissue infection, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and bacteremia. The primary reservoir of these bacteria is human skin and mucous membranes, with 35–40% of the population colonized by S. aureus in the anterior nares. This opportunistic pathogen is also highly prevalent in hospital environments. Toxin production and biofilm formation are associated with more severe infections. Biofilms can form on host tissues or indwelling medical devices and provide a significant survival advantage by increasing antibiotic resistance by 1500-fold. In addition, biofilm formation enables the persistence of chronic infections and results in increased morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, early detection and inhibition of biofilms is essential for preventing and managing S. aureus infections.

A key step in improving both diagnosis and treatment of S. aureus infections is identifying new targets that are easily accessible to small molecules, unique to S. aureus, and that contribute to growth and maintenance of biofilms. Serine hydrolases are a promising class of enzymes to target for therapeutic, diagnostic, and imaging applications. Despite being linked to critical processes such as virulence, biofilm formation, and host-pathogen interactions in many pathogenic organisms, the specific functional roles, expression patterns, and localization of many bacterial serine hydrolases remain poorly characterized. This is in part because serine hydrolases share a common α, β-hydrolase catalytic domain and often have overlapping functions that can compensate for one another. In these cases, genetic tools are difficult to use for functional studies because multiple targets must be knocked out simultaneously to observe a phenotype. As a result, there is a significant unmet need to identify selective inhibitors for members of this family that could be used not only to assign specific biological functions to specific serine hydrolases but also to determine their potential as therapeutic and imaging targets.

### The role of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in skin and soft tissue infections [^f0c0f7ee]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major public health issue worldwide over the last years. MRSA is frequently implicated in the development of skin and soft tissue infections, leading to significant increases in morbidity, mortality and overall healthcare costs.

Recent Findings

In order to face the threat of MRSA, major changes in clinical management of skin and soft tissue infections are required. The identification of populations at risk for the acquisition of infections due to MRSA, together with the improvement of the diagnostic techniques, is paramount. Moreover, a number of new antimicrobials with activity against MRSA have been recently developed and approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections, however, the use of the new drugs in the wide clinical practice remains limited.

Summary

We reviewed the current epidemiology of MRSA in skin and soft tissue infections, with particular focus on implications for clinical management. The potential role of new antibiotic options against MRSA infections is also discussed.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^88c1e1a3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of mortality by bloodstream infections worldwide, and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of mortality attributable to antimicrobial resistance. Despite its global distribution and an incidence of approximately 30 per 100 000 person-years, the optimal approach to S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is poorly understood. Despite the fact that SAB has been a major theme in the medical literature for decades, basic treatment elements such as the optimal antibiotic regimen, the role of adjunct and oral antibiotics, the optimal treatment duration, and the definition of persistent SAB remain fundamentally unknown. Even less is known about global differences in treatment practices for SAB.

The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB. To do this, we used a variety of social media platforms to reach a large number of clinicians throughout the world for a survey on SAB treatment practices.

### Bench-to-bedside review: understanding the impact of resistance and virulence factors on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in the intensive care unit [^bb80a9cb]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) displays a remarkable array of resistance and virulence factors, which have contributed to its prominent role in infections of the critically ill. We are beginning to understand the function and regulation of some of these factors and efforts are ongoing to better characterize the complex interplay between the microorganism and host response. It is important that clinicians recognize the changing resistance patterns and epidemiology of Staphylococcus spp., as these factors may impact patient outcomes. Community-associated MRSA clones have emerged as an increasingly important subset of Staphyloccocus aureus and MRSA can no longer be considered as solely a nosocomial pathogen. When initiating empiric antibiotics, it is of vital importance that this therapy be timely and appropriate, as delays in treatment are associated with adverse outcomes. Although vancomycin has long been considered a first-line therapy for serious MRSA infections, multiple concerns with this agent have opened the door for existing and investigational agents demonstrating efficacy in this role.

### Clinical management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^145ca116]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is one of the most common serious bacterial infections worldwide. In the UK alone, around 12,500 cases each year are reported, with an associated mortality of about 30%, yet the evidence guiding optimum management is poor. To date, fewer than 1500 patients with S aureus bacteraemia have been recruited to 16 controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, clinical practice is driven by the results of observational studies and anecdote. Here, we propose and review ten unanswered clinical questions commonly posed by those managing S aureus bacteraemia. Our findings define the major areas of uncertainty in the management of S aureus bacteraemia and highlight just two key principles. First, all infective foci must be identified and removed as soon as possible. Second, long-term antimicrobial therapy is required for those with persistent bacteraemia or a deep, irremovable focus. Beyond this, the best drugs, dose, mode of delivery, and duration of therapy are uncertain, a situation compounded by emerging S aureus strains that are resistant to old and new antibiotics. We discuss the consequences on clinical practice, and how these findings define the agenda for future clinical research.

### Methicillin-resistant and susceptible Staphylococcus aureus: tolerance, immune evasion and treatment [^ee273bb1]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is capable of infecting every organ system in the body and developing resistance to every available antibiotic used to treat it, such as methicillin-resistant S.aureus (commonly referred to as MRSA). This pathogen is characterized by the sudden emergence of virulent new clones and an array of mechanisms to circumvent the immune system and antibiotics. Furthermore, despite the development of new antibiotics and a growing body of high-quality data to inform their use, S.aureus continues to be a leading bacterial cause of death worldwide. In this Review, we provide an overview of the basic research on the complex interplay between S.aureus, the host and antibiotics. We also provide an update on the contemporary clinical studies on the treatment and prevention of S.aureus.

### Staphylococcus aureus: methicillin-susceptible S. aureus to methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus [^b7b4ee41]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The evolution of methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has demanded serious review of antimicrobial use and development of new agents and revised approaches to prevent and overcome drug resistance. Depending on local conditions and patient risk factors, empirical therapy of suspected S. aureus infection may require coverage of drug-resistant organisms with newer agents and novel antibiotic combinations. The question of treatment with inappropriate antibiotics raises grave concerns with regard to methicillin-resistant S. aureus selection, overgrowth, and increased virulence. Several strategies to reduce the nosocomial burden of resistance are suggested, including shortened hospital stays and outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy of the most serious infections.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^7ef31e71]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an evolving pathogen responsible for a variety of infections ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to invasive life-threatening diseases. Staphylococcus aureus is the second most common bacterial pathogen that causes infections in outpatients and is among the most frequent causes of nosocomial bacteremia. Metastatic infection and relapse are common, and involvement of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA]/heterogeneous VISA [hVISA]) and daptomycin is increasing. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin nearly doubled between 2004 and 2009.

For decades, vancomycin has been the gold standard treatment for MRSA infections including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Treatment failures with vancomycin have been associated with the presence of VISA and hVISA and the phenomenon of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creep. Furthermore, vancomycin has limited tissue penetration, is slowly bactericidal, and is suboptimal against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA); therefore, S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) relapse is common. Daptomycin, which is approved for the treatment of SAB in the United States and Europe, has been shown to be noninferior to standard therapy in terms of cure (vancomycin or antistaphylococcal penicillin, depending on isolate susceptibility) and is an alternative to vancomycin. Resistance to daptomycin has begun to emerge in the following 2 clinical scenarios: in daptomycin-treated patients with undrained infections and in daptomycin-naive patients infected with MRSA strains that display high MIC to vancomycin. Thus, a critical need exists for additional agents that are effective in the treatment of bacteremia and infective endocarditis.

Telavancin is a semisynthetic derivative of vancomycin (Figure 1) that exhibits concentration-dependent bactericidal effects in vitro via a dual mechanism of action of inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and disruption of bacterial cell membrane barrier functions. Telavancin is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) due to susceptible gram-positive pathogens. Also, telavancin is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), including ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) due to susceptible isolates of S. aureus (MRSA strains only in Europe), when alternative medicines are unsuitable.

### Recalcitrant Staphylococcus aureus infections: obstacles and solutions [^87f91b83]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic treatment failure of Staphylococcus aureus infections is very common. In addition to genetically encoded mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, numerous additional factors limit the efficacy of antibiotics in vivo Identifying and removing the barriers to antibiotic efficacy are of major importance, as even if new antibiotics become available, they will likely face the same barriers to efficacy as their predecessors. One major obstacle to antibiotic efficacy is the proficiency of S. aureus to enter a physiological state that is incompatible with antibiotic killing. Multiple pathways leading to antibiotic tolerance and the formation of tolerant subpopulations called persister cells have been described for S. aureus Additionally, S. aureus is a versatile pathogen that can infect numerous tissues and invade a variety of cell types, of which some are poorly penetrable to antibiotics. It is therefore unlikely that there will be a single solution to the problem of recalcitrant S. aureus infection. Instead, specific approaches may be required for targeting tolerant cells within different niches, be it through direct targeting of persister cells, sensitization of persisters to conventional antibiotics, improved penetration of antibiotics to particular niches, or any combination thereof. Here, we examine two well-described reservoirs of antibiotic-tolerant S. aureus, the biofilm and the macrophage, the barriers these environments present to antibiotic efficacy, and potential solutions to the problem.

### Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: definitions and treatment [^21dfd926]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality and often results in metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis, which have a negative impact on patient outcomes. We review the importance of the use of precise definitions of uncomplicated bacteremia and complicated bacteremia and present a case study to highlight the need for prolonged treatment and close monitoring of patients with risk factors for complications associated with S. aureus bacteremia. Traditionally, the treatment of choice for S. aureus bacteremia has depended to a large extent on the methicillin susceptibility of the pathogen. New antibiotics with proven efficacy against both susceptible and resistant strains are particularly attractive for empirical therapy. The antimicrobial agents that are currently available for use in the treatment of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and the scientific evidence that forms a basis for the use of these agents for this indication are reviewed.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^78f30306]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

COMBATING S. aureus

The treatment of S. aureus continues to be a hot area in ID clinical science as S. aureus is one of the leading bacterial causes of death both globally and in the United States. Published in October 2023, the ERADICATE RCT was the first head-to-head phase 3 trial of an anti-MRSA antibiotic for bacteremia in 15 years. In this study, 390 patients across 17 countries with complicated S. aureus bacteremia were randomized to receive either daptomycin or ceftobiprole in a double-blinded fashion. The primary outcome, treatment success at 70 days, was similar between the 2 arms and within the noninferiority margin; however, superiority of ceftobiprole was not demonstrated. Unfortunately, a subgroup analysis of outcomes in patients with MRSA was limited, as only about a quarter of the patients in the study had MRSA infections. Based on the results of this and other studies, ceftrobiprole was approved by the FDA in April 2024.

The use of oral antibiotics for the treatment for S. aureus bacteremia also remains a topic of great interest. The SABATO noninferiority trial, published in 2024, randomized patients meeting a strict definition of uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia to either complete 14 days of intravenous antibiotics or switch to oral therapy after 5–7 days to complete the remainder of a 14-day course. The choice of antibiotics was dictated by the study protocol, based on antibiotic susceptibility testing data and patient allergies. As a testament to the difficulty in discerning which cases of S. aureus bacteremia are truly uncomplicated, > 5000 patients were assessed for eligibility in order to enroll just 213 patients, only half of the original planned sample size. Despite this smaller sample size, the study met its noninferiority margin of 10% and showed a significant reduction in hospital length of stay in the group switched to oral therapy. This study adds to the growing literature suggesting that finishing a short treatment course with oral antimicrobials is safe in carefully selected patients with S. aureus bacteremia.

### Antistaphylococcal agents [^57c45e67]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

These are interesting times in the treatment of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with shifting epidemiology of antibiotic resistance; changing prevalence of clinical syndromes (probably reflecting changes in virulence of circulating strains); and the recent availability of a variety of new agents with activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci. The abundance of riches in new drugs for the multidrug-resistant gram-positive space is timely, and these agents show great potential, but as yet have incompletely tested durability and comparative efficacy. This article reviews the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of antistaphylococcal agents by providing basic information including mechanism of action; mechanisms of resistance; clinical use (including dosing for and data supporting common indications); drug toxicities; and major drug interactions.

### Adaptation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the face of vancomycin therapy [^34a2ce1a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

For the past 2 decades, vancomycin has served as the cornerstone of therapy against serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. This role is increasingly challenged by questions of efficacy, including reduced efficacy against infections caused by glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus strains. In an evaluation of clinical glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus isolates and serial, clinical methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates obtained from patients receiving vancomycin for the treatment of bacteremia, we found that loss of function of the accessory gene regulator operon may confer a survival advantage to S. aureus under vancomycin selection pressure, particularly in strains with the accessory gene regulator group II genotype. Other advantages in a nosocomial setting may include enhancement of biofilm formation and promotion of physiologic changes supporting colonization. We conclude that loss of accessory gene regulator function in methicillin-resistant S. aureus might, in part, explain the decreased efficacy of vancomycin in the therapy of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia, thus highlighting the need to reevaluate the criteria of susceptibility to vancomycin.

### Staphylokinase promotes the establishment of Staphylococcus aureus skin infections while decreasing disease severity [^d16ac535]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Skin infections are frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus and can lead to a fatal sepsis. The microbial mechanisms controlling the initiation and progression from mild skin infection to a severe disseminated infection remain poorly understood. Using a combination of clinical data and in vitro and ex vivo assays, we show that staphylokinase, secreted by S. aureus, promoted the establishment of skin infections in humans and increased bacterial penetration through skin barriers by activating plasminogen. However, when infection was established, the interaction between staphylokinase and plasminogen did not promote systemic dissemination but induced the opening and draining of abscesses and decreased disease severity in neutropenic mice. Also, increased staphylokinase production was associated with noninvasive S. aureus infections in patients. Our results point out the dual roles of staphylokinase in S. aureus skin infections as promoting the establishment of infections while decreasing disease severity.

### Treating Gram-positive infections: vancomycin update and the whys, wherefores and evidence base for continuous infusion of anti-Gram-positive antibiotics [^e00f0c33]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of vancomycin for treating serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections and the optimal method of administration of anti-Gram-positive antibiotics have been recently questioned. This review summarizes the current literature concerning the use of vancomycin and the role of continuous infusion antimicrobials for treatment of Gram-positive infections.

Recent Findings

Although vancomycin-resistant S. aureus due to acquisition of vanA from vancomycin-resistant enterococci remains rare (11 cases to date), heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus have now been reported from many countries around the world. Laboratory studies have demonstrated subtle, but potentially significant differences in vancomycin susceptibility depending on the methods used, meaning clinicians need to liaise closely with their local microbiology laboratories. Higher vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations within the accepted susceptible range and the presence of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus are associated with vancomycin treatment failure. It is likely that heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus contributes to treatment failure in patients with serious, high bacterial load infections. Despite the potential limitations of vancomycin, no clinical trials have demonstrated superiority of alternative agents. Administration of antibiotics by continuous infusion is supported by in-vitro and animal studies for the classes of antibiotic that demonstrate time-dependent killing. However, few, limited clinical studies have been performed to date.

Summary

Vancomycin remains an important first-line antimicrobial for treatment of serious methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections; however, a detailed analysis of isolate susceptibility and appropriate dosing are important. Although continuous infusion of some anti-Gram-positive antimicrobials may provide theoretical benefits, clinical trials demonstrating superiority in outcomes are uncommon. Use of continuous infusion may, however, provide practical advantages in patients on home intravenous antibiotics.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^203a6047]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is characterized by a unique ability to involve metastatic infections in almost every organ system in the body. Around 20% of the patients with SAB die within 30 days. In patients with SAB, the distinction between uncomplicated and complicated SAB is therapeutically important, as guidelines recommend different treatment durations for these two entities. However, this dichotomous classification strategy can incompletely reflect the heterogeneity of SAB. In this viewpoint, we discuss the limitations of the currently used definitions for SAB. We then propose a new approach to define the extent of infection in patients with SAB, providing an individualized framework for diagnosis and treatment.

### Staphylococcal decolonisation: an effective strategy for prevention of infection? [^8f278bdc]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus decolonisation — treatment to eradicate staphylococcal carriage — is often considered as a measure to prevent S aureus infection. The most common approach to decolonisation has been intranasal application of mupirocin either alone or in combination with antiseptic soaps or systemic antimicrobial agents. Some data support the use of decolonisation in surgical patients colonised with S aureus, particularly in those undergoing cardiothoracic procedures. Although this intervention has been associated with low rates of postoperative S aureus infection, whether overall rates of infection are also decreased is unclear. Patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis might benefit from decolonisation, although repeated courses of treatment are needed, and the effects are modest. Eradication of meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) carriage has generally been difficult, and the role of decolonisation as an MRSA infection control measure is uncertain. The efficacy of decolonisation of patients with community-associated MRSA has not been established, and the routine use of decolonisation of non-surgical patients is not supported by data.

### Are bloodstream leukocytes trojan horses for the metastasis of Staphylococcus aureus? [^8e6aa7a1]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia remains very difficult to treat, and a large proportion of cases result in potentially lethal metastatic infection. Unpredictable and persistent bacteraemia in the face of highly active, usually bactericidal antibiotics is the strongest predictor of death or disseminated disease. Although S. aureus has conventionally been considered an extracellular pathogen, much evidence demonstrates that it can survive intracellularly. In this Opinion article, we propose that phagocytes, and specifically neutrophils, represent a privileged site for S. aureus in the bloodstream, offering protection from most antibiotics and providing a mechanism by which the bacterium can travel to and infect distant sites. Furthermore, we suggest how this can be experimentally confirmed and how it may prompt a change in the current paradigm of S. aureus bacteraemia and identify better treatment options for improved clinical outcomes.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

Study Identification Study Status Sponsor/Collaborators Study Description This is an open-label, expanded access study of exebacase used in addition to antistaphylococcal antibiotics in adult patients with persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, including right-sided endocarditis, who are hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019. Patients with left-sided endocarditis are excluded. Patients will receive a single dose of exebacase. Patients will continue to receive antistaphylococcal antibiotics as prescribed by the treating physician. Exebacase Phase 3 study sites may participate in this Expanded Access study. Exebacase, a direct lytic agent, is an entirely new treatment modality against S. aureus.

Exebacase is a recombinantly-produced, purified cell wall hydrolase enzyme that results in rapid bacteriolysis, potent biofilm eradication, synergy with antibiotics, low propensity for resistance, and the potential to suppress antibiotic resistance when used together with antibiotics. Exebacase represents a first-in-field, first-in-class treatment with the potential to improve clinical outcome when used in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics to treat S. aureus BSI including IE. Conditions Study Design InterventionsInterventions Patients will receive a single IV infusion of exebacase in addition to antistaphylococcal antibiotics prescribed by the treating physician. Patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment will be administered a dose of 18 mg of exebacase; patients with moderate or severe renal impairment will be administered a dose of 12 mg; patients with end-stage renal disease, including those on hemodialysis, will be administered a dose of 8 mg.

Eligibility Inclusion Criteria:

- Male or female, 18 years of age or older.
- Hospitalized with known COVID-19 infection confirmed by positive diagnostic test.
- Not eligible for the exebacase Phase 3 study.
- Blood cultures positive for MRSA for ≥ 3 days.
- Patient is not pregnant or breastfeeding and is not of reproductive potential or agrees to remain abstinent or use contraception if of reproductive potential.

### Counter inhibition between leukotoxins attenuates Staphylococcus aureus virulence [^ac788c5e]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

We are in the early stages of uncovering why S. aureus produces numerous related leukotoxins and how they contribute to disease. Leukotoxins exhibit unique attributes and as such, they likely have distinct roles during infection. It remains to be elucidated if the large numbers of toxins produced by S. aureus exist solely to increase the amount of cellular targets required for efficient immune cell lysis by the bacterium. Alternatively, the interplay between these leukotoxins could also modulate S. aureus pathogenesis, beyond merely promoting cell lysis. We postulate that while the cytotoxic capabilities of leukotoxins likely have a role in establishing infections, the ability of leukotoxins to inhibit each other within certain environments could be beneficial for S. aureus as it has the potential to diminish overt tissue damage, inflammation and ultimately death of the infected host. As such, leukotoxin antagonism could impact the development of anti-toxin strategies by adding a new layer of complexity previously unknown. Our study stresses the importance of deciphering how bi-component leukotoxins work in vivo as a collective group of virulence factors, as this information is required for the development of more effective anti-toxin treatments to combat S. aureus infections.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^23a90521]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The framework proposed here for the classification and management of patients with SAB has the potential to solve the shortcomings of the current simplistic definition of uncomplicated and complicated SAB. It consists of four steps: (1) risk stratification for the presence of metastatic infection that (2) directs a diagnostic work-up in search for these infections leading to (3) 'final clinical diagnoses' corresponding with a general direction for treatment that (4) can be individualized to favorable clinical characteristics. This framework provides guidance to the clinician and a context for future research to improve patient outcome and individualized treatment.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^ee57eb0c]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection, also known as bacteraemia, is one of the most common and serious community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide. When S aureus enters the bloodstream it can disseminate to cause metastatic, deep-seated infection of almost any organ, with an associated mortality of approximately 20%. Despite the frequency and severity of S aureus bacteraemia, the optimal antibiotic treatment is uncertain. Fewer than 1600 participants have been enrolled in randomised trials of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of this infection over the past 50 years. Most treatment recommendations are therefore based on observational studies and clinical experience. Opinions on best management vary widely, but current guidelinesrecommend S aureus bacteraemia be treated with at least 14 days of an intravenous β-lactam antibiotic, or a glycopeptide if the bacteria are resistant to meticillin. Combination antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended, except in severe meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections (eg, endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections); however, evidence in support of its use in such cases is weak.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole for treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections [^1d387e9b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections.

Data Sources

Clinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-February 2003) and EMBASE (1980-February 2003). Key search terms included trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination and Staphylococcus aureus.

Data Synthesis

An evaluation of case reports, case series, and clinical studies focusing on the use of TMP/SMX for treatment of severe S. aureus infections was conducted. The majority of the reports indicate that TMP/SMX may be effective for the treatment of infections due to low bacterial burdens of susceptible strains of S. aureus.

Conclusions

In select infections, TMP/SMX may be a useful alternative to vancomycin for treatment of severe S. aureus infections. Additional randomized studies should be conducted comparing this agent with vancomycin and linezolid.

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN TREATMENT OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTEREMIA OR INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS

ASSURE Study

A phase 2, multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telavancin for the treatment of adult patients with uncomplicated SAB. Patients were randomized to receive either telavancin (10 mg/kg IV q24h) or standard therapy (vancomycin 1 g IV q12h or antistaphylococcal penicillin [nafcillin 2 g IV q6h, oxacillin 2 g IV q6h, or cloxacillin 2 g IV q6h]) for 14 days (blinded dose adjustment of vancomycin was permitted per site-specific guidelines). The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure at day 84, defined as resolution of clinical symptoms/signs associated with bacteremia, no evidence of metastatic complications, all cultures negative for S. aureus after qualifying blood cultures, and no nonstudy systemic antistaphylococcal medication to which the baseline pathogen was susceptible.

Of 60 patients randomized to telavancin or standard therapy, 58 received 1 or more doses of study medication (n = 29 in each group). The key analysis populations included the all-treated target population (ATT; patients who received 1 or more doses of study medication and fulfilled inclusion/exclusion and continuation criteria [telavancin, n = 15; standard therapy, n = 16]) and the clinically evaluable population (patients in the ATT population who received 12–16 days of study medication and whose study participation did not deviate from the protocol by more than prespecified limits [telavancin, 8; standard therapy, 9]). Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 ATT treatment groups. All baseline isolates of S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA) available for testing were vancomycin susceptible (≤ 1 µg/mL). Sixteen patients in the telavancin group and 12 patients in the standard therapy group discontinued study medication early. The most common reason for failing to meet continuation criteria was identification of complicated bacteremia (positive follow-up blood cultures).

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^89a7ab7f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Telavancin is a bactericidal antibiotic with a dual mechanism of action. In vitro data and experimental models of infection support a potential role for telavancin in the treatment of SAB. In murine models of bacteremia and in in vitro and rabbit models of infective endocarditis, telavancin demonstrated greater efficacy than vancomycin and similar or greater efficacy than daptomycin. Clinical experience includes bacteremic patients with catheter-associated infections, HAP, osteomyelitis, and endovascular infections, which showed comparable clinical cure rates between telavancin and vancomycin, although the findings were based on very small sample sizes. While the drug has been generally well tolerated, nephrotoxicity warrants caution in its use, especially among patients at high risk for development of renal dysfunction. Additional clinical experience is needed to fully assess the effectiveness and safety of telavancin in patients with SAB. These studies will need to include larger numbers of patients than were enrolled in the ASSURE study, as well as patients with complicated bacteremia.

Table 2.
Cure Rates at Test of Cure in Patients With Bacteremia in Clinical Studies With Telavancin

Adverse events (AEs) were more common in the telavancin group compared with the standard therapy group; AEs that led to drug discontinuation were similar in both groups (Table 3). Potential clinically significant increases in serum creatinine (serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL and at least 50% greater than baseline at any time point through the end-of-therapy visit) were more common in telavancin-treated patients (5/25 vs 2/28).

Table 3.
Overall Safety and Tolerability in Patients With Bacteremia in Clinical Studies of Telavancin

Five (17%) died in the telavancin group and 3 patients (10%) died in the standard therapy group. In the telavancin group, 1 patient who died from endocarditis had withdrawn consent after the first dose, 2 other patients had discontinued early because of failure to meet continuation criteria (1 with endocarditis and 1 with metastatic soft tissue abscess), and 2 patients died after completing study medication (1 with prostate cancer and cardiorespiratory failure and 1 with probable sepsis from the urinary tract). In the standard therapy group, 1 patient died with MSSA bacteremia and intestinal ischemia, 1 patient died from endocarditis, and 1 patient died from a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

ATTAIN Studies

The ATTAIN studies were 2 methodologically identical, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials that compared telavancin with vancomycin for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to gram-positive pathogens including MRSA. Overall, the pooled studies showed that telavancin was noninferior to vancomycin and indicated improved clinical outcomes compared with vancomycin in the subgroups of patients with monomicrobial S. aureus infections and with S. aureus strains displaying a vancomycin MIC ≥ 1 µg/mL. As bacteremic HAP is associated with higher mortality than nonbacteremic HAP, particularly when MRSA is the causative pathogen, a post hoc analysis of patients with bacteremic HAP enrolled in the ATTAIN studies was conducted. Bacteremic HAP was defined by the identification of a pneumonia-causing pathogen in the blood or of the same pathogen in the lung and blood with identical susceptibility profiles.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^cc0595fe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is one of the most common serious bacterial infections and the most frequent invasive infection due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Treatment is challenging, particularly for MRSA, because of limited treatment options. Telavancin is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that is active against a range of clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens including MRSA. In experimental animal models of sepsis telavancin was shown to be more effective than vancomycin. In clinically evaluable patients enrolled in a pilot study of uncomplicated SAB, cure rates were 88% for telavancin and 89% for standard therapy. Among patients with infection due to only gram-positive pathogens enrolled in the 2 phase 3 studies of telavancin for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, cure rates for those with bacteremic S. aureus pneumonia were 41% (9/22, telavancin) and 40% (10/25, vancomycin) with identical mortality rates. These data support further evaluation of telavancin in larger, prospective studies of SAB.

### Structural basis of broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [^ab0162bc]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Staphylococcus aureus underlies one of the top three most deadly drug-resistant bacterial infections worldwide. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are particularly problematic owing to their prevalence in nosocomial and community-acquired infections, increased rates of morbidity and death, as well as elevated healthcare costs. MRSA is notorious for its ability to acquire resistance to not only β-lactams but also many other classes of antibiotics. The drugs typically used to treat MRSA infections, such as vancomycin, are less effective, more toxic and are subject to established and growing resistance mechanisms as evidenced in vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strains –. Despite some progress in the development of new therapeutics, S. aureus has recently been estimated to cause more than a quarter of all mortality attributed to antimicrobial resistance in economically developed countries, demonstrating that improved treatment options are urgently required. A clearer understanding of resistance in this pathogen could facilitate the development of new cocktail therapies to preserve β-lactam action.

### Contemporary management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia-controversies in clinical practice [^1122c80d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) carries a high risk for excess morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, significant practice variation continues to permeate clinical management of this syndrome. Since the publication of the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, the field of SAB has evolved with the emergence of newer diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of SAB, with special focus on areas where the highest level of evidence is lacking to inform best practices.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus infections [^074ae517]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Because of high incidence, morbidity, and antimicrobial resistance, Staphylococcus aureus infections are a growing concern for family physicians. Strains of S. aureus that are resistant to vancomycin are now recognized. Increasing incidence of unrecognized community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections pose a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although the incidence of complex S. aureus infections is rising, new antimicrobial agents, including daptomycin and linezolid, are available as treatment. S. aureus is a common pathogen in skin, soft-tissue, catheter-related, bone, joint, pulmonary, and central nervous system infections. S. aureus bacteremias are particularly problematic because of the high incidence of associated complicated infections, including infective endocarditis. Adherence to precautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially handwashing, is suboptimal.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^5282e7a0]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The current duration of therapy in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is based on differentiating complicated from uncomplicated disease. While this approach allows clinicians and investigators to group SAB patients into broadly similar clinical categories, it fails to account for the intrinsic heterogeneity of SAB. This is due in part to the fact that risk factors for metastatic infection and confirmed metastatic infection are considered as equivalent in most scoring systems. In this viewpoint, we propose a two-step system of categorizing patients with SAB. Initially, patients with SAB would be categorized as 'high risk' or 'low risk' for metastatic infection based upon an initial set of diagnostic procedures. In the second step, patients identified as 'high-risk' would undergo additional diagnostic evaluation. The results of this stepwise diagnostic evaluation would define a 'final clinical diagnosis' to inform an individualized final treatment plan.

### Transcription tuned by S-nitrosylation underlies a mechanism for Staphylococcus aureus to circumvent vancomycin killing [^92af226e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

NOS has also been reported to influence S. aureus virulence, sensitivity to oxidative stress, and heme stress; it also plays essential roles in regulating electron transfer to maintain membrane bioenergeticsand modulates aerobic respiratory metabolism and cell physiology. Bacterial NOS-derived NO also plays important roles in regulating the formation, swarming, and dispersal of bacterial biofilms. These findings suggest a key role of bacterial NOS or NOS-derived NO in the global regulation of S. aureus physiological phenotypes. It is thus worth exploring the mechanisms by which NOS is regulated. The regulatory mechanism mediated by S-nitrosylation may be universal and could be applied to regulation of other physiological phenotypes, and it should therefore be further explored in the future.

Here, we found that the NOS inhibitor L-NAME and vancomycin showed a synergistic antibacterial effect on S. aureus. Introducing a NOS inhibitor as a co-treatment with other antibiotics is thus a potential strategy for clinical treatment of severe S. aureus infection. However, L-NAME is also an effective inhibitor of mammalian NOS, and further research is therefore required to discover a bacteria-specific NOS inhibitor.

Host-derived NOS and NO have been suggested to have roles in controlling S. aureus infections. NO produced by host immune cells has been shown to have broad activity against diverse pathogens and to inhibit Staphylococcus virulence. However, it has been found that NO produced by bacteria promotes bacterial virulence and drug resistance. Thus, it would be useful to understand whether host cell-produced NO could affect bacterial antibiotic susceptibility. The present study provides a key insight that bacteria may use host-produced NO to resist antibiotic killing during infection. This is a promising direction for future study and potential improvement of antibiotic therapeutic strategies.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^5fde553e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

ANIMAL MODELS OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTEREMIA OR INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS

The efficacy of telavancin has been studied in animal infection models of bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by clinically relevant gram-positive organisms. In these studies, telavancin efficacy was compared with that of agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin at doses that mimicked human-equivalent exposures. The following are a few illustrative examples.

In several murine bacteremic infection models, telavancin treatment resulted in the successful resolution of a MRSA infection, whereas vancomycin treatment did not. Telavancin also produced significantly greater reductions in blood and spleen bacterial titers (P < .05) vs vancomycin (Figure 2). The mortality rate (day 14) was lower with telavancin than with vancomycin or controls (1/15 [7%], 15/15 [100%], and 15/15 [100%], respectively). In an immunocompromised murine model of bacteremia caused by glycopeptide intermediate S. aureus (strains HIP-5836 and Mu50) or hVISA (strain Mu3), telavancin was more effective than vancomycin despite only 24 hours of dosing. Moreover, only telavancin produced statistically significant (P < .05) and sustained reductions in blood and spleen titers from pretreatment levels for all 3 strains tested (Figure 3).

### Clinical management ofBacteremia in neonates, children, and adolescents [^742d84ad]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of community and health care-associated bacteremia, with authors of recent studies estimating the incidence of S aureus bacteremia (SAB) in high-income countries between 8 and 26 per 100000 children per year. Despite this, < 300 children worldwide have ever been randomly assigned into clinical trials to assess the efficacy of treatment of SAB. A panel of infectious diseases physicians with clinical and research interests in pediatric SAB identified 7 key clinical questions. The available literature is systematically appraised, summarizing SAB management in children in relation to these priority clinical questions. The management of neonates, children, and adolescents with SAB is predominantly based on clinical experience and trial data extrapolated from adult studies, with limited high-quality evidence available to guide management. The optimal, comprehensive management strategies for SAB in children will remain unknown until the questions outlined are answered through prospective observational cohorts and inclusion of children with SAB in clinical trials.

### Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: pathogenesis and regulatory mechanisms [^9f183019]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that normally colonizes the human anterior nares. At the same time, this pathogen is one of the leading causes of life-threatening bloodstream infections, such as sepsis and endocarditis. In this review we will present the current understanding of the pathogenesis of these invasive infections, focusing on the mechanisms of S. aureus clearance from the bloodstream by the immune system, and how this pathogen hijacks the host defense and coagulation systems and further interacts with the blood vessel endothelium. Additionally, we will delve into the regulatory mechanisms S. aureus employs during an invasive infection. These new insights into host-pathogen interactions show promising avenues for the development of novel therapies for treating bloodstream infections.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^0b6435f4]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) efficacy target for vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — an AUC/MIC ratio of ≥ 400 (with the MIC determined by broth microdilution [BMD]) is the currently accepted critical PK/PD index; in vitro and in vivo assessments indicate bactericidal activity (ie, a 1- to 2-log reduction in bacterial inoculum in the animal model) when the vancomycin AUC/MICBMD ratio approximates or exceeds 400, and in vitro data suggest that an AUC of < 400 potentiates the emergence of MRSA resistance and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strains; in adults, an AUC/MICBMD ratio of ≥ 400 is currently considered the optimal PK/PD "efficacy" target.

### Serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^239f437c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Although first identified just > 4 decades ago, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has undergone rapid evolutionary changes and epidemiologic expansion to become a major cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections worldwide. Increasing resistance to vancomycin among MRSA strains in conjunction with availability of new antibiotics, including daptomycin and linezolid, have increased treatment choices but made clinical treatment decisions more challenging. This article describes the clinical features and management issues of 2 challenging-to-treat manifestations of MRSA infection, bacteremia and/or endocarditis and osteomyelitis. It also presents a brief review of community-associated MRSA infections and preventive strategies directed against MRSA.

### The role of novel antibiotics in the management of diabetic foot infection [^f9f08eb8]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic foot infection is a leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation. It is also associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. According to current guidelines, the management of severe diabetic foot infection consists of assessment for need for surgical treatment, evaluation for peripheral arterial disease and urgent management if present and administration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment targeting both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes. The antibiotic therapy should then be adjusted based on both the clinical response and culture findings. The most common pathogens causing diabetic foot infection are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, whereas almost one fifth of cases are polymicrobial. However, the presence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is becoming more frequent in diabetic foot infection. Indeed, almost 20% of bacteria causing diabetic foot infection are multidrug resistant, particularly S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, the incidence of failure of antibiotic treatment is also rising. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major cause of the emergence of resistant bacteria. An earlier meta-analysis did not identify clear differences in resolution of diabetic foot infection among conventional carbapenems, antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins. In this context, recently approved antibiotics might have a role in the management of difficult-to-treat diabetic foot infections.

In the present review, we summarize the role of novel antibiotics in the management of these patients. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a review [^bec90ec5]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of death from bacteremia worldwide, with a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and an estimated 300 000 deaths per year.

Observations

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia causes metastatic infection in more than one-third of cases, including endocarditis (≈12%), septic arthritis (7%), vertebral osteomyelitis (≈4%), spinal epidural abscess, psoas abscess, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, and seeding of implantable medical devices. Patients with S aureus bacteremia commonly present with fever or symptoms from metastatic infection, such as pain in the back, joints, abdomen or extremities, and/or change in mental status. Risk factors include intravascular devices such as implantable cardiac devices and dialysis vascular catheters, recent surgical procedures, injection drug use, diabetes, and previous S aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S aureus bacteremia (≥ 48 hours) is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%. All patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant (MRSA) based on susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Initial treatment for S aureus bacteremia typically includes antibiotics active against MRSA such as vancomycin or daptomycin. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, antibiotics should be adjusted. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be used for MSSA and vancomycin, daptomycin, or ceftobiprole for MRSA. Phase 3 trials for S aureus bacteremia demonstrated noninferiority of daptomycin to standard of care (treatment success, 53/120 [44%] vs 48/115 [42%]) and noninferiority of ceftobiprole to daptomycin (treatment success, 132/189 [70%] vs 136/198 [69%]). Source control is a critical component of treating S aureus bacteremia and may include removal of infected intravascular or implanted devices, drainage of abscesses, and surgical debridement.

Conclusions and Relevance

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and causes 300 000 deaths per year worldwide. Empirical antibiotic treatment should include vancomycin or daptomycin, which are active against MRSA. Once S aureus susceptibilities are known, MSSA should be treated with cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Additional clinical management consists of identifying sites of metastatic infection and pursuing source control for identified foci of infection.

### Epitope-specific immunity against Staphylococcus aureus coproporphyrinogen III oxidase [^960f70a8]. NPJ Vaccines (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is associated with a significant disease burden causing life-threatening diseases, such as deep wound infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and enterotoxin-mediated shock. Antibiotic resistance, specifically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is widespread and of aggravating concern. Although vaccination strategies against S. aureus have attracted much attention in basic and clinical research, no S. aureus vaccine is currently available –. Specific challenges to development of a S. aureus vaccine include low immunogenicity of pathogen-derived antigens, a lack of natural immunity to S. aureus, multiple virulence and immune evasion factors as well as redundant nutrition acquisition pathways. All of these challenges compromise a straightforward strategy to delineate a correlate of protection.

In general, neutralising antibodies inhibiting pathogen interaction with or entry into host cells or detoxifying virulence factors represent a dominant principle of protection provided by vaccines. For instance, due to nasal colonization most adult humans have high levels of circulating antibodies against many staphylococcal antigens which seem to provide some protection against invasive infection with S. aureus. Classical vaccine approaches, targeting S. aureus toxins for neutralisation or surface antigens for production of opsonising antibodies, have not worked against S. aureus in clinical trials. Similarly, the targeting of S. aureus proteins serving important roles in host-pathogen interactions, including adhesion to host cells, binding to and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, iron-uptake or intervention with the host fibrinolytic system remained unsuccessful –. Preclinical and clinical data repetitively indicate that although immunisation with S. aureus antigens usually results in high antibody titers, this does not confer protection against S. aureus infections.

### Heterogeneity in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia clinical trials complicates interpretation of findings [^c85952d6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is a complex disease associated with persistently high mortality (15%–50%). Our understanding of optimal antimicrobial treatment is constrained by limited availability of evidence from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Conducting and interpreting RCTs in SAB is challenging due to heterogeneity of the host, pathogen, and extent of infection. Application of therapeutic findings made in clinical trial cohorts to "real-life" patient cohorts relies on representative participant recruitment to trials and detailed reporting of cohort characteristics. Furthermore, as with other diseases, we likely fail to identify patient subgroups that would differentially benefit from specific therapies. In SAB, specific subgroups could hypothetically differentially benefit from combination antimicrobials or modulation of host factors. There is a need to maximize the value of RCTs for SAB, to ensure applicability of findings and to differentiate true lack of efficacy from treatment effects that are subgroup dependent.

To achieve this, SAB trial participants should represent the full spectrum of real-life patient cohorts (where appropriate for the study drug); detailed and consistent participant characteristics should be collected and reported to allow hypothesis-generating analyses in sufficiently powered subgroups; and outcome reporting should permit meaningful meta-analyses. We aimed to identify current SAB RCTs and systematically analyze the characteristics of included patients, eligibility criteria, and reported outcomes.

### Outcome and predictors of treatment failure in total hip / knee prosthetic joint infections due to Staphylococcus aureus [^4e4dc599]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) represent a growing public health concern in developed countries as a result of the increasing number of operations for total joint arthroplasty and a risk of postoperative infection of 1%–2%. Such infections are associated with substantial morbidity, increased medical costs, and reduced quality of life. General principles of management of PJI include a multidisciplinary approach at centers with expertise in this field. Reliable microbiological diagnosis, along with surgical procedures ranging from prosthesis removal with or without reimplantation to debridement with implant retention, and prolonged appropriate antibiotic therapy, are key elements in the management of such infections. Factors influencing the outcomes of patients with PJI have been assessed in previous studies and include retention of infected material, duration of symptoms of infection, and bacterial resistance. However, the role of these parameters differs from one study to another and is related to study design, patients included, type of surgery, posttreatment follow-up duration, the pathogens in question, and the definition of cure. Although most PJIs are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, only a few studies on small populations, focusing on treatment of early postoperative PJIs or combining coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and S. aureus PJIs, have assessed variables associated with outcome. The purpose of the present retrospective study was therefore to identify variables associated with outcome in a large series of patients treated for S. aureus PJIs, treated according to an algorithm derived from the experience reported by Zimmerli et al and several other authors.

Treatment of necrotizing infections — Staphylococcus aureus: Listed agents and dosages include nafcillin (adult 1–2 g every 4 h IV; pediatric 50 mg/kg/dose every 6 h IV), oxacillin (adult 1–2 g every 4 h IV; pediatric 50 mg/kg/dose every 6 h IV), cefazolin (adult 1 g every 8 h IV; pediatric 33 mg/kg/dose every 8 h IV), vancomycin for resistant strains (adult 30 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses IV; pediatric 15 mg/kg/dose every 6 h IV), and clindamycin (adult 600–900 mg every 8 h IV; pediatric 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 8 h IV). For severe penicillin hypersensitivity, the table lists vancomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin, and it cautions regarding clindamycin: "Bacteriostatic; potential cross-resistance and emergence of resistance in erythromycin-resistant strains; inducible resistance in MRSAb".

Human bite wound infections — key antibiotic choices and organism considerations — include oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg bid and intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5–3.0 g every 6 h, with doxycycline 100 mg bid as an oral option, for which the table states "Good activity against Eikenella species, staphylococci, and anaerobes; some streptococci are resistant". The text notes involvement of "streptococci, S. aureus, and Eikenella corrodens, as well as with multiple anaerobic organisms", that "Eikenella corrodens is resistant to first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and aminoglycosides", and therefore "treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem is recommended; if there is history of hypersensitivity to β-lactams, a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus metronidazole, or moxifloxacin as a single agent is recommended".

### Staphylococcus-induced glomerulonephritis: potential role for corticosteroids [^db6228d4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a troublesome pathogen, responsible for a broad range of clinical manifestations, ranging from benign skin infections to life-threatening conditions such as endocarditis and osteomyelitis. The kidney can be affected through a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis mediated by an inflammatory reaction against a superantigen deposited in the glomerulus during the infection's course. This glomerulopathy has a poor prognosis, often leading to chronically impaired kidney function, eventually progressing to end-stage renal disease. Treatment rests on antibiotherapy. Despite the inflammatory role in this disease's pathophysiology, most authors discourage a simultaneous immunosuppressive approach given the concomitant infection. However, there are some reports of success after administration of systemic corticosteroids in these patients. We present a 66-year-old man with a staphylococcus-induced glomerulonephritis brought on by a vascular graft infection, with rapidly deteriorating kidney function despite extraction of the infected graft and 3weeks of antibiotherapy with achievement of infection control. Kidney function improved after the introduction of corticosteroids. This case highlights the potential role of corticosteroids in selected cases of staphylococcus-induced glomerulonephritis, particularly those in which the infection is under control.

### The interface between antibiotic resistance and virulence in Staphylococcus aureus and its impact upon clinical outcomes [^76d4ccb4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The ability of Staphylococcus aureus to rapidly acquire antibiotic resistance in the face of antimicrobial challenge has enabled it to remain an ongoing, significant human pathogen. Mechanisms behind the evolution of resistance in S. aureus are well documented, but the effects of these phenotypes upon virulence are less clear. By exploring available clinical and experimental data, we have shown that a number of the major steps in the evolution of antibacterial resistance in S. aureus have been accompanied by alterations in virulence. This review also highlights that further experimentation is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms involved in the interface between virulence and antibiotic resistance, with the intention of identifying novel preventative or therapeutic strategies for this important human pathogen.

### Restriction of arginine induces antibiotic tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus [^cd3c1a3b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Growth as a biofilm, a dense community where adherent microbes secrete a complex extracellular matrix, induces extremely high levels of antibiotic tolerance. Antibiotic tolerance is the ability of a bacterial population to withstand an otherwise lethal antibiotic dose due to phenotypic changes without any evidence of a change in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against that antibiotic. Bacteria growing in a biofilm community differ from planktonic bacteria in their metabolism and growth, and they are able to tolerate 100 to 1000 times the concentration of antibiotics that would eliminate planktonic bacteria. Biofilm formation has been implicated in many different types of S. aureus infections including osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, endocarditis, and chronic wound infections. In these infections, biofilm growth contributes to the high morbidity and recalcitrance to antibiotic treatment.

Despite much investigation and speculation about the potential causes of antibiotic tolerance in biofilm-mediated infections, the mechanisms by which this occurs in S. aureus are still poorly understood. In this work, an in vitro model of S. aureus biofilms grown at a solid-air interface is employed to investigate antibiotic tolerance during biofilm growth. Mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance in S. aureus are identified using two broad, unbiased, complementary screening approaches: semi-quantitative proteomics, and transposon sequencing-based screening. These screens identify a novel role for arginine metabolism as a key potentiator of antibiotic tolerance in S. aureus. By restricting the synthesis of arginine, S. aureus can induce antibiotic tolerance by inhibition of protein synthesis. Furthermore, inhibiting the ability of S. aureus to produce arginine from citrulline during antibiotic treatment enhances bacterial fitness during antibiotic treatment in mouse models of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) and osteomyelitis. Together, these studies demonstrate that restricting arginine synthesis, and in turn limiting arginine availability, can contribute to antibiotic treatment failure in S. aureus.

### Considerations for clinical trials of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection in adults [^edb38a37]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (SAB) are broadly grouped into 2 categories: registrational trials intended to support regulatory approval of antibiotics for the treatment of SAB and strategy trials intended to inform clinicians on the best treatment options for SAB among existing antibiotics. Both types of SAB trials are urgently needed but have been limited by cost, complexity, and regulatory uncertainty. Here, we review key SAB trial design considerations for investigators, sponsors, and regulators.

### Anti-infective therapy using species-specific activators of Staphylococcus aureus clpP [^96a79dce]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

S taphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes the human skin and nares and frequently causes invasive and life-threatening diseases. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is responsible for many hospital-acquired infections, which include surgical site infections, bacteremia, and sepsis. MRSA has acquired multidrug resistance against many antibiotics, including β-lactam, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Due to this resistance, antibiotic prophylaxis of MRSA infections frequently incites nosocomial diseases such as Clostridium difficile infection. Given the dwindling supply of potent antibiotics, it is increasingly important to develop new methods of treating multidrug-resistant MRSA infections. To this end, developing antistaphylococcal agents, particularly those with a different mode of action, is urgently needed to provide future treatments for MRSA infections –.

Given the changing epidemiology of disease due to Staphylococcus aureus (SA), including the emergence of drug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant SA, investigators may wish to evaluate the effects of antimicrobials in disease due to SA as well as in disease due to other organisms in the same trial. Here we discuss issues that investigators should address in trial design, conduct, and analysis to evaluate overall effects or effects within subgroups according to causative organisms.

### Retapamulin: an antibacterial with a novel mode of action in an age of emerging resistance to Staphylococcus aureus [^9a029fe2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and responsible for more than 11 million skin and soft tissue infections annually. Impetigo is a common skin infection and the most common bacterial skin infection in children aged two to five years. The emergence of S. aureus isolates resistant to commonly utilized antibacterials for skin infections (beta-lactams, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and mupirocin) makes successful treatment an ongoing challenge. To treat skin infections such as impetigo, antibacterials with a short dosing schedule and low propensity to develop resistance should be used. In 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the United States (U.S.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in over 20 years. In vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against S. aureus and has a lower propensity to develop resistance than mupirocin. In clinical studies, the convenient five-day b.i.d. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the development of resistance against systemic agents.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^9aac643e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

### Treatment of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in children [^6da9b03e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The concept of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) associated with broad resistance, nosocomial acquisition, and known risk factors has recently been expanded. A new type of MRSA that is resistant to fewer antibiotics has emerged in pediatric practice since the mid-1990s. These isolates are community acquired and have been reported from diverse geographic regions. Awareness of these organisms is important for appropriate treatment of S. aureus infections in children.

Recent Findings

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are similar in many respects to community-acquired methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (CA-MSSA). There are usually no differences in risk factors between children with CA-MRSA infections and those with CA-MSSA infections or their household contacts. In one study, however, multivariate analysis showed that age greater than 1 year and health care contact in the preceding month were significant risk factors for CA-MRSA. Skin and soft tissue infections are the most common manifestations, although serious invasive infections and death may occur. Pneumonia has been reported more often in children with CA-MRSA than in those with CA-MSSA. Clindamycin is an effective therapy for CA-MRSA, but there is a risk for development of clindamycin resistance during treatment of a CA-MRSA that is clindamycin susceptible and inducibly erythromycin resistant. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be effective, and linezolid is a new option for treatment.

Summary

The appearance of CA-MRSA has important implications for therapy of infections caused by S. aureus in children. Three specific issues are the development of resistance during clindamycin therapy, insufficient data on the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in serious CA-MRSA infections, and the appropriate role for newer antibiotics such as linezolid.

### Treating osteoarticular infections in a role 2 in Chad: a bacterial epidemiological study [^64374c1c]. BMJ Military Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The treatment of osteoarticular infections in Africa is a medical and surgical challenge due to the difficulties in managing antibiotic therapy after the surgical procedure. The objectives of this study were to identify the types of bacteria in osteoarticular lesions in patients treated in Chad and to determine the spectrum of resistance encountered and the efficacy of available antibiotics.

Material and Methods

This is a retrospective study of all intraoperative osteoarticular and soft tissue samples taken in a French Role 2 Medical Treatment Facility of N'Djamena during surgery for chronic osteoarticular infections, in Chad, for 1year.

Results

A total of 160 bacterial strains were identified, with a predominance of Gram-negative bacillus (GNB) and staphylococcus infections. Among staphylococci, 80% were methicillin-sensitive streptococci which were generally multidrug-sensitive. Enterococci were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, first-generation fluoroquinolones and gentamycin. Among GNB, there was a predominance of enterobacteria compared with non-fermenting GNB, of which 52% were multidrug-resistant and produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL).

Conclusion

Staphylococcus aureus infections are most often sensitive to available antibiotics and therefore have better prognoses than infections caused by other bacteria. In contrast, in half of the cases of GNB, infections were caused by bacteria producing ESBL, thus posing the problem of multidrug-resistance, the risks of which are increased in precarious situations. Therefore, the type of bacteria appears to be a major prognostic factor in the treatment of osteoarticular infections in a Role 2 in Chad. This criterion will need to be considered before any treatment decisions are made.

### Staphylococcus aureus from an acute fracture-related infection displays important bacteriological and histopathologic differences from a chronic equivalent in a murine bone infection model [^17f3042a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Similar to septic infection in the human host, we found more-severe systemic and local infection caused by Hi-SA5458 compared with a milder course of infection induced by Lo-SA5464. Thus, there is strong support that the course of infection is not only influenced by host factors or the duration of infection (acute versus chronic), but that pathogenic virulence also plays a crucial role in fracture-related infections. By identifying specific pathogen-related factors that influence the clinical severity of fracture-related infection, this could guide future treatment decisions regarding the extent of surgical treatment and antimicrobial therapy. Following sepsis models, the efficacy of compounds that target virulence factors and thereby attenuate the virulence of S. aureus should be investigated in fracture-related infections. If promising, this could introduce a new and additional pharmacologic therapy for bone and joint infections in the long term, which could be particularly important in preventing septic infection. Future studies should focus on characterizing S. aureus virulence at the genomic and transcriptomic levels in a broader cohort of clinical isolates and patients and how this relates to the clinical presentation of fracture-related infections in humans. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo comparisons of knockout versus wildtype strains for specific virulence systems, including the S. aureus strains studied here, may reveal whether our observations are reproducible and what genomic characteristics are attributable to increased or attenuated virulence of S. aureus in fracture-related infections.

### Pathogenesis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^6c0524a6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen capable of causing a wide range of human diseases. However, the role of different virulence factors in the development of staphylococcal infections remains incompletely understood. Some clonal types are well equipped to cause disease across the globe, whereas others are facile at causing disease among community members. In this review, general aspects of staphylococcal pathogenesis are addressed, with emphasis on methicillin-resistant strains. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains are not necessarily more virulent than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains, some MRSA strains contain factors or genetic backgrounds that may enhance their virulence or may enable them to cause particular clinical syndromes. We examine these pathogenic factors.

### Distinct clinical endpoints of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia complicate assessment of outcome [^08f5b18e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of both community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia. Among high-incidence bacteremia-causing pathogens, S. aureus is associated with the highest mortality. A major distinction in the outcome of patients with SAB is the presence or absence of suppurative metastatic complications, that is, foci of infection which are anatomically distinct from the portal of entry. These are identified in up to 40% of patients.

Strategy trials have focussed on combination therapy, especially for methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB) but to date have not identified approaches that reduce mortality compared to standards of care. Mortality is the endpoint of SAB most commonly captured as an outcome in clinical trials, whereas microbiological and clinical endpoints are used more variably and defined less consistently.

After progression of S. aureus infection to bacteraemia, metastatic disease and/or attributable mortality are potential clinical endpoints. The extent to which they co-occur or share risk factors is not well described but could be important for assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions in clinical trials. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the development of metastatic infection represents a distinct clinical endpoint from death due to the infection.

### Perspectives on daptomycin resistance, with emphasis on resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [^8c07af71]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are becoming more frequent and less easily treated by means of currently recommended agents. Vancomycin has been associated with decreased susceptibility in staphylococci and with treatment failures. Daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal; a dosage of 4 mg/kg daily is approved for treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections, and a dosage of 6 mg/kg daily is approved for treatment of patients with S. aureus bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. Findings of in vitro studies suggest a correlation between the minimum inhibitory concentrations of daptomycin and vancomycin. Clinical failure was associated with increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations in case reports and in a randomized study of persons with S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. Patients who did not respond to therapy had deep-seated infections that required but could not be or were not managed with adjunctive surgical therapy. No definitive resistance mechanism has been identified, although genetic mutations have been described. Clinically, prior vancomycin therapy has not been associated with failure of daptomycin therapy. Although clinical practitioners must monitor for daptomycin resistance, the available data support the use of daptomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis.

### Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management strategies [^64a3e487]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia, and S. aureus bacteremia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, compared with bacteremia caused by other pathogens. The burden of S. aureus bacteremia, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia, in terms of cost and resource use is high. The risk of infective endocarditis and of seeding to other metastatic foci increases the risk of mortality and raises the stakes for early, appropriate treatment. The incidence of S. aureus bacteremia and its complications has increased sharply in recent years because of the increased frequency of invasive procedures, increased numbers of immunocompromised patients, and increased resistance of S. aureus strains to available antibiotics. This changing epidemiology of S. aureus bacteremia, in combination with the inherent virulence of the pathogen, is driving an urgent need for improved strategies and better antibiotics to prevent and treat S. aureus bacteremia and its complications.

### Current issues on resistance, treatment guidelines, and the appropriate use of fluoroquinolones for respiratory tract infections [^bfd71cf3]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired respiratory tract infections comprise a large percentage of diseases treated by primary care physicians, and rates of antimicrobial use for respiratory tract infections are increasing. The fluoroquinolones comprise a drug class with broad-spectrum activity against many of the key pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other significant pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While fluoroquinolones have gained popularity, the settings for their appropriate use in treating respiratory tract infections remain unclear.

Objective

In this article, the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in S. pneumoniae, treatment guidelines, and the mode of spread of resistance are reviewed.

Methods

The authors conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1990 to the present. Search terms included Streptococcus pneumoniae, fluoroquinolones, and resistance. Articles were selected for inclusion based on their relevance to the objective of this review.

Results

Although 3 sets of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) currently exist in the United States, a consensus for the role of fluoroquinolones in the outpatient management of CAP has not been achieved. Factors mitigating for restraint in the outpatient use of fluoroquinolones include concern for the spread of resistance to "innocent-bystander" organisms, such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, as well as possible inappropriate "trickle-down" use for other, less severe respiratory syndromes, such as bronchitis.

Conclusion

Although the fluoroquinolones are potent agents against respiratory pathogens and have a clearly defined role in the treatment of hospitalized patients with CAP, their optimal role in the outpatient management of respiratory tract infections remains controversial.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^a1186801]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Should an antitoxin active drug (clindamycin or oxazolidinon) be included in the empirical regiment of clinically suspected necrotizing infection?

Either clindamycin or linezolid should be included in the empirical antibiotic regimen of NSTI (recommendation 1C).

Selection of antibiotics that inhibit toxin production may be helpful, particularly in those patients who have evidence of TSS, potentially present in patients who have streptococcal and staphylococcal infections. Protein cytotoxins play an important role in the pathogenesis of various staphylococcal infections, and toxin production should be considered when selecting an antimicrobial agent for Gram-positive pathogens. Linezolid and clindamycin play an important role because they may significantly inhibit exotoxin production from Gram-positive pathogens.

### Dalbavancin for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: the DOTS randomized clinical trial [^a2e15976]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Dalbavancin is a long-acting intravenous lipoglycopeptide that may be effective for treatment of complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia without requiring long-term intravenous access.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin vs standard therapy for completion of treatment of complicated S aureus bacteremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Open-label, assessor-masked, randomized clinical trial conducted from April 2021 to December 2023 at 23 medical centers in the US (n = 22) and Canada (n = 1). Participant follow-up lasted 70 days (180 days for participants with osteomyelitis); date of final follow-up was December 1, 2023. Hospitalized adults with complicated S aureus bacteremia who achieved blood culture clearance following at least 72 hours but no more than 10 days of initial antibacterial therapy were included. Participants were excluded if they had central nervous system infection, retained infected prosthetic material, left-sided endocarditis, or severe immune compromise.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2 doses of intravenous dalbavancin (n = 100; 1500 mg on days 1 and 8) or 4 to 8 total weeks of standard intravenous therapy (n = 100; cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillin if methicillin susceptible; vancomycin or daptomycin if methicillin resistant).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) at day 70, which involved 5 components (clinical success, infectious complications, safety complications, mortality, and health-related quality of life) and was assessed for superiority (achieved if the 95% CI for the probability of dalbavancin having a superior DOOR was > 50%). Secondary outcomes included clinical efficacy at day 70 (prespecified noninferiority margin of 20%) and safety.

Results

Of 200 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 56 [16.2] years; 62 females [31%]), 167 (84%) survived to day 70 and had an efficacy assessment. Participants without a day 70 efficacy assessment were treated as clinical failures in the analyses. The probability of a more desirable day 70 outcome with dalbavancin vs standard therapy was 47.7% (95% CI, 39.8% to 55.7%). Regarding secondary outcomes, clinical efficacy was documented in 73 of 100 for dalbavancin and 72 of 100 for standard therapy (difference, 1.0% [95% CI, -11.5% to 13.5%]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. Serious adverse events were reported in 40 of 100 participants who received dalbavancin and 34 of 100 participants who received standard therapy; treatment-related adverse events were uncommon in both groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adult participants with complicated S aureus bacteremia who achieved blood culture clearance, dalbavancin was not superior to standard therapy by desirability of outcome ranking. When considered with other efficacy and safety outcomes these findings may help inform use of dalbavancin in clinical practice.

### Management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^54e420d0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis are serious infections that demand prompt clinical attention to ensure good outcomes. Of foremost importance is identifying and managing the source of infection and any associated complications. Evaluation for the presence of cardiac involvement is essential because inadequately managed S. aureus endocarditis is life threatening. Thus, physicians must aggressively negotiate treatment paths, considering whether the S. aureus bacteremia is complicated, whether foreign sources of infection should be removed or replaced, and whether surgical intervention is necessary. Selection of an antibiotic treatment is also an essential factor for optimal management. The increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections has created a tremendous demand for effective and safe antimicrobial agents other than the historic anti-MRSA agent vancomycin.

### Restriction of arginine induces antibiotic tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus [^15c933dc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To further confirm the role of ArgH in antibiotic tolerance during biofilm-mediated infections, a murine osteomyelitis model with vancomycin treatment was also employed. Biofilms play an important role in osteomyelitis and contribute to the high rates of antibiotic treatment failure seen in the treatment of this type of infection. In this model, mice were inoculated directly in their femurs with JE2 and argH ::Tn at a 2:1 WT:mutant ratio and treated with vancomycin for seven days beginning immediately at the time of infection. Consistent with the recalcitrance of osteomyelitis to vancomycin treatment, 7 out of the 10 mice treated with vancomycin remained infected after 7 days of antibiotic treatment, despite starting therapy immediately (Figure S12a). Similar to what was observed in the SSTI model, the argH ::Tn mutant had decreased fitness in the absence of antibiotics, but had a relative advantage during treatment with vancomycin (Figure S12b).

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1dbe0fab]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is a common cause of severe community-acquired and hospital-acquired infection worldwide. We tested the hypothesis that adjunctive rifampicin would reduce bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death, by enhancing early S aureus killing, sterilising infected foci and blood faster, and reducing risks of dissemination and metastatic infection.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults (≥ 18 years) with S aureus bacteraemia who had received ≤ 96 h of active antibiotic therapy were recruited from 29 UK hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequential randomisation list to receive 2 weeks of adjunctive rifampicin (600 mg or 900 mg per day according to weight, oral or intravenous) versus identical placebo, together with standard antibiotic therapy. Randomisation was stratified by centre. Patients, investigators, and those caring for the patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was time to bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death (all-cause), from randomisation to 12 weeks, adjudicated by an independent review committee masked to the treatment. Analysis was intention to treat. This trial was registered, number ISRCTN37666216, and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Dec 10, 2012, and Oct 25, 2016, 758 eligible participants were randomly assigned: 370 to rifampicin and 388 to placebo. 485 (64%) participants had community-acquired S aureus infections, and 132 (17%) had nosocomial S aureus infections. 47 (6%) had meticillin-resistant infections. 301 (40%) participants had an initial deep infection focus. Standard antibiotics were given for 29 (IQR 18–45) days; 619 (82%) participants received flucloxacillin. By week 12, 62 (17%) of participants who received rifampicin versus 71 (18%) who received placebo experienced treatment failure or disease recurrence, or died (absolute risk difference −1.4%, 95% CI −7.0 to 4.3; hazard ratio 0.96, 0.68–1.35, p = 0.81). From randomisation to 12 weeks, no evidence of differences in serious (p = 0.17) or grade 3–4 (p = 0.36) adverse events were observed; however, 63 (17%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 39 (10%) in the placebo group had antibiotic or trial drug-modifying adverse events (p = 0.004), and 24 (6%) versus six (2%) had drug interactions (p = 0.0005).

Interpretation

Adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in adults with S aureus bacteraemia.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^da9af8aa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Impetigo and ecthyma — therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Effect of algorithm-based therapy vs usual care on clinical success and serious adverse events in patients with staphylococcal bacteremia: a randomized clinical trial [^d59ca636]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The appropriate duration of antibiotics for staphylococcal bacteremia is unknown.

Objective

To test whether an algorithm that defines treatment duration for staphylococcal bacteremia vs standard of care provides noninferior efficacy without increasing severe adverse events.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized trial involving adults with staphylococcal bacteremia was conducted at 16 academic medical centers in the United States (n = 15) and Spain (n = 1) from April 2011 to March 2017. Patients were followed up for 42 days beyond end of therapy for those with Staphylococcus aureus and 28 days for those with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had 1 or more blood cultures positive for S aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients were excluded if they had known or suspected complicated infection at the time of randomization.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to algorithm-based therapy (n = 255) or usual practice (n = 254). Diagnostic evaluation, antibiotic selection, and duration of therapy were predefined for the algorithm group, whereas clinicians caring for patients in the usual practice group had unrestricted choice of antibiotics, duration, and other aspects of clinical care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Coprimary outcomes were (1) clinical success, as determined by a blinded adjudication committee and tested for noninferiority within a 15% margin; and (2) serious adverse event rates in the intention-to-treat population, tested for superiority. The prespecified secondary outcome measure, tested for superiority, was antibiotic days among per-protocol patients with simple or uncomplicated bacteremia.

Results

Among the 509 patients randomized (mean age, 56.6 [SD, 16.8] years; 226 [44.4%] women), 480 (94.3%) completed the trial. Clinical success was documented in 209 of 255 patients assigned to algorithm-based therapy and 207 of 254 randomized to usual practice (82.0% vs 81.5%; difference, 0.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -6.2% to ∞]). Serious adverse events were reported in 32.5% of algorithm-based therapy patients and 28.3% of usual practice patients (difference, 4.2% [95% CI, -3.8% to 12.2%]). Among per-protocol patients with simple or uncomplicated bacteremia, mean duration of therapy was 4.4 days for algorithm-based therapy vs 6.2 days for usual practice (difference, -1.8 days [95% CI, -3.1 to -0.6]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with staphylococcal bacteremia, the use of an algorithm to guide testing and treatment compared with usual care resulted in a noninferior rate of clinical success. Rates of serious adverse events were not significantly different, but interpretation is limited by wide confidence intervals. Further research is needed to assess the utility of the algorithm.

### Restriction of arginine induces antibiotic tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus [^ce7b5711]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Chronically infected wounds have been shown to have elevated levels of citrulline, presumably due to metabolism of arginine by the host immune system. Since disruption of argH resulted in the inability of S. aureus to convert citrulline into arginine and a subsequent increase in antibiotic tolerance in vitro, it was hypothesized that ArgH might play an important role in antibiotic susceptibility during treatment of a S. aureus wound infection. Using a murine model of a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), the ability of the argH ::Tn strain to survive antibiotic treatment was compared directly to that of the parental strain, JE2. A patch of skin was exposed on the back of mice by tape-stripping, and the exposed epidermis was then inoculated with a mixture of both the JE2 and argH ::Tn strains at a 2:1 WT:mutant ratio. Murine S. aureus SSTI models, including this tape-stripping model, promote S. aureus infections with local biofilm formation –. The SSTI was allowed to progress for 48 h, at which point mice received either antibiotic treatment with IP injections of vancomycin or a vehicle control. After 48 hours of treatment, mice were euthanized, and individual lesions were excised to quantify the number of CFUs of each strain present. As a control, a subset of mice was harvested at 48 hours post-inoculation (prior to any antibiotic treatment) to determine relative fitness of the two strains in the absence of antibiotics. As shown in Figure S10, there were large differences in the response to a S. aureus skin infection between male and female mice, with female mice showing a significant reduction in the number of total CFUs even in the absence of antibiotic treatment, consistent with sex differences previously shown in S. aureus mouse skin infections. However, the changes within the ratio of mutant to wildtype (as measured by a competitive index), were relatively consistent across both sexes. Concentrations of arginine and citrulline present in the mouse skin were similar between the two sexes, and on a similar order of magnitude to the concentrations used in the in vitro experiments (Figure S11). Among all mice (male and female combined), in the absence of antibiotic treatment, there was a significant decrease in fitness of the argH ::Tn mutant relative to the parental control at both 2 DPI and 4 DPI (one-sample Wilcoxon test, p = 0.0066 and p < 0.0001, respectively) (Fig. 5d), in line with previous studies showing a virulence defect in an argH mutant during infection. A similar phenotype was observed when the male and female mice were analyzed individually (Figure S10). Conversely, the argH mutant had a higher competitive index in the vancomycin treatment group when compared to either the pretreatment or vehicle control treated groups (Fig. 5d), consistent with the hypothesis that lower levels of ArgH are beneficial to S. aureus during antibiotic treatment. These experiments support a role for the conversion of citrulline into arginine by ArgGH in influencing antibiotic tolerance during an infection.

### Efficacy and safety of an early oral switch in low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SABATO): an international, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^50e39ae4]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection is treated with at least 14 days of intravenous antimicrobials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of an early switch to oral therapy in patients at low risk for complications related to S aureus bloodstream infection.

Methods

In this international, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial done in 31 tertiary care hospitals in Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, adult patients with low-risk S aureus bloodstream infection were randomly assigned after 5–7 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy to oral antimicrobial therapy or to continue intravenous standard therapy. Randomisation was done via a central web-based system, using permuted blocks of varying length, and stratified by study centre. The main exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of complicated S aureus bloodstream infection, non-removable foreign devices, and severe comorbidity. The composite primary endpoint was the occurrence of any complication related to S aureus bloodstream infection (relapsing S aureus bloodstream infection, deep-seated infection, and mortality attributable to infection) within 90 days, assessed in the intention-to-treat population by clinical assessors who were masked to treatment assignment. Adverse events were assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study medication (safety population). Due to slow recruitment, the scientific advisory committee decided on Jan 15, 2018, to stop the trial after 215 participants were randomly assigned (planned sample size was 430 participants) and to convert the planned interim analysis into the final analysis. The decision was taken without knowledge of outcome data, at a time when 126 participants were enrolled. The new sample size accommodated a non-inferiority margin of 10%; to claim non-inferiority, the upper bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference (stratified by centre) had to be below 10 percentage points. The trial is closed to recruitment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01792804), the German Clinical trials register (DRKS00004741), and EudraCT (2013-000577-77).

Findings

Of 5063 patients with S aureus bloodstream infection assessed for eligibility, 213 were randomly assigned to switch to oral therapy (n = 108) or to continue intravenous therapy (n = 105). Mean age was 63.5 (SD 17.2) years and 148 (69%) participants were male and 65 (31%) were female. In the oral switch group, 14 (13%) participants met the primary endpoint versus 13 (12%) in the intravenous group, with a treatment difference of 0.7 percentage points (95% CI -7.8 to 9.1; p = 0.013). In the oral switch group, 36 (34%) of 107 participants in the safety population had at least one serious adverse event compared with 27 (26%) of 103 participants in the intravenous group (p = 0.29).

Interpretation

Oral switch antimicrobial therapy was non-inferior to intravenous standard therapy in participants with low-risk S aureus bloodstream infection. However, it is necessary to carefully assess patients for signs and symptoms of complicated S aureus bloodstream infection at the time of presentation and thereafter before considering early oral switch therapy.

### Secondary infections in patients with atopic dermatitis [^86e108f2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians have long since been aware that bacteria and other microorganisms play a role in the etiology of atopic dermatitis. Indeed, the immunological profile of atopy favors colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, and the bacteria are present in most patients with atopic dermatitis, even in the absence of skin lesions. Clinical signs of impetiginization, such as weeping and crusting, periauricular fissuration, or small superficial pustules are a sensitive indicator that the numbers of S. aureus may have increased and a clinical indication of secondary infected dermatitis. However, recent research that has focussed on the role of S. aureus in atopic dermatitis, offers a reversed perspective, by presenting evidence that the underlying pathology of atopic dermatitis, i.e. an alteration of the skin barrier and inflammation of the upper dermis, depends itself on the presence of an infectious process. In other words, secondary infection with S. aureus emerges as a cause of atopic dermatitis. Secondary infections due to fungi have, comparatively, received less attention, but there is evidence for a role for Malassezia spp. as a factor in dermatitis with a head and neck distribution pattern. Viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus, and mixed infections of intertriginous spaces, may complicate an underlying atopic dermatitis, but are not perceived as etiologic factors. Recent research has greatly contributed to our understanding of the pathophysiological potential of S.aureus superantigens in atopic dermatitis, suggesting that antibiotic therapy might be an important element in the therapeutic management of atopic dermatitis. At present, however, the clinical evidence is scarce with regards to demonstrating a clear advantage of combined anti-inflammatory and antibiotic treatment, compared with anti-inflammatory treatment alone. If there is a consensus that the presence of clinically infected lesions in atopic dermatitis warrants a course of specific antibiotic topical therapy, the clinical benefit of antibiotic agents in apparently uninfected atopic dermatitis, as present in the majority of patients, remains an open question. Moreover, the impact of adjuvant skin care on the cutaneous microflora needs to be quantified in order to properly assess the role of specific antibiotic therapy in clinically uninfected atopic dermatitis. In the meantime, secondary infections in atopic dermatitis remain a secondary problem in clinical atopic dermatitis management, and specific anti-infective therapy remains a method of fine-tuning for optimizing individual atopic dermatitis treatment.

### Counter inhibition between leukotoxins attenuates Staphylococcus aureus virulence [^0504e645]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

S taphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen capable of causing widespread infections and mortality in both the hospital and community settings. The increased incidence of community-acquired S. aureus infection is especially alarming because it occurs in healthy people who lack the underlying risk factors often associated with patients succumbing to S. aureus infections in nosocomial settings. The ability for S. aureus to invade and colonize multiple sites of infection is attributed to its large arsenal of virulence factors designed to avoid host immune responses, coupled with its rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Considering the growing numbers of infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains that now account for over half of all S. aureus infections, treatment options are rapidly diminishing. Among the virulence factors encoded by S. aureus are a family of five leukotoxins, which include the Panton–Valentine leukocidin (LukSF-PV), leukotoxin ED (LukED), gamma hemolysin (which exists as two toxins: HlgAB and HlgCB) and leukotoxin AB (LukAB, also known as LukGH). These toxins target an extensive range of the body's immune cells for destruction, which is thought to play a crucial role in immune evasion by S. aureus by promoting bacterial survival and proliferation.

### Neutrophil elastase limits spread of Staphylococcus aureus during skin infection [^88538c1f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Neutrophil elastase (NE), the main protease of neutrophils, is involved in many of their functions, including prevention of infections. Despite its general importance, NE was previously thought to play no role in infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, one of the leading bacterial pathogens. Here, using transgenic mice deficient in NE and a mouse model of localized skin infection, we demonstrate that NE is in fact needed for the containment of S. aureus and prevention of the systemic spread of this bacterium. This is apparently due to the role of NE in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

Organisms

Staphylococcus epidermidis

Infections caused by S epidermidis were not a significant indicator for treatment outcome in males. In an unadjusted sex-stratified analysis, S epidermidis associated with a 42% reduction in the odds of treatment failure for females (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.96, P = 0.035), but was not significant in the adjusted model.

Staphylococcus aureus

In an unadjusted sex-stratified analysis, S. aureus was a significant predictor of treatment failure for males (OR 1.91; 95% 1.32, 2.77; P = 0.001), but did not remain significant in the adjusted analysis. Infections caused by S aureus were not a significant indicator for treatment outcome in females.

Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus

In an unadjusted sex-stratified analysis, MSSA as a subgroup within S aureus infections was a significant predictor of treatment failure for males (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.67; P = 0.004) but did not remain significant in the adjusted analysis. Infections caused by MSSA as a subgroup within S aureus infections were not a significant indicator for treatment outcome in females.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^8d2db541]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in children with HIV — HIV infection appears to be a risk factor for MRSA infections in children and adults, but findings are conflicting about the relative contribution of immunosuppression versus the impact of social determinants of health; limited data suggest that children with HIV, like their uninfected counterparts, experience predominantly non-invasive, skin, and soft tissue infections as a result of community-associated MRSA strains and that greater immunosuppression may not confer greater risk of MRSA, and Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-susceptible and MRSA) should be considered in people with a recent viral infection (especially influenza) or complicated pneumonia.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^8bbee969]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is a common cause of severe community-acquired and hospital-acquired infection worldwide. We tested the hypothesis that adjunctive rifampicin would reduce bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death, by enhancing early S aureus killing, sterilising infected foci and blood faster, and reducing risks of dissemination and metastatic infection.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults (≥ 18 years) with S aureus bacteraemia who had received ≤ 96 h of active antibiotic therapy were recruited from 29 UK hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequential randomisation list to receive 2 weeks of adjunctive rifampicin (600 mg or 900 mg per day according to weight, oral or intravenous) versus identical placebo, together with standard antibiotic therapy. Randomisation was stratified by centre. Patients, investigators, and those caring for the patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was time to bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death (all-cause), from randomisation to 12 weeks, adjudicated by an independent review committee masked to the treatment. Analysis was intention to treat. This trial was registered, number ISRCTN37666216, and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Dec 10, 2012, and Oct 25, 2016, 758 eligible participants were randomly assigned: 370 to rifampicin and 388 to placebo. 485 (64%) participants had community-acquired S aureus infections, and 132 (17%) had nosocomial S aureus infections. 47 (6%) had meticillin-resistant infections. 301 (40%) participants had an initial deep infection focus. Standard antibiotics were given for 29 (IQR 18–45) days; 619 (82%) participants received flucloxacillin. By week 12, 62 (17%) of participants who received rifampicin versus 71 (18%) who received placebo experienced treatment failure or disease recurrence, or died (absolute risk difference -1.4%, 95% CI -7.0 to 4.3; hazard ratio 0.96, 0.68–1.35, p = 0.81). From randomisation to 12 weeks, no evidence of differences in serious (p = 0.17) or grade 3–4 (p = 0.36) adverse events were observed; however, 63 (17%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 39 (10%) in the placebo group had antibiotic or trial drug-modifying adverse events (p = 0.004), and 24 (6%) versus six (2%) had drug interactions (p = 0.0005).

Interpretation

Adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in adults with S aureus bacteraemia.
