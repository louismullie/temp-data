Diagnosis of pulmonary embolisim

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing suspected pulmonary embolism, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic stability and whether this is high-risk PE. Then, I should verify pretest probability using validated tools and PERC in low-risk patients. Next, I will review D-dimer thresholds, including age-adjusted and the 1000 ng/mL strategy, and check when to skip D-dimer. After that, I need to select imaging based on probability and contraindications, interpret results carefully, and consider special populations. Finally, I should confirm documentation, safety netting, and follow-up plans, including when to consider CTEPH screening if symptoms persist.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status, because hemodynamic instability immediately shifts the pathway to high-risk PE where I should not delay imaging or empiric therapy while arranging CTPA or bedside echocardiography, and I need to ensure I do not get distracted by noncritical steps in this scenario [^111m2sux] [^115wxPf2].

> Wait, let me verify the pretest probability step before ordering any tests, because all subsequent decisions hinge on it; I should use a validated clinical prediction rule such as Wells or the simplified revised Geneva, and in patients with low pretest probability I should apply PERC to see if any testing is needed at all, since PERC-negative patients have a very low likelihood of PE and can forgo D-dimer and imaging safely [^111sKa8J] [^117URCzd] [^1152amYf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about D-dimer in everyone; I should confirm that D-dimer is reserved for low or intermediate probability patients who do not meet PERC, and I must avoid D-dimer in high probability because a normal result cannot exclude PE and will only delay definitive imaging, which would be a harmful delay in that context [^117Kqscd] [^112UjLr8] [^114MVN56].

> I need to check D-dimer thresholds carefully; for patients older than 50 years, age-adjusted D-dimer using age × 10 ng/mL increases specificity while maintaining high sensitivity, and in selected low-probability patients a 1000 ng/mL threshold can be used to safely reduce imaging, as shown in the YEARS algorithm and supported by a recent interventional study using a simplified "PE is not the most likely diagnosis" approach with a 1000 ng/mL cutoff, which achieved very low failure rates and reduced CT utilization [^114ZGKy6] [^111LtTN7] [^111nTd1p].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 1000 ng/mL strategy might be broadly applicable, but I should double-check that it is best validated in low-probability patients or within structured algorithms like YEARS; the recent interventional data support safety when PE is not the most likely diagnosis, but I should be cautious extrapolating beyond those contexts and continue to anchor the age-adjusted threshold as standard for patients over 50 with non-high probability [^111nTd1p] [^114ZGKy6].

> Next, I should review imaging choices; for high pretest probability or unstable patients, I will proceed directly to CTPA if available, or bedside echocardiography if unstable and transport is risky, and I must not order D-dimer in this group because it will not change the need for imaging; for low or intermediate probability with positive D-dimer, CTPA is preferred, while V/Q scanning is reasonable when contrast is contraindicated or in pregnancy, and I should remember that a normal V/Q scan effectively excludes PE without further testing [^111m2sux] [^113KctUb] [^112S1dcD] [^115rydYp].

> I will now examine how to interpret imaging results; if CTPA shows a segmental or more proximal filling defect, I should confirm PE and move to risk stratification and treatment, whereas a normal CTPA in low or intermediate probability essentially excludes PE and no further testing is needed; if CTPA is nondiagnostic or subsegmental, I should consider bilateral leg ultrasound to look for proximal DVT, because finding proximal DVT confirms VTE and justifies anticoagulation even if the PE imaging is equivocal [^113ioWLG] [^113KctUb] [^113vNAQD].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant; I need to ensure radiation-sparing strategies are prioritized, typically starting with leg ultrasound and, if negative and suspicion remains, using a V/Q scan rather than CTPA when feasible, while still applying validated diagnostic approaches adapted for pregnancy and postpartum care to maintain safety for both mother and fetus [^11632NGd] [^11425t9v] [^115rydYp].

> Let me consider other special populations; in patients with contrast allergy or significant renal impairment, V/Q scanning or MRPA can be alternatives, though MRPA is generally not recommended to rule out PE in routine practice, and in recurrent PE with low pretest probability, a D-dimer–first strategy remains acceptable, though I should confirm local pathways and patient-specific factors before proceeding [^1136K6kV] [^111KJKnq].

> I should confirm documentation and safety netting; I need to record the pretest probability method, the D-dimer threshold used, the imaging rationale, and the results, and if PE is excluded, I should provide return precautions and arrange follow-up, with a low threshold to reconsider PE if symptoms persist or evolve, especially given the risk of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension after PE [^116dPC2d].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed overtesting and incidental findings; overuse of CTPA and D-dimer can cause harm through radiation, contrast nephropathy, cost, and overdiagnosis of small or subsegmental clots of uncertain significance, so adhering to validated algorithms and using higher D-dimer thresholds judiciously in low-risk patients helps mitigate these harms while preserving safety [^115xQJ3G] [^111LtTN7] [^111nTd1p].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: assess stability first, determine pretest probability with validated tools and PERC where appropriate, deploy D-dimer selectively with age-adjusted or 1000 ng/mL thresholds in the right patients, image directly in high probability or unstable patients, interpret results in clinical context with leg ultrasound when imaging is nondiagnostic, adapt for pregnancy and contraindications, and close with clear documentation and follow-up, because this strategy minimizes missed PE while reducing unnecessary imaging and harm [^112kKbjQ] [^113e1XSR] [^111LtTN7] [^111nTd1p].

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) relies on a **stepwise algorithm** that integrates clinical probability, D-dimer testing, and imaging [^112kKbjQ]. Use **validated clinical prediction rules** (Wells or Geneva) to stratify pretest probability [^111sKa8J] [^115nUopK]; in low-risk patients who meet all PERC criteria, no further testing is needed [^113dMkSt] [^117URCzd]. For low or intermediate probability, obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer [^116x4kmB], using age-adjusted thresholds (age × 10 μg/L) in patients > 50 years [^114ZGKy6]; a negative result safely excludes PE [^112J8XNL]. For high probability or positive D-dimer, proceed to imaging [^113JBqex]; CTPA is first-line [^116W1esb], with V/Q scan or compression ultrasonography as alternatives when CTPA is contraindicated [^115rydYp] [^113vNAQD]. This approach balances accuracy, safety, and resource use [^111LtTN7].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

PE presents with **nonspecific symptoms** — dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachycardia, and syncope — and has a broad differential, including pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and pneumothorax [^114XnYyJ] [^112kotWt]. Risk factors include recent surgery, immobilization, malignancy, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, prior VTE, and inherited thrombophilias [^114XnYyJ].

---

## Clinical prediction rules

Validated clinical prediction rules **estimate pretest probability** and guide testing [^115nUopK]. The Wells and Geneva scores are commonly used [^112XvjVG]:

| **Wells score** | **Points** |
|-|-|
| - Previous PE or DVT | 1.5 |
| - Heart rate > 100 bpm | 1.5 |
| - Recent surgery or immobilization | 1.5 |
| - Clinical signs of DVT | 3 |
| - Alternative diagnosis less likely than PE | 3 |
| - Hemoptysis | 1 |
| - Cancer | 1 |

---

Pretest probability categories: **low 0–1**, **intermediate 2–6**, and **high ≥ 7** [^113ShcWT].

---

## D-dimer testing

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product elevated in thrombosis; **high-sensitivity assays** have sensitivity ~97% and specificity ~41% [^1121HehZ]. It is most useful for excluding PE in low- and intermediate-risk patients [^116x4kmB]:

- **Low probability**: PERC-negative patients require no further testing [^113dMkSt] [^117URCzd].
- **Intermediate probability**: Use age-adjusted D-dimer (age × 10 μg/L) in patients > 50 years [^114ZGKy6] [^1145L4PW].
- **High probability**: Skip D-dimer; proceed directly to imaging [^113JBqex].

---

## Imaging modalities

Imaging is **required to confirm or exclude PE** [^117FMBJo]:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CTPA | First-line for high probability or positive D-dimer | High sensitivity/specificity; rapid | Radiation, contrast risks |
| V/Q scan | Contraindications to CTPA (contrast allergy, pregnancy, renal impairment) | No contrast; useful in pregnancy | Lower sensitivity; nondiagnostic results |
| Compression ultrasonography | Suspected DVT or alternative to CTPA | Detects DVT; no radiation | Limited by obesity, edema |

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Use V/Q scan or CTPA with shielding; avoid radiation when possible [^115rydYp] [^114ZHCnB].
- **Renal impairment**: Prefer V/Q scan or compression ultrasonography [^115rydYp].
- **Contrast allergy**: Use V/Q scan or compression ultrasonography [^115rydYp].

---

## Diagnostic algorithms

Recommended algorithms include:

- **Low probability**: Apply PERC; if negative, no further testing [^113dMkSt] [^117URCzd].
- **Intermediate probability**: Use age-adjusted D-dimer; if negative, exclude PE [^114ZGKy6] [^116gCFFG].
- **High probability**: Proceed directly to CTPA or V/Q scan [^113JBqex].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Overdiagnosis**: Increased detection of small, subsegmental PEs of uncertain clinical significance [^112bq84Q].
- **False positives**: D-dimer is elevated in cancer, infection, and inflammation [^notfound].
- **False negatives**: Occur in high pretest probability or early presentation [^117Kqscd].

---

## Recent advances

Recent advances include **age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds** [^1145L4PW], which reduce unnecessary imaging while maintaining safety [^1145L4PW], and **simplified algorithms** such as the YEARS rule, which reduce CT use without compromising safety [^111nTd1p]. The diagnosis of PE requires a **stepwise approach** integrating clinical probability, D-dimer testing, and imaging, balancing accuracy, safety, and resource use [^112kKbjQ].

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112kKbjQ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### D-dimer thresholds for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism based on a single question: is it the most likely diagnosis? A prospective, multicentre, open-label, single-arm interventional study [^111nTd1p]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

Validated diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism allow raising the D-dimer threshold to 1000 ng/mL in selected patients with a low probability of pulmonary embolism, but adherence to this strategy in routine practice remains poor. Retrospective studies suggest that these rules could be replaced by a single clinical question as to whether pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis. We aimed to assess the safety of a simplified approach that applies a 1000 ng/mL threshold when pulmonary embolism is unlikely and an age-adjusted threshold otherwise, including patients at a high probability for pulmonary embolism.

Methods

In this prospective interventional study in 13 French hospital emergency departments, patients aged ≥ 18 years with a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism, who were not on full-dose anticoagulant therapy and had not had a thromboembolic event in the past 6 months, were included. The intervention consisted of ruling out pulmonary embolism without chest imaging in patients for whom pulmonary embolism was not considered the most likely diagnosis and had a D-dimer value < 1000 ng/mL. The age-adjusted D-dimer threshold (500 ng/mL if aged < 50 years or age×10 ng/mL if aged ≥ 50 years) was used for the other patients. The primary outcome was the diagnostic failure rate (ie, occurrence of a thromboembolic event at 3 months of follow-up) among patients for whom pulmonary embolism was initially ruled out. Safety was established if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the diagnostic failure rate was less than 1·85% in patients for whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out at initial testing and in a subgroup of patients for whom it was ruled out without chest imaging. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06190392) and is complete.

Findings

Between Jan 16 and Sept 5, 2024, 1365 patients were screened for eligibility and 1221 were included, of whom 80 (7%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism at initial testing. Pulmonary embolism was not considered the most likely diagnosis for 997 patients. The diagnostic failure rate was 0·00% (95% CI 0·00–0·34) and was 0·12% (0·01–0·55) after multiple imputation for 33 patients with no available follow-up, both within the safety threshold. In the prespecified subgroup of 796 patients for whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out without chest imaging, the diagnostic failure rate was 0·00% (0·00–0·46), also within the safety threshold. The strategy had a 32% chest imaging rate (384 of 1217 patients), an absolute reduction of 19% (16–21) compared with the fixed 500 ng/mL D-dimer threshold strategy (609 [50%] of 1215). There were 16 deaths during the 3-month follow-up.

Interpretation

A global simplified strategy using a D-dimer threshold of 1000 ng/mL in patients for whom pulmonary embolism was not the most likely diagnosis, and an age-adjusted threshold for other patients, safely excluded the diagnosis. These findings indicate that this simplified strategy could safely reduce the use of chest imaging in the emergency department.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Pulmonary embolism: making sense of the diagnostic evaluation [^111c6F2c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the publication of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis in 1990, the diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary embolism continues to be approached in an inconsistent fashion. The reasons for this are unclear but likely have to do with inadequate methods for predicting pretest probability of disease and the inconvenience and perceived risk of pulmonary angiography. Because pulmonary embolism and its treatment carry substantial risk of morbidity and mortality, a consistent approach to evaluation is desirable. This article reviews large, prospective studies that suggest that it may be unnecessary to diagnose pulmonary embolism with the certainty that pulmonary angiography allows. Finally, the article proposes an algorithm that may be acceptable to patients and clinicians alike if safety is confirmed in future prospective studies.

This first of two practice reviews addresses pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis considering important aspects of PE clinical presentation and comparing evidence-based PE testing strategies. A companion paper addresses the management of PE. Symptoms and signs of PE are varied, and emergency physicians frequently use testing to 'rule out' the diagnosis in people with respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. The emergency clinician must balance the benefit of reassuring negative PE testing with the risks of iatrogenic harms from over investigation and overdiagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism [^1171fJ7r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a challenging pathology commonly faced by emergency physicians, and diagnosis and management remain a crucial skill set. Inherent to the challenge is the breadth of presentation, ranging from asymptomatic pulmonary emboli to sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis and exclusion have evolved over time and now use a combination of clinical decision calculators and updates to the classic d-dimer cutoffs. Management of pulmonary emboli revolves around appropriate anticoagulation, which for most of the patients will comprise newer oral agents. However, there remains a substantial degree of practice variation and ambiguity when it comes to higher risk patients with submassive or massive pulmonary emboli.

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

### Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^1176dRcj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have improved diagnostic accuracy and made management algorithms safer, easier to use, and well standardized. These diagnostic algorithms are mainly based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer measurement, and imaging tests-predominantly computed tomography pulmonary angiography. These diagnostic algorithms allow safe and cost-effective diagnosis for most patients with suspected PE. In this review, we summarize signs and symptoms of PE, current existing evidence for PE diagnosis, and focus on the challenge of diagnosing PE in special patient populations, such as pregnant women, or patients with a prior VTE. We also discuss novel imaging tests for PE diagnosis and highlight some of the additional challenges that might require adjustments to current diagnostic strategies, such as the reduced clinical suspicion threshold, resulting in a lower proportion of PE among suspected patients as well as the overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE.

### Diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism [^111fqhYG]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism often remains a difficult diagnosis for the clinician, particularly in patients with comorbidity factors. This is in contrast with the availability of effective treatment, which should be prescribed as soon as possible. To date, there is still no ideal diagnostic test that is accurate, safe, readily available and cost-effective. Recent technical advances in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory findings have raised new possibilities in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. This review covers the performance of different diagnostic tests, and focuses on the advantages and limitations of single diagnostic tests and the clinical usefulness of these tests in diagnostic strategies.

### Disparities in current pulmonary embolism management and outcomes: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111Wgdmb]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common cause of cardiovascular-associated morbidity and mortality. Although pulmonary embolism affects individuals from all demographics, the incidence of pulmonary embolism is higher among people from certain racial groups, reproductive-age women compared with age-matched men, and transgender people taking estrogen hormones. Furthermore, disparities may exist in the diagnosis or management strategies of pulmonary embolism associated with race, ethnicity, sex, or socioeconomic status, which may correlate with poorer downstream outcomes, including recurrent pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, or short- or long-term mortality. This scientific statement summarizes disparities in diagnosis, treatment strategies, and outcomes related to pulmonary embolism, and reviews approaches to create equitable pulmonary embolism care and address the knowledge gaps in the literature.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^113xn5sB]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Current diagnostic algorithms, combining clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although at costs of high numbers of CT-examinations. In view of cost- and time-saving as well as safety issues, several attempts have recently been undertaken to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Especially the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the potential for non-invasive exclusion of PE. Once the diagnosis of PE is established, immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin-K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients with use of clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers or imaging tests, aids physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcome, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients, who require closer monitoring and for whom recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy. This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

Venous thromboembolic disease (VTD), comprising venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, is responsible for innumerable deaths every day. Wide variance in its presentation and clinical manifestations and the resultant difficulties in achieving its diagnosis have confounded attempts to define optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies. Those strategies should be predicated on the understanding of the manifestations of VTD and of the attributes and interrelationship of the various modalities available for its diagnosis. This review will present an overview of the literature describing those modalities, their strengths and deficiencies, and their current value in algorithms for the diagnosis of VTD.

### Imaging of acute pulmonary embolism [^113NB91D]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) is a cardiovascular emergency associated with significant morbidity and a 5–35% mortality for untreated pulmonary embolism. If promptly diagnosed and treated, the mortality rate can be significantly reduced. Diagnosis of acute PE continues to be a clinical challenge, with diagnostic imaging playing an important role. This review discusses the clinical challenges of diagnosing acute PE, presents an evidence-based review of the current tests and ever-evolving imaging technology, and highlights special considerations related to radiation dose, contrast media use, and pregnant patients.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115j6zVt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^111hJdis]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a non-systematic review of the guidelines and literature, and expert consensus. Management in an individual patient should be based on clinical risk–benefit assessment, careful management of coagulation status and effective physician–patient communication. Structured follow-up post-acute PE is important to improve patient outcomes, including diagnosing CTEPH. How best to deliver such care and how best to structure follow-up PE clinics requires further evaluation.

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

### Pulmonary embolism [^113gaDHB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PE is one of the great challenges in medicine. It is a disease that carries with it a high mortality rate, yet no historical piece of information, physical examination finding, or diagnostic modality is perfect at excluding its possibility. Emergency physicians must be vigilant about considering PE in the differential diagnosis of a variety of presenting complaints and must use a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options as they manage patients with suspected or confirmed PE. The diagnostic options range from bedside diagnostic tests to highly specialized imaging available at only specialized institutions. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the diagnostic modalities assists the physician in employing the best test. Therapeutic options also vary widely and include anticoagulation, vena caval interruption, systemic thrombolysis, embolectomy, and other therapeutic adjuncts, such as ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Similarly, awareness of the indications and contraindications to the varied therapeutic agents ensures appropriate therapy when the diagnosis is made.

### Diagnosis and exclusion of pulmonary embolism [^112XvjVG]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to test for pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a lethal mistake, but PE and produces symptoms similar to many other diseases. Overtesting for PE has negative consequences.

Objectives

Use published evidence to create a rationale and safe diagnostic approach for ambulatory and emergency patients with suspected PE in 2017.

Findings

Pulmonary embolism need not be pursued in patients with no symptoms of PE in the present or recent history (dyspnea, chest pain, cough or syncope), and always normal vital signs. When clinicians have a low clinical suspicion for PE or a Wells score < 2, they can reasonably exclude PE with the Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC rule). For patients with a "PE-unlikely" pretest probability (Wells or simplified revised Geneva score < 5), PE can be ruled out with a normal or age-adjusted D-dimer concentrations. Other patients should undergo pulmonary vascular imaging, and the choices are discussed, including computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Conclusions

A thoughtful algorithm for PE exclusion and diagnosis requires pretest probability assessment in all patients, followed by selective use of clinical criteria, the quantitative D-dimer, and pulmonary vascular imaging.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure.

Summary

Despite advances in clinical decision support, the diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, treatment and disposition of emergency department patients with pulmonary embolism remain challenging. The use of diagnostic risk stratification tools and D‐dimer can decrease unnecessary exposure to radiation and intravenous contrast; however, D‐dimer is elevated in many conditions including normal pregnancy, so imaging is often indicated. Once diagnosed, prognostic risk stratification tools can inform treatment decisions across the risk spectrum, including identifying low‐risk patients with pulmonary embolism who can safely be treated at home. For patients requiring hospitalization, alternatives to unfractionated heparin can improve time to therapeutic anticoagulation and reduce treatment‐related bleeding risk.

### Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115MBX3q]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, lethal yet treatable disease. The clinical diagnosis of PE remains to be a problem due to the nonspecific presenting signs, symptoms, electrocardiographic findings, arterial blood gas abnormalities and chest X-ray changes. Despite these nonspecific clinical findings, clinicians are adept at assigning pretest probability using overall clinical assessment. Clinical models have been developed to improve the accuracy of pretest probability assessment. D-dimers are becoming a widely available clinical tool useful in the diagnostic management of suspected PE. The limitations of the imaging modalities for PE [ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning, spiral computerised tomography, pulmonary angiography and venous leg imaging] necessitate the use of these tests in series and in combination with clinical pretest probability assessment and D-dimer in diagnostic management algorithms. These algorithms permit safe diagnostic management of patients with suspected PE while limiting invasiveness, inaccessibility and expense.

### Pulmonary embolism [^1111SSxc]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is caused by emboli, which have originated from venous thrombi, travelling to and occluding the arteries of the lung. PE is the most dangerous form of venous thromboembolism, and undiagnosed or untreated PE can be fatal. Acute PE is associated with right ventricular dysfunction, which can lead to arrhythmia, haemodynamic collapse and shock. Furthermore, individuals who survive PE can develop post-PE syndrome, which is characterized by chronic thrombotic remains in the pulmonary arteries, persistent right ventricular dysfunction, decreased quality of life and/or chronic functional limitations. Several important improvements have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of acute PE in recent years, such as the introduction of a simplified diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE as well as phase III trials demonstrating the value of direct oral anticoagulants in acute and extended treatment of venous thromboembolism. Future research should aim to address novel treatment options (for example, fibrinolysis enhancers) and improved methods for predicting long-term complications and defining optimal anticoagulant therapy parameters in individual patients, and to gain a greater understanding of post-PE syndrome.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of test accuracy for the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism [^1121HehZ]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, potentially life-threatening yet treatable condition. Prompt diagnosis and expeditious therapeutic intervention is of paramount importance for optimal patient management. Our objective was to systematically review the accuracy of D-dimer assay, compression ultrasonography (CUS), computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning for the diagnosis of suspected first and recurrent PE. We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for eligible studies, reference lists of relevant reviews, registered trials, and relevant conference proceedings. 2 investigators screened and abstracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. We pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review included 61 studies. The pooled estimates for D-dimer sensitivity and specificity were 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.96–0.98) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.36–0.46) respectively, whereas CTPA sensitivity and specificity were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89–0.97) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97–0.99), respectively, and CUS sensitivity and specificity were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.31–0.66) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95–0.98), respectively. Three variations of pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity of V/Q scan were carried out, based on interpretation of test results. D-dimer had the highest sensitivity when compared with imaging. CTPA and V/Q scans (high probability scan as a positive and low/non-diagnostic/normal scan as negative) both had the highest specificity. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO as CRD42018084669.

### Differentiating low-risk and no-risk PE patients: the PERC score [^1121XDnd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging diagnoses in emergency medicine. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) score, a decision aid to reliably distinguish low-risk from very low-risk PE patients, has been derived and validated.

Clinical Question

Can a subset of patients with sufficiently low risk for PE be identified who require no diagnostic testing?

Evidence Review

The PERC score derivation and validation trials were located using PubMed and Web of Science. A critical appraisal of this research is presented.

Results

One single-center and another multi-center validation trial both confirmed that the eight-item PERC score identified a very low-risk subset of patients in whom PE was clinically contemplated with a negative likelihood ratio 0.17 (95% confidence interval 0.11–0.25) in the larger trial. If applied, the rule would have identified 20% of potential PE patients as very low risk.

Conclusion

The PERC score provides clinicians with an easily remembered, validated clinical decision rule that allows physicians to forego diagnostic testing for pulmonary embolus in a very low-risk population.

### Pulmonary embolism [^114XnYyJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism:

- **Definition**: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- **Pathophysiology**: Most pulmonary emboli (70–80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- **Epidemiology**: PE occurs in approximately 60–120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000–100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

The purpose of this essay is to highlight the clinical features and imaging findings associated with different types of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism.

Conclusion

Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism is an infrequent condition with various causes that can be life-threatening pathologic conditions. The entity presents a diagnostic challenge because of the low specificity of clinical symptoms and imaging signs. Awareness of the imaging features of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism facilitates correct diagnosis and leads to appropriate patient care.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

### Emergency evaluation for pulmonary embolism, part 2: diagnostic approach [^115cfMiL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In part 1 of this two-part review, we discussed which risk factors, historical features, and physical findings increase risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) in symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients.

Objectives

Use published evidence to describe criteria that a reasonable and prudent clinician can use to initiate and guide the process of excluding and diagnosing PE.

Discussion

The careful and diligent emergency physician can use clinical criteria to safely obviate a formal evaluation of PE, including the use of gestalt reasoning and the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC rule, Table 2, part 1). We present published clinical and radiographic features of patients with PE who eluded diagnosis in the ED. D-dimer can be used to exclude PE in many patients, and employing age-based adjustments to the threshold to define an abnormal value can further reduce patient exposure to pulmonary vascular imaging. Moreover, we discuss benefits, limitations, and potential harms of computed tomographic pulmonary vascular imaging relevant to patients and the practice of emergency care. We present algorithms to guide exclusion and diagnosis of PE in patients with suspected PE, including those who are pregnant.

Conclusions

Reasonable and prudent emergency clinicians can exclude PE in symptomatic ED patients on clinical grounds alone in many patients, and many more can have PE ruled out by use of the D-dimer.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: imaging in the emergency department [^117FMBJo]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition that requires accurate diagnostic imaging. Morbidity and mortality that result from PE can be reduced significantly if appropriate treatment is initiated early; this makes timely diagnosis imperative. Historically, the gold standard for the imaging of PE has been pulmonary angiography. Rapid advances in radiology and nuclear medicine have led to this modality largely being replaced by noninvasive techniques, most frequently multidetector helical CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). In cases in which CTPA is contraindicated, other modalities for diagnosis of PE include nuclear ventilation perfusion scanning, magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography, duplex Doppler ultrasonography for deep venous thrombosis, and echocardiography. This article reviews the literature on the role of these imaging modalities in the diagnosis of PE.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — Table 2 suggestions for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) specify the following actions using computed tomography (CT) and alternative tests. Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115771Z4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

American College of Physicians best practice advice — evaluation of suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE): Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered. Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should use age adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted. Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff. Clinicians should obtain imaging with CTPA in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve V/Q scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Is a V / Q scan based algorithm correctly used to diagnose acute pulmonary embolism? A daily practice survey [^114ruPRx]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic flow-charts for pulmonary embolism (PE) are widely implemented in the management of PE. A major drawback of a diagnostic PE algorithm is the use of several consecutive tests, which may be challenging in daily clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

Evaluation whether the use of an algorithm, starting with a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan after a normal chest X-ray, is correctly used in daily clinical practice for diagnosing acute PE. Consecutive V/Q scans of patients with suspected acute PE were assessed to evaluate the use of the predefined diagnostic algorithm.

Results

A chest X-ray had been performed in 101 of the 130 patients who underwent V/Q scanning; 89 patients had a normal chest X-ray. The V/Q scan was normal in 77/130 patients (59%), 30/130 patients (23%) had a non-high probability and 23/130 patients (18%) a high probability for PE. Only 3 of the 30 patients with a non-high V/Q scan (10%) underwent a computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scan, in contrast to the algorithm that required a CTPA scan in every patient with a non-high V/Q scan. Overall, the diagnostic strategy, starting with a V/Q scan as the baseline diagnostic tool with a prior chest X-ray, was appropriately followed in only 75/101 patients (74%).

Conclusions

A complex diagnostic algorithm for diagnosing PE is often not followed properly. This improper use of an algorithm could lead to a potential delay of establishing or excluding PE, a delay of therapy and/or unnecessary treatment. More simple algorithms could resolve this diagnostic management dilemma.

### Pulmonary embolism [^115V5a3a]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

### Diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism: a prediction model based on a patient data meta-analysis [^117NXgcK]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The diagnostic management of pulmonary embolism (PE) is a challenge faced by physicians in emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, and hospital wards, because signs and symptoms of PE are non-specific. The threshold to refer patients for (further) testing is usually low, since the consequences of a missed PE diagnosis can be serious and potentially fatal. PE can be confirmed or ruled out with sensitive and specific imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scanning.

The use of a diagnostic algorithm based on a clinical decision rule, consisting of medical history and physical examination findings, combined with D-dimer testing is recommended in patients with clinically suspected PE to exclude the disease and thereby reduce the need for CT scans. This is important since imaging results in radiation exposure, risk of contrast reactions or nephropathy, increased healthcare utilization and costs, overdiagnosis of small clots with uncertain relevance, and potential shortage of iodinated contrast material. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability and a D-dimer below a fixed or variable threshold, PE is considered excluded and imaging can be safely withheld. Nonetheless, up to 50% to 70% of patients with suspected PE with non-low clinical probability and elevated D-dimer levels are referred for imaging, and PE is not diagnosed in about 70% of those. Moreover, there are concerns about the generalizability of these algorithms given the differences in case-mix and PE prevalence across healthcare settings.

Thus far, the development of PE diagnostic scores has focused on simplicity, allowing the scores to be calculated at the bedside to rapidly decide which patients should be referred for D-dimer testing or directly for imaging. These scores are based on simple multivariable logistic regression models in which continuous variables were often categorized and potential interaction was ignored. Derivation of most PE diagnostic models also did not follow state-of-the-art methodological principles currently recommended including use of multiple imputation and internal-external validation. Finally, several diagnostic PE models include a subjective 'Gestalt' variable to indicate whether 'PE is the most likely diagnosis', which is difficult to standardize as it may vary depending on physician experience.

An alternative approach to the diagnostic management of suspected acute PE is to use a model which calculates an absolute PE probability for each patient, allowing the physician to make individualized management decisions, i.e. deciding whether imaging is required. Using a large individual patient dataset (IPD), we sought to derive and validate such a diagnostic model including objective clinical items and quantitative D-dimer testing.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152amYf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to define the diagnostic performance of pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) in deferring the need for D-dimer testing to rule out pulmonary embolism in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and all the evidence-based medicine reviews that included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through August 14, 2011, and hand searched references in potentially eligible articles and conference proceedings of major emergency medicine organizations for the previous 2 years. We selected studies that reported diagnostic performance of PERC, reported original research, and were conducted in the ED, with no language restrictions. Two investigators independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. We used contingency tables to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios.

Results

We found 12 qualifying cohorts (studying 13,885 patients with 1,391 pulmonary embolism diagnoses), 10 prospective and 2 retrospective, from 6 countries. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios for 10 included studies were 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 0.98), 0.23 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.24), 1.24 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.30), and 0.17 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.23), respectively. Significant heterogeneity was observed in specificity (I(2) = 97.2%) and positive likelihood ratio (I(2) = 84.2%).

Conclusion

The existing literature suggests consistently high sensitivity and low but acceptable specificity of the PERC to rule out pulmonary embolism in patients with low pretest probability.

Remarks state that validated clinical decision rules were used to assess clinical probability of PE in studies, the Geneva score has been validated only in an outpatient population, if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used this recommendation corresponds to the "likely PE" category, and the strategy assumes optimal test conditions with suboptimal CTPA possibly requiring repeat testing.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^11136L5F]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Baseline measurement

A baseline audit was designed to investigate the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department in which we compared current practice in two emergency departments within the hospital network to a set standard. The standard which was used was based on the NICE guideline on diagnosis of venous thromboembolism but with the addition that the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria could also be used to differentiate low risk from no risk pulmonary embolism therefore avoiding unnecessary d-dimer use in very low risk patients.

Data was collected over a four week period and aimed to include all patients where the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was considered. Search criteria, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria used were identical to those used in the subsequent PDSA cycles and re-audit. The baseline audit was carried out over a four week period in March 2015 and the re-audit carried out over a four week period in June 2015.

Patients to be included were identified through a search of electronic patient records by either diagnosis or presenting symptoms.

Search Criteria:

Patients either admitted to a ward or the emergency observation unit with diagnosis of 'PE' or 'PE for exclusion'
Patients attending the emergency department with symptoms that could be suggestive of pulmonary embolism (chest pain/shortness of breath/haemoptysis/cough)

Inclusion Criteria:

Adults attending the emergency department who had either a d-dimer (where the consideration of PE was documented in the notes), a CTPA, or a V/Q scan requested.
Patients presenting with dyspnoea, chest pain, haemptysis, or cough in whom a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was considered.

Exclusion Criteria:

Pregnant women
Patients under 18
Investigations requested outside of the emergency department (e.g. by GP/inpatient team)

### Simplified diagnostic management of suspected pulmonary embolism (the YEARS study): a prospective, multicentre, cohort study [^111LtTN7]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Validated diagnostic algorithms in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism are often not used correctly or only benefit subgroups of patients, leading to overuse of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The YEARS clinical decision rule that incorporates differential D-dimer cutoff values at presentation, has been developed to be fast, to be compatible with clinical practice, and to reduce the number of CTPA investigations in all age groups. We aimed to prospectively evaluate this novel and simplified diagnostic algorithm for suspected acute pulmonary embolism.

Methods

We did a prospective, multicentre, cohort study in 12 hospitals in the Netherlands, including consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary embolism between Oct 5, 2013, to July 9, 2015. Patients were managed by simultaneous assessment of the YEARS clinical decision rule, consisting of three items (clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis, haemoptysis, and whether pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis), and D-dimer concentrations. In patients without YEARS items and D-dimer less than 1000 ng/mL, or in patients with one or more YEARS items and D-dimer less than 500 ng/mL, pulmonary embolism was considered excluded. All other patients had CTPA. The primary outcome was the number of independently adjudicated events of venous thromboembolism during 3 months of follow-up after pulmonary embolism was excluded, and the secondary outcome was the number of required CTPA compared with the Wells' diagnostic algorithm. For the primary outcome regarding the safety of the diagnostic strategy, we used a per-protocol approach. For the secondary outcome regarding the efficiency of the diagnostic strategy, we used an intention-to-diagnose approach. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR4193.

Findings

3616 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism were screened, of whom 151 (4%) were excluded. The remaining 3465 patients were assessed of whom 456 (13%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism at baseline. Of the 2946 patients (85%) in whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out at baseline and remained untreated, 18 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic venous thromboembolism during 3-month follow-up (0·61%, 95% CI 0·36–0·96) of whom six had fatal pulmonary embolism (0·20%, 0·07–0·44). CTPA was not indicated in 1651 (48%) patients with the YEARS algorithm compared with 1174 (34%) patients, if Wells' rule and fixed D-dimer threshold of less than 500 ng/mL would have been applied, a difference of 14% (95% CI 12–16).

Interpretation

In our study pulmonary embolism was safely excluded by the YEARS diagnostic algorithm in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The main advantage of the YEARS algorithm in our patients is the absolute 14% decrease of CTPA examinations in all ages and across several relevant subgroups.

Funding

This study was supported by unrestricted grants from the participating hospitals.

### Effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold on thromboembolic events in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: a randomized clinical trial [^1145L4PW]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study MODIGLIA-NI was published by Yonathan Freund and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the trial question was: what is the effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in ED patients with suspected PE? In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the population was: 1414 patients (823 female, 591 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PE rule-out criteria rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE. The key exclusion criteria were high or low clinical probability of PE; pregnancy; other obvious cause for chest pain, syncope or dyspnea; concurrent anticoagulation treatment. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the interventions were: n = 648 modified diagnostic strategy (use of YEARS rule combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing) n = 623 a conventional diagnostic strategy (test with D-dimer using the age-adjusted threshold level). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in VTE at 3 months (0.15% vs. 0.8%; AD -0.64%, 97.5% CI -Infinity to 0.21). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in need of chest imaging (30.4% vs. 40%; AD -8.7%, 95% CI -13.8 to -3.5) Significant increase in ED median length of stay (6 hours vs. 6 hours; AD 1.6 hours, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.9). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PE rule-out criteria rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE, modified diagnostic strategy was noninferior to a conventional diagnostic strategy with respect to VTE at 3 months.

### Beyond pulmonary embolism; nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism as diagnostic challenges [^115cfuX8]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism (NTPE) is less well understood and is encountered less frequently than pulmonary embolism from venous thrombosis. NTPE results from embolization of nonthrombotic material to the pulmonary vasculature originating from many different cell types as well as nonbiologic or foreign materials. For many radiologists NTPE is a challenging diagnosis, presenting nonspecific or unusual imaging findings in the setting of few or unusual clinical signs. The aim of this paper is to review the pathophysiology of diverse causes of NTPE, which should aid radiologists to better understand and, more importantly, diagnose these infrequent events.

Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (adult), low pretest probability — For low PTP/prevalence (≤ 5%), the American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel recommends using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding PE in a population with low prevalence/PTP (≤ 5%), followed by ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for patients requiring additional testing. If D-dimer is not readily available, alternate acceptable strategies include performing VQ scan or CTPA alone. The document specifies a strong recommendation for D-dimer and a conditional recommendation for VQ scan or CTPA alone. Remarks state that for patients presenting to an emergency department with a low probability of PE, the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) may be used to determine whether D-dimer testing is warranted, that validated clinical decision rules were used and the Geneva score has been validated on an outpatient population, that if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used this corresponds to the "unlikely PE" category, that a decision to start with D-dimer assumes timely results and cost offset by avoiding unnecessary VQ or CTPA, and that if the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^114ZHCnB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough and haemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing (d-dimer) but relatively significant potential adverse events (radiation and contrast associated complications) with more invasive testing such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist in an attempt to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments in which this project was undertaken there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism which involves appropriate use of the Wells scoring system.

Below is a summary of these guidelines:

Patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism should all have an assessment of their general medical history, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray. All patients with suspected pulmonary embolism should have their probability of pulmonary embolism assessed using the two-level Pulmonary Embolism Wells score.

Patients with a likely two-level Wells score should NOT have a d-dimer and be offered CTPA with the exception of patients with contrast allergy, renal impairment, or in whom risk of irradiation is high who should instead be offered a Ventilation Perfusion (V/Q) scan. All patients not able to have immediate imaging should have interim parenteral anticoagulant therapy.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^114WYAgD]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — epidemiology, sources, and outcomes are summarized as follows: PE occurs in 250,000 patients annually, and the vast majority (90%–95%) arise from deep vein thrombosis of the legs, most involving proximal veins; additional sources include mobile masses, endocarditis, thrombi on indwelling lines or leads, and thrombi or tumors from right-heart structures. PE is the third most common cause of vascular death after myocardial infarction and stroke and the leading preventable cause of death in hospital patients; about 10% or more of symptomatic cases are rapidly fatal, another 5% die after starting treatment, about a third are left with residual symptoms, and 2% develop thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension due to unresolved PE.

### Symptomatic subsegmental pulmonary embolism: what is the next step? [^112bq84Q]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

The introduction of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has led to an increase in the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis. However, the case fatality rate is lower and the mortality rates of PE have remained unchanged, suggesting a lower severity of illness. Specifically, the multiple-detector CTPA increased the rate of subsegmental filling defect reported in patients with suspected PE. Whether these filling defects reported on CTPA would correlate with true subsegmental PE (SSPE) on pulmonary angiography or are actually artifacts is unknown. The inter-observer agreement for SSPE diagnosis among radiologists with varied levels of experience is low (κ of 0.38; 95% CI, 0.0–0.89). Furthermore, the clinical importance of a symptomatic SSPE diagnosed by CTPA is unclear. SSPE are frequent on pulmonary angiography in patients with a low probability ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan for suspected PE. Several prospective management cohort studies have demonstrated that patients with low or intermediate V/Q scan results can be safely managed without anticoagulation by combining the scan results with the pretest probability (PTP) of PE and compression ultrasonography. Although clinical equipoise exists, the majority of patients diagnosed with SSPE on CTPA are currently treated with anticoagulant therapy. Only a small number of patients with SSPE diagnosed by CTPA and without DVT who did not receive anticoagulation treatment have been reported in the literature. None of these patients suffered recurrent symptomatic VTE (PE or DVT) during the 3-month follow-up period (0%; 95% CI, 0–7.4%), suggesting that SSPE might be clinically unimportant. These conclusions are only hypothesis generating and need to be confirmed in prospective clinical management studies before changing clinical practice.

### Rapid systematic review: age-adjusted D-dimer for ruling out pulmonary embolism [^115srCkp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a disease diagnosed relatively frequently in emergency departments (EDs). Evidence suggests that improved decision making may decrease inappropriate testing, unnecessary radiation exposure, and non-beneficial treatment. Several studies have looked at the utility and safety of age-adjusting the D-dimer levels used to safely rule out PE.

Objective

This rapid systematic review sought to answer the question: Can an age-adjusted D-dimer be used to safely rule out PE in patients over 50 years old?

Methods

We performed a structured review of PubMed from January 2012 to January 2018 limited to reports involving human subjects and written in the English language and containing relevant keywords. The highest-quality studies were then reviewed in a structured format.

Results

One hundred and eleven papers were identified for further review. Eight articles were determined to be appropriate for inclusion in this summary. These studies all used patient age (in years over 50) × 10 μg/L (fibrinogen equivalent units) as their definition of an age-adjusted D-dimer.

Conclusions

Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff values, in combination with a non-high clinical probability, is safe and effective to essentially rule out PE in ED patients.

### Diagnostic approaches to possible pulmonary embolism… [^115d2mZo]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is not sufficiently reliable, as evidenced by the fact that the condition is confirmed in only 30 percent of persons who are suspected of having the condition. Various methods are currently used to aid in evaluation, but they also have limitations. Ryu and colleagues discuss the problems encountered with the traditional approaches to diagnosis of PE and propose the use of computed tomographic angiography as an important alternative diagnostic strategy. Helical and electron-beam CT scanning facilitate the diagnosis of acute and chronic PE. They are approximately 90 percent sensitive and 90 percent specific in detecting proximal PE. Because these two techniques are far less accurate at detecting peripheral emboli in the subsegmental arteries, the minimum sensitivity and specificity of CT angiography in diagnosing PE in all vessels are 53 percent and 75 percent, respectively.

A unique advantage to CT angiography is its ability to reveal intrathoracic diseases, such as neoplasms and pneumonia, to explain clinical symptoms that might otherwise suggest PE. According to the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis study, low-, intermediate- and high-probability scan results had positive predictive values of 16 percent, 33 percent and 88 percent, respectively, in the diagnosis of PE. Pretest clinical probability can be applied to the results of ventilation-perfusion scanning to improve reliability. However, in most patients additional testing is still required to confirm or exclude the presence of PE. The use of magnetic resonance angiography as a diagnostic tool in cases of suspected PE has been investigated as well. Its sensitivity ranges from 75 percent to 100 percent, and its specificity ranges from 42 percent to 100 percent. Diagnostic accuracy can be improved with gadolinium contrast enhancement.

An advantage to this method is that magnetic resonance venography of the legs and pelvis could be included to detect deep venous thrombosis as well. Currently, CT scanning is preferred because it is faster and less expensive. The authors provide a diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE that incorporates clinical suspicion, d-dimer level and radiologic testing. If the suspicion for PE is low, a normald-dimer level can exclude the diagnosis. If the clinical suspicion is moderate to high, the authors suggest that CT angiography is an appropriate initial diagnostic method. When the use of contrast dye is contraindicated, ventilation-perfusion scanning and sonography of the lower extremities are options.

### Diagnosing pulmonary embolism… [^115kods3]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

However, he did recently drive eight hours from Orlando with his grandchildren. His heart rate is 104 beats per minute. What is the probability that he has pulmonary embolism and, based on his risk level, what tests should you run in order to rule in or rule out PE. One of the strengths of an evidence-based approach to diagnosis is that it allows you to tailor the diagnostic strategy to the patient. Rather than taking a "one size fits all" approach that over-investigates patients who are at low risk and may miss disease in patients who are at high risk, you can use the information from your clinical evaluation to guide the selection of tests and their interpretation. Several groups have developed and validated protocols for the diagnosis of PE that rely on the clinical assessment, D-dimer test, ventilation-perfusion scan, ultrasound of the proximal leg veins and helical computed tomography scanning.

The protocol is based on the finding that patients with a low clinical probability and a negative noninvasive test almost certainly do not have PE, while patients with a high clinical probability and a positive noninvasive test almost certainly do. Those with an intermediate clinical probability or an indeterminate noninvasive test require further rounds of testing and closer follow-up. However, a positive D-dimer does not rule in the diagnosis; it indicates further confirmatory testing. Conversely, helical CT is very good at ruling in disease when intraluminal filling defects in segmental or larger pulmonary arteries are seen, but it is unhelpful if results are normal or indeterminate. Patients with non-diagnostic V/Q scans and helical CT scans need further testing with ultrasonography of the leg veins to help diagnose or exclude PE. The diagnosis In the case of Mr. Smith, our fictitious patient, the probability of PE is moderate. Following the protocol, you would send him for a stat D-dimer test and a helical CT scan. If the D-dimer turned out to be negative, this would not be enough to exclude PE, given the intermediate clinical risk. If we assume that the helical CT revealed an intraluminal filling defect in the segmental arteries, it would confirm the diagnosis of PE. Had the helical CT shown only a subsegmental intraluminal filling defect, further testing would have been indicated to help establish the diagnosis.

### Diagnosing patients with pulmonary embolism… [^1159P15n]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Because untreated pulmonary embolism can be rapidly fatal or cause permanent disability from pulmonary hypertension, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is essential. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are closely associated. The approach to patients with signs and symptoms of PE needs to be developed from published research about new diagnostic modalities allowing the highest level of accuracy. The American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies Committee and the Clinical Policies Subcommittee on Suspected Pulmonary Embolism reviewed and analyzed the medical literature regarding the diagnosis of PE in adults. The committee placed emphasis on the following topics: the diagnostic use of D-dimer, ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and spiral computed tomographic angiography in the evaluation of PE, and therapeutic indications for fibrinolytic therapy in PE.

Initially, the pretest probability of PE can be determined by one of several sets of explicit criteria that divide patients into low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk categories. The first critical question looked at the usefulness of a negative d-dimer test to exclude PE. Because D-dimer levels increase with fibrinolysis in the presence of endovascular thrombus, patients with a low probability by pretest determination who have a negative D-dimer result can be ruled out as having a PE using a turbidimetric or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, or using whole blood cell qualitative assay with a Wells' pretest score of 2 or less.

The addition of duplex ultrasonography of the lower extremities to help identify the probability of PE in patients with nondiagnostic V/Q scan offers low sensitivity and does not exclude PE in patients with nondiagnostic V/Q scan and non-low pretest probability. A normal V/Q scan in patients with low-to-moderate pretest probability excludes clinically significant PE. In patients with low-to-moderate pretest probability who have a nondiagnostic V/Q scan, PE can be excluded by the following methods: a negative turbidimetric or ELISA d-dimer; a negative whole blood cell qualitative d-dimer assay in combination with a Wells' score of 4 or less; a negative single bilateral venous ultrasonographic scan; or a negative serial bilateral venous ultrasonographic scan.
