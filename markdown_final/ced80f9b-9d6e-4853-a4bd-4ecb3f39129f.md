## Question

What is the management for a patient with a fib diagnosed 10 months ago, but still having symptomatic palpitation while on metoprolol?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of a patient with atrial fibrillation diagnosed 10 months ago who continues to experience symptomatic palpitations despite being on metoprolol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the diagnosis and rhythm burden with appropriate monitoring. Then, I should assess whether current rate control is adequate and optimized. Next, I will weigh rate versus rhythm control strategies in light of persistent symptoms. After that, I need to choose an evidence-based rhythm-control option if indicated, and finally, I should ensure anticoagulation and stroke prevention are addressed while considering ablation if drug therapy fails, with close follow-up and safety monitoring throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and avoid premature conclusions. A 10-month history of atrial fibrillation with ongoing palpitations suggests symptomatic, likely paroxysmal or persistent AF where symptoms persist despite a beta-blocker, which often signals either insufficient rate control, a need for rhythm control, or a misclassification of the arrhythmia burden and triggers, so I should verify the diagnosis and symptom–rhythm correlation with objective monitoring before escalating therapy [^114DzV8E] [^1164BMnx].

> I need to check the diagnostic foundation and rhythm burden. Wait, let me verify that the original diagnosis was made on a 12-lead ECG and that recent ECGs still show AF when symptomatic. If not, I should obtain a 12-lead ECG now to document rhythm at baseline and during symptoms. I should also quantify burden and correlate symptoms with arrhythmia using ambulatory monitoring, and a 2-week event or patch monitor provides the best diagnostic yield-to-cost ratio in palpitations of uncertain etiology, with Holter if episodes are very frequent. This helps distinguish AF from other SVTs and clarifies whether palpitations align temporally with documented AF episodes [^1164BMnx] [^1115kjhj].

> Next, I should review whether current metoprolol therapy has achieved adequate rate control. Hold on, I should verify formulation and dose, because metoprolol succinate extended-release can be dosed once daily up to 200 mg, whereas metoprolol tartrate is typically 25–200 mg twice daily for AF rate control; many patients remain symptomatic due to undertitration rather than treatment failure. I need to check resting and exertional heart rates and adjust to a lenient target of resting HR less than 110 bpm initially, reserving stricter targets for persistent symptoms, while watching for hypotension, bradycardia, or worsening heart failure during up-titration [^1111A18w] [^1122zFzc] [^115yL76f] [^115wrbBH].

> If optimized rate control still leaves the patient symptomatic, I should consider a rhythm-control strategy. Let me think about guideline direction: multiple societies recommend offering rhythm control when symptoms persist despite adequate rate control or when rate control is unlikely to resolve symptoms; this applies here given ongoing palpitations on metoprolol. I should confirm there are no contraindications to rhythm-control agents, particularly structural heart disease or ischemia, before proceeding, and document shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^112XuvQr] [^113AFDNx].

> For pharmacologic rhythm control, I should confirm the substrate and select an appropriate antiarrhythmic. Flecainide or propafenone are reasonable first-line choices in patients with normal left ventricular function and no significant structural heart disease or coronary artery disease, with the caveat that I must co-prescribe a nodal-blocking agent such as metoprolol, diltiazem, or verapamil to mitigate risk of 1:1 atrial flutter conduction; sotalol is an alternative when structural heart disease is absent, with close QT and renal monitoring, while amiodarone is reserved for refractory cases due to long-term toxicity [^113AFDNx] [^111dzcFM] [^113dzNCg] [^113SZaLd].

> But wait, what if rhythm-control drugs are contraindicated or fail. I should double-check candidacy for catheter ablation; contemporary guidance supports offering ablation for symptomatic, drug-refractory AF, with pulmonary vein isolation achieving durable rhythm control in appropriately selected patients. Cost-effectiveness modeling and expert consensus favor ablation over chronic medical therapy in symptomatic patients with recurrent episodes, particularly when quality of life is impacted, though patient-specific risks and expectations must be reviewed [^notfound].

> I need to ensure stroke prevention is addressed regardless of rate or rhythm strategy. Hold on, I should verify the CHA2DS2-VASc score and current anticoagulation status. Direct oral anticoagulants are preferred over warfarin for nonvalvular AF unless there is moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve, and I should reassess bleeding risk and drug–drug interactions when adding antiarrhythmics or changing metoprolol dose [^113NEQ5v].

> I will now examine modifiable triggers and comorbidities that could perpetuate symptoms. Let me consider sleep apnea, obesity, hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, alcohol and caffeine intake, and deconditioning, because addressing these can reduce AF burden and symptom severity; if palpitations are activity-limited, I should confirm adequacy of rate control during exertion and adjust therapy accordingly, since exercise-related symptoms are common in inadequately controlled AF [^1135qgne] [^1111A18w].

> Next, I should review a follow-up cadence and safety checks. I need to check in within 4–6 weeks after any medication change to reassess symptoms, heart rate control, blood pressure, and adverse effects. If rhythm control is pursued, I should arrange ECGs to monitor for proarrhythmia, QT prolongation with sotalol, and drug interactions, and repeat echocardiography if there is concern for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or structural remodeling. If catheter ablation is planned, pre-procedural imaging and anticoagulation bridging per institutional protocol should be verified [^113dzNCg].

> Let me summarize the decision flow to ensure nothing is missing. First, confirm AF with objective monitoring and exclude mimics. Second, optimize metoprolol to guideline-concordant dosing and rate targets. Third, if symptoms persist, pivot to rhythm control with flecainide or propafenone plus a nodal blocker in appropriate patients, or sotalol with close surveillance, reserving amiodarone for refractory cases. Fourth, consider pulmonary vein isolation ablation for drug-refractory symptoms. Fifth, maintain anticoagulation based on CHA2DS2-VASc. And sixth, address lifestyle and comorbidities with structured follow-up and safety monitoring at each step [^1111A18w] [^113AFDNx] [^112XuvQr] [^113NEQ5v].

---

For persistent palpitations despite metoprolol in atrial fibrillation, the next step is to **titrate metoprolol to the maximum tolerated dose** [^1111A18w] and add a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (diltiazem or verapamil) if needed [^notfound]. If symptoms persist, consider rhythm control with **flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone** [^113AFDNx], selected based on structural heart disease and comorbidities [^113AFDNx]. If drug therapy fails or is not tolerated, refer for **catheter ablation** [^112XuvQr]. Throughout, ensure anticoagulation per CHA2DS2-VASc, monitor for bradycardia or hypotension, and adjust therapy to patient comorbidities and preferences [^1111A18w].

---

## Evaluate current metoprolol therapy

- **Assess dose and adherence**: Confirm the current metoprolol dose, formulation (immediate-release vs. extended-release), and adherence [^113WfUdP]. The usual effective dose range for metoprolol succinate is 25–200 mg daily, and for metoprolol tartrate, 25–100 mg twice daily [^115wrbBH] [^112VaomF].

- **Titrate to maximum tolerated dose**: If the patient is not at the maximum dose, titrate metoprolol to the highest tolerated dose, monitoring for bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue [^116qTCsE].

- **Consider switching formulations**: If using immediate-release metoprolol, consider switching to extended-release for improved adherence and smoother rate control [^notfound].

---

## Add or switch rate-control agents

If symptoms persist despite optimized metoprolol, **add a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker** (diltiazem or verapamil) to achieve stricter rate control [^notfound]. Choose the agent based on comorbidities, as both are effective for rate control [^1111A18w].

---

## Consider rhythm-control strategies

If rate control is inadequate or symptoms persist, **consider rhythm control** using antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation [^112XuvQr]:

| **Antiarrhythmic drug** | **Indication** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Flecainide or propafenone | Normal LV function, no structural heart disease | Monitor for proarrhythmia, QT prolongation, and drug interactions [^notfound] |
| Sotalol | Normal LV function, no significant QT prolongation | Monitor QT interval, renal function, and electrolytes [^113dzNCg] |
| Amiodarone | Structural heart disease or LV dysfunction | Monitor for pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, and ocular toxicity [^notfound] |

---

Catheter ablation is appropriate for **symptomatic AF refractory to medical therapy**, particularly in younger patients or those with paroxysmal AF, with high success and low complication rates in experienced centers [^notfound].

---

## Address modifiable risk factors and lifestyle modifications

- **Hypertension**: Optimize blood pressure control to reduce AF burden and symptoms [^notfound].

- **Obesity**: Weight loss and lifestyle modifications can reduce AF recurrence and symptom burden.

- **Alcohol and caffeine**: Limit or avoid excessive intake.

- **Sleep apnea**: Screen and treat obstructive sleep apnea [^notfound].

---

## Anticoagulation management

Ensure anticoagulation per CHA2DS2-VASc score; **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred** unless contraindicated (e.g. mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis) [^113NEQ5v].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly reassess symptoms, heart rate control, and adverse effects, adjusting therapy as needed [^1135qgne]. Provide patient education on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and when to seek medical attention [^1111TJXg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Titrate metoprolol**: Increase to maximum tolerated dose.

- **Add CCB**: Consider diltiazem or verapamil if needed.

- **Rhythm control**: Consider antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation if symptoms persist.

- **Risk factors**: Address modifiable risks and lifestyle factors.

- **Anticoagulation**: Ensure appropriate anticoagulation.

- **Follow-up**: Regular monitoring and patient education.

---

Persistent palpitations despite metoprolol in AF warrant **optimization of rate control**, consideration of rhythm-control strategies, and addressing modifiable risk factors. Individualize therapy to comorbidities, patient preferences, and symptom burden, with regular follow-up to adjust treatment as needed.

### Diagnostic approach to palpitations [^1115kjhj]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Palpitations-sensations of a rapid or irregular heartbeat-are most often caused by cardiac arrhythmias or anxiety. Most patients with arrhythmias do not complain of palpitations. However, any arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular tachycardia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations should be considered as potentially more serious if they are associated with dizziness, near-syncope, or syncope. Nonarrhythmic cardiac problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis, and congestive heart failure, and noncardiac problems, such as hyperthyroidism, vasovagal syncope, and hypoglycemia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations also can result from stimulant drugs, and over-the-counter and prescription medications. No cause for the palpitations can be found in up to 16 percent of patients. Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring usually is indicated if the etiology of palpitations cannot be determined from the patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG. When palpitations occur unpredictably or do not occur daily, an initial two-week course of continuous closed-loop event recording is indicated. Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours may be appropriate in patients with daily palpitations. Trans-telephonic event monitors are more effective and cost-effective than Holter monitors for most patients.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

Atrial fibrillation rate control — comparative drug effects and emergency department outcomes show heart rate reductions across agents and similar acute care outcomes between classes. In a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, crossover study, the 24-hour mean heart rate was 96 ± 12 bpm at baseline (no treatment), 75 ± 10 bpm with diltiazem, 81 ± 11 bpm with verapamil, 82 ± 11 bpm with metoprolol, and 84 ± 11 bpm with carvedilol, with all drugs significantly reducing heart rate versus baseline. In a retrospective cohort from two urban emergency departments, a total of 259 consecutive patients were enrolled, with 100 receiving calcium channel blockers and 159 receiving beta blockers; twenty-seven percent of patients taking beta blockers were admitted, while 31.0% of patients taking calcium channel blockers were admitted, with no significant differences in emergency department length of stay, adverse events, or 7- or 30-day revisits. A follow-up analysis of the AFFIRM study reported no difference in all hospitalization and all-cause mortality among participants receiving beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or digoxin as a single rate-control agent at baseline.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: updated guidance from the AHA… [^113NEQ5v]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Direct oral anticoagulants are recommended over warfarin for AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical valve. Warfarin is still recommended for mitral stenosis and mechanical valves.
- Although CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores of 0 for men and 1 for women do not require treatment, scores of 1 for men and 2 for women are indeterminate and anticoagulation may be considered by shared decision-making. Direct oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are preferred to warfarin unless the patient has concomitant moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Based on new data, the recommended set-points for anticoagulation have been increased, and the previous recommendation to prescribe an anticoagulant for all patients with AF who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack has been removed.

For patients taking warfarin, an international normalized ratio test is recommended at least every week at the start of treatment and monthly when stable within the recommended range. Warfarin is the recommended anticoagulant for patients with AF and moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Dabigatran should be avoided in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve. Renal and hepatic function should be assessed before initiating direct oral anticoagulant therapy, then at least each year thereafter. Anticoagulant therapy is not necessary for men with AF and a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 0 or for women with AF and a score of 1, except in the presence of moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Warfarin or apixaban can be considered in men with AF, end-stage renal disease or on dialysis, and a CHA.

Based on expert opinion, patients with AF without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve who are taking warfarin, but whose international normalized ratio is not being maintained in a therapeutic range, should have their treatment regimen changed to a direct oral anticogulant. Because there are no data indicating that the benefits are greater than the harms, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban should be avoided in patients with AF and ESRD or on dialysis.

Comparison between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.

Out of the symptomatic patients, 72 (33.60%) with palpitations that had been demonstrated to be clearly correlated with PVCs were classified as the PVC‐relevant group and the other 52 (24.30%) with palpitations that were not definitely related to PVCs as the PVC‐irrelevant group (Figure 1). The only difference in the clinical characteristics between the two groups was the duration of the palpitation. In the PVC‐relevant group, more patients experienced palpitation that lasted only a few seconds (29.2% vs. 11.5%; p = .027). In addition, a higher proportion of patients took antiarrhythmic drugs (33.3% vs. 13.5%; p = .012). A comparison of ECG features between the two groups revealed significantly lower PVC CI ratios (55% [52% −60%] vs. 62% [55% −67%]; p = .001) and longer Post‐PVC CI (1170 [1027‐ 1270] vs. 1083 [960–1180] ms; p = .018) in the PVC‐relevant group. The comparisons between the PVC‐relevant and PVC‐irrelevant groups are presented in Table 4.

### Newly detected atrial fibrillation… [^115XeNBB]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Rate control is strongly preferred to rhythm control in most patients, using nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers.
- Rate control to less than 110 beats per minute at rest is recommended over rate control to less than 80 beats per minute. The American Academy of Family Physicians has updated its 2003 guideline to provide guidance on atrial fibrillation treatment via medication in the primary care setting. The guideline focuses on adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation as diagnosed by electrocardiography; atrial fibrillation with a valvular or reversible etiology is not addressed in this update. Recommendations Rate control is strongly preferred to rhythm control in most patients, using nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers, which are superior to digoxin.

Rhythm control with amiodarone, dronedarone, propafenone, or sotalol can be considered for persons in whom rate control is ineffective and based on symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. High-quality data indicate that there are fewer hospitalizations with rate control than with rhythm control. In addition, there are significant risks and adverse effects with medications to control rhythm. Rate control to less than 110 beats per minute at rest is recommended over rate control to less than 80 bpm. However, if there is no change in symptoms, physicians should consider stricter rate control. Low-quality data indicate that lenient control is associated with a lower incidence of stroke vs. strict control, and limited data indicate that there are no differences in mortality, hospitalization, heart failure symptoms, quality of life, thromboembolic episodes, or bleeding between the two.

In addition, because strict control is more difficult to attain and more medication may be needed, it is associated with greater risk of harm from adverse effects. The risk of stroke and bleeding should be discussed with patients when anticoagulation is prescribed. Stroke risk can be determined using the continuous CHADS. Long-term anticoagulation should be prescribed for all patients with atrial fibrillation, with the exception of those who have contraindications or a low stroke risk defined as a CHADS.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, general indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to offer a trial of rhythm control to evaluate whether AF contributes to the reduced LV function in patients with reduced LV function and persistent (or high burden) AF.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115Wmqtv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is an abnormal rapid cardiac rhythm that involves atrial or atrioventricular node tissue from the His bundle or above. Paroxysmal SVT, a subset of supraventricular dysrhythmias, has three common types: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. Presenting symptoms may include altered consciousness, chest pressure or discomfort, dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, or palpitations. Diagnostic evaluation may be performed in the outpatient setting and includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, electrocardiography, and laboratory workup. Extended cardiac monitoring with a Holter monitor or event recorder may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Acute management of paroxysmal SVT is similar across the various types and is best completed in the emergency department or hospital setting. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, synchronized cardioversion is first-line management. In those who are hemodynamically stable, vagal maneuvers are first-line management, followed by stepwise medication management if ineffective. Beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers may be used acutely or for long-term suppressive therapy. When evaluating patients for paroxysmal SVTs, clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to a cardiologist for electrophysiologic study and appropriate intervention such as ablation. Clinicians should use a patient-centered approach when formulating a long-term management plan for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Catheter ablation has a high success rate and is recommended as the first-line method for long-term management of recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal SVT, including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^11168qnB]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is common, responsible for over half of prevalent HF, yet no therapies have yet been shown to reduce mortality or morbidity. Atrial fibrillation and HFpEF are closely linked, with similar risks and mechanisms as discussed above. Current management is no different to that in sinus rhythm; diuretics to reduce signs and symptoms of fluid overload, and optimisation of hypertension and other comorbidities. Whether MRA have a specific role in improving exercise capacity and diastolic function by reducing fibrosis is currently under investigation. The risk of stroke in AF with HFpEF is similar to HFrEF, and therefore all suitable patients require anticoagulation.

### How to manage atrial fibrillation secondary to ibrutinib [^111qxtMT]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Continued

Six months later, the patient was tolerating his anticoagulation and beta-blocker, and was asymptomatic.

It is important to follow patients with new AF. This is particularly important if the proarrhythmogenic treatment is continuing because their symptom load may increase. If this patient started complaining of increasing palpitations and shortness of breath, it would be prudent to increase his rate control medication. If his symptoms were refractory to maximal medical therapy, he would then be considered for a rhythm control strategy, which can include medications, or more invasive management such as atrioventricular node ablation and pacemaker insertion or radiofrequency ablation. If a rhythm control strategy is pursued, it is advisable to avoid CYP3A4 inhibitors such as amiodarone, diltiazem, and verapamil. Generally, it is accepted that Class 1B and 1C antiarrhythmic drugs are the least likely to cause drug–drug interactions with ibrutinib. An electrical cardioversion strategy can also be considered. An alternative rhythm control strategy could potentially involve acalabrutinib. This is a second-generation BTK inhibitor that is more selective and has thus far demonstrated lower rates of AF and bleeding.

Our treatment decisions throughout the case were guided by the AF Better Care (ABC) pathway, which our group has pioneered (Figure 1). The ABC pathway proposes a streamlined approach to holistic AF management that is applicable to primary and secondary care: A, Avoid stroke/Anticoagulation; B, Better symptom management, with patient-centered symptom-directed decisions on rate or rhythm control; and C, Cardiovascular risk factor and Comorbidity management, including addressing lifestyle factors.

Figure 1
The ABC Pathway Applied to Oncology Patients

The ABC (AF Better Care) pathway can be used to provide holistic management of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Step A focuses on avoiding stroke via utilization of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and treatment of modifiable bleeding risk factors via the HAS-BLED score. Step B focuses on symptom control in AF and the decision between rate versus rhythm control. Step C focuses on management of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^11342hJW]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

From the Holter ECG, the following parameters were collected: (1) PVC burden: the percentage of the total number of PVCs to the total number of heartbeats during Holter monitoring; (2)circadian distribution of PVCs: according to the circadian distribution characteristics of PVCs, they were distinguished into daytime‐dominant pattern (the proportion of PVCs during daytime exceeded 70%), nighttime‐dominant pattern (the proportion of PVCs during nighttime exceeded 70%) and uniform‐distribution pattern (the difference in the proportion of PVC during daytime and nighttime day did not exceed 40%). Daytime was defined as the period from 6 am to 6 pm and night as the period from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. the following day; (3) correlation between PVC frequency and heart rate (HR): the relationship between the number of PVCs per hour and the hourly mean HR was analyzed by Pearson's correlation and presented as positive, negative or no correlation.

2.4 Symptom assessment and patient grouping

Whether patients had the symptoms of palpitations within the past month was confirmed through face‐to‐face consultation. Based on the presence or absence of palpitations, patients were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Among the symptomatic patients, those with a temporal consistency between the occurrence of palpitations and the appearance of PVCs were classified as PVC‐relevant, while those without this clear correlation were classified as PVC‐irrelevant. To clarify the relevance of palpitations to PVCs, we identified the occurrence of PVCs through in‐office ECG recording or physical examination and asked patients whether they experienced palpitations and felt the occurrence of PVCs at the same time. The clinical features associated with palpitations were collected, including the chronological order of symptom onset and PVC diagnosis, the duration of palpitations, and the correlation between palpitations and physical activity. The severity of palpitations was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patients' demographic, clinical and ECG characteristics were compared between these groups.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^111CBbdR]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Arrhythmias during pregnancy — palpitations and inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) — show limited arrhythmia detection on ambulatory monitoring and physiologic heart rate increases. In an outpatient Holter study of 110 symptomatic pregnancies with a 52-pregnancy control group, 23% of controls reported palpitations during the 24-hour monitoring period, and only 10% of symptomatic episodes during pregnancy were associated with an arrhythmia documented by 24-hour Holter monitoring. Resting sinus rate commonly rises in pregnancy, with a 10% or greater increase in resting heart rate. IST is defined as a resting heart rate > 100 and a mean ambulatory heart rate > 90 with associated symptoms, has been reported to be associated with a higher frequency of induction at term but with no impact on maternal or fetal outcomes, and about 8% of patients with IST identify pregnancy as the inciting event.

### Maintenance of sinus rhythm with metoprolol CR initiated before cardioversion and repeated cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study [^1175YaAn]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effect of metoprolol in combination with repeated cardioversion on maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR).

Methods and Results

Consecutive outpatients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) were randomized to treatment with metoprolol CR or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Study treatment was started at least one week before direct current (DC) cardioversion. Patients were followed once a week during the first 6 weeks after cardioversion. In case of relapse during this period, a second cardioversion was performed. Total treatment time was 6 months. A total of 168 patients were randomized to metoprolol (n = 83) or placebo (n = 85). The dose of study treatment at cardioversion was 169 ± 47 mg in the metoprolol group and 180 ± 40 mg in the placebo group (P = 0.12). In an intention-to-treat analysis, 46 patients (55%) in the metoprolol group and 34 patients (40%) in the placebo group (P = 0.04) had SR 1 week after cardioversion, and 38 patients (46%) in the metoprolol group compared with 22 patients (26%) in the placebo group had SR after 6 months (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

A treatment strategy of metoprolol CR started before cardioversion in combination with prompt second cardioversion in case of early relapse (1–6 weeks) significantly increases the proportion of patients in SR during six months of follow-up.

Clinical Assessments

Personal history and clinical profile: clinical evaluation, including personal and family history, physical examination, comorbidities, drug therapy, and cardiac symptoms at rest or during effort (ie, palpitations, dyspnea, syncope, chest pain) were assessed. We collected information on the beta‐blocker therapy taken by patients, and we calculated equivalent doses considering metoprolol 200 mg as 100%; for example, daily doses of 10 mg bisoprolol were considered as 100% dose equivalent, and nadolol 80 mg was defined as 50% dose equivalent. Genetic counseling and testing were offered systematically to all patients when the diagnosis was established. We assessed the results of the cardiac magnetic resonance, paying particular attention to the presence and percentage of late gadolinium enhancement.
Information about the lifetime history of exercise, the type of exercise, and the intensity and volume of training per week was systematically collected via an interview during the clinical evaluation. Physical active patients were defined as individuals who performed more than 3 hours of organized exercise per week. We assigned a metabolic equivalent of task for all activitiesand calculated the physical activity volume by multiplying the metabolic equivalent of task score by the reported physical activity volume (session duration x frequency/week).
ECG: Resting heart rate, sinus rhythm, the presence of T‐wave inversion, and bundle‐branch blocks were evaluated; left atrium enlargement was defined as a P‐wave duration > 120 milliseconds or a negative portion of the P‐wave of ≥ 0.1 mV in‐depth and ≥ 40 milliseconds in duration in the lead V₁.LV hypertrophy was defined based on Sokolow–Lyon criteria voltage.Q waves ≥ 40 milliseconds in duration or ≥ 25% of the R wave in depth or ≥ 3 mm in depth in at least 2 contiguous leads except aVR were considered pathological.
Twelve‐lead 48‐hour ambulatory ECG monitoring: the presence of rhythm abnormalities, supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, and other abnormal findings were investigated annually or more often if clinically indicated.
Echocardiogram: LV and right ventricular dimensions and function, aortic root diameters, and atrial dimensions were obtained as recommended.LV volume measurements were calculated from the apical 4‐ and 2‐chamber views using the modified Simpson's rule, and ejection fraction was calculated. Doppler LV outflow tract pressure gradient at rest or during physiological provocation such as Valsalva maneuver and exercise was calculated to evaluate the presence of LV outflow tract obstruction. Doppler interrogation of the tricuspid regurgitant jet was used to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. The early (E) and late (A) pulsed‐wave Doppler diastolic peak‐flow velocities and tissue Doppler imaging assessment of early (e′) and late (a′) diastolic peak velocities and their ratio were measured to assess diastolic function. Two‐dimensional speckle‐tracking echocardiography analysis was performed and analyzed offline using dedicated automated software (EchoPAC PC, Version 112; GE Health Care, Milwaukee, WI, USA). LV global longitudinal strain was measured as the average of the LV longitudinal strain peaks obtained from 2‐, 3‐, and 4‐chamber views. Right ventricular global longitudinal strain included the interventricular septum and right ventricular free wall peak systolic longitudinal strain, measured as the average of the lateral wall's 3 segments (basal, midcavity, and apical). Peak atrial longitudinal strain and peak atrial contraction strain, measures of the atrial reservoir and active function, respectively, were obtained by calculating the average values obtained from the 4‐chamber and 2‐chamber view (left atrial global peak atrial longitudinal strain and global peak atrial contraction strain). Echocardiograms were also performed during exercise to evaluate the LV outflow tract gradient, which is the most important aspect of exercise echocardiography in patients with HCM.
Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was performed using a cycle ergometer (Quark CPET, CosMed USA Inc. Concord, CA, USA) equipped with software OMNIA (CosMed USA Inc. Concord, CA, USA, 1.6.5). The test (ramp protocol) included a 1‐minute preexercise resting period sitting upright on the bike, a 2‐minute unloaded warmup cycling phase, followed by an incremental exercise cycling period with an increasing workload of 5 to 40 W per minute, dependent on the patient's clinical status and aiming to complete the CPET within 8 to 12 minutes, as recommended. Oxygen consumption (Vo 2), carbon dioxide production (Vco 2), and ventilation during exercise were analyzed breath by breath. Peak VO 2, first (VT 1) and second (VT 2) ventilatory thresholds, ventilatory efficiency through ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide ventilation/Vco 2 slope, the respiratory exchange ratio (defined as the ratio between Vco 2 and Vo 2), exercise breathing reserve, the partial end‐tidal pressures of O 2 and CO 2, the Vo 2 /work rate ratio, and peak exercise oxygen pulse (calculated as Vo 2 /heart rate, providing an estimate of LV stroke‐volume changes during exercise) were evaluated. The determination of noninvasive VTs was based on the analysis and integration of data derived from some of the 9 CPET panels. The methods for VT 1 determination were the following: V‐slope method (change in the slope of Vco 2 versus Vo 2 ratio from an increase with a slope ≤ 1 to a slope > 1); the nadir of the first increase in ventilation/Vo 2, without a simultaneous increase in ventilation/Vco 2; and the nadir of partial end‐tidal pressures of O 2, while partial end‐tidal pressures of CO 2 remains constant or is increasing. The VT 2 was determined by analyzing the inflection of ventilation versus work rate, the nadir of ventilation/Vco 2 increase, and the zenith and deflection point of partial end‐tidal pressures of CO 2. Chronotropic competence, resting/peak blood pressure, oxygen saturation, supraventricular/ventricular arrhythmias, and symptoms during exercise were also analyzed. The CPET was preceded by spirometry, which evaluated respiratory parameters and classified them as normal or pathological according to standardized criteria.
Personalized exercise prescription First, we assessed the presence of contraindications to physical activity (eg, history of syncope/hypotension during effort, clinically relevant arrhythmias particularly during effort, presence of severe provocable obstruction at rest or during effort, presence of extensive late gadolinium enhancement (> 15%) on cardiac magnetic resonance). In case of a clinical risk deemed excessively high and the impossibility of temporarily practicing exercise, we suggested a revaluation for an exercise program after implementing optimal medical or interventional therapy (eg, after reducing a significant LV outflow tract obstruction). Exercise prescription was tailored according to the patient's characteristics, the drugs administered, the personal history, the response to exercise, the previous training experience, the aims to reach, and the different health profiles to improve, based on the so‐called FITT‐VP model (frequency, intensity, time, and type),:
Frequency is the number of sessions/weeks; it was suggested that patients start with 2 sessions/week until reaching a target of 3 to 5 times/week.
Intensity is the amount of energy expenditure/time unit during training sessions. The CPET gives the unique opportunity to delineate the ventilatory thresholds (VT 1 and VT 2), representing the most reliable method to identify the correct intensity of aerobic exercise. The intensity of aerobic exercise can be classified as light, moderate, high, and very high. Moderate intensity of aerobic exercise is slightly above or around VT 1; therefore, the heart rate value corresponding to the VT 1 was derived and used as an objective indicator for prescribing moderate aerobic exercise.
Time represents the duration of a training program in weeks or months, training days/week, training session times/day, and duration of training sessions in hours. We suggested reaching 150 to 300 min/week of aerobic exercise with intensity corresponding to VT 1.000000000000000e+00
Type of exercise included aerobic continuous training (eg, running, cycling, swimming, walking, etc.). In nonobstructive patients, strength activities were prescribed with an intensity corresponding to 40% to 70% of 1 repetition maximum, adapted individually.
Volume indicates the total amount of weekly exercise.
Progression is how the program advances. Specific instructions were provided regarding the program's progression to increase the exercise dose gradually, considering the patient's adaptation to exercise, age, and clinical characteristics.

### Evolution of the American college of cardiology and American Heart Association cardiology clinical practice guidelines: a 10-year assessment [^111H4Vkb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical practice guidelines provide a vetted framework for high‐quality, up‐to‐date standards of care to guide clinicians in important management decisions. National professional organizations make these recommendations through committee consensus after systematic review of scientific evidence, 1 while using caution to minimize conflict of interest and ensure that the guidelines are relevant to clinical practice. 2 To keep pace with evolving practice standards and evidence, new guidelines are created while older guidelines are periodically revised.

Since 1984, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have concurrently produced recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with, or who are at risk for, cardiovascular disease. 3 The strength and relative benefit‐to‐risk ratio of each recommendation is expressed as the class of recommendation (COR), while the quality of the underlying evidence is expressed by the level of evidence (LOE) designation (Table 1). 4, 5, 6 Full‐guideline revisions occur approximately every 4 or more years, but individual recommendations may be reviewed annually. 7 Individual recommendation revisions are termed "focused updates", as they represent the most current amendments, deletions, or additions to guidelines based on significant new research.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and… [^117HqUtY]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Beta blockers such as propranolol and esmolol may be preferable to calcium channel blockers in patients with myocardial infarction or angina, but they should not be used in patients with asthma. As initial treatment, 1 mg of propranolol is given intravenously over two minutes; this dose can be repeated every five minutes up to a maximum of 5 mg. Maintenance dosing of propranolol is 1 to 3 mg given intravenously every four hours. Esmolol has an extremely short half-life and may be given as a continuous intravenous infusion to maintain rate control. Medical Cardioversion After patients with atrial fibrillation have been stabilized and the ventricular rate has been controlled, conversion to sinus rhythm is the next consideration. The decision to restore sinus rhythm should be individualized.

The many reasons for not attempting pharmacologic cardioversion include duration of atrial fibrillation for more than 48 hours, recurrence of atrial fibrillation despite multiple treatment attempts, poor tolerance of antiarrhythmic agents, advanced patient age and concomitant structural disease, large size of left atrium, and the presence of sick sinus syndrome. 2, 3 Physicians should use medical cardioversion only after careful consideration of the possibility of proarrhythmic complications, particularly in patients with structural heart disease or congestive heart failure. 7 Because cardioversion can lead to systemic emboli, heparin should be given before medical cardioversion is attempted 7. Anticoagulation with warfarin should be continued for four weeks after cardioversion. 18 A recent small study 19 examined rate control versus rhythm control plus anticoagulation.

Overall, rate control was as good as rhythm control in reducing or eliminating symptoms and in reducing hospitalization rates, but the comparative effect on stroke risk was not studied. 3 Patients with atrial fibrillation at a ventricular rate of less than 150 beats per minute who are hemodynamically stable can be initially treated with drugs for ventricular rate control and intravenously administered heparin for anticoagulation. Medical cardioversion or elective electrical cardioversion can then be considered as appropriate. Patients are usually monitored in the hospital while cardioversion is being attempted. However, one study.

Painless thyroiditis — clinical course and management: The thyrotoxic phase occurs in 5%–20% of patients and typically lasts 3–4 months, the hypothyroid phase may last up to 6 months, and normal thyroid function is reestablished by 12 months in most patients, though 10%–20% have persistent hypothyroidism; recurrences are about 5%–10%, with a long-term recurrence rate of 65% reported in one Japanese study. During the thyrotoxic phase, serum TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4, and the absence of TRAb antibodies helps distinguish painless thyroiditis from GD. Patients with symptomatic thyrotoxicosis due to painless thyroiditis should be treated with β-adrenergic-blocking drugs to control symptoms, ATDs have no utility, and corticosteroids have been used rarely but should be reserved for severe cases only. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension and Angina: Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (> 2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash.

Heart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once-daily; n = 1,990) to placebo (n = 2,001), 10.3% of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients.

The table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality.

Adverse Reactions Occurring in the MERIT-HF Study at an Incidence ≥ 1% in the Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets Group and Greater Than Placebo by More Than 0.5%

Post-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta–blocker therapy, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets use was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia (6.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 2.74; 95% CI 2.19, 3.43), hypotension (15% vs. 9.7%; HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.37, 1.74), stroke (1.0% vs. 0.5%; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.26, 3.74) and death (3.1% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03, 1.74) compared to placebo.

Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.3	Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of TOPROL-XL, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of TOPROL-XL. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce TOPROL-XL. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of TOPROL-XL. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of TOPROL-XL, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of TOPROL-XL should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

Clinical Introduction

A 72-year-old woman presented with an 8-year history of palpitations occurring every few weeks. They were sudden in onset, were associated with dizziness and could last for up to 2hours. She was prescribed bisoprolol which reduced the frequency of events but did not abolish them. Baseline ECG and echocardiography were normal. She was referred for electrophysiological study. Despite initial difficulties, diagnostic catheters were placed in the right ventricular (RV) apex and in the coronary sinus (CS) via the right internal jugular vein and superior vena cava (SVC) (figure 1A). A narrow complex tachycardia was easily induced, and ablation was then delivered during tachycardia with the ablation catheter positioned as shown in (figure 1A). This terminated tachycardia 4s after onset of energy delivery and on follow-up she has remained asymptomatic. She later underwent a CT scan (figure 1B, C; online supplementary video).DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2017–311734.supp1Supplementary file 1 heartjnl;103/19/1554/F1F1F1Figure 1(A) Fluoroscopy of catheter placement.

### Notes for the general paediatrician: managing thyrotoxicosis in children and young people [^115TsLz1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Adjunctive early therapy: beta adrenergic blockers

Most children have 'toxic' featureswith palpitations and tremor at diagnosis. Beta-adrenergic blockers provide symptomatic relief before carbimazole takes effect and can be continued until the thyroid hormone levels have normalised (usually around 4–6 weeks). Propranolol is most commonly used. Rare side effects include alopecia, neuromuscular dysfunction, postural hypotension, psychosis and thrombocytopaenia. Atenolol can be used as an alternative as it has the advantage of beta-1 adrenergic receptor selectivity, and therefore, safely used in patients with asthma.

Recommendation: In children with palpitations and tremor, commence beta-adrenergic blocking agents alongside carbimazole and continue until symptoms resolve or thyroid levels normalise.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^116Wg1uK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Heart Failure

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart-failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^112Jn6Dw]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Convalescence management

Special considerations for management of patients with SCAD after clinical stabilisation are summarised in Box 2. In-hospital management is similar to that of any other patient with ACS, with extra consideration regarding the appearance of ischaemic relapses (including late propagation). Most cases can be safely discharged after a few days of convalescence, yet this should be individualised to each case. Ventricular function should be monitored during hospitalisation and later after discharge since left ventricular systolic impairment at baseline has shown to improve significantly in the short term. This has implications for tailoring medical treatment and, especially, for appropriately indicating primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in those patients with severe ventricular disfunction. If left ventricular function is severely depressed, until reassessment, the role of wearable defibrillators for this relatively young population is appealing.

Box 2
Summary of recommendations for spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) survivors

Reassessment of left ventricular function (life vest if necessary until then)

Differential diagnosis of chest pain after SCAD should distinguish non-ischaemic chest pain from less common serious causes: late propagation (days, weeks) or de novo SCAD recurrence (months, years), which may occur regardless of the treatment received

Medications:

Tailor heart failure therapy in accordance with left ventricular function that should be monitored to evaluate recovery
Dual antiplatelet therapy only for patients having stents implanted
Consider long-term beta-blocker if well tolerated (nebivolol for coexisting migraine)
Statins only for dyslipidaemia or evidence of atherosclerosis
For patients with fibromuscular dysplasia: aspirin, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor or ARB

Systematic screening of extracoronary arteriopathy, preferably with a magnetic resonance angiography-based protocol

Genetic testing only if a connective tissue syndrome or familiar aggregation is suspected

Cardiac rehabilitation programmes and mental health assessment are appropriate

Discharge counselling:

Control of cardiovascular risk factors, with special emphasis in smoking and blood pressure
Encourage physical activity but avoid extenuating or isometric exertion (weight lifting)
Avoid recognisable emotional stressors
Preferential use of non-hormonal over hormonal therapies
Eventual pregnancies should be closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team

### Achieving ventricular rate control using metoprolol in β-blocker-naive patients vs patients on chronic β-blocker therapy [^112iYfUv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of the study is to evaluate the difference in ventricular rate control using an intravenous (IV) metoprolol regimen commonly used in clinical practice in patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy compared to patients considered β-blocker naive admitted to the emergency department (ED) for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate.

Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study of adult ED patients who were admitted with a rapid ventricular rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm) or greater and treated with IV metoprolol was performed. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate to less than 100 bpm or a 20% decrease in heart rate to less than 120 bpm after metoprolol administration. Patient demographics, differences in length of stay, and adverse events were recorded.

Results

A total of 398 patients were included in the study, with 79.4% (n = 316) receiving chronic β-blocker therapy. Patients considered to be β-blocker naive were more likely to achieve successful rate control with IV metoprolol compared to patients on chronic β-blocker therapy (56.1% vs 42.4%; p = 0.03). β-Blocker-naive status was associated with a shorter length of stay in comparison to patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy (1.79 vs 2.64 days; P < .01).

Conclusion

Intravenous metoprolol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was associated with a higher treatment response in patients considered β-blocker naive compared to patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy.

Alternative pharmacologic options when adenosine is contraindicated or ineffective: When additional intravenous nodal blocking agents are needed, intravenous metoprolol or propranolol have the most robust safety, and intravenous beta-blockers are an alternative treatment for acute SVT; experience with intravenous calcium channel blockers is less robust and, given the potential for hypotension, these agents are generally used in patients who are refractory or with contraindication to adenosine and beta-blockers; procainamide and digoxin also remain options in these cases.

### Use of clesrovimab for prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2025 [^113T8fVV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, more specifically with respect to immunization, infants and children, CDC 2025 guidelines recommend to offer clesrovimab as one of two long-acting monoclonal antibody options (as an alternative to nirsevimab), for the protection of infants aged < 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season who are not protected through maternal RSV vaccination. Offer protection against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection all infants through one of three product options:

- maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy

- infant receipt of the long-acting RSV monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab

- infant receipt of the long-acting RSV monoclonal antibody, clesrovimab.

The patient did not tolerate guideline‐directed medical therapy because of low systemic blood pressure and postural symptoms (dizziness and fatigue). His oral pharmacotherapy by that time included a low dose of beta‐blocker (metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg daily), digoxin 0.0625 mg daily, spironolactone 25 mg daily, furosemide 125 mg daily, and dabigatran 110 mg twice daily. The patient did not tolerate any physical activity, he was only able to take one or two steps. He had a nocturnal dyspnea almost every other night. Other symptoms included postural weakness, dizziness, palpitations, bendopnea, and nycturia. The patient had elevated jugular venous pressure (+11 cm), third heart sound, systolic murmur at the apex, basal rales on lung auscultation, hepatomegaly and hepatojugular reflux, and ankle swellings.

Palpitations in pregnancy — physiologic changes and symptom correlation indicate that resting heart rate increases by 10% or more during pregnancy and pregnancy is associated with an increase in sinus rhythm frequency and slight increase in extrasystole burden, which return postpartum; in a study of 110 pregnant patients referred mainly for palpitations (87%) compared with 52 healthy pregnant controls, sinus tachycardia was found in 9% and 10%, sinus bradycardia in 1% and 2%, atrial extrasystoles in 56% and 58%, and ventricular extrasystoles in 49% and 40% without significant differences, and only 10% of symptomatic episodes were accompanied by any arrhythmia; patients with extrasystole or sinus tachycardia on ECG during ongoing symptoms generally do not benefit from further extensive evaluation, though high-burden PVCs or persistent fast sinus tachycardia may indicate underlying disease needing further evaluation.

Methods

Patient Database

The clinical personal record, a nationwide administrative database of public expenditure for refractory disease by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, was established to register and certify intractable diseases, including cardiomyopathies, throughout Japan. This record prospectively and annually collected the following data: (1) demographic data (age, sex, duration of HF, and New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class), (2) vital signs, (3) comorbidities, (4) electrocardiographic data, (5) echocardiographic data, (6) laboratory data, and (7) medication use. This database does not collect information about clinical outcomes such as hospitalization and death. DCM was diagnosed on a dilated left ventricle and reduced LVEF in the absence of any specific cardiac or systemic diseases such as hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, coronary artery disease, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy caused by toxins/medications, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, connective tissue disease, dystrophy, or metabolic disease such as Pompe disease or Fabry disease. The data in this registry were collected from all types of hospitals. All clinical personal records were registered after being reviewed by certified cardiologists. The present study used this nationwide database from 2003 to 2014.

Study Patients

Patients > 18 years old with current LVEF ≥ 40% and previous LVEF < 40% were identified from the database of DCM described above. Screened patients were excluded from enrollment if they received a left ventricular assist device or heart transplantation during the follow‐up period or they were not assessed with echocardiography at 2 years of follow‐up. Patients prescribed with carvedilol or bisoprolol were assigned to the beta‐blocker group and those not prescribed were assigned to the no‐beta‐blocker group. Metoprolol succinate is not available in Japan. All patients had prior symptoms or signs of HF, including dyspnea, palpitation, chest pain, edema, and hepatomegaly.

### Metoprolol responding uveitis [^116kdxhN]. Eye (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Noninfectious uveitis is usually managed by topical and systemic corticosteroids and in refractory cases by immunosuppressive drugs.

Objective

To describe a patient with noninfectious anterior and posterior uveitis, refractory to corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive therapy, which responded to systemic metoprolol.

Patient and Methods

A 49-year-old patient was treated for 3 years with topical and systemic corticosteroids and systemic cyclosporin A for a bilateral anterior and posterior uveitis of unknown origin. The treatment did not result in resolution of the uveitis. A bilateral uveitic glaucoma developed and necessitated neodymium: YAG laser iridotomies and antiglaucoma medications. A systemic beta-blocker, metoprolol tartrate 50 mg b.i.d., was administered for palpitations because of idiopatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and short ventricular tachycardia.

Results

Following administration of metoprolol tartrate, the bilateral uveitis resolved. The corticosteroids and the cyclosporin A were withdrawn after 6 weeks without any recurrence. A trial to discontinue metoprolol after 6 months resulted in flare-up of the disease and only following its readministration the inflammation resolved. The patient is currently under metoprolol for a year without flare-ups.

Conclusions

The use of metoprolol tartrate in this patient resulted in resolution of bilateral noninfectious uveitis. This is the first report of non-antiinfectious, antiinflammatory, or immunosuppressive drug effective for uveitis. It is possible that a subgroup of resistant uveitis may respond to drugs other than the traditional drugs, such as metoprolol, and that other forms of uveitis of unidentified origin exist.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, metoprolol tartrate injection was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction.

Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol tartrate injection or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with metoprolol tartrate injection or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given metoprolol tartrate injection and followed up to 1 year.

The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the metoprolol tartrate injection- and placebo-treatment groups. Among patients treated with metoprolol tartrate injection, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤ 8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with metoprolol tartrate injection and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.

In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intravenously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta blockers.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112uGbqv]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation guideline — Heart rate targets for rate control in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): The ideal target heart rate remains uncertain, but given potential harms of rapid ventricular rates, a stricter strategy may be reasonable. In AF-CHF, rate control was defined as ventricular rate < 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test. In RACE II, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to strict control (< 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm with moderate exercise) versus lenient control (resting heart rate, < 110 bpm), showing similar outcomes, though patients were rate controlled at enrollment (baseline heart rate, 96 bpm), and only 15% had LVEF < 40% with very few > 100 bpm. In a crossover study of 20 patients with persistent AF and LVEF < 40%, metoprolol (average dose, 121 mg) targeted < 70 bpm and after 3 months reduced resting heart rate from 94 ± 14 bpm to 85 ± 12 bpm without significant QOL or functional differences. Strict rate control is also advisable in patients with ICDs and CRT.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) — utility, technique, and typical candidates are outlined as follows: This procedure is often effective in reducing the probability for arrhythmic events in high-risk patients, including those who are intolerant or refractory to beta-blockers alone. The procedure can be done surgically through a left supraclavicular incision or as a minimally invasive procedure in experienced centers. This procedure is frequently used in very high-risk infants and children in whom ICD therapy may be relatively contraindicated due to the physical size of the patient, in some patients with syncope despite beta-blocker therapy, and in patients with asthma who are intolerant of beta-blockers.
