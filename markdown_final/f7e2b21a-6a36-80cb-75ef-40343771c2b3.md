## Question

What are the other signs of severe dengue disease besides persistent vomiting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the other signs of severe dengue disease besides persistent vomiting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative sources that define warning signs and severe dengue. Then, I should verify which clinical features consistently appear across guidelines and high-quality reviews. Next, I will organize the signs into categories for clarity and double-check that I am not conflating early febrile-phase features with true warning signs. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list and note any age-specific nuances or timing considerations that change pretest probabilities or management decisions.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative sources I should rely on. The WHO 2009 classification and its implementation in PAHO/WHO 2022 guidelines are the primary references for warning signs and severe dengue criteria, and the CDC Yellow Book operationalizes these for travel and outbreak settings. High-quality evidence syntheses, including a 2021 Lancet Infectious Diseases systematic review and meta-analysis, validate which clinical features predict progression to severe disease during the febrile phase, which helps prioritize early warning signs over late manifestations [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed] [^2d9dc7a3] [^935126d4].

> I need to check the core warning signs beyond persistent vomiting. Across WHO-aligned sources, the following consistently appear: abdominal pain or tenderness, clinical fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion), mucosal bleeding (gingival, nasal, conjunctival, hematuria, menorrhagia), lethargy or restlessness, postural hypotension, hepatomegaly greater than 2 cm, and a progressive increase in hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count. These are the canonical seven warning signs used for triage and close monitoring, and they are supported by both guidelines and meta-analytic data showing associations with severe outcomes [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed] [^935126d4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I should confirm when these warning signs typically emerge. Warning signs cluster around defervescence, marking the transition to the critical phase; this is precisely when patients may look clinically better as fever abates, yet are at highest risk for plasma leakage, shock, and bleeding. This timing is emphasized in CDC and WHO documents and is crucial for anticipatory guidance and disposition decisions [^2d9dc7a3] [^d873c2d2].

> Next, I should review the manifestations that define severe dengue, because these are the endpoints that warning signs predict. Severe dengue is defined by severe plasma leakage leading to shock or respiratory distress from effusions, severe bleeding, or severe organ impairment such as hepatitis, impaired consciousness, or cardiac involvement. Recognizing these endpoints reinforces why the warning signs warrant escalation of care even if the patient appears superficially stable [^c5c972ed] [^bb59901e].

> Let me consider age-specific nuances, especially in children. In infants, hepatomegaly and clinical fluid accumulation carry particularly high negative predictive value for severe disease, whereas in older children and adolescents, the combination of rising hematocrit with falling platelets is most discriminative. I should double-check that these pediatric data align with WHO guidance, and yes, multiple pediatric cohorts and reviews corroborate this pattern, which can refine triage in different age strata [^e98cb6ec] [^a3d64da1] [^74b35cc2].

> I will now examine gastrointestinal and hepatic features that often co-occur with persistent vomiting and signal severity. Severe or continuous abdominal pain, distension from ascites, and tender hepatomegaly are repeatedly flagged as high-risk features. Laboratory correlates such as marked transaminase elevations and hypoalbuminemia accompany liver involvement and correlate with severe disease, reinforcing the clinical impression when these are present [^e917a7af] [^7d0cc89e] [^935126d4].

> But wait, what if I am conflating early nonspecific symptoms with true warning signs. I should confirm that nausea and isolated mild abdominal discomfort are not themselves warning signs, whereas persistent vomiting, severe or continuous abdominal pain, and clinical fluid accumulation are. This distinction matters for outpatient counseling and helps avoid both under- and over-triage during the early febrile phase [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized, clinically actionable list beyond persistent vomiting. The other major warning signs are: severe or continuous abdominal pain or tenderness, clinical fluid accumulation (ascites or pleural effusion), mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, postural hypotension, hepatomegaly greater than 2 cm, and a rising hematocrit with concurrent rapid platelet decline. These should trigger close observation, consideration of inpatient care, and protocolized fluid management rather than routine outpatient follow-up alone [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed] [^f2ed2d86].

> I should double-check that I have not omitted any frequently cited features. Some sources emphasize narrow pulse pressure and cold, clammy extremities as early shock surrogates; while not listed as standalone WHO warning signs, they are integral to recognizing compensated shock and should be assessed alongside the formal warning signs, particularly around defervescence when compensatory vasoconstriction maintains perfusion despite falling intravascular volume [^d873c2d2] [^044dfedb].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical implication is clear. The presence of any warning sign, including persistent vomiting, mandates vigilant monitoring for progression to severe plasma leakage, bleeding, or organ impairment, with a low threshold for hospitalization and careful fluid titration. Early recognition and supportive care reduce mortality substantially, which is why guidelines emphasize training clinicians to detect these signs and act before decompensation occurs [^429be5e4] [^f2ed2d86] [^d08d09e8].

Besides persistent vomiting, severe dengue is signaled by **abdominal pain or tenderness** [^e917a7af], **mucosal bleeding** (gums, nose, vagina, or hematuria) [^e917a7af], **lethargy or restlessness** [^c5c972ed], **clinical fluid accumulation** (ascites or pleural effusion) [^e917a7af], **hepatomegaly** (> 2 cm) [^e917a7af], and a **rapid rise in hematocrit with falling platelets** [^935126d4]. These warning signs typically emerge around defervescence and indicate a high risk of progression to shock, severe bleeding, or organ impairment; prompt recognition and close monitoring are essential to reduce mortality [^2d9dc7a3] [^429be5e4].

## Clinical warning signs of severe dengue

The WHO and PAHO guidelines identify the following **warning signs** that indicate an increased risk of progression to severe dengue:

| **Warning sign** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Abdominal pain or tenderness | Progressive, continuous, or intense pain, especially late in the febrile phase [^e917a7af] [^2d9dc7a3] |
| Mucosal bleeding | Gingival bleeding, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, hematuria [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed] |
| Lethargy or restlessness | Altered mental status, irritability, drowsiness [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed] |
| Clinical fluid accumulation | Ascites or pleural effusion detected clinically or by imaging [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed] |
| Hepatomegaly | Liver enlargement > 2 cm below the costal margin with abrupt onset [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed] |
| Progressive increase in hematocrit | Concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count [^e917a7af] [^935126d4] |

---

## Pathophysiological basis of warning signs

These warning signs reflect underlying pathophysiological changes characteristic of severe dengue:

- **Plasma leakage**: Increased vascular permeability leads to hypovolemia, shock, and fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion) [^d873c2d2].
- **Coagulopathy**: Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities cause mucosal bleeding and hemorrhagic manifestations [^044dfedb].
- **Organ impairment**: Liver involvement (hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases), neurological involvement (lethargy, restlessness), and cardiovascular compromise [^7d0cc89e] [^6a604657].

---

## Clinical significance of warning signs

Recognition of these warning signs is critical because they:

- **Predict progression**: Strongly associated with progression to severe dengue, including dengue shock syndrome, severe bleeding, and organ impairment [^935126d4] [^61c8b7aa].
- **Guide management**: Indicate the need for close monitoring, hospitalization, and prompt supportive care, particularly intravenous fluid therapy [^f2ed2d86] [^429be5e4].
- **Reduce mortality**: Early identification and intervention significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with severe dengue [^429be5e4] [^b7a0ced2].

---

## Timing and progression of warning signs

Warning signs typically appear in the **late febrile phase**, around the time of defervescence (fever resolution), and may persist into the critical phase. This timing coincides with increased vascular permeability and plasma leakage, which underlie severe complications [^2d9dc7a3] [^d873c2d2].

---

## Clinical management implications

When warning signs are present, clinicians should:

- **Monitor closely**: Frequent vital signs, hematocrit, platelet count, and clinical assessment for fluid accumulation and bleeding [^e917a7af].
- **Hospitalize**: Patients with warning signs generally require hospitalization for observation and supportive care [^429be5e4].
- **Initiate fluid therapy**: Intravenous crystalloids are indicated to prevent or manage shock, with careful titration to avoid fluid overload [^f2ed2d86] [^d08d09e8].

---

## Conclusion

Besides persistent vomiting, severe dengue is heralded by **abdominal pain, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, fluid accumulation, hepatomegaly, and rising hematocrit with falling platelets** [^e917a7af] [^c5c972ed]. These warning signs typically arise around defervescence and signal a high risk of shock, bleeding, or organ impairment; early recognition and prompt supportive care are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^2d9dc7a3] [^429be5e4].

Regarding classification and risk stratification for dengue, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, PAHO/WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider assessing for the following warning signs to identify patients with an increased risk of progression to severe disease:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Abdominal pain|- Progressive until it is continuous or sustained and intense, and at the end of the febrile stage|
|Sensory disorder|- Irritability, drowsiness, and lethargy|
|Mucosal bleeding|- Gingivorrhagia, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding not associated with menstruation or more menstrual bleeding than usual, and hematuria|
|Fluid accumulation|- Clinical, on imaging, or both, at the end of the febrile stage|
|Hepatomegaly|- > 2 cm below the costal margin and abrupt onset|
|Vomiting|- Persistent (≥ 3 episodes in 1 hour or 4 episodes in 6 hours)|
|Progressive increase in hematocrit|- On at least 2 consecutive measurements during patient monitoring.|

Added value of this study

In line with the 2009 WHO guidelines, we found that vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, spontaneous and mucosal bleeding, and clinical fluid accumulation were clinical features associated with severe disease. In addition, we found that the presence of specific pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and renal disease) were associated with progression to severe disease. During the first 4 days of febrile illness, individuals with a lower platelet count and serum albumin, and with higher aminotransferase concentrations (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were more likely to progress to severe disease. The infection of dengue serotype 2 among children and secondary infections were also associated with progression to severe disease.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our findings support the use of warning signs described in the 2009 WHO guideline. They also indicate that the signs are dynamic, varying during the phases of disease, and that risk assessment in the early febrile phase of disease could be enhanced with the inclusion of the additional prognostic signs we have identified. Improving the prediction of progression to severe disease could considerably improve the management of patients and health-care resource allocation in endemic areas.

To assist clinicians in the early detection of severe disease progression, a Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, in collaboration with WHO, recommended the use of warning signs detailed in the 2009 WHO dengue guidelineas early indicators of plasma leakage. These warning signs are abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, liver enlargement by more than 2 cm, and an increase in haematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count. Although the use of these warning signs achieves high sensitivity in detecting those at risk of disease progression during the febrile phase, it substantially increases the number of unnecessary admissions, particularly in endemic areas and during epidemics. In addition, some of the warning signs occur late relative to onset of plasma leakage, and therefore have limited clinical value.

INTRODUCTION

Dengue is a common cause of hospitalization in endemic areas of tropical countries. Moreover, dengue cases have grown dramatically, with recent annual aggregate estimates of 58 million,100 million, and 105 million cases globally. Similarly, the worldwide disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to dengue grew from 822,800 in 1990 to 2,920,000 in 2017. As this rise runs counter to the global shift in disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases, it highlights the need for better understanding and improved tools.

Many dengue infections are asymptomatic. Dengue episodes (symptomatic infections) range in severity from undifferentiated fever to severe and occasionally fatal cases. During the acute phase, sick individuals often experience high fever lasting for more than 24 hours, and other symptoms may also be present, for example, retro-orbital pain, nausea, vomiting, rash, aches, and pain. In severe dengue, the warning signs might appear as persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, and concurrent increasing of hematocrit with rapid decreasing of platelet count. This severe form leads to severe plasma leakage or shock, severe bleeding, and severe organ impairment. These symptoms impose a range of direct costs (i.e. costs for medical care) and indirect costs (i.e. the economic value of lost productivity) on affected families, with cost increasing with disease severity. Some episodes persist for months. Since the first case found in Surabaya city in 1968, Indonesia has become one of the countries with the highest burden of dengue.

### An evidence-based algorithm for early prognosis of severe dengue in the outpatient setting [^126e133d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Dengue is the most common arboviral infection of humans and a public health burden in much of tropical Asia and Latin America. Seasonal epidemics, with children and young adults most affected, place enormous stress on healthcare systems in endemic countries. The burden of dengue in 10 endemic countries was revealed with precision in phase 3 vaccine trials of the now licensed Dengvaxia vaccine, in which approximately 10% of all febrile episodes in the control groups were confirmed to be dengue cases. Among these dengue cases, the percentage requiring hospitalization was 19.1% in the Asian cohort and 11.1% in the Latin American cohort.

The pathophysiological hallmarks of severe dengue are increased capillary permeability, coagulopathy, and a hemorrhagic diathesis. For some patients this can lead to hypovolemic shock, called dengue shock syndrome (DSS), with or without clinically severe bleeding. Other rare complications can include hepatic dysfunction, central nervous system involvement, and myocarditis. Progress in clinical management, particularly fluid resuscitation and monitoring in intensive care, has led to a decline in the dengue case fatality rate over the last 2 decades; it is now < 1% of hospitalized cases in many settings, but can exceed 20% if treatment is inadequate. There are no specific antiviral or disease-modifying treatments for dengue despite recent efforts.

DSS typically manifests between the fourth and sixth day of illness, during the so-called critical phase. Features such as abdominal pain, lethargy, rapidly rising hematocrit level, and persistent vomiting have anecdotally been associated with progression to DSS or other clinically severe manifestations. However, the prognostic value of these signs and symptoms, which usually occur near the time of shock, have not been formally evaluated. Thus emergency department physicians seeing a patient with 3 days of fever in whom dengue is suspected are faced with a dilemma; to send the patient home with a request that they return for follow-up or to admit them for observation as they approach the critical phase. The hospitalization of a large number of dengue cases for observation inevitably places a burden on healthcare resources and has direct and indirect costs to patients and their families.

### Risk stratification of dengue cases requiring hospitalization [^b0d98dc7]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito‐borne human disease and is caused by the dengue virus (DENV). Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe and sometimes fatal disease. Severe cases often require hospitalization where timely monitoring and intervention can reduce the overall mortality rate to less than 1%. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies symptomatic dengue into three clinical categories: dengue without warning signs (DF; dengue fever), dengue with warning signs (DWS), and severe dengue (SD). Warning signs, such as mucosal bleeding, persistent vomiting, hepatomegaly, low platelet counts, and abruptly elevated liver enzymes, indicate the need to monitor patients closely, while milder cases can be treated at home. Furthermore, cases with warning signs can eventually progress to SD leading to life‐threatening complications, such as hypovolaemic shock, severe bleeding, and multiorgan failure.

The symptoms of dengue are often difficult to differentiate from other viral fevers and concomitant illnesses, even during critical phases of infection. This presents a significant challenge for clinicians attempting to provide an accurate diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, particularly in countries with a high prevalence of dengue. An inaccurate diagnosis may result in unnecessary hospitalization and subsequently an increased burden on the healthcare system. On the other hand, the accurate identification of severe cases is critical to prevent fatalities. Clinical and conventional laboratory markers, including white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet counts (PLT), and liver enzyme levels can help to distinguish severe cases of dengue from DF. However, clinical manifestations may be delayed and can either follow or be triggered by changes in humoral inflammatory profiles. Therefore, inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines may serve as early direct indicators of the systemic inflammatory status and have potential for prognostication of tissue damage before clinical manifestations of disease severity.

Dengue clinical classification — probable dengue, warning signs, and severe dengue — lists criteria and manifestations for triage. Probable dengue includes living in or travel to an endemic area plus fever with 2 of the following: nausea/vomiting, rash, aches and pains, tourniquet test positive, leukopenia, or any warning sign; laboratory-confirmed dengue includes molecular techniques or IgM or IgG seroconversion. Warning signs comprise abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation (ascites, pleural effusion), mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, postural hypotension, palpable hepatomegaly > 2cm, and progressive increase in hematocrit. Severe dengue is defined by one of the following: shock or respiratory distress due to severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding based on evaluation by the attending physician, or severe organ involvement (such as liver or heart).

### Chikungunya cases identified through passive surveillance and household investigations – puerto rico, may 5-August 12, 2014 [^41d0dda0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Improved vigilance and reporting of suspected chikungunya cases by health care providers can help health authorities estimate the health burden of chikungunya in Puerto Rico and help mobilize the resources needed to respond to the epidemic and direct them to affected areas. The chikungunya epidemic is expected to continue until a critical threshold of the population is no longer susceptible to infection, until which time early and accurate identification of dengue patients will remain a challenge.

Because of overlapping signs and symptoms, chikungunya and dengue are often difficult to distinguish clinically. Therefore, surveillance in areas where both CHIKV and DENV are circulating should include laboratory diagnostic testing for both illnesses. Although aches and pains are characteristic of both illnesses, arthralgia might be more prominent in patients with chikungunya, whereas dengue patients typically complain of generalized myalgia and retro-orbital eye pain. Similarly, although rash might be present in both dengue and chikungunya patients, studies have suggested that it is more common and develops earlier in chikungunya patients. Nonetheless, until arthralgia, rash, or other clinical signs or symptoms have been shown to clearly differentiate patients with chikungunya from those with dengue, the introduction of chikungunya to the Americas heightens the clinical challenge of ensuring optimal management of dengue patients †† (i.e. hospitalization of patients with warning signs of severe dengue [e.g. persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain] or other severe manifestations, and providing outpatients with appropriate anticipatory guidance). Because persons with suspected chikungunya might have dengue, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin and ibuprofen) should be avoided and fever and pain should be managed with acetaminophen until there is a clear diagnosis and the patient is free of warning signs.

### The value of warning signs from the WHO 2009 dengue classification in detecting severe dengue in children [^2b3ebe0a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome Definition

Patients were classified as having nonsevere or severe dengue according to WHO-2009 case definitions. Severe dengue includes: (1) severe plasma leakage with shock (DSS) or presence of hypotension, tachycardia and signs of poor capillary perfusion with or without narrow pulse pressure; (2) severe bleeding, including bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract with or without the need for transfusions of blood products or (3) severe organ impairment defined as elevated levels of aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase of 1000 IU/L or higher, central nervous system impaired consciousness or heart and other organ involvement. An independent trained physician classified the clinical dengue cases to classify patient outcomes as nonsevere dengue or severe dengue.

Definition of WSs on Admission

The WSs considered included: abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, liver enlargement and laboratory results showing an increase in hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count. Abdominal pain was defined as abdominal tenderness and continuous (ie, not intermittent) pain. Persistent vomiting was defined as more than 3 episodes of vomiting within 12 hours. Fluid accumulation was defined as pleural effusion visible on a chest radiograph or ultrasound and ascites detected by abdominal ultrasound. Mucosal bleeding was defined as bleeding gums or conjunctiva, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, hemoptysis or hematuria. Lethargy was defined as an alteration of consciousness with a Glasgow score of less than 15. Hepatomegaly was defined based on the liver edge palpation of more than 2 cm below the right costal margin. Increased hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count (high hematocrit/low platelets) was defined as any increase in hematocrit from baseline at admission in the febrile phase, with a concurrent rapid decrease in platelet count of at least 10,000 cells/mm³ in 24 hours or with a drop of platelet count below 100,000 cells/mm. The Presence or absence of each warning sign on admission was enumerated per patient.

Dengue Clinical Disease

Dengue clinical disease ranges from a mild, undifferentiated febrile illness to severe disease complicated by shock, bleeding, or severe organ impairment. Approximately 75% of dengue infections are mild or asymptomatic. The most common presentation of symptomatic disease is sudden onset of fever accompanied by headache, retro-orbital pain, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, flushing of the face, anorexia, abdominal pain, and nausea. A generalized erythematous, macular rash developing within 3–4 days of fever onset frequently is observed. Laboratory-detected findings can include leukopenia, hemoconcentration, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies dengue illness as 1) dengue with or without warning signs for progression toward severe dengue and 2) severe dengue. Warning signs of severe dengue include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation (e.g. ascites, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion), mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, postural hypotension, liver enlargement of > 2 cm, or an increased hematocrit level concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count. Criteria for the case definition of severe dengue include any sign of severe plasma leakage leading to shock or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or severe organ impairment.

Patients with severe dengue need in-hospital medical treatment to mitigate poor clinical outcomes commonly due to vascular permeability, which results in plasma leakage and leads to hypovolemic shock or clinically significant ascites or pleural effusions, and less commonly, to severe bleeding due to various host or viral factors. Because of the risk for complications due to plasma leakage and bleeding, severe dengue requires monitoring and treatment in intensive care settings. Although rare, dengue can affect the liver, heart, central nervous system, kidneys, eyes, muscles, or bone marrow. These severe manifestations of dengue carry a high risk for death and must be recognized and appropriately managed in a timely manner. Age, comorbidities, host genetics, and the infecting virus strain are risk factors for severe dengue, and heterotypic secondary infections are the most prominent factor associated with severe dengue.

Dengue Treatment

No effective antiviral treatments against dengue are available; therefore, the mainstay for preventing severe disease and death is timely and supportive management with volume replacement, particularly among patients with severe dengue. The case-fatality ratio for severe dengue has been reported to be as high as 13% and can be < 1% with access to timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Phases of symptomatic dengue — incubation, febrile phase, and warning signs: Symptomatic dengue begins abruptly after an incubation period of 5–7 days (range 3–10 days) and has a 3-phase clinical course: febrile, critical, and convalescent. During the febrile phase, fever typically lasts 2–7 days and can be biphasic, with some patients having an injected oropharynx or facial erythema in the first 24–48 hours after onset. Warning signs of progression to severe dengue usually occur in the late febrile phase around the time of defervescence (i.e., temperature 38°C [< 100.4°F]) but can also present during the febrile or critical phase; warning signs include severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, extravascular fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, progressively increase in hematocrit (hemoconcentration), postural hypotension, lethargy or restlessness, and liver enlargement.

DISCUSSION

This study showed that in infants, the most discriminative warning sign for severe dengue is liver enlargement with positive predictive value of 68.8% and NPV of 80.8%, followed by clinical fluid accumulation with NPV of 75%. In older age groups, an increase in hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count was most discriminative WS with NPV (76.1% and 91.9% in children 1–14 years and adolescents, respectively). Other WSs with high NPVs in children 1–14 years and adolescents were abdominal pain, persistent vomiting and clinical fluid accumulation. In the absence of one of these 3 WSs in older children, it leads to unlikely-to-severe dengue.

The prevalence of severe dengue in our pediatric cohort was about 34.4%, which was higher compared to another study from Medan, Indonesia, where the severe dengue prevalence was 25% among children less than 18 years old, but lower than the estimate from another study among pediatric patients, by Pothapregada et al.in India, where severe dengue occurred in 40.6%. The high prevalence obtained in the present study is probably due to the fact that the subjects came from a national tertiary referral hospital, predominantly attracting severe pediatric dengue cases. Our result was also much higher than studies that included all ages. –

### Diagnostic laboratory testing and clinical preparedness for dengue outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1f8e44b6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Sir,

Wilder-Smith and coauthors made key observations regarding the importance of maintaining mosquito control and clinical preparedness for dengue during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, especially given the resurgence of dengue in Latin America in 2019 and 2020. – Clearly, simultaneous outbreaks of COVID-19 and dengue pose high potential for overwhelming healthcare systems; and because the two diseases can have similar nonspecific clinical presentation in early stages, alerting clinicians and putting in place carefully drawn clinical algorithms for triage are critical to reducing mortality. We would like however to qualify and elaborate on Wilder-Smith et al.'s comment regarding virologic and diagnostic testing in this context.

Because diagnostic laboratory testing for dengue is mostly conducted for surveillance purposes in the Americas and is typically not performed in clinical settings, dengue diagnosis is primarily based on clinical presentation and disease progression. Whereas molecular testing for COVID-19 can be performed in most Latin American countries, laboratory testing for COVID-19 may not be frequently available because of limited resources, results may be delayed, and COVID-19 rapid tests may lack sensitivity and specificity. Although we are skeptical that dengue antibodies cross-react with COVID-19 virus, rapid diagnostics tests for dengue, though potentially useful, may lack sensitivity and specificity.

Given limitations in diagnostic testing for both dengue and COVID-19, suspect febrile illnesses in dengue-endemic areas require patient/family guidance to monitor warning signs of severe illness and to seek evaluation and care if signs of symptoms of either disease occur. Patient education and clinical triage protocols should note that the critical period for the most frequent severe complication of dengue, shock due to capillary leakage, can occur somewhat earlier in the course of illness (3–7 days after fever onset, around the time of defervescence) than does the respiratory decompensation seen in COVID-19 patients (5–8 days). Thus, clinicians in dengue-endemic areas during the COVID-19 pandemic should remain vigilant for warning signs of potentially severe dengue illness including abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding, and lethargy or restlessness, and communicate counseling messages regarding these warning signs to patients with suspected early-stage COVID-19, particularly during dengue outbreaks. Furthermore, clinicians should recognize that some of the dengue clinical warning signs may also be seen in COVID-19 cases.

WSs present at admission and stratified by age group are described in Table 2. Among the infants with severe dengue, the most common WSs were liver enlargement 11/16 (68.6%) and clinical fluid accumulation 10/16 (62.5%). In children 1–14 years with severe dengue, the 3 most common WSs were increase in hematocrit with rapid decrease of platelet count 122/181 (61.9%), abdominal pain 108/181 (59.7%) and persistent vomiting 95/181 (30.4%). In adolescents with severe dengue, the most common warning sign was increase in hematocrit with rapid decrease of platelet count 11/14 (78.6%).

TABLE 2.
Warning Signs on Admission Among 614 Confirmed Dengue Patients Stratified by Age and by Severe or Nonsevere Dengue

In infants, liver enlargement was most discriminative with an NPV of 80.8%, followed by clinical fluid accumulation (NPV: 75%). In older children, all WSs, except for mucosal bleeding and lethargy. Restlessness was significantly more common among patients with severe dengue. NPV was highest for an increase in hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count (76.1%). Other WSs with good NPVs in children 1–14 years were abdominal pain, persistent vomiting and clinical fluid accumulation. In adolescents, results on the discriminative value of individual WS were largely in line with results for 1–14-year-olds.

In infants, the combination of the 2 most discriminative WSs (liver enlargement and clinical fluid accumulation), had a NPV of 88%. In adolescents, several combinations of WS each had comparable discriminative power (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,), including abdominal pain and increase in hematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count (NPV: 100%), increase in hematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count and clinical fluid accumulation (NPV: 100%). When the number of WSs increases, the discriminatory ability, notably NPV and specificity, improves, especially in infants (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3).

### Risk predictors of progression to severe disease during the febrile phase of dengue: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ceeac8ea]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Several clinical signs or symptoms were associated with progression to severe disease. We found a robust association with vomiting, with no heterogeneity, whereas high heterogeneity was found in the meta-analysis of abdominal pain and tenderness. This finding is probably due to the subjective nature of the symptom, which depends on both the patient and the physician doing the clinical examination. Bleeding as a clinical entity varies widely from gum bleeding to haematochezia or melaena. However, the presence of minor bleeding (ie, mucosal and spontaneous bleeding) during the febrile phase could be a prognostic sign for progression to severe disease.

All patients with dengue develop a spectrum of plasma leakage, and the presence of either pleural effusion or ascites, which can be classified as clinical fluid accumulation, can be a consequence of severe plasma leakage in the critical phase. However, the clinical detection of pleural effusion or ascites can reflect an increased risk of decompensation in the critical phase. Clinical fluid accumulation is particularly useful when the effusion is detected early within the febrile phase, before severe dengue develops. It will also increase in utility with time, given that the use of ultrasonography in low-income and middle-income countries is increasing and thresholds of detection of pleural effusion or ascites will decrease due to increased sensitivity of detection by ultrasound.

Although the use of a tourniquet test is recommended for diagnosing dengue haemorrhagic fever in the 1997 and 2009 WHO guidelines, we found no evidence that this test allows early prediction of progression to severe disease. All studies of tourniquet test and progression used the 1997 WHO classification, in which the positive tourniquet test itself is a diagnostic criterion for dengue haemorrhagic fever. The positive association obtained in the sensitive analysis could therefore reflect this bias.

Haematological analyses have been used for dengue diagnosis and severity classification in a variety of health-care settings, from primary to tertiary. Platelet count was significantly associated with disease progression in our study, with patients with low platelet count showing a higher risk of progressing to severe disease. This finding is consistent with the observed decrease in platelet counts recorded in other observational studiesand confirms platelet count as one of the key WHO warning signs. Although this meta-analysis could not provide robust clinical evidence of a platelet count cutoff to determine the risk of severe dengue, the majority of the average platelet counts in non-severe dengue groups were higher than 100 000 cells per dL. This value is in line with recommendations from the 1997 WHO dengue guideline and 2011 WHO South-East Asia region (SEARO) dengue guideline.

### Comparison of dengue, chikungunya, and zika among children in Nicaragua across 18 years: a single-centre, prospective cohort study [^12b551f4]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Most of the 62 cases of afebrile dengue were mild and required no hospital admission (appendix 2 pp 14–15). No cases had severe disease, but five (8.1%) had dengue warning signs (as defined by the 2009 WHO guidelines): two with mucosal bleeding, two with abdominal pain, and one with persistent vomiting. 12 (19.4%) of 62 cases had no clinical features besides rash (usually erythematous and generalised) and 17 (27.4%) had one clinical feature besides rash, predominantly leukopenia (12 [70.6%] of 17). Cases of afebrile dengue had a significantly lower number of medical consultations per case than those with febrile dengue (median 2.0 [IQR 1.0–3.0] vs 4.0 [3.0–6.0]; p < 0.0001), and were most similar to those with afebrile Zika in terms of the number of medical consultations (2.0 [1.0–3.0] vs 2.0 [1.0–2.0]; p = 0.19), day of first presentation to the health centre (2.0 [1.0–2.0] vs 2.0 [1.0–2.0]; p = 1.00), and number of clinical features in the first 3 days (2.0 [2.0–3.0] vs 2.0 [1.0–3.0]; p = 0.67) and 10 days of illness (2.5 [2.0–4.0] vs 2.0 [2.0–3.0]; p = 0.81).

Arboviruses

Dengue (Flaviviridae)

Dengue viruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA viruses of the Flaviviridae family. They are the cause of dengue fever. There are four viral serotypes 1–4 with no cross-immunity, and spread is via Aedes mosquito vectors. Incidence has increased 30-fold over recent decades, and there are now an estimated 96 million symptomatic infections annually, two million cases of severe dengue, and 21,000 deaths. Occurring in endemic–epidemic cycles in crowded tropical urban areas, the largest numbers of infections are in children in Asia and young adults in the American tropics, albeit with significant extension to other continents.

Dengue fever occurs 3–14 days after a mosquito bite, with development of a non-specific febrile phase lasting 3–6 days. Upon fever resolution, some cases progress to a critical phase of plasma leakage into abdominal and pleural cavities, also sometimes associated with impaired haemostasis. Other findings include vomiting, petechial rash, myalgia, hepatomegaly, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. A convalescent phase follows. Cases of severe dengue involve dengue shock syndrome and respiratory distress secondary to plasma leakage, severe bleeding and severe end organ involvement.

### The value of warning signs from the WHO 2009 dengue classification in detecting severe dengue in children [^74b35cc2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In infants, important WSs to detect severe dengue are liver enlargement and clinical fluid accumulation; when both these WSs are absent in infants, severe dengue is unlikely. In older children, the presence of any of the WSs — an increase in hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count, abdominal pain, vomiting or fluid accumulation — is likely severe dengue.

### Severe dengue: know the warning signs… [^1a3cb1d5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Severe dengue is a medical emergency. It can start after other symptoms of the disease go away. Severe Dengue: Know the Warning Signs Dengue can be deceptive. The mosquito-borne disease can cause body aches so intense it's sometimes called "break-bone fever. " But in some cases, it's most dangerous after the aches and fever subside. Three out of four people who get infected by the dengue virus never have any symptoms. Most of those who do have symptoms get better in about a week. But of the people who do get sick, about 1 in 20 will get very sick. They might have internal bleeding, go into shock, even die. And severe dengue can start in the day or two after the fever goes away. "It's counterintuitive for patients, and even for some doctors, who might assume that a fever resolving automatically means they are getting better, " says Dr. Joshua Wong, who leads the CDC clinical care team responding to this year's outbreak in Puerto Rico.

But with dengue, "When the fever goes down, that is precisely when you need to be seen by a doctor and monitor for signs or symptoms that might suggest you're progressing to severe dengue". When dengue becomes severe, "It happens fast – like on the order of hours, " says Wong, a lieutenant commander in the U. S. Public Health Service. "Patients sometimes can wait too long before they seek help. " Severe dengue is a medical emergency, so get help immediately if you or a family member has
- Stomach pain or tenderness
- Vomiting
- Bleeding from the nose or gums
- Vomiting blood or blood in the stool. Dengue outbreaks tend to occur every few years in areas with mosquitoes and where the disease is common. Four different types of viruses cause dengue, and the types that are circulating this year haven't been seen much in the past decade, so people's bodies are less likely to have built up immunity to them, Wong says.

Some people are more likely to get sicker than others, including infants, people over age 65, and people with conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or chronic kidney or liver disease.
- Using EPA-registered insect repellent.
- Wearing loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants, when possible.
- And dumping out standing water, where mosquitoes lay eggs.

### Chymase level is a predictive biomarker of dengue hemorrhagic fever in pediatric and adult patients [^c9d2b25a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Dengue is an arboviral infection spread by mosquitoes in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is caused by dengue virus (DENV), which has 4 distinct serotypes. Between 50 million and 400 million DENV infections occur yearly. In DENV-endemic countries, such as the site of this study, Sri Lanka, many patients experience multiple DENV infections in a lifetime. An incubation period of approximately 4–7 days occurs before fever onset. Signs such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and rash and symptoms such as headache, vomiting, and retro-orbital eye pain are common during acute disease and usually resolve within 3–7 days for those who experience mild disease, diagnosed as dengue fever (DF). Mild hemorrhagic manifestations such as petechiae and purpura are also common during this time. Resolution of the febrile response usually occurs around days 4–7, when most patients completely recover, but other individuals can suddenly experience complications. Warning signs have been identified to aid in recognizing patients on course to develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), also known as severe dengue. Warning signs include mucosal bleeding, liver enlargement, abdominal pain, rapid hematocrit increase, persistent vomiting, and clinical fluid accumulation. Many of these signs are subjective and present very late. DHF and DSS are extremely difficult to predict, and there is an urgent need to identify risk factors and biomarkers of severe dengue. Although some studies associated high serum viral titers with DHF and DSS, others have reported conflicting information. Multiple factors could explain these discrepancies, including faster clearance of viremia during secondary infection. There is an unmet need for diagnostic tests to identify severe DENV during the acute phase of disease, since clinical symptoms often fail to predict it with sufficient warning, and to understand whether those tests are robust in multiple patient populations.

Dengue warning signs.

Of the 143 patients, 122 (4 severe, 118 non-severe [85.3%]) had at least one dengue warning sign: abdominal pain or tenderness (N = 42/143 [29.4%]); persistent vomiting (N = 6, 4.2%); edema of face, hands, or feet (N = 54, 37.8%); mucosal bleeding (N = 66 (46.2%): nose/mouth (N = 35), subconjunctival (N = 35), vagina (N = 16); lethargy (N = 4, 2.8%); and a palpable liver (N = 10, 7%, liver size not measured). Ultrasounds, performed in 129 patients, detected 30 (23.3%) with ascites alone (N = 9), a pleural effusion alone (N = 14), or both (N = 7) from D4 to D14, median 7 (IQR: 5–11). The risk of developing ultrasound detected plasma leakage was 3.5-fold (95% CI: 1.3–9.6, P = 0.005) higher in those who received preadmission IV fluids (22/70 [31.4%]) versus those who had not (4/45 [8.9%]), but the median IV fluid volumes administered during admission were similar (P = 0.31) in patients with and without plasma leakage: 3 and 3.2 L, respectively. Patients with concurrent rising Hcts and declining platelet counts numbered 17 (11.9%).

WHO defined severe dengue.

Four patients (2.8% [95% CI: 0.77–7.01]) developed severe dengue: 1) one [0.69 (0–3.8)%] developed shock (systolic BP 70 mmHg) on D10 and 2) three had AST > 1,000 IU/L but no clinical features of acute liver failure. All had prior warning signs. The shocked patient had facial swelling, abdominal pain, and ascites; the other three had mucosal bleeding (N = 1), lethargy (N = 1), and a pleural effusion (N = 1). No patients had severe bleeding, reduced consciousness, or clinical evidence of other end-organ damage, and none died.

### Epidemiology of dengue among children aged [^602db3e9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Of 472 (58%) laboratory-positive cases who were reported to have been hospitalized, 145 (31%) had medical records that were available and reviewed (Table 2). Of the 145 cases who were reviewed, 41% met the 1997 WHO case definitions for DF, 19% for DHF, and 4% for DSS. When using the 2009 WHO case definitions, 40% met the case definitions for dengue, 23% for dengue with warning signs, and 33% for severe dengue. When compared with the data from the chart review, the percentage of underreporting for each of these respective classes of severe dengue based on data reported through PDSS was 3% for DSS, 15% for DHF, and 21% for severe dengue.

The most common warning signs of dengue among these 145 cases were pleural effusion (25%), persistent vomiting (18%), and ascites (14%). Of those infants with severe dengue, 3 (6%) had severe bleeding, 25 (52%) had severe plasma leakage resulting in shock or respiratory distress, 5 (10%) had severe organ impairment, and 15 (31%) met the definitions for two or more of these categories. Other clinical signs were refusal to eat (50%), irritability (41%), constant crying (15%), and changes in sleeping habits (8%). Severe dengue and DHF/DSS cases presented to the hospital and were hospitalized 3.0 (95% CI = 2.5–3.6) and 2.6 (95% CI = 1.9–3.3) days postsymptom onset, respectively; their length of hospitalization was similar at 7.9 (95% CI = 6.4–9.4) and 6.9 (95% CI = 5.7–8.1) days, respectively.

### The value of warning signs from the WHO 2009 dengue classification in detecting severe dengue in children [^e98cb6ec]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

World Health Organization proposed 7 warning signs to identify the risk of severe dengue in 2009. This study aimed to evaluate the value of these warning signs in detecting severe dengue in children.

Material and Methods:

A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data of children with clinical dengue infection obtained from medical records between January 2009 and December 2018 in Jakarta. Children with confirmed dengue were analyzed and stratified into 3 age groups: infants less than 1 year old, children 1–14 years and adolescents 15–18 years of age. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity of each warning sign present or absent on admission in detecting severe dengue were computed.

Results:

Six hundred ninety-nine children with clinical dengue infection were enrolled, among whom 614 (87.8%) had confirmed dengue infection, either by antigen or antibody serological tests. Severe dengue occurred in 211/614 (34.4%) cases. In infants, important warning signs on admission to detect or exclude severe dengue were liver enlargement (NPV 80.8%) and clinical fluid accumulation (NPV 75%). In children and adolescents, warning sign with highest NPV (in children 76.6% and in adolescents 91.9%) was increase in hematocrit concurrent with a rapid decrease in platelet count. Other warning signs with high NPV values in children were abdominal pain (72%), vomiting (70%), clinical fluid accumulation (69.3%), and in adolescents' abdominal pain (80.7%), vomiting (75.7%), clinical fluid accumulation (82.7%). NPVs increase with more than 1 warning sign in all age groups.

Conclusion:

In infants, liver enlargement or clinical fluid accumulation are important warning signs for severe dengue, when both are absent, severe dengue is unlikely. In older children and adolescents, an increase in hematocrit with the concurrent rapid decrease in platelet count is most discriminative; followed by the absence of abdominal pain, vomiting or fluid accumulation are unlikely severe dengue.

### Primary dengue and long-term health status in madeira island, Portugal: a retrospective questionnaire-based study [^f97176cb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dengue, a vector-borne disease caused by one of the four known serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), has become endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, where it represents a major health concern. During the past 5 decades, the incidence of dengue epidemics has increased 30-fold, reaching nowadays 390 million annual infections, with new countries being affected.

Infected people may be asymptomatic (estimated to be 50%–98% of the infected)or exhibit a wide spectrum of manifestations, from mild disease to severely debilitating or lethal disease, classified as "severe dengue" according to the WHO. Literature describing the manifestations of symptomatic dengue at the acute and convalescence phases of the infection is abundant. – The most common signs and symptoms are fever accompanied by myalgia/arthralgia, headaches, retro-orbital pain, maculopapular rash, leukopenia, abdominal pain, and/or vomiting; in most patients, this is a self-limiting infection lasting up to 2 weeks. –

To gain a better understanding of the real impact of a dengue outbreak on the health status of a population, it is crucial to evaluate the clinical manifestations during active infection but also those that become more evident or appear after the recovery phase and persist chronically. Despite the recognition of late complications and unusual manifestations by the WHO, little is known about the long-term consequences of dengue. Some reports indicated that muscle pain, arthralgia, or asthenia, among other symptoms, may persist for 1–2 months in 9–24% of patients. – A few studies have published evidence of an even longer duration of persistent symptoms, up to 2 years after infection. Additionally, long-term manifestations such as liver injury, cardiovascular sequelae (reviewed in Rahim et al.), and neurologic and ocular complications (reviewed in Trivedi and Chakravarty)have also been described. Infection with DENV can also favor Guillain–Barré or chronic fatigue syndromes, as observed in other viral infections.

### The association between diabetes and obesity with dengue infections [^9067fc6f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Different dengue serotypes may show different clinical manifestations. According to a cohort study in Singapore, a higher risk for Severe Dengue (SD) is associated with DENV-1 as compared to DENV-2 and DENV-3 based on the criteria published in 2009 by WHO. On the other hand, a retrospective observational study in Malaysia found DENV-2-infected patients have increased risk of developing SD (33%, 9 out of 27 patients) as compared to DENV-1 and DENV-3. Dengue fever can be classified to 3 different categories according to the WHO 2009 dengue case classification. These are Dengue without warning signs (DWOS), Dengue with warning signs (DWWS) and SD. The clinical presentations of warning signs are abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleed, lethargy, liver enlargement, high haematocrit and low platelet count due to blood cell diffusing out from the blood vessels and a decrease in blood volume. Persistence of DWWS may leads to the development of SD with the symptoms of severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding, and severe organ impairment.

### Definitions for warning signs and signs of severe dengue according to the WHO 2009 classification: systematic review of literature [^0d735e81]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Since warning signs and signs of severe dengue are defined differently between studies, we conducted a systematic review on how researchers defined these signs. We conducted an electronic search in Scopus to identify relevant articles, using key words including dengue, "warning signs", "severe dengue", and "classification". A total of 491 articles were identified through this search strategy and were subsequently screened by 2 independent reviewers for definitions of any of the warning or severe signs in the 2009 WHO dengue classification. We included all original articles published in English after 2009, classifying dengue by the 2009 WHO classification or providing the additional definition or criterion of warning signs and severity (besides the information of 2009 WHO). Analysis of the extracted data from 44 articles showed wide variations among definitions and cutoff values used by physicians to classify patients diagnosed with dengue infection. The establishment of clear definitions for warning signs and severity is essential to prevent unnecessary hospitalization and harmonizing the interpretation and comparability of epidemiological studies dedicated to dengue infection.

### Clinical features of dengue… [^5b3d423a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Febrile Phase
- Fever typically lasts 2–7 days and can be biphasic.
- Other signs and symptoms may include severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia and arthralgia, macular or maculopapular rash; and minor hemorrhagic manifestations including petechia, ecchymosis, purpura, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematuria, or a positive tourniquet test result.
- Some patients have injected oropharynx and facial erythema in the first 24–48 hours after onset. Warning Signs Warning signs of progression to severe dengue usually occur in the late febrile phase around the time of defervescence, and include persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy/restlessness, postural hypotension, liver enlargement, and progressive increase in hematocrit. Critical Phase
- The critical phase of dengue begins at defervescence and typically lasts 24–48 hours.
- Most patients clinically improve during this phase, but those with substantial plasma leakage can, within a few hours, develop severe dengue.
- Initially, physiologic compensatory mechanisms maintain adequate circulation, which narrows pulse pressure as diastolic blood pressure increases.
- Patients with severe plasma leakage may have pleural effusions, ascites, hypoproteinemia, or hemoconcentration.
- Patients may appear to be well despite early signs of shock. However, once hypotension develops, systolic blood pressure rapidly declines, and irreversible shock and death may ensue despite resuscitation.
- Patients can also develop severe hemorrhagic manifestations, including hematemesis, hematochezia, or menorrhagia, especially if they have been in prolonged shock. Uncommon manifestations include hepatitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and encephalitis.

Dengue warning signs include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, and liver enlargement. Patients with warning signs should be monitored closely as they can be more likely to progress to severe disease. Severe dengue is defined by dengue with any of the following clinical manifestations: severe plasma leakage leading to shock or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress; severe bleeding; or severe organ impairment such as hepatitis, impaired consciousness, or heart impairment.

2 Methods and materials

2.1 Patients

The study was designed as a phase II open-label, randomized, controlled trial to compare the doses, efficacy, and safety of eltrombopag to correct thrombocytopenia in moderate to severe dengue patients. Patients with an age range between 15 and 65 years and clinical presentation of dengue virus infection including but is not limited to fever, leucopenia (WBC ≤ 5000 cells/mm³), increased hematocrit (Hct) 5–10% from baseline, platelet count ≤ 150 × 10⁹/L, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia/bone pain, rash were considered as suspected dengue patients in accordance with the world health organization (WHO) guideline. Briefly, moderate dengue was defined for patients with a high fever (40 °C/104°F) is accompanied by two of the warning signs including abdominal pain and tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, and liver enlargement, increase in hematocrit (Hct) and rapid decrease in platelet count. Severe dengue including the DHF patients was characterized by one of the following symptoms: plasma leakage leading to shock or respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ failure (eg, elevated liver enzyme levels, impaired consciousness, or heart failure). The suspected patients were subjected to dengue specific antigen (NS1) and antibody (IgM/IgG) tests. Patients exhibiting positive results for NS1 or dengue specific IgM/IgG were considered as dengue positive patients. Patients diagnosed with dengue virus infection were screened for eligibility to enter the trial. Among the eligible candidates, patients with pregnancy, receiving immunosuppressive therapy, thrombocytopenia caused by other factors such as severe aplastic anemia (SAA), chronic liver disease (CLD) and Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels higher than 5 times of upper normal limit, history of portal vein thrombosis and HBV/HCV infection were excluded from the trial. Additionally, patients with any severe co-morbidity such as chronic kidney disease were excluded. According to the World Health Organization, Regional Office for South-East Asia (WHO SEARO) 2011, one of the warning signs of severe dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever, has been characterized by the decreased platelet count below 100 × 10⁹/L. Based on this characterization, eligible patients exhibiting platelet (PLT) count below 100 × 10⁹/L were enrolled in the trial.

### Effects of acute dengue infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids of men [^05dcdbea]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Dengue is a mosquitoborne viral disease common in regions with tropical climates. Worldwide annual dengue incidence is estimated at ≈100 million diagnosed and ≈300 million asymptomatic infections. To date, it is estimated that > 55% of the population worldwide is exposed to dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus from the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. The disease represents a global health issue because it is endemic in > 100 countries and the World Health Organization listed dengue as a top 10 disease threat in 2019. Climate change and increased circulation of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in temperate countries mean that dengue incidence is being forecast to increase and extend to regions not previously affected.

Most dengue-infected persons are asymptomatic or develop a mild form of the disease with common signs and symptoms resembling those of influenza, such as fever, retroocular pain, headache, rash, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. However, a small proportion of infections progress to severe illness that can cause rapid onset of capillary leakage leading to bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and rapid shock. Severe dengue can be fatal, and it is often impossible to predict the progression from mild infection to severe dengue.

### Clinical manifestations of dengue in children and adults in a hyperendemic region of Colombia [^4f78df6d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of dengue typically occur 5–7 days after infection, with severe dengue occurring in some cases. Diagnosis primarily hinges on a distinct fever lasting less than a week, absence of upper respiratory symptoms, and at least two of the following: headache and/or pain behind the eyes, general discomfort, muscle or joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting, skin rash, petechiae, a positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated liver enzymes. These symptoms vary between children and adults.

Previous research indicates that adults with dengue often suffer from myalgia, retro-orbital pain, nausea, and arthralgia, whereas children tend to exhibit vomiting and rashes. Rapid progression to severe dengue, marked by vascular leakage in children and bleeding in adults, differs between age groups. Notably, febrile and gastrointestinal symptoms in Bangladeshi children and hepatomegaly and fatigue in Thai infants were observed. Yet, the distinction between pediatric and adult symptoms remains vague. With dengue's rise in Latin American children, the need for targeted health interventions has become critical in reducing school absenteeism, hospitalizations, and potential increases in child mortality.

Dengue may be challenging to recognize because of its undifferentiated presentation, with symptoms that are similar to those of other viral illnesses, making differentiation especially difficult in children, who have high exposure to febrile diseases. In addition, given the absence of specific treatments for dengue, early detection of disease is essential. The need to identify clear warning signs for early and effective medical response is paramount. In effect, our study aimed to differentiate the signs and symptoms (clinical and hematological) between individuals under 12 years and those 12 years and older in an endemic Colombian region.

### Dengue human infection models supporting drug development [^511c98fa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to DENV-4) are the most important arboviral pathogens of humans. The global burden of dengue, recently estimated at approximately 100 million cases per year, remains unchallenged by licensed vaccines or sustainable vector control strategies. The scale of the dengue burden in the endemic countries of Asia and Latin America has a negative economic impact and places a significant clinical burden on often fragile health care systems.

Dengue is an acute systemic febrile illness that manifests with abrupt onset as an undifferentiated fever that is difficult to distinguish from other infections without laboratory diagnostic tests. Headache, malaise, myalgia, retro-orbital pain are common symptoms in adults. The clinical features differ by age group, with symptoms such as cough, vomiting and abdominal pain more common in children. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory features.

In most cases, fever and symptoms resolve uneventfully after 3–7 days with no long-term sequelae. In a subset of cases, a transient vascular leakage syndrome develops after 3–4 days of illness, which, when severe, can lead to life-threatening hypovolemic shock (called dengue shock syndrome) and/or hemorrhage. The vascular leak syndrome may be associated with complement activation and a coagulopathy that can contribute to the risk of hemorrhage. Signs of vascular leakage include an increasing hematocrit, microalbuminuria, or the accumulation of fluids at serosal surfaces (eg, pleural effusions).

Supportive care and the careful titration of minimum volumes of parenteral crystalloid fluids to maintain stable cardiac output during the 1–3-day period of vascular permeability are critical elements in dengue case management. Vasopressors are commonly used in cases with prolonged shock. Clinically significant hemorrhage requiring use of blood products is more common in adults than in children.

Improvements in the management of severe dengue cases have seen the case mortality rate decline over the last decade in many but not all endemic settings. At present there is no validated way of identifying which patients will progress to more severe disease, meaning that health facilities in endemic areas are often overwhelmed with patients with dengue who require ongoing observation as outpatients or are admitted for inpatient observation.

### Dengue virus infections among peace corps volunteers in timor-leste, 2018–2019 [^f5089eb6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of dengue patients to those who sought care for an acute febrile illness and had no laboratory diagnostic evidence of dengue (Table 1). Median age among all patients was 24 years (range: 22–25) and half (50%) were female. Nausea, vomiting, and headache were common among all patients, and all dengue patients presented with fever and myalgia. Rash was significantly more common in dengue patients (73% versus 11%, respectively; P < 0.05). No other signs and symptoms or demographic characteristics were significantly associated with dengue patients.

Table 1
Characteristics of Peace Corps volunteers in Timor-Leste with fever or clinical suspicion of dengue by status of dengue virus infection, September 2018–June 2019 (n = 20)

Dengue warning signs were reported in three dengue patients. One patient who tested positive for DENV-3 by RT-PCR had persistent vomiting and a pulse pressure < 20. The other two patients, who tested positive for DENV by NS1, presented with bleeding (menorrhagia) and persistent vomiting, as well as abdominal pain and ascites, respectively. Clinical findings among dengue patients also included hypotension and marked thrombocytopenia, but none met the case definitions for severe dengue or dengue hemorrhagic fever.

The first patient with laboratory diagnostic evidence of DENV infection had symptom onset in January 2019. Additional cases were identified through June 2019 (Figure 1). The greatest numbers of monthly dengue patients were identified in February and March (n = 3).

### Comparing the usefulness of the 1997 and 2009 WHO dengue case classification: a systematic literature review [^63ef9b7d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

WS for SD disease.

Several studies looked at the value of WS as predictors of severe disease. The study in ref.suggests that having at least five WS may be a good predictor of severe disease; in particular, lymphocyte counts < 1,500 cells/mm³, platelet counts < 20,000/mm³, and raised AST levels were associated with SD. However, in the study in ref. the three most common WS were lethargy, abdominal pain/tenderness, and mucosal bleeding. Also, no single WS alone or combined had a sensitivity of more than 64% in predicting severe disease. Specificity was 90% for both DHF and SD with persistent vomiting, hepatomegaly, hematocrit rise, and rapid platelet drop.

In practice, however, it seems that WS are significant events that are well-documented in medical charts, but using WS as compulsory hospitalization criteria may well increase workload.

Usefulness for triage and in outbreaks.

The study in ref.finds — with focus groups and questionnaires among clinicians in 18 countries — that D/SD "was easily applicable in clinical practice, also seen to be useful for triage and case management by medical staff, more frequently than the DF/DHF/DSS classification". The study in ref.analyses medical charts of 274 confirmed dengue cases. When using DF/DHF/DSS, more intensive treatment (with careful monitoring and intravenous rehydration) was needed in 94 cases compared with 189 cases when using D+WS and SD as criteria. Similarly, the study in ref.calculates the requirement for hospitalization increasing from 17.0% to 51.3% using D/SD. This finding is in agreement with the findings in the study in ref.: "DF/DHF/DSS may save health care resources with its more stringent definition of a DHF case requiring the most intensive hospital intervention". However, the same study points out that "the use of D/SD guidelines in this outbreak facilitated the early admission of those with life threatening dengue disease for appropriate clinical management".

### Disease severity and mortality caused by dengue in a Dominican pediatric population [^00cb122b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Millions are infected with dengue yearly. We evaluated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients infected with dengue in the Dominican Republic. The applicability of World Health Organization (WHO) warning signs for predicting severe dengue and mortality was also studied. This study was a cross-sectional retrospective review of patients with a clinical diagnosis of dengue. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate characteristics associated with severity and mortality. The study included 796 subjects: 288 subjects were classified as dengue, 290 subjects had alarm signs, and 207 subjects were classified as severe dengue. Common findings included thrombocytopenia (96%), abdominal pain (71%), and vomiting (59%). The most important factors associated with severe dengue were rash (P < 0.01), severe thrombocytopenia (P < 0.01), and anemia (P < 0.01). These signs and symptoms were also associated with mortality. This study validates the current WHO warning signs of severity. Rash and severe thrombocytopenia may be early warning signs and need additional study.

### Evaluation of the NS1 rapid test and the WHO dengue classification schemes for use as bedside diagnosis of acute dengue fever in adults [^3755b193]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

WHO dengue classification schemes.

Clinical data obtained from EDEN patients within 72 hours of fever onset were used in a diagnosis of probable dengue versus other febrile illness using the 1997 and 2009 WHO classification schemes. The 1997 WHO classificationclassifies acute febrile illness as dengue fever based on headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, hemorrhagic manifestations, and leukopenia. In contrast, the 2009 WHO classificationuses two or more clinical manifestations for probable dengue classification: nausea/vomiting, rash, aches and pains, tourniquet test positive, leucopenia, and any warning signs. For this analysis, leukopenia was defined as white blood cell (WBC) count below 4.5 × 10/μL, and arthralgia/myalgia was included under aches and pains. Information on tourniquet test positivity was not obtained and hence, was not included in this analysis.

Because the goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the dengue classification schemes as tools for early diagnosis, we have not included five of seven warning signs listed in the 2009 classificationas criteria for diagnosis. These signs, namely clinical fluid accumulation, liver enlargement (> 2 cm), increase in hematocrit, persistent vomiting, and lethargy/restlessness, were present in some cases but at either the second visit or later, and they were detected through repeated monitoring. Hence, they may not be useful for early dengue diagnosis. Abdominal pain and mucosal bleeding were the only warning signs included in our diagnostic analysis.

Immunochromatographic detection of dengue NS1 antigen.

The Dengue NS1 Ag Strip is a lateral flow immunochromatography test for the detection of the NS1 antigen. The manufacturer recommended that the NS1 Strip be read at 15 minutes and again at 30 minutes for doubtful samples or negative samples in patients with suggestive clinical information. In this study, the test was read at both 15 and 30 minutes for all serum samples, and the results were analyzed separately. Two technicians read each NS1 strip independently and were blinded to the infection status of the serum sample. If interpretations were conflicting, the final result was taken as equivocal.

Statistics.

Statistical analysis was performed with SAS software, version 9.2. The two-sample t test was used to analyze continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test was used to compare binary variables and sensitivity.

### Dengue outbreak – federated States of micronesia, 2012–2013 [^71f17a16]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

A modified WHO 2009 dengue case definition was used to identify suspected dengue cases with fever plus at least two of the following: anorexia and nausea, rash, aches and pains (headache, eye pain, muscle pain, or joint pain), leukopenia (white blood cells < 4,000/mL), or a warning sign (abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleed or widespread petechiae, lethargy, restlessness, clinical fluid accumulation, or liver enlargement > 2 cm). The case definition for an RDT-positive case was any suspected dengue case that tested NS1-positive or IgM-positive by RDT.

From September 26, 2012, to March 14, 2013, a total of 729 suspected dengue cases were identified at Kosrae State Hospital, with 242 (33.2%) patients admitted. One or more dengue warning signs were reported for 159 (21.8%) patients. Although detailed data on severe dengue cases are not available, poor peripheral perfusion or hemodynamic instability, as defined by the treating physician, was reported for 25 (3.4%) patients. No deaths were reported.

Of 728 patients tested by RDT, 206 (28.3%) had positive results (Figure 1). Of these, 173 (84.0%) were NS1-positive and 41 (19.9%) were IgM anti-DENV-positive (eight patients [4%] were positive for both NS1 and IgM anti-DENV). The cumulative incidence during the 5.5 months was 110.0 suspected and 31.1 RDT-positive dengue cases per 1,000 population, respectively.

The persons most affected by the dengue outbreak were aged 15–39 years (Figure 2). The 20–24 year age group had the highest suspected dengue case rate at 171.5 per 1,000 population; the 35–39 year age group had the highest RDT-positive dengue case rate at 83.6 per 1,000 population. The least affected age group was 0–4 years (62.7 suspected and 1.3 RDT-positive cases per 1,000 population, respectively).

### Differential clinical symptoms among acute phase Indian patients revealed significant association with dengue viral load and serum IFN-gamma level [^956fef23]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

During last three decades, dengue (DF), an arthropod-borne viral disease is increasingly prevalent worldwide including India, resulting in serious public health problems.

Objective

This study was carried out during 2012–2013 to evaluate the association of WHO-classified dengue disease symptoms with viral load (VL) and serum IFN-gamma levels in dengue patients from India.

Study Design

Blood samples were collected from dengue symptomatic febrile patients (n = 127). DEN-VL was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using RNA, extracted from plasma and anti-DENV-IgM was detected by ELISA. Serum IFN-gamma level was detected by ELISA among DENV infected and age-matched control individuals. Association between DEN-VL and IFN-gamma level in patient's sera with WHO-classified disease symptoms was statistically analyzed.

Results

DENV RNA and anti-DENV-IgM was detected among 94% (n = 73) and 36% (n = 28) of dengue infected patients (n = 78) respectively. Fever, nausea, rash, aches & pains, leucopenia and persistent vomiting were significantly correlated with DENV infection (P-value < 0.05). Only patients with high-VL exhibited leucopenia, persistent vomiting, abdominal pain and clinical fluid accumulation, which were warning signs of dengue infection according to revised WHO-criteria (P-value < 0.05). Clinical symptoms of DENV infected patients, viz. leucopenia, abdominal pain and persistent vomiting were significantly correlated to each other (P-value < 0.05). Increased serum IFN-gamma level was detected among dengue patients compared to control individuals. DEN-VL and symptoms like nausea, leucopenia, persistent vomiting and abdominal pain were significantly negatively correlated with serum IFN-gamma level (P-value < 0.05).

Conclusion

Serum IFN-gamma level and dengue viremia among acute stage patients might be used as early prognostic marker for disease severity prediction.

### Predicting the severity of dengue fever in children on admission based on clinical features and laboratory indicators: application of classification tree analysis [^7b3b37dd]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Another recent study, by Tamibmaniam et al. used simple logistic regression and identified three parameters, including vomiting, pleural effusion, and low systolic blood pressure, to predict severe dengue based on the 2009 WHO criteria. This study did not specifically focus on children and included only female patients. The sensitivity and specificity achieved in its decision algorithm were 81% and 54%, respectively. Of the three parameters they identified, vomiting was the only parameter available in our study, and although it initially appeared to be significant in the severe group, it was not selected for the final tree.

Despite using a similar approach to predict somewhat similar outcomes to the aforementioned studies, we identified additional parameters that related to the severity of dengue, including GCS, urine protein, and serum creatinine. There are a number of possible explanations for these differences, as outlined below.

### Differentiating dengue from COVID-19: comparison of cases in Colombia [^7d06086c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

From a total of 123 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 183 patients diagnosed with dengue, 23 and 70 were included in each group, respectively, after meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the dengue patients, 38 cases had positive anti-DENV antibodies and 32 had positive anti-DENV antibodies and NS1antigen.

There were two cases of dengue and COVID-19 coinfection. The first case was confirmed by nested RT-PCR for DENV 1–4, and the second was confirmed by seroconversion (persistence of positive anti-DENV antibodies 24 days after onset of symptoms).

Seventy-one percent of the dengue patients were classified as dengue with warning signs, 17% as dengue without warning signs, and 12% as severe dengue. The most frequent warning signs were persistent vomiting (22.7%), bleeding manifestations (20%), and increased hematocrit (19.7%). The median length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients was 8 days (IQR = 4–25 days), and for dengue patients, it was 3 days (IQR = 2–4 days).

Table 1 shows the demographics and clinical and laboratory findings for both diseases. Dengue patients were significantly younger than COVID-19 patients (P < 0.01). A lower median oxygen saturation at admission was reported in COVID-19 patients. Fever, myalgias, headache, and nausea were more frequent in dengue patients. The mean length of time of symptoms before consulting was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (P = 0.017). Cough and dyspnea were more frequent in COVID-19 patients. There was less oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients than in dengue patients (P < 0.001). A decrease in the hemoglobin value (< 10 g/dL) was more frequent in COVID-19 patients. There were no COVID-19 patients with leukopenia, and two patients had thrombocytopenia.

### Clinical spectrum and predictors of severity of dengue among children in 2019 outbreak: a multicenter hospital-based study in Bangladesh [^9ab245dc]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The mosquito-borne arboviral disease dengue has become a global public health concern. However, very few studies have reported atypical clinical features of dengue among children. Because an understanding of various spectrums of presentation of dengue is necessary for timely diagnosis and management, we aimed to document the typical and atypical clinical features along with predictors of severity among children with dengue during the largest outbreak in Bangladesh in 2019.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study between August 15 and September 30, 2019. in eight tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka city. Children (aged < 15years) with serologically confirmed dengue were conveniently selected for data collection through a structured questionnaire. Descriptive, inferential statistics, and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze data.

Results

Among the 190 children (mean age 8.8years, and male-female ratio 1.22:1) included in the analysis, respectively 71.1 and 28.9% children had non-severe and severe dengue. All children had fever with an average temperature of 103.3 ± 1.2F (SD). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common associated feature, including mostly vomiting (80.4%), decreased appetite (79.5%), constipation (72.7%), and abdominal pain (64.9%). Mouth sore, a less reported feature besides constipation, was present in 28.3% of children. Atypical clinical features were mostly neurological, with confusion (21.3%) being the predominant symptom. Frequent laboratory abnormalities were thrombocytopenia (87.2%), leucopenia (40.4%), and increased hematocrit (13.4%). Age (AOR 0.86, 95%CI 0.75–0.98, p = 0.023), mouth sore (AOR 2.69, 95%CI 1.06–6.96, p = 0.038) and a decreased platelet count (< 50,000/mm³) with increased hematocrit (> 20%) (AOR 4.94, 95%CI 1.48–17.31, p = 0.01) were significant predictors of severity.

Conclusions

Dengue in children was characterized by a high severity, predominance of gastrointestinal symptoms, and atypical neurological presentations. Younger age, mouth sores, and a decreased platelet with increased hematocrit were significant predictors of severity. Our findings would contribute to the clinical management of dengue in children.

### Occurrence and correlates of symptom persistence following acute dengue fever in Peru [^18fd1c36]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes an acute febrile illness generally considered to result in either complete recovery or death. Some reviews describe persistent symptoms after the febrile phase, although empirical data supporting this phenomenon is scarce. We evaluated symptom persistence in acute febrile DENV-infected and DENV-negative (controls) individuals from Peru. Self-reported solicited symptoms were evaluated at an acute and a follow-up visit, occurring 10–60 days after symptom onset. Rate of persistence of at least one symptom was 7.7% and 10.5% for DENV infected and control subjects, respectively (P < 0.01). The DENV-infected individuals had lower rates of persistent respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and fatigue, but higher rates of persistent rash compared with controls. Older age and female gender were positively associated with symptom persistence. As dengue cases continue to increase annually, even a relatively low frequency of persistent symptoms may represent a considerable worldwide morbidity burden.

### Dengue serotype-specific differences in clinical manifestation, laboratory parameters and risk of severe disease in adults, Singapore [^9fb44611]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Outcome variables.

The clinical manifestations included in the analysis were headache, drowsiness, eye pain, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, bleeding, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, red eyes (conjunctival injection), and abdominal pain. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 warning signs of lethargy/drowsiness, severe abdominal pain, and mucosal bleeding were assessed as one variable defined as patients who fulfilled any of the three warning signs (WS). Data on the other WS were not collected for the whole cohort and hence were not included in the analysis. Plasma viral RNA level, temperature, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, hematocrit, platelet, and leukocyte count at the first day of presentation were analyzed. Both DHF and SD were classified according to the WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria; data from entire clinical course were used to assess disease severity outcomes. All four of the following criteria must be present to fulfill the case definition of DHF, namely: fever or history of fever, hemorrhagic tendencies, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of plasma leakage.SD was defined by one or more of the following: severe plasma leakage (shock, fluid accumulation with respiratory distress), severe bleeding, or severe organ impairment.

Data analysis.

For descriptive analyses, number and percentage were used for categorical variables; median and range were used for continuous variables. The χ² test was used to compare univariate categorical data whereas Fisher's exact test was used if expected cell sizes < 5. Modified Poisson regression was carried out for binary outcomes whereas ordinal logistic regression was used for ordinal categorical data. Adjustment was done for clinically relevant potential confounders: age, gender, year of infection, recruitment site, fever day, and primary/secondary infection status unless stated otherwise. All analysis was done using R 15.0 and SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### The increasing importance of dengue virus infection in Saudi arabia: a review [^27487cd5]. Virus Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 80% of initial dengue virus infections occur without any noticeable symptoms, with fewer than 20% of those infected showing clinical signs. Dengue fever typically manifests as intense headaches, mild fever, skin rashes, muscle and joint discomfort, as well as feelings of nausea and vomiting. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is marked by elevated body temperature, enlarged liver (megalohepatia), instances of bleeding, shock, and frequently, disruptions in cardiovascular function. Initially, DHF was documented as primarily impacting individuals under the age of 15, but subsequent research has revealed its occurrence in adults as well.

Infection with the dengue virus initiates acute febrile syndrome;. Some studies suggest that the dengue virus non-structural protein-1 is found abundantly in a patient's serum, both as a soluble lipoprotein and on cell surfaces, and these elevated levels might be linked to disease severity and play a role in the development of severe dengue in the host;. A single infection with a specific dengue virus serotype can grant long-lasting immunity against that serotype and offer limited cross-protection against different serotypes in the short term. However, it has been observed that a second infection with a different dengue serotype, known as heterotypic secondary dengue viral infection, significantly increases the risk of severe dengue, including the potentially life-threatening conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome;. Moreover, certain clinical symptoms and non-communicable conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes have been recently linked to the severity of dengue infection.

### Dengue outbreak and response-puerto rico, 2024 [^e0eceb0b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dengue is a mosquitoborne viral infection primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Dengue is caused by four distinct dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV-1–4), and manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to severe disease. Signs and symptoms typically appear 3–10 days after exposure and include fever, muscle and joint pain, retroorbital pain, rash, nausea, and vomiting. Although no antiviral treatment is available, early recognition of warning signs of severe dengue, a life-threatening complication of dengue, proper triage, supportive care, and follow-up are crucial to reducing morbidity and mortality. The Dengvaxia dengue vaccine (Sanofi-Pasteur) * is recommended for persons aged 9–16 years who live in areas of the United States with endemic dengue and who have had a confirmed previous dengue infection; vaccination provides protection against symptomatic disease and hospitalization from dengue. †

Approximately 13 million dengue cases were reported to the Pan American Health Organization from North, Central, and South America in 2024. DENV transmission is frequent in Puerto Rico, with seasonal peaks occurring July–November and outbreaks every 3–7 years. The dengue outbreak in 2024 marks Puerto Rico's first since 2013, denoting an unusually long 11-year gap. This extended interval was likely influenced by temporary cross-protective immunity to dengue after the Zika outbreak in 2016 followed by reduced travel and exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2024, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) declared a public health emergency when dengue cases exceeded the epidemic threshold, defined as the point at which weekly cases surpass levels historically associated with epidemics, based on 30 years of surveillance data. This report describes a dengue outbreak response conducted in collaboration with CDC to monitor the outbreak and implement vector-control measures and public health campaigns to raise awareness about increasing dengue case numbers and strategies to prevent mosquito bites.

### The 2023 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh: exploring the epidemiology in hospitalized patients [^8e8e8f56]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

For the past two decades, Bangladesh has faced recurrent dengue outbreaks, with the most recent occurring in 2023. We investigated the socioeconomic, clinical, and laboratory aspects of patients diagnosed with dengue during this outbreak. This observational study was conducted from July to September 2023 at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Chittagong Medical College Hospital, and included 450 confirmed cases of dengue. Sociodemographic information was collected via face-to-face interviews, clinical examinations, and laboratory testing, which was done within 24 hours of admission. Dengue severity was classified according to the 2009 WHO dengue guidelines. Notably, 17% of patients experienced severe dengue, and 89% of those with nonsevere cases exhibited at least one warning sign. Most patients were young adults (mean age, 33 years), with a nearly equal male-to-female ratio. Common clinical presentations included fever (95%), myalgia (62%), and headache (58%), whereas warning signs such as vomiting (54%) and abdominal pain (39%) were prevalent. Plasma leakage indicators, including ascites, pleural effusion, and edema, were found predominantly in severe cases. Laboratory findings revealed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in nearly half the patients. An elevated hematocrit level was associated with severe dengue. We report that a substantial number of patients developed severe dengue during the epidemic in 2023, and provide detailed clinical-epidemiological profiles of the patients, offering valuable insight into management of dengue cases.

### Primary dengue and long-term health status in madeira island, Portugal: a retrospective questionnaire-based study [^4e0b048f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Dengue is among the most important mosquito-borne viral diseases worldwide. Although its acute manifestations are well known, little is known about the long-term impact of dengue on the population's health status. Madeira Island experienced a single outbreak of autochthonous dengue from September 2012 to March 2013. To extend our knowledge about the clinical impact of the outbreak on this naive population, we applied an online questionnaire to 168 adults diagnosed with dengue at the time to characterize retrospectively their symptoms during the infection and to identify long-term manifestations, possibly triggered by dengue. The most frequent symptoms during the clinical period, reported by more than three-quarters of our participants, were fever, myalgia, extreme tiredness, and headaches, whereas vomiting, pruritus, nausea, retro-orbital pain, and arthralgia occurred in 35% to 50% of participants. In the 8 years after dengue, 61.5% of participants reported at least one recurrent previously nonexistent symptom, the most frequent being headaches, abundant hair loss, extreme tiredness, arthralgia, and myalgia, experienced by 25% to 35% of participants. Nearly 20% of the participants with persistent symptoms reported the onset of chronic illness in the 4 years after dengue, most frequently ophthalmological and autoimmune diseases (5.6% each), versus only 2.2% of chronic disease onset in participants without persistent symptoms. Our results suggest that the occurrence of persistent symptoms after primary dengue might be more frequent than anticipated and may persist for several years, having an impact on the health status and well-being of a considerable proportion of the infected population.

### Dengue-related deaths in puerto rico, 1992–1996: diagnosis and clinical alarm signals [^08c81335]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue, although endemic in Puerto Rico, is often not mentioned in the death certificates of decedents with laboratory results positive for dengue. Because confirmatory results are usually not available during hospitalization, we examined the utility of 2 instruments for diagnosis on the basis of clinical findings: the definition of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and the publicized (but unevaluated) clinical alarm signals for impending dengue shock.

Methods

We studied data from all patients with laboratory test results positive for dengue who died (23 patients) and from the 8 patients whose death certificates listed dengue as a cause of death but whose laboratory test results were negative for dengue in Puerto Rico from 1992 through 1996. We examined hospital records to determine whether the clinical criteria for DHF were fulfilled and evaluated the incidence and timing of clinical alarm signals (intense, sustained abdominal pain; persistent vomiting; sudden change from fever to hypothermia; and marked restlessness or lethargy) and the hematocrit/hemoglobin ratio as an indicator of hemoconcentration.

Results

A similar proportion of patients with laboratory test results positive for dengue (18 [78%] of 23) and negative for dengue (6 [75%] of 8) fulfilled the criteria for DHF. Clinical alarm signals were found only among patients with laboratory test results positive for dengue and were usually noted on the day that the patient's condition deteriorated. The hematocrit/hemoglobin ratio identified 1 (6%) of 16 patients with dengue who had significant hemoconcentration. Important comorbidities were present in 16 (70%) of the patients with laboratory test results positive for dengue and in 4 (50%) of the patients with dengue-related deaths with laboratory test results negative for dengue.

Conclusions

Dengue-related deaths in Puerto Rico often occur in patients with comorbidities. Among such patients, the DHF definition and the hematocrit/hemoglobin ratio were not useful in identifying patients with laboratory test results positive for dengue. In contrast, the clinical alarm signals for shock supported the dengue diagnosis and should alert clinicians to the severity of the disease.

### Zika virus disease comparing children and adults in a dengue-endemic setting [^d12bd814]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mosquito-borne viral diseases have rapidly spread globally in the recent years. Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections are mosquito-borne viral diseases that have become public health concerns worldwide because of their expanding geographic areas, the potential threat of severe clinical courses in DENV infections, as well as teratogenicity and spectrum of neuro-abnormalities in ZIKV infections.

Both DENV and ZIKV are flaviviruses transmitted mainly by Aedes mosquito species, especially Aedes aegypti, and both share some similar clinical features. The complexity of serological diagnosis due to cross-reactivity of the antibodies among flaviviruses is disadvantageous, and specific molecular testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is needed to confirm infection. Since 2015, ZIKV has attracted global concern because of a large epidemic in Latin America, associated with serious congenital neurological consequences and Guillain–Barre syndrome. It was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO on February 1, 2016and later was announced on November 18, 2016 to be incorporated into the longer term public response.

According to the WHO, DENV is endemic in more than 100 countries, of which countries in the WHO regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific are the most seriously affected. As of July 2, 2019, the WHO reported ZIKV in 148 countries, some of which are also the most DENV-affected countries.

Dengue virus infection manifests with a diverse range of symptoms from mildly undifferentiated fever to severe diseases, although it may be asymptomatic in 70–80% of cases. According to the WHO, the clinical manifestations can be classified as dengue fever (DF) and severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever), and suspected dengue is characterized by high fever accompanied by two of the following symptoms: headache, retrobulbar pain, nausea and vomiting, muscle and joint pain, and rash. Dengue fever has no apparent evidence of plasma leakage and is usually not a severe disease, whereas dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by vascular leakage and thrombocytopenia, which can lead to shock and bleeding.

### Primary dengue and long-term health status in madeira island, Portugal: a retrospective questionnaire-based study [^99420832]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the only study reporting long-term persistent symptoms is that of García et al.in which 56.7% of Cuban participants had at least one chronic symptom 2 years after dengue. Their findings are similar to ours, except for differences noted for persistent headaches, abundant hair loss (respectively, 2.4- and 3.3-fold less frequent than in our study), and retroorbital pain (1.5-fold more frequent than in our study). We should stress that the García et al. studywas undertaken in a dengue-endemic area, whereas ours refers to primary dengue. In this context, our results suggest that, even in naive populations, the occurrence of persistent symptoms may be more frequent than previously thought and such symptoms may prevail for several years. Nearly 20% of our participants have described persistent ophthalmological signs such as blurred vision and/or retroorbital pains in the years after dengue, four of which have developed ophthalmologic chronic disease. There is, in fact, an increasing body of evidence about dengue-associated eye disease, the onset of which has been described to occur immediately or a few months after the infection (reviewed in Ng and Teoh 2015).

Also noteworthy, our data are, to our knowledge, the first to investigate and suggest sex and age as good predictors of specific symptoms, either during the infection period or persistent symptoms. During the infection, pruritus, vomiting, nausea, extreme tiredness, palmar erythema, petechiae, and arm and leg swelling were significantly more frequent in females, and arm and leg swelling were more common in older participants. The effect of these variables in an active infection is likely due to hormonal and psychosomatic differences and/or the co-occurrence of age-related conditions. As for persistent symptoms, headaches, and abundant hair loss were more common in females, whereas headaches were more frequent in younger participants, and arthralgia and bone pain in older participants. Although there is no consensus about the physiopathological mechanisms underlying the persistence of symptoms, it has been suggested that the excessive cytokine production during the acute phasemay cause neuroendocrine, musculoskeletal, and immunological damage, which may affect males and females in different ways and lead to more durable consequences in older patients, given their lower regenerative capacity of affected tissues.

### Dengue virus dynamic and persistence in body fluids of infected patients in Italy, 2018–2023 [^19d5b9a6]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dengue is a mosquito‐borne viral disease caused by four distinct but closely related viral serotypes (DENV‐1, ‐2, ‐3, and ‐4) primarily circulating in the tropics and subtropics. The geographical distribution and the global burden of DENV have increased over the last few decades due to the expansion of the Aedes vectors and the more frequent importation of cases into nonendemic areas. Approximately half of the world's population is at risk of DENV infection, with 100–400 million infections occurring annually. In 2023 and 2024, an upsurge of DENV cases was globally observed. The most affected countries included Brazil, Argentina, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Burkina Faso. An unprecedented number of autochthonous cases was also reported in European countries such as Italy (83), France (77), and Spain (8). From January to July 2024, almost 5 million DENV cases have been confirmed in Brazil, marking a threefold increase compared to 2023.

DENV infection is symptomatic in about 40% of cases. Symptoms range from mild, self‐limiting acute febrile illness without warning signs, to severe illness, resulting in hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.

Due to its nonspecific manifestations and the high percentage of asymptomatic infections, DENV can be misdiagnosed, and cases may be underreported. Proper laboratory diagnostic algorithms and surveillance activities are essential for clinical management, as well as for monitoring and controlling the DENV burden. DENV differential diagnosis is broad, and laboratory confirmation is needed. The latter relies on viral RNA or NS1 antigen detection in blood samples or serological detection of DENV‐specific IgM and IgG in paired serum samples collected at least 1 week apart. Moreover, the use of lateral flow rapid tests detecting the viral NS1 protein and IgM and IgG may be particularly useful, as a user‐friendly first‐line test, to facilitate timely DENV diagnosis and treatment decisions and to inform surveillance entities.

### Elevated soluble HLA-G levels associate with dengue severity in Vietnamese patients [^5bfb49e8]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Dengue Severity Classification and Laboratory Assessment

In Vietnam, admitted patients were clinically classified into three severity levels according to WHO guidelines: dengue without warning signs (DF, n = 103), dengue with warning signs (DWS, n = 122) and severe dengue (SD, n = 13). In this classification, warning signs include the presence of abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, clinical fluid accumulation, lethargy/restlessness, liver enlargement and a rapid decrease in platelet count with rising haematocrit. Severe dengue is defined by severe plasma leakage leading to shock or respiratory distress, severe bleeding or severe organ impairment such as hepatitis, myocarditis or encephalopathy. Patients who required close monitoring and hospitalization included both those with DWS and SD, as recommended by the WHO. Accordingly, these groups were combined for the analysis of sHLA‐G levels to highlight clinically relevant differences and ensure statistical power. Clinical presentations were documented upon admission. Laboratory parameters assessed during admission include a complete hemogram: Erythrocyte (RBC), Haemoglobin (Hb), Haematocrit (HCT), Platelet (PLT), Leucocyte (WBC), Neutrophile (NEU), Lymphocyte (LYM), Monocyte (MONO), Eosinophile (EOS), Basophile (BASO), Large Unstained Cells (LUC), and liver enzymes: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

2.5 Measurement of sHLA‐G Plasma Levels

Plasma levels of sHLA‐G (sHLA‐G1 and sHLA‐G5) were quantified in 238 patients and 118 healthy controls using the sHLA‐G enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (BioVendor–Laboratorní medicína a.s. Brno, Czech Republic), a sandwich enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of sHLA‐G, according to the manufacturer's instructions, whose detection limit is 0.38 ng/mL. Absorbance was measured using an ELISA reader (Infinite 200 PRO‐TECAN, Maennedorf, Switzerland) at 450 nm with the reference wavelength set to 630 nm. sHLA‐G concentrations were determined from a five‐point standard curve prepared from serial dilutions of calibrator (7.81, 15.63, 31.25, 62.5, and 125 U/mL) purchased by the kit as standard reagent. Results were expressed as Units/millilitre (U/mL).

### A serological framework to investigate acute primary and post-primary dengue cases reporting across the Philippines [^72234e02]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Dengue surveillance in the Philippines

The Philippines, consisting of 7641 islands spanning more than 300,000 km 2, is one of the countries in the Western Pacific region most heavily burdened by dengue. According to the country's Department of Health (DOH), all four serotypes of dengue (DENV1–4) co-circulate in the country and reported cases increased from 213,930 to 220,518 between 2015 and 2016, respectively. In 2008, the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) system was established to synchronise and strengthen disease surveillance across the country resulting in dengue becoming notifiable across all Filipino disease-reporting units (DRUs), ranging from local barangay health facilities to major regional hospitals. According to the 2009 WHO criteria, the PIDSR categorises patients as having no warning signs, warning signs or severe dengue symptoms. Warning signs include a sudden acute illness coupled with either abdominal pain, vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, liver enlargement, increased haematocrit and/or decreased platelet counts. Severe symptoms include a sudden acute illness coupled with either severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding and/or severe organ impairment.

### Early clinical and biological features of severe clinical manifestations of dengue in Vietnamese adults [^e84ceb0e]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue is a major public health problem in both children and adults in Vietnam, but dengue severity in adults has been poorly investigated.

Objectives

To describe severe manifestations of dengue in Vietnamese adults and to identify early indicators of these manifestations.

Study Design

A prospective longitudinal study was carried out from July to October, 2007, in People's Hospital 115, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Results

One hundred ninety-five clinically suspected dengue patients were enrolled. 151 of these were laboratory-confirmed using serum samples on day 3 after onset of fever for RT-PCR and/or virus isolation. Dengue was associated with plasma leakage in 51 patients (33.8%), gallbladder thickening in 30 patients (20%), spontaneous bleeding in 127 patients (84.1%), and internal bleeding in 37 patients (24.5%). Several early indicators were associated with severe manifestations of dengue. Frequent vomiting (≥ 3 times a day), marked lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes on day 3 after onset of fever were significantly associated with plasma leakage and gallbladder thickening. Increased alanine aminotransferase level in plasma on day 3 was significantly associated with internal bleeding. Gallbladder thickening and internal bleeding were more common with specific serotypes.

Conclusion

Several severe manifestations of dengue were observed in Vietnamese adults. These manifestations were associated with early clinical and biological indicators. This information may be useful for clinicians to better monitor adult dengue patients, particularly in tropical areas where health resources may be limited.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^d873c2d2]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Dengue critical phase — timing and key clinical features are described. The critical phase begins at defervescence and typically lasts 24–48 hours, and severe dengue manifestations are most frequently seen during this phase. Substantial plasma leakage can cause ascites or pleural effusions, hemoconcentration, and hypoproteinemia. Compensatory mechanisms narrow pulse pressure as diastolic blood pressure increases, initially maintaining adequate circulation; once hypotension develops, systolic blood pressure rapidly declines and irreversible shock and death can ensue despite resuscitation. Prolonged shock can lead to severe hemorrhagic manifestations including hematemesis, melena, or menorrhagia, and uncommon manifestations include encephalitis, hepatitis, myocarditis, or pancreatitis. Laboratory findings commonly include leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, hyponatremia, and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

### Dengue as a growing global health concern [^9668b3a8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

According to(launched May, 2024), there have been approximately 13 million reported cases (almost 42,000 of them severe) and over 8700 dengue-related reported deaths worldwide since the beginning of 2024. All WHO regions are affected, with 90 countries having known active transmission. Most cases have been reported in tropical and subtropical areas where the virus is endemic: region of the Americas (12,026,698 cases and 7152 deaths), South-East Asia region (357,808 cases and 1379 deaths) and Western Pacific region (219,441 cases and 154 deaths). Dengue cases have also been reported in non-endemic areas, such as mainland. This recent surge has been preceded by an estimated 85.5% increase in incident cases of dengue worldwide between 1990 and, and a doubling in the number of global cases each year since. WHO assigned the highest level of emergency (grade 3) to the global increase in dengue cases and, in June 2024, theselected Orthoflavivirus denguei as a priority pathogen in all six WHO regions.

is a major vector-borne disease transmitted to humans via infected female mosquitoes. Most infected individuals show no or mild symptoms (eg, fever, muscle and joint pains, headache, and nausea), but severe disease can develop in rare cases, characterised by severe plasma leakage, bleeding, and organ impairment. A well-known risk factor for the development of severe dengue is previous infection with a heterologous dengue virus (DENV), but it is thought that multiple mechanisms and factors could also have a role in progression to severe. An estimated 4 million cases are estimated to require hospitalisation each year and the median case fatality rate of severe dengue is up to 5%, with severe hepatitis, dengue shock syndrome, altered mental status, diabetes, and a higher pulse rate identified as risk factors for mortality in infected.

### Dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 responsible for major dengue outbreaks in Nepal: clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological features [^cf450486]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Early hospital visit (shorter illness duration) by urban (versus rural) residents signals their increased awareness and access to hospitals compared with their rural counterparts who substantially delay hospital attendance. Most dengue patients (88%) were hospitalized although only 18% of them were severe. Lack of laboratory facilities in resource-limited areasand inefficient classification and management experience may have contributed to unnecessarily higher hospitalization rates in Nepal. As expected, severe dengue was more common in secondary infections compared with primary.

Characteristics of the illness varied slightly depending on the infecting serotype. Secondary infections were more commonly found in DENV-2 infections, which may have led to higher viremia in patients and more severe manifestation of the disease. Likewise, primary infections were more common among DENV-1 patients. In addition to clinical features previously described in DENV infections, we observed significantly higher frequency of vomiting, retro-orbital pain, hepatomegaly and elevated AST/ALT in the dengue population (versus nondengue), which are not commonly reported. Some of these clinical manifestations (rash, bleeding, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and elevated AST/ALT) were more common in severe DENV infections (versus DF). Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and elevated liver enzymes were found significantly associated with both dengue (versus nondengue) and severe dengue (versus DF). Similar patterns are also reported elsewhere. – These discriminatory features may be useful in patient management to allow careful monitoring for severe dengue development. Nonetheless, clinical decisions should not solely depend on these features alone. Clinical features have great value when organized into a prognostic algorithm for early prediction of dengue severity.

### Remote-controlled and pulse pressure-guided fluid treatment for adult patients with viral hemorrhagic fevers [^5514bfeb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Shock is thought to be a common final pathophysiological pathway to death in Ebola virus disease (EVD) and other high-threat viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) such as Marburg hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. Although there are limited data on the frequency, timing, and nature of shock, intravascular hypovolemia resulting from gastrointestinal losses and capillary leak are thought to be the important drivers of shock. Intravascular fluid resuscitation presents a clinical management challenge in VHFs due to the need to restore adequate intravascular volume while avoiding excessive organ edema, in particular pulmonary edema resulting in respiratory failure. This challenge is greatest in resource-limited settings where most of these infections are managed. In these settings limited staff, protective clothing, and appropriate intensive care facilities and equipment render the clinical monitoring and support of patients difficult.

The optimal fluid resuscitation strategy for EVD and other VHFs is currently unknown. However, the well-studied fluid management of shock in severe dengue may be used as a guide. Severe dengue is associated with a marked increase in capillary permeability, hemoconcentration, and bleeding. A resulting key clinical feature is a reduction in pulse pressure. Fluid resuscitation in severe dengue needs to balance the risk of volume overload with the risk of undertreating intravascular hypovolemia and shock. For this reason, fluid resuscitation strategies in severe dengue are more conservative than in sepsis and septic shock. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) mortality is less than 1% when fluid management strategies are restricted, but higher with more liberal fluid regimens. The limited data on hypovolemia and hemoconcentration in EVD are reminiscent of severe dengue, although there are several important differences between the two diseases. Dehydration from diarrhea and vomiting, electrolyte disturbances, and acute kidney injury are much more prominent in EVD patients, requiring, if available, plasma electrolyte assessments and correction. However, capillary leakage, the pivotal pathophysiological feature of severe dengue, is also a major feature of EVD and other VHFs.

### Dengue NS1 antibodies are associated with clearance of viral nonstructural protein-1 [^a7ce5a6a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Inclusion Criteria

Men, women, and children 8 years of age and older with a clinical diagnosis of dengue, including fever > 38°C at enrollment and a laboratory-confirmed NS1 antigen test, were recruited from Northern Colombia from 2018 to 2020.

Ethics Statement

All participants provided written informed consent and children received written assent in addition to the consent of their parent or guardian. The study samples were collected under approval from the Universidad El Bosque Institutional Ethics Review Board (UB 387–2015) under the protocol "Surveillance of sentinel infectious events prevalent in Colombia" and the Clínica Fundación with a nonhuman subjects' determination from the George Washington University Institutional Review Board.

Outcome Measures

Dengue signs and symptoms were reviewed, and blood collection was performed daily until 5 days after defervescence or until the patient was discharged, whichever came first. Clinical signs and symptoms collected daily included fever, headache, retroorbital pain, arthralgias, myalgias, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence, hypotension, hepatomegaly, mucosal hemorrhage, hypothermia, hemoconcentration, platelets < 100 000/µL, shock, organ failure, hemorrhage with hemodynamic compromise and ascites, and pleural effusion or pericardial effusions documented by ultrasound. Individuals were stratified as dengue with alarm signs, without alarm signs, and severe dengue as per the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria.

Clinical Phase Definitions

The febrile phase refers to the period during which the patient was febrile (excluding the defervescence day). The critical phase includes the last day of fever (defervescence day, day 0) and the first day without fever (day 1 postdefervescence) and is named the "critical phase" as dengue patients are most likely to experience shock and risk of death during this time period. Finally, the recovery phase in this study is defined as starting on day 2 postdefervescence until the patient was discharged.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations and prognostic factors for severe dengue in Thai children [^99840331]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Dengue infection poses a significant public health challenge in tropical countries. In Thailand, children ages 5–14 years are among the groups with the highest incidence of dengue. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in children with dengue infection and assess prognostic factors for severe dengue. We reviewed the medical records of children ages 0–14 years who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of dengue infection between 2019 and 2022 at Charoenkrung Pracharak Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Dengue severity was classified according to the 2009 WHO dengue guidelines. Clinical manifestations and laboratory data were analyzed for their association with severe dengue using a logistic regression model. The study included 556 dengue cases, with 48 cases (8.6%) classified as severe dengue. The mean age (SD) of patients was 9.9 (3.7) years. The most common GI symptoms were anorexia (91.7%) and vomiting (57.6%) followed by abdominal pain (38.3%), and diarrhea (33.3%). GI bleeding was found in 3.2% of patients. Hepatomegaly and ascites were found in 20.9% and 2.9% of patients, respectively. Acute liver failure and acalculous cholecystitis were found in 0.4% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Children younger than 5 years of age exhibited a lower prevalence of vomiting and abdominal pain compared with older children, making the diagnosis of dengue more challenging. Vomiting, ascites, aspartate aminotransferase > 450 U/L, and serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL were significantly associated with severe dengue infection. Children with dengue infection presenting any of these factors should be closely monitored for severe dengue.

### Burden of postinfectious symptoms after acute dengue, Vietnam [^43c36eaf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Dengue is a mosquitoborne viral infection found across much of the tropical and subtropical world. Most infections are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic. Acute symptoms range from an influenza-like self-limited febrile illness to, in a small proportion of cases, severe and complicated disease that can prove fatal. In total, 4 dengue viral serotypes (DENV-1–4) exist; severe disease rarely occurs during the first exposure to any serotype (i.e. a primary infection) but is more likely to occur during a subsequent infection with a different serotype (i.e. a secondary infection).

The symptoms of acute dengue are generally understood to resolve after 1–2 weeks, but the potential for persistent or delayed symptoms has received increasing attention in recent years. However, few formal studies have been published, and these studies have reported a range of symptoms and frequencies. A recent review summarizing this literature showed a substantial proportion of persons experienced some kind of postacute symptoms; the proportion decreased over time after infection, and 24% reported notable fatigue.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors of dengue shock syndrome in children [^9990b0e5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) represents one of the most severe manifestations of dengue virus infection. The objective of the present study was to analyze the clinical and laboratory characteristics, risk factors and outcome of DSS in children.

Methods

Patients < 15 years old admitted with DSS during the 2012 and 2013 outbreak of serotype 2 of dengue virus in Paraguay were included. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data of patients with/without DSS were analyzed.

Results

Of 471 children hospitalized with dengue, 354 patients (75%) presented with shock at admission or developed later. The mean age of patients with DSS was 10.2 ± 4 years (no difference with patients without shock), without gender preference. Rash (50% vs. 56%), myalgias (45% vs. 40%), vomiting (66% vs. 68%) and bleeding manifestations (24% vs. 21.2%) were similar for 2 groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the frequency of DSS between primary versus secondary infection cases (76.2% vs. 71.6%, P = 0.3). Age group > 5 years [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1–2.8, P < 0.05), presence of abdominal pain (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.3–4.9, P = 0.006), an activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (OR 4; 95% CI: 1.6–10, P < 0.001) and low fibrinogen level (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1–5.9, P = 0.02) were found significantly associated with DSS. About 12% of patients required intensive care unit admission, and 2 patients died (lethality 0.35%).

Conclusions

This study validated most of the clinical variables present in the current WHO guidelines as markers of severe disease and add additional variables that can help to predict the risk of progression to shock.

### Clinical spectrum and predictors of severity of dengue among children in 2019 outbreak: a multicenter hospital-based study in Bangladesh [^3f151e4c]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Determinants of severity among children

Factors which differed among children in relation to age, sex and severity were included in a predictive model to determine their predictive values for severe dengue among children (Table 4). These included child's age, sex, certain clinical features (backache, retroorbital pain, oral ulcer, rash, arthralgia, vomiting, abdominal pain, loose motion, and constipation) and investigation (decreased platelet < 150,000/mm³ with increased hematocrit > 20% and leucopenia). Severity defining features like hemorrhage and signs of plasma leakage and shock were excluded from the model to avoid incorporation bias. Several atypical features were excluded due to their low count. Abdominal pain was kept in the model despite showing non-significant variation across groups as severe abdominal pain is a warning sign. In the final model age, oral ulcer and decreased platelet with increased hematocrit count was found to be a significant predictor of severity among children. One-year increase in age was associated with 14% reduction in risk of severity (OR 0.86, 95%CI 0.75–0.98, p = 0.023). Presence of mouth sores was associated with significantly higher odds of developing severe disease (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.06–6.96, p = 0.038). A decreased platelet count with increased hematocrit was associated with 4.94 times higher odds (95%CI 1.48–17.31, p = 0.01) of developing severe dengue.

### Persistent symptoms of dengue: estimates of the incremental disease and economic burden in Mexico [^aa6b9463]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Dengue incidence and its geographical range have expanded substantially in the past decades; it has become a major public health challenge to most tropical and subtropical countries worldwide. Recent estimates suggest there are approximately 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections annually, resulting in about 50–100 million symptomatic dengue episodes and 10,000 deaths.–Several studies have examined the duration of symptomatic DENV infections. They typically last from 2 to 7 days, but may span a wide clinical spectrum. A symptomatic episode usually comprises a febrile phase (with fever of at least 38.5°C), a critical phase around defervescence (which may include hemorrhagic manifestations and/or dengue shock syndrome), and a recovery or convalescent phase. However, some dengue patients present persistent symptoms including fatigue, depression, and weight loss after the recovery phase, a possibility acknowledged by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1997.

A Malaysian studyfound that the adverse effects of symptomatic DENV infection on patients' quality of life (QoL) extend well beyond the febrile phase, although by day 14 of illness most patients in the sample had returned to a QoL of at least 90%. Fatigue, which results in decreased capacity to work, is common during the acute stage of dengue and may persist for several weeks after recovery. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on the acute manifestation of dengue illness. If persistent symptoms affect a non-negligible share of the population, previous studies have likely underestimated the burden of dengue.

As accurate estimates of disease and economic burden are critical to inform policy decisions and to assess technologies for dengue control and prevention, several authors have called for a broader evaluation of dengue burden. On the basis of a systematic literature review, we updated estimates of the economic burden of dengue in Mexico, addressing uncertainty in productivity loss due to persistent symptoms and in incremental expenses using Monte Carlo simulations.

### Guidelines for classifying dengue… [^bb59901e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance The World Health Organization classifies symptomatic dengue cases as dengue or severe dengue to facilitate dengue clinical management. WHO 2009 Dengue Classification Dengue is defined by a combination of ≥ 2 clinical findings in a febrile person who lives in or traveled to a dengue-endemic area. Clinical findings include nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pains, a positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, or any warning sign. Dengue warning signs include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, and liver enlargement. Patients with warning signs should be monitored closely as they can be more likely to progress to severe disease.

Severe dengue is defined by dengue with any of the following clinical manifestations: severe plasma leakage leading to shock or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress; severe bleeding; or severe organ impairment such as hepatitis, impaired consciousness, or heart impairment.

### Severe dengue: the need for new case definitions [^b5c01832]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dengue fever imposes a societal burden that is difficult to measure because of the disease's non-specific symptoms and the lack of easily applied case definitions for its more severe manifestations. An efficacy trial of a tetravalent vaccine is expected in the near future, but only one of the severe dengue syndromes-the continuum of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome-is well defined. One of the results of the focus on dengue haemorrhagic fever is the false perception of low disease burden in the Americas, which is an obstacle to the mobilisation of political and economic resources to fight the disease. Three improvements are necessary to standardise the dengue haemorrhagic fever definition and to allow it to do well in different populations: (1) redefine the threshold for thrombocytopenia, (2) clarify the standard practice and value of the tourniquet test, and (3) incorporate a criterion to measure intravenous fluid replacement. In addition, for an accurate estimation of dengue burden, locally appropriate definitions of severe dengue must be devised and standardised so they will be considered valid in the global research community.

Sera were tested from 103 patients, of whom 98 had paired sera. Forty-four patients (43%) tested positive for dengue by RT-PCR (40 patients) or ELISA (four). Five patients (5%) met the leptospirosis case definition; one patient seroconverted to a convalescent titer of 200, and four patients had titers ≥ 800 that did not change between acute and convalescent specimens, suggesting recent exposure (< 6 months) but not acute infection. In addition, two of these four patients tested positive for DENV-3 by RT-PCR. An additional 11 patients (11%) had at least one titer ≥ 200 but < 800 and lacked a ≥ fourfold increase. Among 91 patients with LRDT and MAT results, 33 (36%) were LRDT-positive, including the five with confirmed cases (Table). The LRDT had a low positive predictive value of 15% (95% CI = 7%–31%) compared with MAT confirmation.

Clinical presentation of dengue — disease spectrum, classification, and triage: An estimated 40%–80% of dengue virus (DENV) infections are asymptomatic, while symptomatic illness most commonly presents as a mild to moderate, nonspecific, acute febrile illness; ≤ 5% of all people experiencing symptoms from dengue develop severe, life-threatening disease. Recognizing early signs of shock and promptly initiating intensive supportive therapy can reduce risk for death among patients with severe dengue by ≥ 20-fold, and World Health Organization clinical classification categories include dengue without warning signs, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue. Patients with dengue with warning signs or severe dengue require strict observation and inpatient management.

### Liver involvement in dengue: a systematic review [^7d0cc89e]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver involvement is an unusual yet frequently overlooked dengue complication. Pivotal for an efficient clinical management, the early diagnosis of dengue-associated liver involvement relies on an accurate description of its clinical and biological characteristics, its prognosis factors, its association with severe dengue and its clinical management. We conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed and Web of Science databases for original case reports, cohort and cross-sectional studies reporting the clinical and/or biological features of dengue-associated liver involvement. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021262657). Of the 2552 articles identified, 167 were included. Dengue-associated liver involvement was characterised by clinical features including abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, jaundice, nausea/vomiting, and an echogenic liver exhibiting hepatocellular necrosis and minimal inflammation. Elevated Aspartate Aminotransferase and Alanine Aminotransferase but also elevated bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, increased International Normalised Ratio, creatinine and creatine kinase, lower albumin and prolonged prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time were prevalent in dengue-associated liver involvement. Cardiovascular and haematological systems were frequently affected, translating in a strong association with severe dengue. Liver involvement was more common in males and older adults. It was associated with dengue virus serotype-2 and secondary infections. Early paracetamol intake increased the risk of liver involvement, which clinical management was mostly conservative. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrates that early monitoring of transaminases, clinical assessment, and ultrasound examination allow an efficient diagnosis of dengue-associated liver involvement, enabling the early identification and management of severe dengue.

Clinical presentation of Oropouche virus — symptoms, course, and pregnancy considerations: The incubation period after exposure is typically 3–7 days, and symptoms are similar to dengue, Zika, and chikungunya with abrupt fever, headache, chills, myalgias, and arthralgias; other symptoms may include photophobia, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and a maculopapular rash starting on the trunk and spreading to the extremities; severe symptoms, primarily neurological (including meningitis and meningoencephalitis), may also be present in a small percentage of patients; symptoms usually last 2–7 days but may recur days or weeks later in up to 70% of patients, and infected individuals may also be asymptomatic; Oropouche is typically not fatal, though two deaths among over 8,000 cases have been recently reported, and at least three cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome were identified during the current outbreak in Cuba; currently, manifestations appear similar in pregnant and nonpregnant people, and it is not known whether pregnant individuals manifest more severe disease.

### Rare case of dengue encephalitis with extensive brain lesions from Pakistan [^6a604657]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Dengue infection is common in 129 countries including Pakistan, with an estimated 390million dengue virus infections per year. Asia accounts for 70% of the actual burden. Clinical signs and symptoms of dengue include a high fever (40°C/104°F) accompanied by two of the following symptoms during the febrile phase: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands and rash. Severe dengue is a potentially fatal complication, due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding or organ impairment. Dengue virus does not usually cause neurological manifestations, unlike other arboviral infections. Encephalopathy is the most common neurological complication. Encephalitis is rare manifestation. We report a rare case of dengue encephalitis from Pakistan, with extensive brain lesions involving the thalamus, cerebellar vermis and frontoparietal periventricular regions. Therefore, we suggest dengue encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever with altered sensorium, especially in Asian countries such as Pakistan where dengue is rampant as dengue encephalitis can be fatal at times.

### Dengue fever with encephalitis: a rare phenomenon [^32afc5c5]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The clinical profile and presentation of patients with dengue fever may differ from asymptomatic infection to the dreadful complications like dengue shock syndrome. However, neurological complications are very rare. Dengue encephalitis occurs by a direct involvement of central nervous system by the dengue virus which is an extremely rare complication. A 33-year-old man presented with fever, vomiting and severe headache. He had one episode of generalised tonic-clonic seizure followed by an altered sensorium on the day of admission to the hospital. The diagnosis of dengue fever was confirmed by dengue serology (IgM) and (NS1) antigen assay. MRI brain was suggestive of encephalitis. Thus, the patient was treated symptomatically and discharged in stable condition with minimal neurological deficit.

### Age-dependent manifestations and case definitions of paediatric zika: a prospective cohort study [^bd6c4c4b]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Paedeatric Zika remains an understudied topic. WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Zika case definitions have not been assessed in children. We aimed to characterise clinical profiles and evaluate the diagnostic performance of the WHO and PAHO case definitions in a large cohort of paediatric Zika cases.

Methods

From January, 2016 to February, 2017, encompassing the major 2016 Zika epidemic, participants in the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS) in Managua, Nicaragua, were encouraged to visit the study health centre at first indication of any illness. PDCS participants were aged 2–14 years, healthy at enrolment, and recruited before the initiation of the present study. Molecular and serological assays were used to test participants exhibiting any of four broad clinical profiles suspected of resulting from a symptomatic Zika virus infection. These clinical profiles were: fever and at least two of headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, and leukopenia; fever and at least two of nausea or vomiting, rash, aches and pains, positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, and any dengue warning sign; undifferentiated fever without evident cause, with or without any other clinical finding; and afebrile rash with or without any other clinical finding. We characterised acute clinical findings (signs, symptoms, and complete blood counts) in both Zika cases and non-Zika cases.

Findings

We prospectively followed a cohort of about 3700 children, of which 1110 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Four participants with laboratory-confirmed Zika (three co-infections with dengue virus, one missing complete blood count data) and two participants who were non-Zika cases (missing complete blood count data) were excluded from analysis. We analysed 556 laboratory-confirmed Zika and 548 non-Zika cases. The WHO case definition captured 176 confirmed Zika cases, and the PAHO definition 109 confirmed Zika cases, who presented with the most clinical findings and a dengue-like clinical profile. The remaining two thirds of Zika cases, principally characterised by undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash, were missed. Among Zika cases, rash (n = 440)-particularly generalised erythematous rash (n = 334)-fever (n = 333), leukopenia (n = 217), and headache (n = 203) were most common and peaked within 3 days of illness onset. The most common Zika presentation over the first week of illness was rash only (n = 80). The sensitivity of Zika case definitions increased across paediatric age (from 11.3% to 56.1% for the WHO case definition and from 6.0% to 36.6% for the PAHO case definition), as the prevalence of most clinical findings (particularly arthralgia) increased with age, irrespective of previous dengue virus infection. Consequently, Zika manifested differently across paediatric age; older Zika cases presented with a dengue-like clinical profile while younger Zika cases presented with undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash.

Interpretation

We provide the most thorough description of paediatric Zika to date. Most paediatric Zika cases go undetected under the WHO and PAHO case definitions, suggesting that current standards for Zika case ascertainment require revision. Zika manifests with mild but differing clinical profiles across paediatric age, presenting major challenges to diagnosis, surveillance, and efforts to control future Zika epidemics.

### Risk predictors of progression to severe disease during the febrile phase of dengue: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^61c8b7aa]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Dengue poses a large burden on public health systems worldwide. In the estimated burden of dengue in 2010, 70% of the global incidence of dengue infection occurred in south and southeast Asia, followed by Latin America and the western Pacific region. In 2009 to 2013, dengue epidemics were reported in some parts of subtropical regions, such as in Europe, the USA, and China. The global incidence has been estimated at 390 million infected individuals each year. Of those, an estimated 96 million individuals have symptomatic infections and 10 000–20 000 individuals die from dengue annually. Although the majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic or experience a benign febrile illness, a minority develop a life-threatening syndrome, known as severe dengue or dengue haemorrhagic fever. The progression to severe disease commonly occurs after the febrile phase, between days 4 and 6 of illness. Early detection of disease progression during the febrile phase, therefore, has a major role in improving case management and reducing the health-care burden of dengue.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched MEDLINE and PROSPERO for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and reviews up to Jan 31, 2018. The search terms were "dengue", and one of: "dengue haemorrhage fever", "severe dengue", or "severity". Only reports written in English were included. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of predictors for progression to severe disease have considered the whole time course of illness and have not differentiated the febrile phase (typically days 1–4 of illness) from the later clinical phases when severe manifestations occur. Because of variation in clinical parameters during the time course of the illness, these previous studies might have missed significant associations between early prognostic factors and progression to severe disease. In addition, not all the warning signs in the 2009 WHO dengue guideline are likely to be of use in the early prediction of severe dengue, because factors such as clinical fluid accumulation or increasing haematocrit occur late relative to the critical phases. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with progression to severe dengue disease that are detectable specifically in the febrile phase.

### Dengue outbreak – federated States of micronesia, 2012–2013 [^bd3351cd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Dengue is caused by four closely related but distinct flaviviruses, DENV serotypes 1–4, which are transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes. Dengue signs and symptoms include fever, aches and pains, nausea, rash, and mild bleeding. A small proportion of patients experience severe dengue, characterized by plasma leakage resulting in shock, respiratory distress secondary to ascites or pleural effusions, major hemorrhage, or serious organ impairment. Although there is no specific treatment for dengue, close monitoring of intravascular volume and prompt intravenous administration of isotonic crystalloids and/or colloids can be life-saving.

This report describes a DENV-4 outbreak in Kosrae State, FSM, in which > 10% of the population received a diagnosis of suspected dengue and nearly 4% were hospitalized. Although slightly less than 30% of suspected dengue cases tested positive with a dengue RDT, this does not represent the true DENV infection rate, because the sensitivities of dengue RDTs are lower than diagnostic testing performed with immunoassays. In a previous DENV-4 outbreak in the Pacific, the sensitivity of the RDT used during this outbreak when compared with a combination of RT-PCR and anti-DENV IgM capture ELISA was found to be 66% (Dengue Branch, CDC, unpublished data, 2011).

### Predicting outcome from dengue [^7155dd1d]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dengue is the most important arboviral infection affecting humans, and presents a major challenge for public health services worldwide. Infection can be caused by any of four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to 4), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Over half the world's population is thought to live in areas at risk for transmission, and recent estimates suggest that around 400 million infections occur annually, of which 100 million are clinically apparent. The clinical phenotype varies from a mild self-limiting febrile illness through to severe and occasionally life-threatening disease. Symptomatic disease typically follows three phases: an initial febrile phase lasting 3 to 7 days; a critical phase around defervescence, during which complications appear in a small proportion of patients; and a spontaneous recovery phase. Complications primarily affect the vascular system, and include an unusual plasma leakage syndrome that may result in hypovolaemic shock – the potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome (DSS); a coagulopathy sometimes accompanied by bleeding; and organ impairment. Because these severe manifestations occur relatively late in the disease course, often when the infecting virus is no longer detectable in plasma, immune-mediated mechanisms are postulated to play a significant role in pathogenesis. Currently no vaccine is available, and neither antiviral drugs nor immunomodulatory agents have been shown to be effective in reducing morbidity or improving disease outcome. However, with good supportive care (primarily judicious use of parenteral fluid therapy to offset plasma volume losses due to leakage), mortality rates of less than 1% are possible even among DSS cases.

Although the vast majority of symptomatic infections do not progress to severe disease, areas of high dengue transmission can have seasonal epidemics, which can quickly overwhelm health service capacity. Thus, the ability to identify patients at high risk of progression, who are likely to benefit from close observation and early intervention with supportive therapy, has become the focus of intense research efforts in recent years. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised the classification system for dengue, defining two major entities – dengue and severe dengue – to replace the more complicated dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) system used previously. The new classification also encompasses a set of 'warning signs' intended to help clinicians identify patients likely to develop complications during the critical phase of the illness (Figure 1). These signs and symptoms were derived in part from a dataset describing almost 2,000 patients with dengue across Asia and Latin America, but owing to the small number of patients progressing to severe disease during the study, further work is needed to validate the findings.

Chikungunya — clinical features and course in travelers are described as follows: The incubation period is typically 3–7 days (range 1–12 days), with sudden onset of high fever (temperature typically 39° C [102° F]) and joint pains; fevers typically last for 1 week and can be biphasic. Joint symptoms are typically severe, debilitating, and usually bilateral and symmetric, most commonly affecting hands and feet but possibly more proximal joints. Other findings include conjunctivitis, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and a morbilliform rash that often pruritic and involves trunk and extremities and can include palms, soles, and face. Abnormal laboratory findings can include elevated creatinine and liver function tests, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia; rare but serious complications include hepatitis, myocarditis, neurologic disease, ocular disease, acute renal disease, and severe bullous skin lesions. Acute symptoms typically resolve in 7–10 days, but some patients have continuation or relapse of rheumatologic symptoms for months after acute illness, and studies report variable proportions, ranging from 5% to 80%, with persistent joint pains and prolonged fatigue for months or years. Deaths occur but are rare and are reported most commonly in older adults with comorbidities and young infants infected perinatally or by mosquito bites. In pregnancy, symptoms and outcomes are similar to others and most infections during pregnancy will not result in transmission to the fetus; however, intrapartum transmission can result in neonatal complications including hemorrhagic symptoms, myocardial disease, and neurologic disease, and rare spontaneous abortions after first-trimester maternal infection have been reported.

Dengue is an arbovirus transmitted by the Aedes spp. mosquito. Approximately 390 million infections occur annually per World Health Organization estimates, with significant increases in infections throughout the last decade. The disease is endemic in warmer climates throughout the world, though cases may also be imported to non-endemic regions by returning travelers. Patients experience a wide variety of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe disease requiring critical care. Emergency clinicians should consider the diagnosis of dengue in patients from endemic areas presenting with a flu-like illness, rash, and evidence of bleeding.

### Clinical spectrum and predictors of severity of dengue among children in 2019 outbreak: a multicenter hospital-based study in Bangladesh [^6077e197]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In 2019 outbreak, dengue among children was characterized by increased severity among preschoolers with a male predominance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common presentation alongside fever. Epistaxis and melena were the main bleeding manifestations. Atypical manifestations were mostly suggestive of neurologic involvement. Decreasing age, presence of mouth sores and a decreased platelet with increased hematocrit were significant predictors of severity. Our findings would contribute to the clinical management and enrich knowledge in dengue research arena. Further randomized case-control and prospective studies with large samples are recommended to characterize particularities of pediatric dengue along with its classification, and complications.

### An unusual cause of acute abdominal pain in dengue fever [^e565446b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Dengue fever is an acute febrile viral disease caused by the bite of Aedes aegypti mosquito. It is a major health problem especially in tropical and subtropical areas including South East Asia and Pakistan. In the past few years, dengue fever has been endemic in Northern Punjab. Physicians managing dengue fever come across varied and uncommon complications of dengue fever. We report a case of dengue fever that developed severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain and induration after extreme retching and vomiting for 2 days. A rectus sheath hematoma was confirmed on noncontrast computed tomography (CT). Rectus sheath hematoma as a complication of dengue fever has rarely been reported before and never from this part of the world. Rectus sheath hematoma is an uncommon and often clinically misdiagnosed cause of abdominal pain. It is the result of bleeding into the rectus sheath from damage to the superior or inferior epigastric artery or their branches or from a direct tear of the rectus muscle. It can mimic almost any abdominal condition (See Fig.) (See Table).

### Dengue [^d076d983]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because efforts to control dengue are flagging, this review focuses on the mechanisms underlying severe disease and on treatment options, good and bad.

Recent Findings

The year 2001 witnessed unprecedented global dengue epidemic activity in the American hemisphere, the Pacific islands and continental Asia. Early diagnosis of dengue is important but what is the value and appropriate use of the tourniquet test? A negative test does not rule out dengue infection, a positive test should be followed by close surveillance for early signs of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Low platelet counts do not predict clinically significant bleeding in dengue. It follows that platelet or blood transfusions should not be administered based upon platelet count alone. Dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome cases frequently have compensated consumptive coagulopathy that seldom requires treatment. Bleeding is most likely caused by activated platelets resulting from damaged capillary endothelium. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome can be safely treated with just normal saline. Colloids should be immediately given to children presenting with a pulse pressure at or below 10 mmHg. Human leukocyte antigen alleles correlate with both protection and susceptibility to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome; studies in Haiti suggest that blacks have a gene providing nearly complete protection against severe dengue illness.

Summary

The role that antibodies play in protecting and enhancing dengue infections has been largely ignored. Such studies require definitive knowledge of what cells are infected in human dengue and an understanding of all the early antibody-accessible steps of infection of these target cells.

### The value of warning signs from the WHO 2009 dengue classification in detecting severe dengue in children [^62c14d9b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical awareness and assessment of the WSs as proposed in the WHO-2009 guidelinesis crucial to monitor the critical phase in dengue-infected patients. When specific warning signs with a high NPV are absent, this can be used to guide clinical decision-making on watchful waiting versus referral, as the post-test probability of severe dengue is substantially reduced in these subjects. While the specificity of the WS can also be a helpful measure, its impact on post-test probability may be low if the particular WS is uncommon in both diseased and undiseased (ie, the absence of the WS does not rule out disease). The NPV is, therefore, the most useful test characteristic to use in this context of clinical decision-making.

In infants WSs based on clinical assessment such as mucosal bleeding and lethargy each have an NPV of 63.2%, whereas when we combine 2 WSs of lethargy and liver enlargement, the NPV increases to 76.5%. WSs based on laboratory results of increased hematocrit and decreased platelet count, and those based on radiology examination to detect clinical fluid accumulation, have high NPVs, but these WSs can only be detected in healthcare facilities equipped with laboratory or radiology facilities. While new diagnostic tools such as NS1 serotype-specific IgG measured by ELISA or PCR-based techniques with rapid results to detect dengue virus are being developed to assist the assessment of disease severity, medical management still heavily relies on clinical judgment as the time from onset of WSs to severe illness in most dengue cases is typically less than 1 day and patients may progress toward hypovolemic shock and even death if adequate fluid therapy is not administered immediately. In addition, access to more advanced diagnostic testing and imaging may be limited in many primary healthcare settings, further stressing the importance of the clinical WSs in early patient assessment to reduce morbidity and mortality in children.

The fact that the dengue cases in this study were from a tertiary hospital is a potential limitation as circumstances and prevalence in primary or secondary healthcare settings may differ, with consequences for the applicability of our conclusions. The strength of this study was that the patients were obtained from a 10-year period with complete datasets of clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiology findings monitored daily until discharge and focus on pediatrics with age stratification.

### Dengue viral infection in children: a perspective [^4d9f03cc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Dengue is a vector-borne viral infection of global importance. Several pathogenetic mechanisms such as immune enhancement and selection pressure have been proposed and febrile, critical and recovery phases have been identified. A new classification proposed by WHO has recently been introduced where definitions have been changed to 'probable dengue', 'dengue with warning signs' and 'severe dengue'. The majority of dengue viral infections are self-limiting, but complications have high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of dengue viral infection is essentially clinical, although confirmation requires laboratory tests including serology, NS1 antigen detection, PCR and viral cultures. There are no specific anti-dengue drugs and treatment is basically supportive and consists of early recognition of complications and appropriate fluid therapy. A number of candidate vaccines are under development.

Discussion

Symptoms reported most frequently by study participants were consistent with classical descriptions of dengue illness, other cohort studies, and WHO guidelines, as well as the key symptoms reported by participants in our focus groups, although a large fraction of participants reported less typical gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms. Participants enrolled as contact case-participants reported fewer symptoms, similar to the findings in cluster investigations performed in Thailand. Some of these persons might otherwise not have sought medical attention. Only 1 (contact case-participant) person reported no symptoms. This finding conflicts with evidence suggesting that only 12%–25% of DENV infections are apparent. However, it is likely that administering the IPR survey encouraged reporting of symptoms that would not have been recalled in the context of a retrospective questionnaire, possibly explaining the relatively high symptomatic to asymptomatic ratio in our sample. We only collected data for persons who had a positive RT-PCR result (persons with only immunologic evidence of seroconversion to DENV were not included). This limitation has been associated with a higher frequency of symptoms.

Although most persons had mild dengue illness, our data demonstrate a range of intensity levels for individual symptoms. The IPR survey also enabled us to identify symptom groups within which daily intensities were highly correlated (r > 0.70): constitutional (malaise and weakness), fever (fever and chills), headache (headache and retroorbital pain), and musculoskeletal pain (body, muscle, bone, and joint pain).

Abdominal pain was reported by 59% of participants, but only 13% reported severe abdominal pain (intensity > 6). Abdominal pain followed a somewhat different time course from and showed substantially lower correlation with the symptom groups listed above. This finding is consistent with a distinct physiologic mechanism for abdominal pain. It also supports guidelines classifying severe abdominal pain as a warning sign, although few of our participants had evidence of plasma leakage or severe bleeding.

### Influence of the dengue serotype, previous dengue infection, and plasma viral load on clinical presentation and outcome during a dengue-2 and dengue-4 co-epidemic [^4649dd62]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2008). Low credibility.

Martinique experienced a dengue outbreak with co-circulation of DENV-2 and DENV-4. In an emergency department-based study, we analyzed whether the clinical presentation and outcome of adult patients were related to serotype, immune status, or plasma viral load. Of the 146 adult patients who had confirmed dengue infection, 91 (62.3%) were classified as having classic dengue fever, 11 (7.5%) fulfilled World Health Organization criteria for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), 21 other patients (14.4%) presented with at least one typical feature of DHF/DSS [i.e., internal hemorrhage, plasma leakage, marked thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤ 50,000 platelets/mm³) and/or shock], and 23 further patients (15.8%) had unusual manifestations. Four patients died. Severe illness was more frequent in patients with secondary dengue infection (odds ratio, 7.18; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–16.7; P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that gastrointestinal symptoms and other unusual manifestations were independently associated with DENV-2 infection, whereas cough and DHF/DSS features were independently associated with secondary immune response. A high plasma viral load was associated with DENV-2 infection, increased serum liver enzymes, and with DHF/DSS features in patients presenting after the third day of illness. The most severe cases of dengue resulted from the combined effects of DENV-2 and secondary infection.
