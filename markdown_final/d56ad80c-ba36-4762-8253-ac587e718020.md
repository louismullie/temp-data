## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a patient with persistent bloating regardless of meal size, postprandial pain and heaviness with occasional cramping, intermittent heartburn after heavier meals, infrequent bowel movements with intermittent straining, and a remote single episode of blood in the stool. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about alarm features and when to scope. Then, I should map the symptoms to Rome IV subtypes of functional dyspepsia and consider overlap conditions such as GERD, IBS, and gastroparesis. Next, I'll outline the initial noninvasive work‑up, followed by empiric lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy tailored to the predominant symptoms. After that, I need to set timing for re‑evaluation and define indications for endoscopy, gastric emptying testing, and esophageal pH‑impedance. Finally, I should address psychosocial and dietary factors and summarize the overall algorithm with checkpoints and decision nodes.

> Let me first confirm the presence or absence of alarm features and age‑related risk, because that determines how low my threshold should be for early endoscopy. Hold on, I should verify the classic red flags: weight loss, GI bleeding, anemia, progressive dysphagia/odynophagia, persistent vomiting, family history of upper GI cancer, and age ≥ 60, noting there was only a remote single episode of blood in the stool two years ago and no current bleeding or anemia reported. In the absence of active alarm features, an initial noninvasive strategy is appropriate, though I need to keep in mind that some guidelines still use age thresholds and red flags to triage for endoscopy when risk is higher or symptoms persist despite empiric therapy [^114UTqsE] [^111AwcgC].

> Next, I should review the symptom pattern against Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia and subtype it, but wait, let me verify that heartburn alone does not define dyspepsia. The story of postprandial fullness and early satiation "no matter how big the meal" aligns with postprandial distress syndrome, while epigastric pain after eating is compatible with epigastric pain syndrome; bloating can coexist but should not be predominant, and heartburn can overlap without excluding FD. I should confirm that symptoms have been bothersome for at least several weeks and that there's no structural disease identified yet, recognizing that symptoms alone cannot reliably discriminate functional from organic causes, which is why a pragmatic, positive diagnostic approach with limited initial testing is endorsed in routine practice [^114UTqsE] [^116xfwW3] [^113qea4V].

> I will now examine overlap disorders, because misattributing symptoms can derail management. GERD frequently coexists with FD and can explain intermittent heartburn, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, as GERD overlap occurs in roughly one‑third of FD patients and does not negate an FD framework. IBS is less likely primary here since pain relief with defecation is not described, though some overlap is common in disorders of gut–brain interaction, and I should double‑check stool form and pain–bowel habit linkage over time. Gastroparesis remains in the differential when fullness and bloating are prominent after small meals, yet objective delayed gastric emptying is required for diagnosis because symptoms alone are not specific, so I should avoid labeling without testing if initial FD‑directed therapy fails [^116xfwW3] [^116xfwW3] [^117Pgb3J].

> Next, I should review the initial noninvasive work‑up that is reasonable before invasive testing in a low‑risk patient. I need to check for Helicobacter pylori with a urea breath test or stool antigen and treat if positive, given its contribution to dyspepsia‑like presentations and the role of test‑and‑treat strategies in dyspepsia pathways. I should confirm a basic laboratory screen with CBC and a metabolic panel and consider TSH and glucose to exclude anemia, thyroid dysfunction, and diabetes that can mimic or contribute to dysmotility‑type symptoms. Let me also consider celiac serology when there are IBS‑like features, bloating, or risk factors, using tTG‑IgA with total IgA to avoid false negatives in IgA deficiency [^113qea4V] [^114dNRtF] [^1113botT].

> Now, I will outline empiric lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy tailored to symptom predominance while I await results. Small, low‑fat meals, avoidance of late meals and recumbency for 2–3 hours after eating, and reducing carbonated beverages can decrease postprandial distress and reflux; wait, I should verify that a short PPI trial is appropriate for heartburn‑predominant or GERD‑overlap symptoms, typically 4–8 weeks of once‑daily dosing taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast. If postprandial fullness and early satiation dominate, I should consider a short‑term prokinetic such as metoclopramide before meals, limiting duration due to tardive dyskinesia risk; if unavailable or poorly tolerated, region‑specific alternatives may be considered. For persistent epigastric pain or visceral hypersensitivity, low‑dose tricyclic antidepressants at night can be helpful; hold on, I should confirm this is consistent with managing functional GI pain states where acid is not the primary driver [^111scUUW] [^112zGywh] [^111NMd8u].

> At this point, I need to ensure a structured reassessment timeline. At about 4–6 weeks, I should review a symptom diary and adherence. If there is at least 50% improvement, I can continue, then taper to the lowest effective dose as feasible; if there is suboptimal response, I should proceed to upper endoscopy to exclude peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, malignancy, and to complete the exclusionary component implicit in Rome IV when symptoms persist. If endoscopy is negative and symptoms remain burdensome, I should verify gastric motility with a standardized gastric emptying study or a validated stable‑isotope breath test to evaluate for gastroparesis, and for PPI‑refractory heartburn I should use esophageal pH‑impedance monitoring off therapy or appropriately timed on therapy to differentiate NERD, reflux hypersensitivity, or functional heartburn before escalating acid suppression or considering antireflux strategies [^114UTqsE] [^116PVasX] [^117Pw8H4].

> I should also address psychosocial contributors and diet in parallel, because neglecting them can undermine outcomes. Let me consider screening for anxiety or depression and offering evidence‑based brain–gut behavioral therapies when available, and I need to check that dietary guidance is specific and safe, favoring structured small‑particle, lower‑fat meal patterns for PDS‑type symptoms and using elimination strategies judiciously with dietitian supervision to avoid malnutrition or disordered eating patterns. But wait, what if food‑triggered symptoms predominate without clear mechanistic signals? That is where a careful, time‑limited, hypothesis‑driven dietary trial with reintroduction under professional guidance makes sense while avoiding overly restrictive long‑term practices [^112H96fF] [^114UTqsE].

> In summary, my algorithm is as follows: first, verify no active alarm features or high‑risk age prompting early endoscopy; second, adopt a positive diagnosis of functional dyspepsia by Rome IV features with awareness of GERD and IBS overlaps; third, perform limited noninvasive testing including H. pylori, selected labs, and celiac serology when appropriate; fourth, initiate lifestyle measures plus a short PPI trial when heartburn is present or a prokinetic if postprandial distress dominates, adding a low‑dose TCA for persistent epigastric pain; fifth, reassess at 4–6 weeks and escalate to endoscopy if response is inadequate; sixth, if endoscopy is negative and symptoms persist, test gastric emptying and consider pH‑impedance for PPI‑refractory heartburn to refine the diagnosis and guide therapy. Let me reconsider once more to ensure internal consistency: this pathway aligns with BSG functional dyspepsia guidance, ACG GERD and gastroparesis recommendations, and expert consensus on physiologic testing in refractory reflux presentations [^114UTqsE] [^111scUUW] [^116PVasX] [^117Pw8H4].

---

This patient's chronic bloating, postprandial pain, intermittent heartburn, and constipation with a remote episode of hematochezia most likely reflect **functional dyspepsia with overlapping IBS-C** [^114UTqsE] [^111iUFFT]. The single remote episode of blood is reassuring but warrants a **colonoscopy if not previously done** to exclude polyps or malignancy. Initial workup should include CBC, CMP, TSH, celiac serology, and fecal calprotectin; if heartburn persists, a PPI trial is reasonable, and if symptoms are refractory, consider gastric emptying studies or SIBO testing [^1113botT] [^111scUUW] [^116PVasX]. Management should focus on dietary measures (low FODMAP, fiber, small frequent meals), osmotic laxatives, and neuromodulators if needed; refer to gastroenterology if alarm features develop or symptoms persist despite therapy [^112H96fF] [^116PVasX] [^notfound] [^114UTqsE] [^116xfwW3] [^111iUFFT].

## Differential diagnosis

Given the chronicity and symptom pattern, **consider the following differential diagnoses**.
- **Functional dyspepsia (FD)**: Characterized by postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, and bloating without structural disease [^114UTqsE] [^116xfwW3].
- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Chronic abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits (constipation-predominant in this case) [^111iUFFT] [^115WB1rB].
- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Intermittent heartburn, especially after heavier meals [^111scUUW] [^112wfT7t].
- **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying causing bloating, early satiety, and postprandial pain [^117Pgb3J] [^116PVasX].
- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: Bloating, abdominal discomfort, and altered bowel habits [^1162mBkv].
- **Celiac disease**: Bloating, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits [^1113botT].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Less likely given the absence of recurrent hematochezia, but should be considered [^114iMRif].
- **Colorectal neoplasia**: Given the remote episode of hematochezia, although unlikely, it should be excluded [^1175KzQd].

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

A structured **diagnostic approach** is recommended [^114UTqsE].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia or inflammation [^1175KzQd].
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess liver and renal function.
- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Screen for hypothyroidism [^116mzVoY].
- **Celiac serology**: Tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA [^1113botT].
- **Fecal calprotectin**: Screen for intestinal inflammation.

---

### Imaging and endoscopy

Imaging and endoscopy should include **colonoscopy** to exclude polyps, malignancy, or IBD given the remote episode of hematochezia. Consider upper endoscopy (EGD) if upper GI symptoms persist or alarm features develop, and use abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for gallstones or other structural abnormalities [^114UTqsE].

---

### Specialized tests

Specialized tests include a **gastric emptying study** for suspected gastroparesis and a **hydrogen breath test** for suspected SIBO [^116PVasX].

---

## Management strategies

Management should be **individualized** based on the working diagnosis.

---

### Dietary modifications

Dietary modifications include a **low FODMAP diet** for bloating and IBS symptoms and **small, frequent meals** to support functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis. Increased **dietary fiber** is recommended for constipation-predominant IBS [^112H96fF] [^116PVasX] [^115WB1rB].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: For GERD symptoms [^111scUUW].
- **Prokinetic agents**: For gastroparesis (e.g. metoclopramide, domperidone) [^116PVasX].
- **Osmotic laxatives**: For constipation (e.g. polyethylene glycol).
- **Neuromodulators**: Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs for functional dyspepsia or IBS [^114UTqsE].

---

### Behavioral and lifestyle interventions

Behavioral and lifestyle interventions include **cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)** for functional GI disorders and **regular physical activity** to improve GI motility and symptoms.

---

## Indications for specialist referral

In the following situations, **refer to a gastroenterologist** [^114UTqsE].
- **Alarm features**: Weight loss, recurrent hematochezia, anemia, or dysphagia.
- **Refractory symptoms**: Persistent symptoms despite initial management.
- **Complex diagnostic evaluation**: Need for specialized testing (e.g. manometry, pH monitoring) [^117Pw8H4].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Functional GI disorders **significantly impact quality of life**, causing physical discomfort, emotional distress, and social limitations [^114WKmZj]. Effective management strategies, including dietary modifications, pharmacological therapy, and behavioral interventions, can improve symptoms and quality of life.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^116xfwW3]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

In the absence of alarm symptoms or signs, functional dyspepsia (FD) is highly probable when epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness are reported in line with the Rome IV criteria. Endoscopy is unlikely to change the diagnosis, even though a normal endoscopy is required as part of these diagnostic criteria. In routine clinical practice, clinicians can use the recently proposed Rome IV clinical criteria, which require the presence of one or more of these four cardinal symptoms, reported as bothersome, for more than eight weeks. Other symptoms can coexist but should not be predominant. Information about the characteristics of pain should be recorded. Usually, in FD, pain is in the upper abdomen or epigastrium and may be present in fasting conditions, or precipitated or exacerbated by meal ingestion. Unlike in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal pain in FD is unrelated to the need to defecate.

All of this may help differentiate patients with FD from those with IBS or identify patients with FD with overlapping IBS, which can be of any subtype and is reported to occur in up to 50% of patients. In this situation, the patient will report the presence of two different types of abdominal pain, one related and one unrelated to defecation. Other functional bowel disorders, including functional diarrhea, functional constipation, or functional abdominal bloating and distension, can also overlap with FD. Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms also coexist in approximately one-third of patients with FD. In this situation, evidence suggests that clinicians tend to favor a diagnosis that incorporates both conditions.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114UTqsE]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Over the last 35 years, definitions of dyspepsia have evolved from a broad one, which included any symptom felt to be attributable to the stomach and duodenum, including heartburn, nausea, or vomiting, to one that includes only the cardinal symptoms of epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiation (the feeling of fullness during ingestion of a meal, which acts as a terminating factor). Recent definitions recognize that belching, nausea, or upper abdominal bloating can also be present. However, heartburn alone is not a symptom of dyspepsia, although it can coexist. Vomiting is atypical and, if present, should prompt consideration of another disorder. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is diagnosed in the absence of a structural abnormality to explain the symptoms. Therefore, to make a diagnosis, by definition, patients need to have been investigated to exclude evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease.

Symptoms alone are not reliable in distinguishing functional from organic causes of dyspepsia. Nevertheless, 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD following endoscopy. FD is defined according to symptom-based diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome Foundation and is classified into two distinct subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS).

- **Epigastric pain syndrome (EPS)**: The EPS subtype separates those with epigastric pain or burning that is often present regardless of meals.

- **Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS)**: PDS refers to those who report early satiation and postprandial fullness, mainly triggered by meals.

**Presentation**: Patients with IBS are classified into subtypes according to their predominant bowel habit. These include IBS-D, IBS-C, and mixed IBS (IBS-M), which is a combination of the previous two. Usually, IBS-D and IBS-C have similar prevalence. Common signs and symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain, bloating, straining during defecation, sensation of incomplete evacuation, mucus with stools, urgency, postprandial symptoms, depression, and anxiety.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, BSG 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining workup judiciously, including radiology, radioisotope studies, manometry, autoimmune screens, and histology, in accordance with guidelines. Take into account the presence of some drugs (such as opioids, cyclizine, or anticholinergic drugs), severe malnutrition, or an eating disorder when interpreting results.

The relationship between sub-types of GERD and non-GERD conditions, reflux acidity, esophageal hypersensitivity (discussed later), and response to PPIs is illustrated in Figure 2. Reflux is more often acidic in patients with reflux esophagitis than in those without, consistent with the strong causal link between reflux esophagitis and esophageal acid exposure. Reflux esophagitis is the most responsive of all GERD manifestations to acid suppression with PPIs, with healing rates of over 80% (and possibly higher with prolonged treatment). Selecting patients with reflux esophagitis strongly selects for those with pathologic esophageal acid exposure. As such, the symptoms experienced by patients with reflux esophagitis are more often related to acid and thus more responsive to PPIs than symptoms in patients without reflux esophagitis. In addition, lower esophageal sensitivity to acid in patients with reflux esophagitis (particularly high grade) than in those with NERD may lower the degree of acid suppression required to alleviate heartburn, also contributing to better PPI response. However, when patients without reflux esophagitis who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure are selected, the estimated complete symptom response rate with PPIs is comparable to that for reflux esophagitis.

Figure 2 shows the relationship between reflux acidity, response of heartburn to acid-suppressive therapy, and the role of peripheral and/or central esophageal hypersensitivity in different gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and non-GERD patients with heartburn.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally result from infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to a variety of conditions.

- **Gastrointestinal etiologies**: Include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases.
- **Central nervous system etiologies**: Primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, typically causing other neurologic signs.
- **Endocrinologic causes**: Pregnancy is the most common and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age.
- **Other causes**: Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses may also cause nausea and vomiting.

Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^112zGywh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gastroparesis, specifically in relation to differential diagnosis, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend considering the presence of rumination syndrome, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, and/or cyclic vomiting syndrome — defined as episodic episodes of nausea and vomiting — when evaluating patients for gastroparesis. It is important to recognize that these disorders may be associated with delayed gastric emptying, and identifying them may alter management.

### Assessment of reflux symptom severity: Methodological options and their attributes [^112gjryQ]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Despite major advances in our understanding of reflux disease, the management of this disorder still presents many challenges. Reduction of heartburn is the most readily apparent objective for the patient with reflux disease. Thus, the ability to measure heartburn accurately is of fundamental importance to clinical research in reflux disease. Here, the available data on the assessment of reflux symptoms — predominantly heartburn — in clinical trials of symptomatic reflux disease are examined.

### Gastric sensorimotor function and its clinical measurement [^117QWBom]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

Gastroduodenal symptoms are highly prevalent, with underlying sensorimotor dysfunction contributing in many patients. Common symptoms include early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric bloating, pain or burning, nausea, and vomiting, which collectively affect over 7% of adults. However, the clinical evaluation of these symptoms remains challenging, with tests of gastric function limited in their ability or availability to separate specific patient subgroups or guide-targeted care.

In the edition of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Silver et al. present new data showing correlations between patterns of intragastric meal distribution and symptom profiles in a large series of patients undergoing gastric emptying scintigraphy. Studies of this type are important as they motivate understanding beyond existing disease labels and orient focus toward deeper mechanistic profiling. This brief review provides an overview of gastric sensorimotor function and profiles several emerging methods of clinical evaluation. Perspectives are provided on accommodation testing, gastric emptying, measuring gastric myoelectrical activity including new approaches, and antroduodenal manometry. Although gastric physiology is complex, recent progress has been encouraging. The heterogeneous pathophysiology of gastric symptoms continues to be unraveled, and new techniques for evaluating gastric function and symptoms are emerging.

Ongoing progress will now depend on continuing to accurately profile the underl…

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly concerning the management of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend increasing fluid and salt intake, offering exercise training, and using compression garments for the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. It is also advisable to consider special pharmacological treatments for volume expansion, heart rate control, and vasoconstriction, with integrated care from multiple specialties — such as cardiology and neurology — in patients not responding to conservative lifestyle measures.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the physiological assessment and diagnosis of GERD [^117Pw8H4]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition worldwide. Key mechanisms of the disease include abnormal oesophagogastric junction structure and function, as well as impaired oesophageal clearance. A therapeutic trial of acid-suppressive PPI therapy is often the initial management strategy, with endoscopy performed in the presence of alarm symptoms and to exclude other conditions. If symptoms persist and endoscopy does not reveal evidence of GERD, oesophageal function tests are performed, including oesophageal manometry and ambulatory reflux monitoring. However, reflux episodes can be physiological, and some findings on endoscopy and manometry can be encountered in asymptomatic individuals without GERD symptoms.

The diagnosis of GERD based on functional oesophageal testing has been previously reported, but no updated expert recommendations on indications and the interpretation of oesophageal function testing in GERD have been made since the Porto consensus over a decade ago. In this Consensus Statement, we aim to describe modern oesophageal physiological tests and their analysis, with an emphasis on establishing indications and consensus on interpretation parameters of oesophageal function testing for the evaluation of GERD in clinical practice. This document reflects the collective conclusions of the international GERD working group, incorporating existing data with expert consensus opinion.

### Comparison of symptoms, healthcare utilization, and treatment in diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [^112Vjhp3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significantly greater percentage of diagnosed patients had GI symptoms for ≥ 10 years compared with undiagnosed individuals (55% vs. 18%, respectively; P < 0.05). Conversely, a significantly greater percentage of undiagnosed individuals had symptoms for < 3 years compared with diagnosed patients (51% vs. 14%, respectively; P < 0.05). Diagnosed patients were twice as likely to have severe GI symptoms (i.e. severity score, 6 or 7) than undiagnosed individuals (16% vs. 8%, respectively; P < 0.05), whereas undiagnosed individuals were significantly more likely to have mild symptoms (i.e. severity score, 1 or 2) compared with diagnosed patients (6% vs. 3%, respectively; P < 0.05).

A greater percentage of diagnosed patients had more severe symptoms compared with individuals in the undiagnosed group for discomfort/pain (diagnosed, 36% vs. undiagnosed, 24%), diarrhea (52% vs. 29%), loose/mushy stools (49% vs. 29%), urgency (61% vs. 41%), and bloating (26% vs. 20%); P < 0.05 for all comparisons (Figure 1a). Diagnosed patients had more disruptive IBS-associated symptoms than individuals in the undiagnosed group, including discomfort/pain (32% vs. 27%), diarrhea (61% vs. 40%), loose/mushy stools (44% vs. 27%), and urgency (64% vs. 46%); P < 0.05 for all comparisons (Figure 1b). Bloating occurred in a comparable percentage of individuals (19% vs. 18%). Yet, undiagnosed individuals had more confounder symptoms (i.e. heartburn, gastric reflux, constipation) than diagnosed patients.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly in managing gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering treatment for suspected mast cell activation syndrome with histamine receptor antagonists and/or mast cell stabilizers. It is advised to avoid triggers such as certain foods, alcohol, strong smells, temperature changes, mechanical stimuli (friction), emotional distress, and specific medications like opioids, NSAIDs, and iodinated contrast.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms from an epidemiological perspective [^114aQiU9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Four manuscripts on gastrointestinal problems or disorders of gut-brain interaction are discussed from an epidemiological perspective. A literature review with strict inclusion criteria pointed out the dearth of evidence-based knowledge on gastrointestinal symptoms following treatment for anorexia nervosa. An epidemiological follow-up study showing the relevance of childhood abdominal pain for fasting to control weight in adolescence is used to emphasize the need to refine our approach to risk factor research in eating disorders. Two additional studies highlight the high prevalence of gastrointestinal problems in eating disorders, underscoring a need for improved consideration of these symptoms in clinical practice and eating disorder research.

### Post-COVID-19 condition: Clinical phenotypes, pathophysiological mechanisms, pathology, and management strategies [^1112b6Dt]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

The post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) can also affect the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea appear across multiple PCC phenotypes. These GI symptoms likely result from a combination of mechanisms, including viral persistence, immune dysregulation, microbial disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction. Such interconnected processes can lead to inflammation and altered gut motility, manifesting as persistent GI symptoms. The GI tract is a known target of SARS-CoV-2 due to the abundance of ACE2 receptors on the brush border of intestinal mucosae. Viral RNA and proteins may persist in the intestines and stool for months after acute infection, suggesting that ongoing viral activity in the gut impacts host immune responses underlying GI symptoms in PCC. Indeed, viral antigen persistence in the gut mucosa was associated with these PCC symptoms.

### Minor digestive symptoms and their impact in the general population: A cluster analysis approach [^114WKmZj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The impact of digestive symptoms and causation is significant. As shown in Figure 4, the most recent minor digestive symptoms (MDS) had a strong emotional and social impact, mainly affecting physical conditions. A substantial 90.5% of women reported feeling heavy or big, physically ill, stressed, uncomfortable in clothing, disturbed in daily life, and experiencing sleeping problems. Additionally, self-image was affected, with 72.5% expressing feelings such as "I feel bad about my body" and "I have a bad image of my body". Vitality was also impacted, with 67.3% experiencing tiredness, lack of reactivity, or vitality.

- **Figure 4**: Emotional and social impact of minor gastrointestinal disorders. The 10 most frequently reported effects are shown as the percentage of the whole population reporting that particular item.

Causation was closely linked to several factors, as shown in Figure 5. It mainly related to food type, with 73.6% of women citing items like uncooked vegetables or fruits and drinking water while eating. Food habits were also noted, with 53.5% mentioning behaviors like eating too quickly or not chewing food enough. Physiology was another factor, with 75.5% reporting issues such as sensitivity, improper intestinal function, aging, and slow digestion. Lifestyle factors were noted by 77.0%, including stress, tiredness, and anger.
- **Figure 5**: Perceived causation of minor gastrointestinal disorders. The 11 most frequently reported causes are shown as the percentage of the whole population reporting that particular item.

Amongst women, the combination of symptom phraseology and pictures of feelings led to the identification of 11 MDS clusters. These were characterized by symptoms, time and place of occurrence, causation, and impact. These clusters included constipation-like symptoms reported by 17.9% of participants.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^114CnLju]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Difficulties in establishing guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea - **Reported change in stool frequency**: Change in stool frequency or form is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and forms part of the definition of the condition, which relies on symptom-based criteria and negative physical examination. Although stool weight does not usually increase in IBS, since symptom reporting forms the basis for the diagnosis and stool weight is rarely assessed early in the investigation, there is considerable overlap between functional bowel disease and true 'diarrhoea'. As IBS may affect 10–13% of the population, there is a significant potential for the inappropriate investigation of patients reporting diarrhoeal symptoms. Conversely, new onset diarrhoea may reflect serious organic disease such as colonic neoplasia. This wide diagnostic potential given similar reported symptoms makes the introduction of specific guidelines difficult.

The broad range of conditions leading to diarrhoea also makes it challenging to be too prescriptive regarding the investigative pathways that should be adopted. Diarrhoea may result from colonic neoplasia, inflammation, small bowel inflammation, small bowel malabsorption, maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency, or motility disorders, and it can be difficult to differentiate these on clinical grounds alone. The decision on whether to focus investigations on any one of these areas remains largely a matter of clinical judgment although, as will be discussed, the prevalence and potential seriousness of different conditions must be considered.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111NMd8u]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

However, non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) is an umbrella term that includes at least four different patient subgroups. Among these, only those where acid is implicated in symptom generation, such as true NERD and patients with acid hypersensitive esophagus, are clearly responsive to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This is not the case for patients who are hypersensitive to nonacidic reflux or those with functional heartburn. According to Rome IV criteria, both acid hypersensitive esophagus (now called reflux hypersensitivity) and functional heartburn are functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, which should no longer be included in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The lack of abnormal acid exposure and symptom-reflux association means patients with functional heartburn are not responsive to PPIs. This subgroup may benefit from visceral analgesics, such as antidepressants.

Although not as frequent as previously suggested, PPI-refractory heartburn does exist and occurs more commonly in NERD than in erosive disease. Approximately 20% (range 15–27%) of correctly diagnosed and appropriately treated patients do not respond to PPI therapy at standard doses. To ascertain whether they are "truly" PPI-resistant, compliance and adherence to treatment should be checked. Indeed, PPIs are often taken inappropriately, with only 27% of GERD patients dosing their PPI correctly and only 12% dosing it optimally in a USA survey. Although a standard PPI dose can occasionally control symptoms, nocturnal intragastric acidity often remains elevated, with nocturnal acid breakthrough (NAB) in these patients. A split regimen (either standard or double dose) of PPIs twice daily (b.i.d.) may be considered.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^117Pgb3J]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires objective evidence of clearly delayed gastric emptying in symptomatic patients. Because accelerated, normal, and delayed gastric emptying cannot be differentiated reliably based on the type or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, objective measurement of delayed gastric emptying (gastric emptying time increased above the upper level of normal) using well-validated techniques such as gastric emptying scintigraphy is required for the diagnosis of gastroparesis. To obtain a more specific symptom pattern and a better separation from functional dyspepsia with delayed emptying, gastroparesis has been proposed to require a stricter definition, for example, more than three standard deviations above the mean value in healthy volunteers.

The merit of gastric emptying studies for clinical management has been questioned because of variations in the reports of the association between gastric emptying rates and symptoms. Several studies published during the past seven years have shown a positive association between symptoms of gastroparesis and gastric emptying times. Measurement of gastric emptying can also predict responsiveness to different therapeutic options. For example, the presence of slow gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia was associated with poor response to antidepressant medications that target visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, one systematic literature review that used multiple methods, various symptom instruments, and diverse treatments showed that most drugs that improved idiopathic and diabetic gastropare…

### Digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 [^116ukDWJ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The prevalence and significance of digestive manifestations in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain uncertain. We aimed to assess the prevalence, spectrum, severity, and significance of digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
- **Methods**: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were abstracted manually from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19.
- **Results**: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were increased to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76–1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission…

### Mechanisms underlying food-triggered symptoms in disorders of gut-brain interactions [^112H96fF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

There has been a dramatic increase in clinical studies examining the relationship between disorders of gut-brain interactions and symptoms evoked by food ingestion in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, but study design is challenging to verify valid endpoints. Consequently, mechanistic studies demonstrating biological relevance, biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets are greatly needed.

This review highlights emerging mechanisms related to nutrient sensing and tasting, maldigestion, physical effects with underlying visceral hypersensitivity, allergy and immune mechanisms, food–microbiota interactions, and gut-brain signaling, with a focus on patients with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Many patients suffering from disorders of gut-brain interactions exhibit these mechanisms, but which ones and which specific properties may vary widely from patient to patient.

Thus, in addition to identifying these mechanisms and the need for further studies, biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets are identified that could enable enriched patient groups to be studied in future clinical trials examining the role of food in the generation of gut and non-gut symptoms.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^1169Hx9a]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Disturbances of gastric and intestinal motor functions, such as gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, enteric dysmotility, IBS, and constipation, affect a large proportion of the population worldwide. These disturbances impair quality of life and cause considerable health-care costs. Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnoses and guide therapy. Comprehensive consensus papers published in 2008 and 2011 detailed how to evaluate and interpret gastric, small intestinal, and colonic motility by intraluminal measurements and transit tests in clinical practice.

Advances in diagnostic techniques for the evaluation of gastrointestinal motor function necessitate an update about indications for, selection of, and performance of currently available tests. This includes how motility disorders can be differentiated and classified based on these tests and how the results guide treatment decisions, as noted in this consensus statement. A panel of international motility experts has re-examined these issues and provides concise information on test principles, practical performance, and interpretation of individual tests. Further details on these topics will be provided in technical position statements that will be published separately.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^112QzyJT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Disturbances of gastric, intestinal, and colonic motor and sensory functions affect a large proportion of the population worldwide, impair quality of life, and cause considerable healthcare costs. Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and to guide therapy. Major advances in diagnostic techniques during the past 5–10 years have led to this update about indications for and selection and performance of currently available tests.

As symptoms have poor concordance with gastrointestinal motor dysfunction, clinical motility testing is indicated in patients in whom there is no evidence of causative mucosal or structural diseases such as inflammatory or malignant disease. Transit tests using radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, breath tests, and wireless motility capsules are noninvasive. Other tests of gastrointestinal contractility or sensation usually require intubation, typically represent second-line investigations limited to patients with severe symptoms, and are performed at specialized centers.

This consensus statement details recommended tests as well as useful clinical alternatives for investigation of gastric, small bowel, and colonic motility. The article provides recommendations on how to classify gastrointestinal motor disorders based on test results and describes how test results guide treatment decisions.

### Impact of pelvic radiation therapy for prostate cancer on global metabolic profiles and microbiota-driven gastrointestinal late side effects: A longitudinal observational study [^112HkpAt]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms and their relationship to metabolite levels, we closely followed our previously published methodology. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) were analyzed with the bowel subset of a gastrointestinal symptom score validated for radiation enteropathy.

Patients were divided into three groups: (1) no symptoms (no symptoms at either 4 or 5 weeks or 6 months); (2) nonpersistent symptoms (symptoms at either 4 or 5 weeks or 6 months); and (3) persistent symptoms (symptoms at 4 or 5 weeks and 6 months). This strategy enables the identification of patients experiencing nonhealing acute toxicity, which may be related to a consequential reaction and determines a higher risk of long-term symptoms.

We used LME modeling to investigate potential associations between short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites of interest (butyrate and propionate) according to the model formula:

model < - log(metabolite) ∼ time point*PRO + (time point|subject)

Significance was evaluated by t-tests using Satterthwaite's method.

### Diet, food intake, and disturbed physiology in the pathogenesis of symptoms in functional dyspepsia [^112AcLqM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) remains a relatively poorly characterized gastrointestinal disorder of unknown etiology that is frequently difficult to manage. A systematic review of the literature relating to food intake and FD is summarized here. Many patients with FD report symptoms after meal ingestion, including fullness, bloating, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, and this has been interpreted as indicative of an underlying "motor disorder of the stomach or small intestine". Such hypotheses are, however, still largely unsubstantiated, and the data that do exist are inconclusive, particularly as few studies have directly examined the temporal relationships between dyspeptic symptoms, meal ingestion, and disordered gastric motility.

Moreover, studies attempting to relate symptoms to specific disturbances in gastric motor function have, in most cases, not evaluated symptoms concurrently with the function test and/or have used suboptimal symptom scoring to quantify symptoms. Furthermore, the term "early satiety" has been used loosely as a symptom rather than as a quantitative measure of food intake. Currently, the most widely accepted mechanism underlying FD is visceral hypersensitivity, which may contribute to both enhanced motor and symptomatic responses to food ingestion. However, the possible contribution of food and dietary habits to the induction and/or exacerbation of dyspeptic symptoms represents a relatively new area — despite frequent reports by patients that their symptoms are often related to food ingestion; this association has not been formally assessed.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: Examining the psychometric evaluations of disordered eating scales in adults living with gastrointestinal conditions [^111fDUWc]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations**: A notable strength of this review was the inclusion of a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of disordered eating in gastrointestinal populations. Included studies spanned 11 countries, increasing the generalizability of the results. Moreover, the rigorous methods by which the study was conducted, wherein two independent researchers performed the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, speak to the internal validity of our study as well as minimizing the risk of bias in the review.

	- Several limitations were present in this review. Primarily, the small number of studies meant that not all gastrointestinal conditions and disordered eating scales could be analyzed, restricting the exploration of possible reasons for the high heterogeneity. The inclusion of varying gastrointestinal conditions, each with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and potential impacts on disordered eating, may reduce the specificity of the findings. The limited studies also precluded the ability to compare the interaction between combinations of scales and gastrointestinal diagnoses, an area that can be explored through further research. Including only observational studies means the quality of reporting, response rates of participants, and the sampling were inconsistent. This was quantified in the overall medium risk of bias, thus reducing the overall robustness of conclusions drawn from this meta-analysis.

### Rumination syndrome: Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^1155sZnY]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on rumination syndrome:

- **Definition**: RS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the effortless and repetitive regurgitation of recently ingested food from the stomach to the oral cavity, followed by either re-swallowing or spitting.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of RS involves a voluntary but unconscious process consisting of a coordinated abdominothoracic muscle response, including thoracic suction, crural diaphragm relaxation, and increased intragastric pressure. These factors collectively reverse the esophagogastric pressure gradient due to low lower esophageal sphincter and intrathoracic pressures. The exact trigger for rumination events is unclear, but they may result from dyspeptic symptoms as patients seek relief through regurgitation or venting. GERD and pathological supragastric belching can also be mechanisms provoking or aggravating RS. Enhanced visceral pain perception and poor postprandial accommodation of the stomach have been suggested as mechanisms for epigastric pain and the feeling of bloating in patients with RS.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of RS in the US is estimated at 5.8%, with higher rates observed in children and adolescents.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for RS include female gender, smoking, adherence to a gluten-free diet, and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, a history of eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) and psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression) have been identified as independent risk factors for RS.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing for disaccharidase deficiencies or other diet-mediated mechanisms as causes of gastrointestinal symptoms in hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders.

### Involvement of digestive system in COVID-19: Manifestations, pathology, management and challenges [^1132VZhr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has developed as a tremendous threat to global health. Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain as major complaints. These features may be attributable to several factors:

- **Expression of receptors**: COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- **Viral RNA presence**: SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, with 20% of patients showing prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples even after the virus converts to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract.

Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation preceding respiratory symptoms; patients suffering only digestive symptoms without respiratory symptoms as a clinical manifestation have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are of great importance.

In this review, we summarize recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of fecal-oral transmission, GI and liver manifestations, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19, and the diagnosis and management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases.

### Small intestinal microbial dysbiosis underlies symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders [^1162mBkv]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

In summary, our findings highlight the potential clinical benefit of characterizing the small intestinal microbiome. There are several mechanisms underlying the common GI symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain, and the gut microbiota is likely one such factor. Small intestinal microbial compositional analysis can help identify individuals in whom the microbiome is altered and may be contributing to symptoms, as well as delineate individuals with a healthy small intestinal microbiome where other factors may be at play. We also provide preliminary evidence supporting the interaction of diet with small intestinal microbiota in the development of GI symptoms commonly associated with FGIDs.

### Insights into gastroesophageal reflux disease-associated dyspeptic symptoms [^114tmLtz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The aims of this study focused on understanding that patients with GERD frequently report dyspeptic-like symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, and belching. The purpose of this review was to define the epidemiology and underlying mechanisms of dyspeptic symptoms in GERD patients.
- **Methods**: We performed a systematic literature review to identify the prevalence of dyspeptic symptoms in GERD patients. A total of 2057 studies were identified, and 37 studies (2%) met the entry criteria. These included 17 articles describing the prevalence of dyspeptic symptoms in GERD subjects, 7 studies describing mechanistic evaluations of dyspeptic symptoms in GERD, 7 studies using questionnaires to measure dyspeptic symptoms, and 6 studies assessing the role of proton pump inhibitor therapy for dyspeptic symptoms associated with GERD. An evidence-based approach was used to assess the literature.
- **Results**: The median (± standard deviation) prevalence of GERD in 30,384 subjects from 8 studies conducted in Western countries was found to be 30% ± 8% (range, 20%-40%). Dyspeptic symptoms were present in 38% ± 14% (range, 21%-63%) and were more frequent in patients with frequent GERD symptoms compared to those with intermittent or no GERD symptoms [Evidence B]. Patients with nonerosive disease showed a higher prevalence of dyspeptic symptoms [Evidence B] and exhibited a lower response to proton pump inhibitor therapy [Evidence A], compared to patients with erosive esophagitis. Notably, symptoms such as epigastric pain, belching, bloating, and early satiety improved with PPI therapy [Evidence A], unlike symptoms of nausea.

### Manifestations and prognosis of gastrointestinal and liver involvement in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116z58wk]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The prevalence and prognosis of digestive system involvement, including gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury, in patients with COVID-19 remains largely unknown. We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system.
- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020. The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients. We excluded preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (less than 10 cases). Extracted data included author, date, study design, country, patient demographics, number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups, prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching, and digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Raw data from studies were pooled to determine effect estimates.
- **Findings**: We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n = 6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2–5; range 0–15; I² = 74%).

### Gastrointestinal symptoms in diabetes: Prevalence, assessment, pathogenesis, and management [^113LxbzC]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms represent an important and often unappreciated cause of morbidity in diabetes, although the significance of this burden across the spectrum of patients and the underlying pathophysiology, including the relationship of symptoms with glycemic control, remain poorly defined. The relevance of GI symptoms and the necessity for their accurate assessment have increased with the greater focus on the gut as a therapeutic target for glucose lowering.

This review addresses the prevalence, assessment, pathogenesis, and management of GI symptoms in diabetes, beginning with broad principles and then focusing on specific segments of the GI tract. We initially performed a literature search of PubMed by using synonyms and combinations of the following search terms: "gastrointestinal symptoms", "diabetes", "prevalence", "pathogenesis", "diagnosis", and "management". We restricted the search results to English only. Review papers and meta-analyses are presented as the highest level of evidence where possible, followed by randomized controlled trials, uncontrolled trials, retrospective and observational data, and expert opinion.

### Gastrointestinal hypoalgesia in inflammatory bowel disease [^114iMRif]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders. It is a major driver behind the deterioration of patients' quality of life and increased healthcare resource utilization in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). While there is little doubt that abdominal pain can have a detrimental impact on the lives of IBD patients, it also serves an indispensable physiological service. The ability to properly perceive pain is critical for the detection of noxious insults that have the potential to cause damage to the body. This is true even in the gastrointestinal tract, where perception of noxious exposures may be vaguer and poorly localized, and it is particularly relevant when considering IBD.

If IBD patients with clinically significant disease activity do not simultaneously experience and/or report symptoms commensurate with the degree of inflammation, including abdominal pain, they are described as having silent IBD. Silent IBD is important because it has been associated with the development of more frequent and serious complications, including strictures, fistulae, and abscesses, as well as increased hospitalization. As abdominal pain is one of the most frequently described and consequential symptoms in the setting of IBD, it is not difficult to imagine that a lack or reduction of abdominal pain by itself during periods of significant disease activity, or "hypoalgesic IBD", can impart a tremendous risk of poor outcomes over time.

### International consensus on the diagnosis and management of dumping syndrome [^116CuTHM]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

Early dumping syndrome is characterized by gastrointestinal and vasomotor symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, borborygmi, nausea, and diarrhea. Vasomotor symptoms include fatigue, a desire to lie down after meals, flushing, palpitations, perspiration, tachycardia, hypotension, and, rarely, syncope. This statement is endorsed with an overall agreement of 100%: A+ 95%, A 5%, A− 0%, D− 0%, D 0%, D+ 0%. Grade: B.

Late dumping syndrome typically occurs 1–3 hours following a meal and is marked by reactive hypoglycemia. This statement is endorsed with an overall agreement of 95%: A+ 85%, A 10%, A− 5%, D− 0%, D 0%, D+ 0%. Grade: A.

Symptoms of early dumping syndrome are attributed to the rapid passage of nutrients to the small intestine, which activates a cascade of pathophysiological events. The arrival of hyperosmolar contents in the small intestine triggers a shift of fluid from the intravascular component to the intestinal lumen, leading to decreased circulating blood volume, duodenal or jejunal distention, and the release of several gastrointestinal peptide hormones.

These changes trigger symptoms of early dumping syndrome:

- **Cardiovascular symptoms**: tachycardia, hypotension, and, rarely, syncope
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: abdominal cramps

Provocative tests for assessing dumping syndrome, such as a modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), have shown that most of these symptoms or their consequences (increased pulse rate and rise in hematocrit level) are already present 30 minutes following a meal. Late dumping syndrome can be attributed to the development of hyperinsulinemic, or reactive, hypoglycemia due to the rapid delivery of carbohydrates.

Non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are associated with a range of symptoms and conditions, including atopy, bowel wall thickening, bloating, and peritoneal findings. Patients may experience weight loss, food allergies, loss of appetite, and delayed puberty. Other manifestations include ascites, abdominal pain, asthma, and abdominal cramps. Additional symptoms can include atopic dermatitis, malabsorption, positive fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), increased blood eosinophil count, decreased serum albumin, diarrhea, allergic rhinitis, anemia, dyspepsia, vomiting, amenorrhea, faltering growth, nausea, bowel obstruction, and abdominal distension.

### Binosto [^113unPR4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions**: Binosto, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to these potential irritant effects and the risk of exacerbating underlying disease, caution should be exercised when Binosto is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers.

Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely leading to esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms indicating a possible esophageal reaction, and patients should be instructed to discontinue Binosto and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain, or new or worsening heartburn.

The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium, after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is crucial that the full dosing instructions are provided to and understood by the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Structured gastroenterological intervention and improved outcome for patients with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy [^1161aDHa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Fifty percent of patients develop chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy that adversely affect quality of life. Fewer than 20% are referred to a gastroenterologist. We aimed to determine if structured gastroenterological evaluation is of benefit to this patient group.
- **Methods**: Sixty patients with GI symptoms at ≥ 6 months after radical pelvic radiotherapy were identified prospectively from oncology clinics in this service evaluation. Those requiring urgent investigation were excluded. Patients were assessed at baseline using patient-reported questionnaires: inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), Vaizey incontinence questionnaire, and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) pelvis questionnaire. Participants were referred for gastroenterological evaluation using an algorithmic approach. Further assessments were made at 3 and 6 months.
- **Results**: Twenty men and 36 women with primary gynecological (31), urological (17), or lower GI (8) tumors were included (mean age, 58.5 years). The median time from radiotherapy to baseline assessment was 3.0 years. Multiple GI symptoms were reported (median, 8; range, 4–16), including frequency, urgency, loose stool, fecal incontinence, flatulence, bloating/distension, and rectal bleeding. Common diagnoses included radiation proctopathy, bile acid malabsorption, diverticulosis, and colonic polyps. Statistically significant improvements in all questionnaire scores between baseline and 6 months were found: IBDQ (p = 0.014), Vaizey (p < 0.0005), and CTCAE rectum-bowel subset (p < 0.001).

### Dyspepsia [^111AwcgC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia refers to pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen. This symptom is remarkably common, with 1-year prevalence rates averaging 25% in the community. Symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome and reflux disease frequently overlap but do not form part of the definition of dyspepsia. Electrical and other stimuli can cause similar or different symptoms in various patients, and even the site to which symptoms are referred varies considerably. Dyspeptic symptoms are therefore a relatively poor guide to the origin or nature of any "disturbances" in the gut.

Identification of patients who require further investigation to rule out serious structural diseases, such as peptic ulcer disease or cancer, is a key issue because unaided clinical diagnosis is unreliable. The use of an age threshold (typically 45 years) and the identification of alarm features, including weight loss, repeated vomiting, and signs of bleeding, seem to be valid on the basis of the limited evidence available.

Dyspeptic symptoms fall into distinct subgroups resembling the perceived clinical entities of ulcer-like and dysmotility-like dyspepsia. Unfortunately, because of overlap with reflux symptoms and between the subgroups, the clinical significance of these groups remains highly questionable. A focus on symptom predominance may be more rewarding. Lack of validated outcome measures has hampered clinical studies and has led to the development of complex outcome measures that integrate and weigh different symptoms or other indirect indicators of outcome into a general score.

### Boniva [^116ySJXk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions**: Boniva, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to these potential irritant effects and the possibility of worsening underlying diseases, caution is advised when Boniva is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems, such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers.

	- Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should be vigilant for any signs or symptoms indicating a possible esophageal reaction. Patients should be instructed to discontinue Boniva and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain, or new or worsening heartburn.

	- The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6–8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is crucial that the full dosing instructions are provided to and understood by the patient (see Dosage and Administration).

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111bs4T6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly in evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a diagnostic evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with disorders of gut-brain interaction in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders. This is particularly essential in the presence of comorbid postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and/or mast cell activation syndrome. Follow a similar approach to the evaluation of disorders of gut-brain interaction as in the general population, which includes using a positive symptom-based diagnostic strategy combined with limited noninvasive testing.

### Ibandronate sodium [^1145VxJf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions**: Ibandronate sodium, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to these possible irritant effects and the potential for worsening underlying disease, caution is advised when ibandronate sodium is prescribed to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems, such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers.

Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In certain cases, these have been severe enough to require hospitalization. Physicians should therefore remain alert to any signs or symptoms indicating a potential esophageal reaction. Patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain, or new or worsening heartburn.

The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences seems to be higher in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates, fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, or continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is essential that full dosing instructions are provided to and understood by the patient [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.2].

### Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with peritoneal dialysis: The prevalence, influence factors and association with quality of life [^115nz6fJ]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a complex condition. Gastrointestinal symptoms related to uraemia, medications, and other comorbidities are common in patients with ESRD. Endoscopic evaluation and mucosal biopsies are ideal methods for diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases, but their invasiveness makes them difficult to use widely in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Several scales, such as Rome I, Rome II, Rome III, and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), are used to evaluate functional gastrointestinal symptoms in dialysis patients. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with PD, as evaluated by different assessment scales, varies greatly, ranging from 14.2% to 90.3%.

The underlying pathogenesis of gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients has not been clearly elucidated. The evidence base regarding gastrointestinal symptoms in dialysis patients is limited, underscoring the need for further investigation into preventable causes and potential interventions. Since dextrose dialysate is instilled into the peritoneal cavity of PD patients, the uniqueness of PD treatment might affect gastrointestinal function through delayed gastric emptying, increased intraperitoneal pressure, and decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure. It is necessary to further study the influence factors of gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients. Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms may significantly impact the quality of life (QOL) of PD patients. Although previous studies have explored the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and QOL in dialysis patients, additional research is required.

### Revisiting Montreal: New insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^112wfT7t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Figure 1 illustrates the suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related symptoms, their relative likelihood of response to acid-suppressive therapy based on the literature, and the presumed importance of acid reflux for symptom generation based on these findings. Smaller arrows underneath each symptom indicate the direction of the shift in response to acid suppression when patients are selected based on the presence (RE+) or absence (RE−) of reflux esophagitis, or the presence (pH+) or absence (pH−) of pathologic esophageal acid exposure. The relative position of each symptom and the size of the arrows are not to scale.

In summary, heartburn is assumed to be the quintessential acid-related symptom and, as such, correlates most frequently with pathologic esophageal acid exposure and response to acid-suppressive therapy. The response of heartburn (and regurgitation) to acid suppression is higher in RE+ patients than in RE− patients, concordant with RE being a good proxy for pathologic esophageal acid exposure in lieu of pH-testing. The relative response of symptoms to acid suppression decreases as their dependence on pathologic esophageal acid exposure decreases. However, even for symptoms such as chest pain and cough, response rates to acid suppression can be enhanced by identifying patients who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure (pH+), albeit with a dwindling effect as symptom etiology becomes increasingly multifactorial.

Given the above, it is not surprising that the proportion of reflux-related symptoms associated with non-acid reflux jumps drastically to around 80% in patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1162LRzY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically concerning gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend aligning the management of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders who do not exhibit symptoms consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or mast cell activation syndrome. This alignment should be with existing approaches to the management of disorders of gut-brain interaction and gastrointestinal motility disorders in the general population.

The guidelines emphasize integrated multidisciplinary care involving multiple specialties, where appropriate, such as cardiology, rheumatology, dietetics, and psychology.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^113qea4V]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

If symptoms were a good discriminator for the likelihood of a patient with dyspepsia having an underlying organic pathology, this would aid the physician greatly in their clinical assessment; however, unfortunately, this is not the case. A previous systematic review of diagnostic test studies demonstrated convincingly that a physician's opinion, based on symptoms reported by the patient, had limited diagnostic ability to discriminate between organic causes of dyspepsia and functional dyspepsia (FD).

Historically, FD was referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, creating the impression that the diagnosis was based on the absence of specific underlying organic pathology and therefore encouraging the use of investigations in all patients. Although more recently the terminology has changed, FD still remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Rome Foundation, the expert group responsible for the classification of all functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, defines FD using the Rome IV criteria as bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning in the absence of structural disease, including at upper GI endoscopy, which would explain the symptoms. According to these criteria, the condition is subgrouped into two separate syndromes: the epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and the postprandial distress syndrome (PDS).
- **Rome criteria**: EPS consists of intermittent pain or burning in the epigastrium, occurring at least once per week. The pain may be either induced or relieved by eating but may also occur while fasting; however, it should not fulfill biliary pain criteria.

### Episodic nature of symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome [^113VXMeJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether the symptoms of diarrhea (defined as loose or watery stools), constipation (hard or lumpy stools), abdominal pain, and bloating occur in episodes rather than sporadically in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); to identify rules for defining the onset and termination of symptom episodes; and to assess the overlap of these episodes.

IBS patients kept a symptom log in which they rated the consistency of each bowel movement (BM) on the Bristol Stool Scale for 3 months. Each night they transferred these data to an internet website and also rated abdominal pain and bloating for that day. Data were analyzed for 124 patients who completed at least 21 consecutive diary days (mean of 73 days) without taking laxative, antidiarrheal, or IBS-specific medications. For each symptom in each patient, researchers computed the correlation between consecutive observations (autocorrelations) in the diary to determine whether the symptom tended to occur in clusters of several instances, as would happen in episodes, versus happening randomly. Next, they compared different patterns by which diarrhea and nondiarrhea stools alternate to identify episode definitions that captured at least 75% of loose/watery stools. A similar pattern analysis was performed for constipation. Pain and bloating episodes were defined as days with an intensity rating > 3 on a 0–10 scale. These patterns were converted into rules for defining the onset and termination of symptom episodes. Lastly, these episode definitions were used to examine the overlap of the identified symptoms.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: Straightening the road from the Rome criteria [^115WB1rB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

A sequence of consensus-based Rome criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been published since 1989. The fundamental definition based on abdominal pain in association with bowel dysfunction has been consistent. However, two major changes occurred in the Rome II and IV criteria. The former change involved "splitting off" symptoms that were not consistently associated with pain, such as functional, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. In Rome IV, the main changes were the exclusion of discomfort (in contrast to pain) and the more stringent frequency criteria for pain to be eligible for diagnosis of IBS (specifically, on average, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months).

Validation studies of the consensus, symptom-based criteria have identified multiple deficiencies that question the rationale for "splitting" the different syndromes and favor a simpler identification of the classical symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating, with the exclusion of alarm symptoms. Advances in the identification of actionable biomarkers related to symptoms suggestive of functional gastrointestinal disorders have the potential to usher a change in practice from positive diagnosis of symptom complexes followed by empirical treatment to identification of the mechanisms causing the symptoms and targeted therapy.

### Causes, symptoms and prevention of food allergy [^116nhCQP]. Postepy dermatologii i alergologii (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on food allergy:

- **Definition**: Food allergy is an adverse food-stimulated immune response initiated on exposure to a given food.

- **Pathophysiology**: Food allergy is mostly caused by IgE-mediated antibodies (type 1 or early; 48%) and IgE-independent immune responses:
	- **IgE-independent immune responses**: Type IV (18%), type III (10%), type II (6%)
	- **Influencing factors**: Genetic and environmental factors such as improved hygiene, lifestyle, and diet and nutrition
	- **Common trigger foods**:
		- **Dairy and grains**: Milk, wheat
		- **Seafood**: Fish, shellfish
		- **Nuts and seeds**: Peanuts, nuts, seeds
		- **Fruits and legumes**: Soy, cherries, peaches, plums, apricots
		- **Others**: Eggs

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the US is estimated at 10,000 in 100,000 adults.

- **Disease course**:
	- **Immediate reaction symptoms**: Anaphylactic shock, urticaria, angioedema
	- **Late reaction symptoms**:
		- **Neurological and psychological**: Fatigue, irritability, depression, hyperactivity, insomnia, headache, poor concentration
		- **Dermatological**: Paleness, itching limbs, skin lesions
		- **Respiratory and ENT**: Asthma, colds
		- **Gastrointestinal**: Indigestion, colic, diarrhea, bloating
		- **Urological**: Involuntary bedwetting
	- **Quality of life impact**: The disease impairs quality of life, necessitating lifelong prevention of the specific food

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality risk associated with fatal anaphylaxis is less than 1%.

### Revisiting Montreal: New insights into symptoms and their causes, and implications for the future of GERD [^113QfxR8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

As highlighted in a landmark review by Savarino et al, the common practice of identifying "NERD" patients solely on the basis of typical symptoms and an absence of reflux esophagitis selects for a heterogeneous patient group. Only those where acid is implicated in symptom generation are clearly responsive to PPIs. These groups consist of those with esophageal acid exposure (true NERD), normal esophageal acid exposure but a positive SAP for acid reflux (acid hypersensitive esophagus) or non-acid reflux (non-acid hypersensitive esophagus), and those with normal esophageal acid exposure and a negative SAP for any type of reflux (functional heartburn). This new understanding is reflected in the most recent iteration of the Rome criteria (Rome IV) for functional esophageal disorders, in which the acid hypersensitive esophagus and non-acid hypersensitive esophagus groups have been combined into the new category of reflux hypersensitivity, which appears to fit somewhere between NERD and functional heartburn.

It should be noted that the SAP method was developed and validated in PPI-naive patients. In the first study to determine the utility of the SAP method in patients with PPI-refractory symptoms (in whom it is most commonly employed in the clinic), it was determined that at reflux rates of less than 10%, SAP values were largely determined by chance, rather than by the relationship between symptoms and reflux. The same study also found that around 70% of patients who are refractory to PPIs have a reflux rate of less than 10%.
