## Question

How to differentiate in an acute hyponatremic patient if it was acute hyponatremia or chronic undiagnosed hyponatremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate between acute and chronic hyponatremia in a patient who presents with low sodium, and what to do when the duration of hyponatremia is unclear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition and why duration matters pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify what history and prior labs can establish acuity. Next, I will examine symptom patterns and their limitations. After that, I need to check which laboratory clues can support acuity. Then, I should review the diagnostic approach when duration remains unknown and how that changes management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and double-check monitoring and correction targets to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

> Let me first confirm the definitions and why they matter. Acute hyponatremia is typically defined as onset within 48 hours, whereas chronic hyponatremia is present for more than 48 hours; when duration cannot be determined, guidelines advise assuming chronic because the brain has likely adapted and is at risk for ODS if sodium is corrected too quickly [^114RsQLR] [^116SLGfd].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I anchor on symptoms. In acute hyponatremia, brain cells swell due to water influx and patients are prone to cerebral edema and encephalopathy. In chronic hyponatremia, adaptive solute egress reduces brain swelling, so symptoms may be milder at the same sodium level, but overly rapid correction can outpace osmolyte restoration and precipitate ODS, which is why correction limits differ by chronicity [^112q1gbT] [^116SLGfd].

> I will now examine the history and prior sodium measurements, because this is the most reliable way to establish acuity. If there is a documented normal sodium within the prior 24–48 hours, that strongly supports acute hyponatremia. Conversely, prior records showing low sodium over days to weeks support chronicity, and in the absence of reliable prior data, guidelines default to chronic for safety [^114RsQLR] [^116SLGfd] [^116cKhyo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from symptoms alone. Severe symptoms such as seizures, vomiting, or altered consciousness are more common with acute hyponatremia due to cerebral edema, but patients with chronic hyponatremia can still present with seizures or coma, and conversely, acute drops to modestly low levels can be highly symptomatic; thus, symptom severity alone cannot reliably distinguish acute from chronic, though it does inform urgency of therapy [^116SLGfd] [^111fLWER] [^111eBTiG].

> Next, I should review laboratory clues that can tilt the pretest probability toward acute or chronic. Low serum urea and uric acid with increased fractional excretions of urea and uric acid, along with very high urine osmolality, can suggest acute water retention and SIADH physiology; however, these are supportive rather than definitive, and I need to ensure I interpret them alongside clinical context and medication review, especially thiazides, SSRIs, and antiepileptics that predispose to SIADH [^112BuaCU] [^116SLGfd] [^1167hT4n].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach when duration is uncertain, because this is common in the ED. I should confirm hypotonicity with measured serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, exclude pseudohyponatremia and hyperglycemia, assess volume status clinically, and obtain urine sodium and urine osmolality; if urine osmolality is greater than 100 mOsm/kg, urine sodium helps distinguish hypovolemic from euvolemic or hypervolemic states, but none of these directly proves acuity, so I must default to chronic assumptions for correction targets if duration remains unknown [^111ABycK] [^1122iXCQ] [^112g3Tem] [^113k4sy9] [^114RsQLR].

> I need to ensure the management plan aligns with the presumed chronicity when uncertain. For severe symptoms, I should treat emergently with 3% hypertonic saline boluses to raise sodium by about 4–6 mmol/L rapidly to mitigate cerebral edema, then slow the pace of correction to no more than 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours if chronic or unknown duration is likely. For moderate symptoms, a single bolus with close monitoring is reasonable. For mild symptoms or asymptomatic cases, slower correction with fluid restriction, isotonic saline if hypovolemic, or cause-specific therapy is appropriate, with vigilant sodium checks to avoid overcorrection [^116Rry73] [^111tDN7n] [^112sZjn1] [^111czwib] [^111yoz7p].

> But wait, what if I overcorrect and risk ODS? I should double-check for overcorrection early and be prepared to relower sodium using desmopressin and hypotonic fluid, typically 5% dextrose, to bring the 24-hour rise back under the safe target; this is especially critical in patients with additional ODS risk factors such as alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, liver disease, or very low starting sodium [^112sZjn1] [^113aETX4] [^115pq4RC] [^111tDN7n].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. If there is clear documentation of normal sodium within 24–48 hours, treat as acute with rapid initial correction and broader daily targets. If there is no reliable prior normal sodium, assume chronic and cap correction at 8–10 mmol/L per 24 hours, using lower targets in high-risk patients. If symptoms are severe, prioritize life-saving hypertonic therapy first and adjust the ongoing correction rate once the initial increment is achieved and symptoms improve [^114RsQLR] [^111tDN7n] [^116cKhyo].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence to keep the patient safe. During active correction with hypertonic saline, check serum sodium every 4–6 hours initially, then every 6 hours once stable; after any intervention that could precipitate rapid change, such as stopping vasopressin antagonists or administering isotonic saline in hypovolemic hyponatremia, I need to increase the frequency and anticipate the need to clamp or relower if the rise is too fast [^114jzD4z] [^114Mqs3L] [^111czwib].

> In summary, I need to integrate prior sodium values, the tempo of symptom evolution, and supportive laboratory patterns to infer acuity. When in doubt, assume chronic to protect against ODS, treat severe symptoms urgently with hypertonic saline, and then correct slowly with close monitoring and a plan to relower if overcorrection occurs [^114RsQLR] [^116SLGfd] [^111fLWER].

In the emergency department, distinguish acute from chronic hyponatremia by **onset within 48 hours** [^114RsQLR] (acute) versus **longer than 48 hours or unknown** (chronic) using history, prior sodium values, and symptom severity [^112Hzt6J]. Acute hyponatremia typically presents with **severe neurologic symptoms** (seizures, coma) and minimal cerebral adaptation, whereas chronic hyponatremia has milder symptoms (confusion, gait instability) due to brain adaptation [^112q1gbT] [^115bV1Sk]. If onset is unclear, **assume chronic** to avoid rapid overcorrection and osmotic demyelination [^114RsQLR] [^113aETX4]. Use hypertonic saline for acute symptomatic cases [^116Rry73] and correct chronic hyponatremia slowly (≤ 8–10 mmol/L/24 h) with close monitoring [^114zYH9K] [^117DP8jL].

---

## Clinical definitions and pathophysiology

Hyponatremia is defined as **serum sodium < 135 mmol/L** [^111fLWER] and is classified by duration and symptom severity [^114RsQLR] [^114hpGSU]:

| **Category** | **Duration** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute | < 48 hours | - Severe neurologic symptoms (seizures, coma) <br/> - Minimal cerebral adaptation [^112q1gbT] |
| Chronic | ≥ 48 hours or unknown | - Milder symptoms (confusion, gait instability) <br/> - Significant cerebral adaptation [^112q1gbT] |

---

Acute hyponatremia causes rapid water influx into the brain, leading to cerebral edema and severe neurologic symptoms [^114CGH5U]. Chronic hyponatremia triggers adaptive solute loss, reducing cerebral edema but increasing the risk of osmotic demyelination if corrected too quickly [^112q1gbT] [^113aETX4].

---

## Clinical features and symptom severity

Symptom severity correlates with the **rapidity of sodium decline** [^1169CfKA]:

- **Acute hyponatremia**: Severe symptoms (seizures, coma, respiratory arrest) are common due to cerebral edema [^112q1gbT].
- **Chronic hyponatremia**: Milder symptoms (confusion, nausea, gait instability, falls) reflect cerebral adaptation [^1169CfKA].

---

## Diagnostic approach in the emergency department

A structured approach is essential to **differentiate acute from chronic hyponatremia**:

---

### History and clinical assessment

- **Onset and duration**: Determine if symptoms started within 48 hours (acute) or longer (chronic) [^114RsQLR].
- **Prior sodium levels**: Review recent labs; a recent normal sodium supports acute onset [^116cKhyo].
- **Symptom severity**: Severe neurologic symptoms favor acute hyponatremia [^112q1gbT].
- **Medication and fluid intake**: Identify diuretics, SSRIs, antiepileptics, or excessive water intake [^1167hT4n].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Serum sodium**: Confirm hypotonic hyponatremia (< 135 mmol/L) [^1169CfKA].
- **Serum osmolality**: Low (< 275 mOsm/kg) indicates true hypotonic hyponatremia [^111ABycK].
- **Urine osmolality and sodium**: Help differentiate SIADH, hypovolemic, and hypervolemic states [^114Kd17F].
- **Thyroid and adrenal function**: Rule out endocrine causes (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency) [^111fLWER].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **duration-based classification** and cautious correction:

- **Acute hyponatremia**: Treat severe symptoms with hypertonic saline (100 mL 3% NaCl bolus, repeat up to three times) [^111yoz7p] [^111tDN7n].
- **Chronic hyponatremia**: Correct slowly (≤ 8–10 mmol/L/24 h) to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114zYH9K] [^111tDN7n].
- **Unknown duration**: Assume chronic and correct conservatively [^114RsQLR] [^115CxKiL].

---

## Risks and complications of misclassification

Misclassification can cause significant harm: acute hyponatremia managed too slowly risks **persistent cerebral edema and neurologic injury**, whereas overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia risks **osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)** — a potentially irreversible neurologic injury [^111WX8Kf] [^113aETX4].

---

## Practical clinical approach

A practical approach includes:

- **Initial assessment**: Rapidly assess symptom severity, history, and prior sodium levels [^112Hzt6J].
- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain serum sodium, osmolality, urine sodium, and osmolality [^114Kd17F].
- **Classification**: Classify as acute (< 48 h), chronic (> 48 h), or unknown duration [^114RsQLR].
- **Treatment**: Use hypertonic saline for acute symptomatic cases; correct chronic cases slowly with close monitoring [^116Rry73] [^112sZjn1].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent sodium checks and neurologic assessments during correction [^111yoz7p].

---

## Conclusion

In the emergency department, **differentiate acute from chronic hyponatremia** by onset, prior sodium values, and symptom severity. When onset is unclear, assume chronic to avoid rapid overcorrection and osmotic demyelination. Use hypertonic saline for acute symptomatic cases and correct chronic hyponatremia slowly with close monitoring.

Clinical Signs and Symptoms Most patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic. Symptoms do not usually appear until the plasma sodium level drops below 120 mEq per L and usually are nonspecific. 11 In cases of severe hyponatremia, neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms predominate. 3 The risk of seizures and coma increases as the sodium level decreases. The development of clinical signs and symptoms also depends on the rapidity with which the plasma sodium level decreases. In the event of a rapid decrease, the patient can be symptomatic even with a plasma sodium level above 120 mEq per L. Poor prognostic factors for severe hyponatremia in hospitalized patients include the presence of symptoms, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
12. Diagnostic Strategy Figure 1 13 shows an algorithm for the assessment of hyponatremia.

The identification of hyponatremia must be followed by a clinical assessment of the patient, beginning with a targeted history to elicit the symptoms of hyponatremia and exclude important causes such as congestive heart failure, liver or renal impairment, malignancy, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, gastrointestinal losses, psychiatric illness, recent drug ingestion, surgery, or reception of intravenous fluids. HYPERVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in the presence of edema indicates increased total body sodium and water. This increase in total body water is greater than the total body sodium level, resulting in edema. The three main causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia are congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal diseases such as renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. These disorders usually are obvious from the clinical history and physical examination alone.

EUVOLEMIC AND HYPOVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in a volume-depleted patient is caused by a deficit in total body sodium and total body water, with a disproportionately greater sodium loss, whereas in euvolemic hyponatremia, the total body sodium level is normal or near normal. Differentiating between hypovolemia and euvolemia may be clinically difficult, especially if the classic features of volume depletion such as postural hypotension and tachycardia are absent. 15 showed an increased BUN-to-creatinine ratio in only 68 percent of hypovolemic patients. Two useful aids for evaluating euvolemic or hypovolemic patients are measurement of plasma osmolality and urinary sodium concentration. Plasma osmolality testing places the patient into one of three categories, normal, high, or low plasma osmolality, while urinary sodium concentration testing is used to refine the diagnosis in patients who have a low plasma osmolality.

These large molecules do not contribute to plasma osmolality, resulting in a state in which the relative sodium concentration is decreased, but the overall osmolality remains unchanged. Severe hypertriglyceridemia and hyperproteinemia are two causes of this condition in patients with pseudohyponatremia. These patients usually are euvolemic. INCREASED PLASMA OSMOLALITY Increased plasma osmolality in a patient with hyponatremia is caused by severe hyperglycemia, such as that occurring with diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. It is caused by the presence of glucose molecules that exert an osmotic force and draw water from the intracellular compartment into the plasma, with a diluting effect. Osmotic diuresis from glucose then results in hypovolemia. Fortunately, hyperglycemia can be diagnosed easily by measuring the bedside capillary blood glucose level. Endocrine disorders are uncommon causes of hyponatremia.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^117T26KB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality encountered in clinical practice; despite this, the work-up and management of hyponatraemia remain suboptimal and varies among different specialist groups. The majority of data comparing hyponatraemia treatments have been observational, up until recently. The past two years have seen the publication of several randomised control trials investigating hyponatraemia treatments, both for chronic and acute hyponatraemia. In this article, we aim to provide a background to the physiology, cause and impact of hyponatraemia and summarise the most recent data on treatments for acute and chronic hyponatraemia, highlighting their efficacy, tolerability and adverse effects.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^116sgW5L]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with stroke and associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality risk. The present review presents the underlying causes and provides a thorough algorithm for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in stroke patients. Concomitant diseases and therapies, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, along with diuretics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors are the most common causes of hyponatraemia in community. In the setting of acute stroke, the emergence of hyponatraemia might be attributed to the administration of hypotonic solutions and drugs (ie. mannitol and antiepileptics), poor solute intake, infections, as well as stroke-related conditions or complications, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, cerebral salt wasting syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatraemia, usually caused by hyperglycaemia or recent mannitol administration in patients with stroke. Determining urine osmolality, urine sodium level and volume status are the following steps in the differentiation of hypotonic hyponatraemia. Of note, specific parameters, such as fractional uric acid and urea excretion, along with plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic yield. Therapeutic options are based on the duration and symptoms of hyponatremia. In the case of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline administration is recommended. Hypovolaemic chronic hyponatremia is treated with isotonic solution administration. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for the rest forms of chronic hyponatraemia, therapies increasing renal free water excretion may be necessary. Loop diuretics and urea serve this purpose in patients with stroke, whereas sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors appear to be a promising therapy. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the appropriate restoration of sodium level improves outcomes in such patients. Randomized trials designed to compare therapeutic strategies in managing hyponatraemia in patients with stroke are required.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114Kd17F]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains.

The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^1167hT4n]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

SIAD

SIAD is a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterised by inappropriate urinary concentration and reduced free water excretion, in the setting of euvolaemic hyponatraemia. Schwartz & Bartter in 1957 reported the first cases of SIAD in two patients with small-cell lung cancer and proposed the diagnostic criteria for the condition (Table 2). Although the vast majority of cases of SIAD are caused by inappropriately increased plasma AVP concentrations, a small minority of cases of SIAD result from a nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis which occur due to gain of function mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor located in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney.

Table 2.
Diagnostic criteria for SIAD.

SIAD has been reported in a wide variety of medical conditions, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders, pulmonary disorders and malignancies. Medications account for 8–27% of cases of SIAD in hospital inpatients, and an even greater proportion in elderly cohorts. Commonly implicated drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, phenothiazine antipsychotics, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, chemotherapeutic agents particularly vincristine and cyclophosphamide, opioid analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

Ascertainment of the key diagnostic parameters for SIAD in routine clinical practice has invariably been poor. The international hyponatraemia registry confirmed only 47% of physician diagnosed SIAD had appropriately confirmed the diagnosis with plasma and urine osmolality and urine sodium measurements, and only 27% had excluded adrenal insufficiency and/or thyroid disease. The failure to make a correct diagnosis can potentially negatively impact patient outcomes.

A key differential in the diagnosis of SIAD is ACTH deficiency, as it presents with a similar biochemical picture. Mechanisms accounting for the development of hyponatraemia in adrenal insufficiency include elevated vasopressin even in the presence of plasma hypo-osmolality and impaired renal water handling in the absence of circulating free cortisol. In a recent prospective series, with full ascertainment of the minimum diagnostic criteria for SIAD in 83% of cases, Cuesta et al. showed that 3.8% of patients presenting with euvolaemic hyponatraemia to our institution had adrenal insufficiency. ACTH deficiency should be particularly suspected in patients who develop hyponatraemia after neurosurgical conditions or withdrawal of long-term glucocorticoid treatment.

Cause of hyponatraemia

Hyponatraemia should be initially classified by extracellular volume status into hypovolaemic, euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia(Table 1). This is a clinical approach, based on signs which are not completely sensitive or specific, and some acumen is required for accurate classification. A clinical diagnosis of hypovolaemia can be made on the basis of orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor, together with laboratory clues such as raised urea to creatinine ratio, elevated uric acid concentration and urinary sodium concentration < 20 mmol/L. A definitive diagnosis is not always possible at the time of presentation – for instance the distinction between euvolaemia and mild hypovolaemia is sometimes difficult to make on clinical groundsand in this scenario the US guidelines recommend a therapeutic trial of isotonic saline with close monitoring of pNa response. Despite it's limitations, categorising patients according to ECF volume status and urine electrolyte excretion does allow the initiation of cause-specific investigations and treatment. This approach to classification also has implications for prognosis, as there is good evidence from recent data that outcomes vary according to volume status, with significantly higher mortality rates in hypervolaemic and hypovolaemic hyponatraemia, compared with SIAD.

Table 1.
Classification of hyponatraemia based on volume status and urinary sodium concentration.

It is important to exclude pseudohyponatraemia which occurs if the blood sample is lipemic or has a high concentration of immunoglobulins such as in patients with myeloma; the problem is largely seen where flame photometry is used for the measurement of electrolytes and is not seen with ion selective electrode measurements. In addition, hyperglycaemia lowers plasma sodium concentration, which needs no action other than lowering of blood glucose concentration. A discrepancy between measured serum osmolality and calculated osmolality raises the possibility of pseudohyponatraemia.

### Transient seizure-induced sodium increase camouflaging a symptomatic hyponatremia [^114CGH5U]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Hyponatremia is a disturbance of fluid and electrolytes in which there is a relative excess of body fluid water compared with body sodium content. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L and is the most commonly observed electrolyte disturbance in clinical medicine with a reported prevalence of 4% in the adult internal medicine patient population treated in the emergency department and up to 30% in hospitalised patients. Hyponatremia has a variety of etiologies and is most commonly caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, the use of thiazide diuretics, congestive heart failure, severe vomiting and diarrhoea or polydipsia. Symptoms are often mild and non-specific like headache, nausea and confusion but can be severe and life-threatening with cardiorespiratory distress, seizures and coma. Severe symptoms are more commonly seen in cases of acute hyponatremia but also chronic hyponatremia in apparently asymptomatic patients must be considered a serious illness as it is associated with an marked increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. Although rare, encephalopathy is the most serious complication of acute hyponatremia. It is the result of cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure caused by the osmotically driven movement of water into brain cells after the extracellular compartment has become hypoosmolar in a relative short period of time (< 48 hours). Left untreated hyponatremic encephalopathy could result in neurological deterioration or death.

### Utility and limitations of the traditional diagnostic approach to hyponatremia: a diagnostic study [^1148TKvF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia is often challenging because of its association with multiple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diseases, and treatment options. Several algorithms are available to guide the diagnostic approach to hyponatremia, but their diagnostic and clinical utility has never been evaluated. We aimed to assess in detail the diagnostic utility as well as the limitations of the existing approaches to hyponatremia.

Methods

Each of the 121 consecutive subjects presenting with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmoL/L) underwent 3 different and independent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches: inexperienced doctor applying an established Algorithm, intensive care senior physicians acting as Senior Physician, and senior endocrinologist serving as Reference Standard.

Results

The overall diagnostic agreement between Algorithm and Reference Standard was 71% (respective Cohen's kappa and delta values were 0.64 and 0.70), the overall diagnostic agreement between Senior Physician and Reference Standard was 32% (0.20 and 0.19, respectively). Regarding the therapeutic consequences, the diagnostic accuracy of the Algorithm was 86% (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and of the Senior Physician was 48% (0.01 and 0.04, respectively). In retrospect, by disregarding the patient's extracellular fluid volume and assessing the effective arterial blood volume by determination of the fractional urate excretion, the Algorithm improved its diagnostic accuracy to 95%.

Conclusion

Although the Algorithm performed reasonably well, several shortcomings became apparent, rendering it difficult to apply the Algorithm without reservation. Whether some modifications may enhance its diagnostic accuracy and simplify the management of hyponatremia needs to be determined.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

It is also possible to have dual pathology, hence an exception to the aforementioned classifications can occur in hypotonic hyponatremia with concurrent raised ineffective osmoles (eg, acute alcohol intoxication), which can lead to a measured osmolality that is normal or even elevated despite the hypotonic hyponatremia.

In this review, the term hyponatremia will refer to hypotonic hyponatremia unless otherwise stated.

Categorization of hypotonic hyponatremia varies, and usually considers both clinical symptoms and the absolute pNa concentration. Biochemically, European guidelines classify hyponatremia as mild (pNa 130–135 mmol/L), moderate (125–129 mmol/L), or profound (< 125 mmol/L). "Severe" hyponatremia is defined by the presence of symptoms or signs of cerebral edema including vomiting, seizures, cardiorespiratory manifestations of raised ICP, decreased conscious state or coma (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] < 8), and warrants emergency treatment (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia" and "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). US expert panel guidelines use the term severe more broadly to indicate serum sodium levels less than 125 mmol/L. To maintain the distinction of symptomatic severity, we use the European definitions in this review.

Another important categorization is acute vs chronic hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia is often defined as duration less than 48 hours, whereas chronic hyponatremia is defined as duration greater than 48 hours, and for practical reasons also includes cases where duration cannot be determined. The biochemical basis for this classification is in the time taken for cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia, via the export or deactivation of intracellular effective osmoles (Fig. 3). Those with chronic hyponatremia are vulnerable to rapid correction of pNa if it outpaces the speed that intracellular osmolality can be restored. A critical consideration in the management of moderate or profound hyponatremia that is chronic, or of unknown duration, is the need to avoid excessively rapid correction of serum sodium — which can lead to ODS and permanent neurological disability or death (see "Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome").

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117M8SDu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size of 56 patients. Some patients with chronic profound hyponatremia may have been admitted to the general ward and treated by general physicians, without the involvement of nephrologists. Second, the definition of overcorrection varies among studies. Finally, we ourselves designed the algorithm used in hyponatremia treatment. The protocol basically complied with international guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia, although we did employ an exceptionally aggressive strategy involving continuous administration of 3% hypertonic saline in some situations to avoid under-treatment. In addition, the purpose of this standardized algorithm was not to recommend our treatment protocol to other institutions, but to make our results comparable to other studies. The appropriateness of applying diagnostic algorithms to treat hyponatremia remains to be studied, and physiology-based treatment must always be kept in mind. Our data should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^111yoz7p]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The European guidelines recommend the administration of 150 mL of hypertonic saline over a period of 20 minutes, at which point a repeat plasma sodium measurement is taken, and another infusion of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline commenced; this can be repeated twice or until a rise in pNa of 5 mmol/L is achieved. If hyponatraemia is presenting with moderate symptoms, then a once off bolus of 150 mL hypertonic saline can be administered. The US guidelines differ slightly; in symptomatically severe hyponatraemia they recommend 100 mL bolus hypertonic saline over 10 minutes to be repeated up to twice more. In patients with moderate symptoms of hyponatraemia, the US guidelines recommended a continuous slow infusion of 3% normal saline at a rate of 0.5–2 ml/kg per hour. Patients should be in a monitored environment, with close supervision of neurological status, urine output and pNa.

- speed of increase in serum sodium concentration

- history of alcohol abuse and/or liver disease

- use of thiazide or antidepressant medications.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112sZjn1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Management of hyponatremia… [^1116d6Sk]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Acute or symptomatic hyponatremia can lead to significant rates of morbidity and mortality. 5–7 Mortality rates as high as 17. 9 percent have been quoted, but rates this extreme usually occur in the context of hospitalized patients. 8 Morbidity also can result from rapid correction of hyponatremia. 9, 10 Because there are many causes of hyponatremia and the treatment differs according to the cause, a logical and efficient approach to the evaluation and management of patients with hyponatremia is imperative. Clinical Signs and Symptoms Most patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic. Symptoms do not usually appear until the plasma sodium level drops below 120 mEq per L and usually are nonspecific. 11 In cases of severe hyponatremia, neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms predominate. 3 The risk of seizures and coma increases as the sodium level decreases.

The development of clinical signs and symptoms also depends on the rapidity with which the plasma sodium level decreases. In the event of a rapid decrease, the patient can be symptomatic even with a plasma sodium level above 120 mEq per L. Poor prognostic factors for severe hyponatremia in hospitalized patients include the presence of symptoms, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
12. Diagnostic Strategy Figure 1 13 shows an algorithm for the assessment of hyponatremia. The identification of hyponatremia must be followed by a clinical assessment of the patient, beginning with a targeted history to elicit the symptoms of hyponatremia and exclude important causes such as congestive heart failure, liver or renal impairment, malignancy, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, gastrointestinal losses, psychiatric illness, recent drug ingestion, surgery, or reception of intravenous fluids.

HYPERVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in the presence of edema indicates increased total body sodium and water. This increase in total body water is greater than the total body sodium level, resulting in edema. The three main causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia are congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal diseases such as renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. These disorders usually are obvious from the clinical history and physical examination alone. EUVOLEMIC AND HYPOVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in a volume-depleted patient is caused by a deficit in total body sodium and total body water, with a disproportionately greater sodium loss, whereas in euvolemic hyponatremia, the total body sodium level is normal or near normal. Differentiating between hypovolemia and euvolemia may be clinically difficult, especially if the classic features of volume depletion such as postural hypotension and tachycardia are absent.

15 showed an increased BUN-to-creatinine ratio in only 68 percent of hypovolemic patients. Two useful aids for evaluating euvolemic or hypovolemic patients are measurement of plasma osmolality and urinary sodium concentration. Plasma osmolality testing places the patient into one of three categories, normal, high, or low plasma osmolality, while urinary sodium concentration testing is used to refine the diagnosis in patients who have a low plasma osmolality. These large molecules do not contribute to plasma osmolality, resulting in a state in which the relative sodium concentration is decreased, but the overall osmolality remains unchanged. Severe hypertriglyceridemia and hyperproteinemia are two causes of this condition in patients with pseudohyponatremia. These patients usually are euvolemic.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Symptoms and characteristics of individuals with profound hyponatremia: a prospective multicenter observational study [^111eBTiG]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess symptoms and characteristics of hyponatremia, the most common electrolyte disturbance in hospitalized individuals and a condition that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

Design

Prospective observational multicenter study.

Setting

Two Swiss academic centers.

Participants

Individuals with profound hypoosmolar hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L) (N = 298).

Measurements

All symptoms and complete medical history including current medications, therapy management, and in-hospital outcomes were recorded.

Results

The median age of all participants was 71 (interquartile range (IQR) 60–80), 195 (65%) were female, and mean serum sodium value on admission was 120 mmol/L (IQR 116–123 mmol/L). Frequent clinical symptoms were nausea (n = 130, 44%), acute vomiting (n = 91, 30%), generalized weakness (n = 205, 69%), fatigue (n = 175, 59%), gait disturbance (n = 92, 31%), recurrent falls (n = 47, 16%), and acute falls (n = 60, 20%). Fractures were reported in 11 participants (4%). More-severe symptoms such as acute epileptic seizures and focal neurological deficits were identified in 16 (5%) and 17 (5%) participants, respectively. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n = 199, 67%), congestive heart failure (n = 44, 15%), chronic renal failure (n = 64, 21%), pulmonary disease (82, 28%), and central nervous system disease (n = 114, 38%). During hospitalization, 12 (4%) participants died, and 103 (35%) needed treatment in the intensive care unit.

Conclusion

A wide spectrum of symptoms accompanies profound hyponatremia. Most participants had moderate symptoms mirroring chronic hyponatremia with brain cell adaptation. Participants with profound hyponatremia had several comorbidities.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L, is frequently encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department. Symptoms are often unspecific and include a recent history of falls, weakness and vertigo. Common causes of hyponatremia include diuretics, heart failure as well as Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis (SIAD) and correct diagnosis can be challenging. Emergency treatment of hyponatremia should be guided by presence of symptoms and focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic hyponatremia.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

Figure 7.
Principles of management of acute vs chronic hyponatremia, and potential risks. Intensity of shading is a visual representation of osmolality. In acute hyponatremia, cerebral osmolar adaptation has not yet occurred so it is acceptable to allow (or induce) rapid correction of serum sodium, with low risk of ODS. We advocate a cutoff of hyponatremia duration less than 24 hours rather than 48 hours to maximize the safety of this approach. In hyponatremia with severe symptoms of any (or unknown) duration, emergency management with bolus hypertonic saline is indicated to prevent progression of potentially life-threatening cerebral edema (see "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). Once the target initial increment of serum sodium rise is achieved (eg, 4–6 mmol/L) and/or if symptoms improve, ongoing correction is determined by duration of hyponatremia. If duration is unknown, it is safest to assume it to be chronic and aim for gradual correction. In chronic hyponatremia, gradual correction of serum sodium allows for restoration of brain tissue osmolality toward the normal range with the import or synthesis of osmolytes (sodium, potassium, organic osmolytes as discussed in Fig. 3), and slow exit of excess intracellular water. The typical target rate of correction is 5 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours, or lower for those with risk factors for ODS. If rapid correction of serum sodium above the target rate occurs (overcorrection, eg, > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours), it is advised to relower serum sodium (eg, with IV dextrose 5%, and/or desmopressin (DDAVP), see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium" below) to prevent the rare complication of ODS. ODS can occur as a consequence of rapid exit of intracellular water damaging the myelin sheath, particularly in the pons, and can cause devastating neurological outcomes or death. Onset of symptoms of ODS is often delayed. Subsequent correction after relowering should be gradual.

### Hyponatremia in patients with infectious diseases [^112KbL7m]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disturbance associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Hyponatremia may not infrequently be present during the course of an infection, does not cause specific symptoms and may be overlooked by clinicians. Nonetheless, it may reflect the severity of the underlying process. This review focuses on the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of hyponatremia associated with infectious diseases. In the majority of cases, the fall in serum sodium concentration is of multifactorial origin owing to increased secretion of the anti-diuretic hormone either appropriately or inappropriately. Inadvertent administration of fluids may worsen hyponatremia and prolong morbidity.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114XPSRV]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Calculation of summary scores for each domain across reviewers required summing up all the scores of the individual items in a domain for each reviewer and then standardizing this total as a percentage of the maximum possible score for that domain. In doing so, the originally semi-qualitative Likert scale was converted to a quantitative score. This may have introduced numeric differences between the guidance documents that were beyond the discriminatory ability of the tool and possibly negligible in practice. Finally, we acknowledge that four of the authors of this paper also authored one of the guidelines included in this review. Although we aimed to judge all guidance documents fairly against the criteria outlined by the AGREE instrument, we cannot rule out that a subconscious intellectual competing interest unduly influenced the scoring.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Risk of adverse clinical outcomes in hyponatremic adult patients hospitalized for acute medical conditions: a population-based cohort study [^1173JybT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

We found robust results in almost 5600 SIAD patients, leading to an alternative, more hypothetical explanation that (over-)production of the antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) during acute medical conditions might be an appropriate sign of immediate hormonal response. It is well established that various stressors activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increasing vasopressin secretion. Thus, hyponatremia may simply be a marker for high levels of a stress hormone to maintain blood pressure and preserve fluid volume, an evolutionary advantage in "flight-or-fight" situations. Therefore, we may postulate that patients showing an adequate high vasopressin response in a "stress" situation have a survival advantage compared to comparably ill patients without such a capability. However, whether the increase in antidiuretic hormones is appropriate or inappropriate warrants further elucidation.

The major strength of this study is its high external validity, which is based on the large nationwide sample comprising nearly 100 000 patients. Within this cohort, weighted analysis allowed for highly accurate estimates at the national level.

Our data must be interpreted in the context of the study design. First, a certain risk of misclassification and underreporting needs to be acknowledged because administrative data were used in our analyses and we were not able to ascertain the diagnoses. Second, in our study population, merely 2.2% of all included hospitalized medical patients were diagnosed with hyponatremia and qualified for propensity-score matching, although current evidence suggests a much higher prevalence among hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, we were able to include more than 47 000 patients into our propensity-score matched analysis of real-world data. This rather strong data basis, in conjunction with the consistency of the observed effects of hyponatremia on clinical outcome measures in this study, indicates a high degree of internal validity and generalizability. Third, the diagnosis of hyponatremia was based on ICD-10 classification in discharge reports and in some of these reports non-SIAD and SIAD causes of hyponatremia were not distinguished. Because we do not have information on clinical symptoms and severity of hyponatremia, we are unable to account for unmeasured and unmeasurable residual confounding (eg, etiology of hyponatremia, thirst perception, volume status, body mass index, smoking status).

In conclusion, there is a relevant health-care burden among hyponatremic adult patients hospitalized for acute medical conditions. Further studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms on how hyponatremia may differentially modulate clinical outcomes.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering bolus or continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline in patients with a sodium concentration of < 125 mEq/L and moderate or severe symptoms. Recognize that bolus infusion improves sodium concentration more quickly with less overcorrection.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^111tDN7n]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential Points

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting around 15% of hospitalized patients - while most are mild (≥ 130 mmol/L), 4% record plasma sodium concentration (pNa) below 130 mmol/L
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) due to excess arginine vasopressin (AVP) despite low serum tonicity, is the leading cause of nonmild hyponatremia
Severe symptomatic hyponatremia manifesting as vomiting, seizure, and reduced conscious state, is a medical emergency and urgent bolus hypertonic saline (100 mL of 3% NaCl, up to 3 doses) is indicated to achieve an initial pNa increase of 4 to 6 mmol/L, to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP)
To prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) in hyponatremia of chronic (or unknown) duration, target a pNa increase of 4 to 8 mmol/L/24 hours, and limit to 10 mmol/L/24 h (lower targets 4–6 mmol/L/24 hours for those with risk factors for ODS, eg, alcohol, malnutrition)
Fluid restriction (FR) of less than 1000 mL/day is the first-line therapy for chronic SIAD endorsed by current guidelines, but is effective in only around half of cases
Second-line therapies supported by current (limited) evidence include tolvaptan, urea, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) or high-dose salt tablets; of these, tolvaptan may be associated with the highest risk of overcorrection
If sodium correction limit is exceeded, relowering of pNa with hypotonic fluid (oral water or intravenous [IV] 5% dextrose), with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output, is indicated

### Etiology and clinical features of patients with hyponatremia in the emergency department: a cross-sectional study [^1121opW3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, affects a significant portion of the population, particularly in emergency and hospitalized settings. This study aimed to investigate the causes and clinical characteristics of hyponatremia in emergency department patients.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included 997 patients diagnosed with hyponatremia in the emergency department between June 2019 and May 2024. We investigated the causes of hyponatremia through medical interviews, blood tests, and urinalysis.

Results

We found that for every 1-year increase in age, serum sodium levels in patients with hyponatremia decreased by 0.14 mmol/L, whereas for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum uric acid, the serum sodium levels increased by 0.125 mmol/L. The leading cause of hyponatremia was the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), accounting for 357 cases (35.8%). However, a significant number of patients showed a similar diagnostic pattern to that of SIAD but were diagnosed with other conditions, such as cerebral salt wasting (31cases, 5.8%), renal salt wasting (23 cases, 3.8%), and mineralocorticoid-responsive hyponatremia of the elderly (17 cases, 1.8%). Many patients initially diagnosed with SIAD were later found to have one of these alternative conditions upon further evaluation. Fractional excretion values of phosphate and uric acid effectively distinguished SIAD from other conditions.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia in the emergency department has diverse causes, with overlapping diagnostic criteria for SIAD and related conditions, though treatment strategies vary significantly. Accurate differential diagnosis is crucial to optimizing patient outcomes. Recognizing the range of underlying causes can help clinicians improve treatment strategies for hyponatremia in emergency settings.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. – Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

Table 1
Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated, regardless of outcome. Data on 56 patients obtained from 40 medical centers confirmed that outcomes depend on the chronicity of hyponatremia, as previously defined: While none of the 18 patients with acute hyponatremia suffered complications, regardless of correction rate, 14 of 28 patients with chronic hyponatremia corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours developed post-therapeutic neurologic complications; in most, the clinical course was consistent with CPM (a delayed onset of neurologic symptoms beginning 2–6 days after initial improvement), but only three had CPM documented by imaging. The amount of correction over 48 hours was also associated with post-therapeutic complications: 14 of 27 chronic patients (52%) corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours were affected. All patients corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours had also been corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, and all but one corrected by < 12 mmol/L in 24 hours were corrected by < 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Biochemical and etiological characteristics of acute hyponatremia in the emergency department [^112BuaCU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia can be classified as acute or chronic depending on its duration, and treatment options are tailored to this classification. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate acute from chronic hyponatremia in the Emergency Department (ED). The objective of this study was to identify characteristics to help diagnose and manage acute hyponatremia in the ED. Patients with acute hyponatremia in the ED were enrolled from a retrospective 2-year chart review. Eleven patients (0.8%) were identified with acute hyponatremia out of a total of 1321 hyponatremic patients. There were nine women and two men. The mean age was 48.9 years. The mean sodium (Na(+)) level was 115 ± 4 mmol/L. Accompanying biochemical abnormalities included hypouricemia and hypouremia with increased fractional excretions of uric acid (UA) and urea. The estimated amount of water intake ranged from 2.5 to 10 liters (mean, 5.1 ± 2.3 liters) during the day before ED presentation. All patients were treated with hypertonic saline and furosemide at a correction rate of 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L/h. No patients had neurological sequelae after treatment. The causes of acute hyponatremia included induction of abortion with oxytocin (n = 1), primary polydipsia on neuroleptic agents (n = 2), polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparation for colonoscopy (n = 1), diuretic therapy for hypertension (n = 4), ecstasy use (n = 1), and weight-reducing herbal teas (n = 2). We conclude that in the right clinical setting, high free water intake and low serum urea and UA favor acute hyponatremia. A detailed drug history may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of acute hyponatremia.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^112q1gbT]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116fNs9z]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the "real world", the non-expert doctor who initially recognises and responds to severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 120 mmol/L) in a critically ill patient will often be a junior trainee working "out of routine office hours". In this emergency setting, the doctor may have limited immediate access to important additional diagnostic tests, e.g. serum and urine osmolality and urine electrolytes. Urgent treatment decisions may need to be taken to manage symptoms such as confusion and seizures, with incomplete patient history and diagnostic information. There is a general consensus that hypertonic saline is effective in the immediate management of acute symptomatic hyponatraemia but available guidelines differ on the volumes and rates of saline infusion. Ultimately, it is clinical judgement rather than adherence to a particular guideline that will determine an individual patient's treatment. Intuitive clinical algorithms, with proven efficacy, would help to encourage "best practice" in the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to severity grading (based on symptoms), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to classify hyponatremia based on the symptomatic presentation:

- **Moderate**: any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of moderate symptoms (nausea without vomiting, confusion, or headache)

- **Severe**: any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of severe symptoms (vomiting, altered level of consciousness, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress).

### Acute severe hypothyroidism is not associated with hyponatremia even with increased water intake: a prospective study in thyroid cancer patients [^116AkR9R]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that in the setting of acute severe hypothyroidism: 1) clinically-important hyponatremia is uncommon; sodium concentration may not need to be monitored unless patients have impaired renal function or are on diuretics, 2) age and female gender are associated with lower sodium concentration. Uncomplicated acute severe hypothyroidism didn't cause clinically-important hyponatremia/SIADH in this cohort of patients. The association between clinically-important hyponatremia and hypothyroidism may be restricted to chronic uncorrected hypothyroidism.

Table 1.
Summary of relevant clinical studies.

The pediatric population can potentially further our understanding, given that adults have many factors which can affect their sodium handling, including medications, variable sodium intake, and comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity. There have been case reports of hyponatremia in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism. – However, these cases were often confounded by comorbid conditions such as acute illness or brain injury. In a study of 32 neonates with congenital hypothyroidism detected on screening, there were no cases of hyponatremia and no significant changes in sodium after thyroid hormone replacement. These results suggest that hyponatremia is uncommon in patients with hypothyroidism alone.

The acute thyroid hormone withdrawal prior to radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment can result in hyponatremia and a significant decline in sodium. However, there have also been other studies in which there was a minimal change in blood sodium concentration. In a study examining 903 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer undergoing RAI, only 2.5% of patients developed hyponatremia. Among the patients who developed hyponatremia, 91.3% were mild and asymptomatic with sodium levels in the 130–135 mmol/L range. These results were corroborated in a study of 212 thyroid cancer patients in which 1.9% patients developed moderate hyponatremia (sodium ⩾120 mEq/L). These studies demonstrate that the incidence of hyponatremia prior to RAI treatment is low and mild in most cases. It could be that chronic hypothyroidism results in hyponatremia. Therefore, hyponatremia is not appreciated in patients undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal due to the acute changes in thyroid hormone levels. A variety of factors including age, preoperative serum sodium level, and history of diuretic use are risk factors for hyponatremia. In addition, the low-iodine diet that thyroid cancer patients undergo in preparation for RAI treatment can contribute to the development of hyponatremia. Therefore, the hyponatremia seen prior to RAI therapy is likely multifactorial rather than solely due to hypothyroidism.

### Hyponatremia… [^111fGejk]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia or hyponatraemia is a low concentration of sodium in the blood. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L, with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEq/L. Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe. Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma; death can ensue. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking too much water or too much beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions that can lead to falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.

Symptom severity depends on how fast and how severe the drop in blood sodium level is. A gradual drop, even to very low levels, may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks, because of neuronal adaptation. The presence of underlying neurological disease such as a seizure disorder or non-neurological metabolic abnormalities, also affects the severity of neurologic symptoms. Hyponatremia, by interfering with bone metabolism, has been linked with a doubled risk of osteoporosis and an increased risk of bone fracture. ADH then enters the bloodstream and signals the kidney to bring back sufficient solute-free water from the fluid in the kidney tubules to dilute the serum sodium back to normal, and this turns off the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. Also, thirst is stimulated.

Normally, when mild hyponatremia begins to occur, that is, the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 mEq/L, there is no secretion of ADH, and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule. Hyponatremia Hyponatremia occurs 1) when the hypothalamic-kidney feedback loop is overwhelmed by increased fluid intake, 2) the feedback loop malfunctions such that ADH is always "turned on", 3) the receptors in the kidney are always "open" regardless of there being no signal from ADH to be open; or 4) there is an increased ADH even though there is no normal stimulus for ADH to be increased. Hyponatremia occurs in one of two ways: either the osmoreceptor-aquaporin feedback loop is overwhelmed, or it is interrupted. If it is interrupted, it is either related or not related to ADH.

If the feedback system is overwhelmed, this is water intoxication with maximally dilute urine and is caused by 1) pathological water drinking, 2) beer potomania, 3) overzealous intravenous solute free water infusion, or 4) infantile water intoxication. Diagnosis The history, physical exam, and laboratory testing are required to determine the underlying cause of hyponatremia. A blood test demonstrating a serum sodium less than 135 mmol/L is diagnostic for hyponatremia. The history and physical exam are necessary to help determine if the person is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic, which has important implications in determining the underlying cause. An assessment is also made to determine if the person is experiencing symptoms from their hyponatremia. These include assessments of alertness, concentration, and orientation.

### Consequences of inadequate management of hyponatremia [^1126XXxi]. American Journal of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Dilutional hyponatremia is a commonly observed disorder in hospitalized patients. It represents an excess of water in relation to prevailing sodium stores and is most often associated with a high plasma level of arginine vasopressin, including that found in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia may be classified as either acute or chronic depending on the rate of decline of serum sodium concentration, and can lead to a wide range of deleterious changes involving almost all body systems. Serious complications of dilutional hyponatremia most frequently involve the central nervous system. In fact, acute severe hyponatremia is potentially life-threatening and must be treated promptly and aggressively. Chronic hyponatremia often develops in patients with nonrenal diseases and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure, hyponatremia is linked to a poor prognosis and increased length of hospital stay. Prompt recognition and optimal management of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients may reduce in-hospital mortality and symptom severity, allow for less intensive hospital care, decrease the duration of hospitalization and associated costs, and improve the treatment of underlying comorbid conditions and patients' quality of life. The proper treatment of dilutional hyponatremia, especially when chronic, must avoid increasing serum sodium too rapidly, which can lead to permanent or fatal neurologic sequelae. The treatment of hyponatremia may be facilitated by emerging therapies that block the actions of arginine vasopressin at V2 and V1a receptors to promote aquaresis, the electrolyte-sparing elimination of free water, and elevate serum sodium concentrations.

### Interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia [^11534PiV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect. Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent. Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner.

Historical Background

In the early 1980s, studies in experimental animals found that rapid correction of hyponatremia could induce brain lesions similar to those found in patients with central pontine myelinolysis (often referred to by its abbreviated name, CPM). These findings sparked a clinical controversy. Prominent experts at the time asserted that rapid correction of severe hyponatremia was needed for survival, that CPM was extremely rare and occurs in patients who were never hyponatremic, and that animal models and case reports in humans were flawed because brain lesions were found outside the pons and only after extremely large, rapid increases in serum sodium, often resulting in hypernatremia. Neurologic sequelae in patients with hyponatremia were attributed to hypoxia instead of a complication of therapy.

In 1986, the term "osmotic demyelination syndrome" (often referred to by its abbreviated name, ODS) was introduced. Reporting on the course of eight patients who had developed clinical features of CPM after correction of severe hyponatremia (sodium ≤ 115 mmol/L and ≤ 105 mmol/L in four of the eight patients) by > 12 mmol/L per day, the article suggested that neurologic complications of severe hyponatremia should be described in clinical rather than anatomical terms. The patients exhibited a stereotypical course characterized by gradual neurologic deterioration, with clinical features suggestive of CPM, beginning 3–6 days after partial or complete correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia. The clinical course was often biphasic: initial improvement in hyponatremic symptoms followed by a delayed onset of new neurologic findings. Because initial brain images were often negative, they were deemed confirmatory rather than essential for the diagnosis. A literature review of patients with sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L found that over half of those corrected by > 12 mmol/L per day had developed neurologic complications after vigorous therapy — often after initially presenting with limited symptoms; half of those had CPM documented by imaging or autopsy, while in most of the others, CPM had been diagnosed clinically. By contrast, all 13 cases with sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been corrected by < 12 mmol/L per day recovered uneventfully.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

2022. 11176 Importance. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures.

In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7. 4 years. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects.

Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Hyponatremia: mechanisms and newer treatments [^115XRMHU]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the neural and renal mechanisms of osmotic homeostasis, provide a rationale for the sensitivity of the central nervous system to hyponatremia, and outline modern approaches to therapy of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Methods

Review of relevant literature with focus on physiologic mechanisms.

Results

With careful monitoring, acute hyponatremia can be managed, while minimizing risks both of continued hyponatremia and the osmotic demyelination that can occur with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia due to disorders of volume regulation (congestive heart failure or cirrhosis) or to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release can be managed effectively with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, but there is no evidence that controlling the hyponatremia enhances survival associated with the underlying diseases.

Conclusions

Therapy in the acute setting balances the risk of the osmotic disturbance with the risk of overly rapid correction. The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan has enhanced our ability to improve chronic hyponatremia in conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116cKhyo]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical and symptomatic severity are not always well correlated, as patients with chronic hyponatremia may have very low serum sodium concentrations with minimal symptoms due to cerebral adaptation, yet patients with an acute precipitous fall in serum sodium, even to concentrations above 120 mmol/L, may present with severe symptoms. The presence of severe symptoms should prompt treatment with careful bolus hypertonic saline aiming for an increment in serum sodium of 4 to 6 mmol, based on clinical improvements seen in published cases. There is clinical evidence to support a 50% reduction in ICP with a pNa increase of this magnitude. A retrospective observational study of 68 patients with transtentorial herniation due to cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, or tumor but with normal serum sodium concentration (mean pNa 140 mmol/L), were administered a small, 30- to 60-mL bolus of very concentrated hypertonic saline (NaCl 23.4%, equivalent Na + to 240 mL of 3% NaCl). ICP reduced from 23 to 11 mm Hg over 24 hours, and reversal of herniation occurred in 75% of cases, predicted by a 5-mmol/L or greater increase in pNa (P = 0.001). There was no control group comparison, however — and this was not a hyponatremic cohort. Collectively, however, these studies illustrate the rationale for active intervention with hypertonic saline in symptomatic hyponatremia to reduce ICP and improve morbidity and mortality.

In patients definitively known to have acute hyponatremia, it is thought that pNa can be corrected (or allowed to correct) more rapidly, as the second phase of cerebral adaptation to low pNa (depletion of organic osmolytes) has not yet occurred (see Fig. 3). In practice, however, when a patient presents to hospital for care, it is often unclear whether their hyponatremia is acute or chronic. Even if there is a compelling history of water intoxication, endurance exercise with hypotonic fluid consumption, or recreational 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA/"ecstasy") use that supports acuity, unless a reliable normal pNa measurement within the previous 24 hours it is available, it is not possible to confirm. While symptom-defined severe hyponatremia should always prompt treatment with hypertonic saline to achieve the initial small increment in serum sodium described earlier, in most cases it is necessary to assume chronicity and adopt conservative serum sodium correction targets from that point to avoid the risk of ODS (see "Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome").
