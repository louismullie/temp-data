## Question

Von willebrand and high blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how high blood pressure (hypertension) interacts with von Willebrand disease (VWD), including pathophysiology, clinical implications, and management strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of VWD and the role of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Then, I should verify how hypertension influences VWF biology and levels. Next, I will examine the clinical implications of this interaction, including bleeding and thrombotic risk. After that, I need to review guideline-based management, including antithrombotic therapy, desmopressin cautions, and prophylaxis. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize practical takeaways with attention to evidence quality and limitations.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: VWD is characterized by quantitative or qualitative defects in VWF, a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion and carries factor VIII; defects lead to mucocutaneous bleeding and variable bleeding phenotypes across types 1, 2, and 3, with diagnosis resting on VWF antigen, platelet-dependent activity assays, and often multimer analysis, while recognizing assay variability and the need for clinical correlation [^11798kDm] [^116s7tr6].

> Wait, let me verify the hypertension–VWF link before drawing conclusions: multiple cohorts show hypertension is associated with higher VWF levels in the general population and in type 1 VWD, with differences on the order of roughly 0.23 IU/mL higher VWF antigen in hypertensive type 1 VWD patients after adjustment, and similar trends for VWF activity and FVIII; importantly, antihypertensive therapy appears to attenuate this elevation, suggesting a modifiable, endothelium-driven effect rather than a purely genetic confounder [^115RcNEH] [^115ZyNiu] [^112Hmzx6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality; I should confirm mechanisms: hypertension drives endothelial activation and dysfunction, which releases VWF from Weibel–Palade granules, and inflammation further amplifies VWF-mediated thrombogenesis; non-dipping blood pressure patterns and metabolic syndrome clusters also correlate with higher VWF, reinforcing endothelial injury as a plausible mediator rather than a mere epiphenomenon [^116xDR5x] [^111eP7Sh] [^114kQaPo].

> I need to check the clinical implications carefully: despite higher VWF and FVIII levels in type 1 VWD patients with hypertension, bleeding episodes — particularly perioperative bleeding — remain more frequent, indicating that the hemostatic balance is complex and not simply normalized by higher VWF; hypertension also contributes to gastrointestinal bleeding risk in VWD cohorts, and age-related VWF rises do not reliably translate into improved bleeding symptoms, underscoring the disconnect between concentration and phenotype [^115RcNEH] [^112j93Vt] [^116nwoDN].

> Let me consider thrombotic risk next: elevated VWF is a recognized thrombotic risk marker and increases with age, so in hypertensive VWD patients, the combination of endothelial activation, high VWF, and vascular disease may tilt toward thrombosis despite the underlying bleeding diathesis; this duality is clinically relevant when antithrombotic therapy is indicated for cardiovascular indications [^116nwoDN] [^116xDR5x].

> Next, I should review guideline-based management for antithrombotic therapy: the ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH 2021 guidelines suggest giving indicated antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy rather than withholding it, but emphasize individualized, multidisciplinary risk–benefit analysis, ongoing reassessment of bleeding risk, and consideration of VWF concentrate prophylaxis in patients with severe bleeding phenotypes who require antithrombotics; shared decision-making is essential given low-certainty evidence [^116vdcam] [^1163JB5u] [^114ucnVy] [^1171AQEy].

> I should double-check desmopressin (DDAVP) cautions: desmopressin can precipitate hyponatremia and fluid retention, and is generally contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease or increased thrombotic risk; in uncontrolled hypertension, fluid shifts may worsen hemodynamics, so if DDAVP is considered at all, it should be with strict fluid restriction, close monitoring, and avoidance in high-risk cardiovascular states; type 2B VWD is a specific contraindication due to thrombocytopenia risk [^1126mKgo] [^112j5yTC] [^111vqGMK].

> Let me verify prophylaxis strategies: for patients with severe or frequent bleeding — especially when antithrombotic therapy is necessary — guidelines support considering long-term VWF concentrate prophylaxis rather than on-demand therapy alone, with periodic reassessment of bleeding burden and treatment needs; this is particularly pertinent in older adults with accumulating comorbidities and rising VWF that does not reliably mitigate bleeding risk [^115kMNMg] [^114ucnVy] [^1173VE7e].

> But wait, what about special populations and procedures: in women with VWD and heavy menstrual bleeding, guidelines advise standard gynecologic evaluation and heightened vigilance for endometrial pathology in those with hypertension and other risk factors; during pregnancy and delivery, VWF levels rise physiologically, yet individualized peripartum hemostatic plans remain critical, and desmopressin-induced hyponatremia risk is magnified with IV fluids and oxytocics, warranting careful fluid management and patient counseling [^1166hiPS] [^11798kDm] [^111wBGKk].

> I should confirm practical takeaways: hypertension is associated with higher VWF levels in type 1 VWD and likely reflects endothelial activation; despite higher VWF, bleeding risk remains elevated, especially perioperatively; antihypertensive therapy may modestly lower VWF and is reasonable; when cardiovascular indications mandate antithrombotics, do not withhold them, but coordinate hemostatic prophylaxis, avoid DDAVP in high cardiovascular risk settings, and reassess bleeding and thrombotic risks over time; these steps align with contemporary guidelines and mechanistic understanding, while acknowledging evidence limitations and the need for individualized care [^115RcNEH] [^116vdcam] [^1126mKgo] [^1171AQEy].

---

Hypertension is associated with **higher VWF levels** in type 1 VWD, likely reflecting endothelial activation and inflammation [^115RcNEH] [^116xDR5x]. This rise in VWF does not fully normalize hemostasis, and patients with hypertension still have **more bleeding**, especially during surgery [^114jY1a2]. Antihypertensive therapy may modestly lower VWF, but clinicians should monitor bleeding risk and coordinate care when antithrombotics are needed [^115ZyNiu] [^116vdcam]. Desmopressin is generally avoided in cardiovascular disease due to fluid retention and hyponatremia risk; use caution in hypertensive patients [^1126mKgo] [^112j5yTC].

---

## Pathophysiological relationship between hypertension and VWF

Hypertension is linked to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, which increase VWF release and reduce its clearance, raising plasma VWF levels [^116xDR5x] [^114jY1a2]. In type 1 VWD, hypertension is associated with **higher VWF antigen, activity, and collagen binding**, suggesting endothelial activation rather than correction of the underlying defect [^115RcNEH] [^115ZyNiu].

---

## Clinical implications of hypertension in VWD patients

### Bleeding risk

Despite higher VWF levels, hypertension does not fully correct the hemostatic defect in VWD, and patients with hypertension have **more bleeding episodes**, particularly during surgery [^115RcNEH] [^114jY1a2]. This likely reflects persistent qualitative defects and endothelial dysfunction [^11798kDm] [^114kQaPo].

---

### Thrombotic risk

Elevated VWF is a recognized **thrombotic risk factor**, and hypertension may further increase this risk in VWD patients, especially when antithrombotic therapy is required [^116nwoDN] [^116vdcam].

---

## Management considerations

### Antihypertensive therapy

Antihypertensive treatment may modestly reduce VWF levels, but the clinical significance is limited; **individualized bleeding risk assessment remains essential** [^115ZyNiu] [^113sb1H2].

---

### Antithrombotic therapy

When antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy is indicated, **individualized risk–benefit analysis and multidisciplinary care are recommended**, with consideration of VWF concentrate prophylaxis in patients with severe bleeding phenotypes [^116vdcam] [^114ucnVy].

---

### Desmopressin (DDAVP)

Desmopressin is generally contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease due to fluid retention and hyponatremia risk; **use caution in hypertensive patients** [^1126mKgo] [^112j5yTC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized management**, multidisciplinary care, and regular reassessment of bleeding and thrombotic risks in VWD patients with hypertension [^113sb1H2] [^1163JB5u].

---

## Summary of key findings

| **Clinical aspect** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| VWF levels | Higher in type 1 VWD patients with hypertension [^115RcNEH] |
| Bleeding risk | Increased despite higher VWF levels [^115RcNEH] |
| Thrombotic risk | Potentially increased due to endothelial dysfunction [^113as9MQ] |
| Antihypertensive therapy | May modestly reduce VWF levels [^115ZyNiu] |
| Antithrombotic therapy | Requires individualized risk–benefit analysis [^1163JB5u] |
| Desmopressin | Use with caution due to fluid retention risk [^1126mKgo] |

---

Hypertension is associated with higher VWF levels in type 1 VWD, but this does not fully correct hemostasis; patients still have **increased bleeding risk**. Management should be individualized, with careful consideration of antithrombotic therapy and cautious use of desmopressin.

Hypertension

There were 117 patients (22%) with hypertension (Table 2). Patients with hypertension were older and more often female (Table 2). Ninety seven of the 117 patients (83%) used anti‐hypertensive drugs.

Type 1 VWD patients with hypertension had higher VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, VWF:Ab and FVIII:C, with a difference of respectively 0.23 iu/ml (95% CI: 0.11–0.35), 0.24 iu/ml (95% CI: 0.08–0.39), 0.26 iu/ml (95% CI: 0.09–0.44) and 0.19 iu/ml (95% CI: 0.03–0.35) when compared to patients without hypertension (corrected at least for age, sex, blood group and anti‐hypertensive treatment, Fig 2). These findings were observed in both young (< 65 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years) VWD patients, although we did not find a significant outcome in elderly type 1 VWD patients, due to the small number of patients (Figure S1). In patients with type 1 VWD and hypertension, use of anti‐hypertensive drugs was associated with lower VWF:Ag, −0.18 iu/ml (95% CI: −0.33 to −0.03), and tended to be associated with lower VWF:Ab, −0.21 iu/ml (95% CI: −0.43 to 0.00) (both corrected for age, sex and blood group). In patients with type 2 VWD, no association between hypertension or use of anti‐hypertensive drugs and VWF or FVIII levels was found (Fig 2; Table SI).

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^115RcNEH]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Some comorbidities, such as hypertension, are associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels in the general population. No studies have been conducted to assess this association in patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD). Therefore, we studied this association in patients with type 1 (n = 333) and type 2 (n = 203) VWD from the 'WiN" study. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) was higher in type 1 VWD patients with hypertension [difference: 0.23 iu/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11–0.35], diabetes mellitus (0.11 iu/ml, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.23), cancer (0.14 iu/ml, 95% CI: 0.03–0.25) and thyroid dysfunction (0.14 iu/ml, 95% CI: 0.03–0.26) than in patients without these comorbidities (all corrected for age, sex and blood group). Similar results were observed for VWF collagen binding capacity (VWF:CB), VWF activity as measured by the VWF monoclonal antibody assay (VWF:Ab) and factor VIII (FVIII) coagulant activity (FVIII:C). In type 1 VWD, age was associated with higher VWF:Ag (0.03 iu/ml; 95% CI: 0.01–0.04), VWF:CB (0.02 iu/ml; 95% CI: 0.00–0.04), VWF:Ab (0.04 iu/ml; 95% CI: 0.02–0.06) and FVIII:C (0.03 iu/ml; 95% CI: 0.01–0.06) per decade increase. After adjustment for relevant comorbidities, these associations were no longer significant. Despite the higher VWF and FVIII levels, type 1 VWD patients with comorbidities had more bleeding episodes, particularly during surgery. There was no association between comorbidities and VWF/FVIII levels or bleeding phenotype in type 2 VWD patients. In conclusion, comorbidities are associated with higher VWF and FVIII levels in type 1 VWD and may explain the age-related increase of VWF and FVIII levels.

### Plasma von Willebrand factor and the development of the metabolic syndrome in patients with hypertension [^114kQaPo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Although the metabolic syndrome is associated with endothelial damage/dysfunction, the effect of risk factors and their relationship with the development of this condition are unclear. We hypothesized that plasma von Willebrand factor (vWf, marking endothelial damage/dysfunction) increases with the number of components of metabolic syndrome and that increased levels precede its development. To test this, fasting vWf, glucose and lipids were measured in 161 patients (mean age 63 ± 7 yr, 85% males) with hypertension. Using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 32 (19.9%), and using National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria, 70 (43.5%) had metabolic syndrome. Plasma vWf was higher in these patients regardless of defining criteria and increased with the number of the components of metabolic syndrome (both P < 0.001). After 4 yr, patients who did not have metabolic syndrome at baseline were reassessed for the development of this condition. Of the 129 patients who did not meet the WHO criteria at baseline, 38 (29.5%) subsequently developed the condition, whereas 36 of the 91 (39.6%) who did not meet the NCEP criteria at baseline subsequently developed metabolic syndrome. Baseline vWf levels did not predict development of metabolic syndrome, regardless of criteria (P = 0.071 for WHO and P = 0.639 for NCEP). Our data suggest more severe endothelial damage/dysfunction with cumulative metabolic syndrome-related risk factors. The failure of plasma vWf to predict the development of metabolic syndrome suggests that endothelial damage/dysfunction is a consequence, not a cause, of these risk factors.

### Von Willebrand disease type 1: a diagnosis in search of a disease [^1154v9Yq]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 1 is reported to be common but frequently is difficult to diagnose. Many people have nonspecific mild bleeding symptoms, von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels display low heritability, and low VWF levels (15% to 50% of normal) are weak risk factors for bleeding. Therefore, bleeding and low VWF levels often associate by chance. Even with stringent diagnostic criteria based on a triad of bleeding symptoms, a low VWF level, and a positive family history, the prevalence of "false-positive" VWD type 1 is comparable to the published prevalence of the disease. Consequently, many patients diagnosed with VWD type 1 do not have a specific hemorrhagic disease at all, which limits the utility of the diagnosis. This unfortunate reality is a consequence of trying to force patients into binary categories of "diseased" or "healthy" that are incompatible with the continuous biologic context in which VWF functions. The problem may be avoided by substituting an empirical epidemiologic approach like that applied to other modest risk factors for disease such as elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure. Such a risk management strategy could be generalized to include other hemorrhagic and thrombotic risk factors.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the management of von Willebrand disease [^1166hiPS]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for von Willebrand disease, more specifically with respect to patients with heavy menstrual bleeding, ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH 2021 guidelines recommend to pay special attention to adverse effects of therapy in patients at high risk of endometrial hyperplasia/malignancies, such as patients aged > 35 years, patients with polycystic ovaries, high BMI, and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension.

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^112P5jjJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

Categorical data are presented as frequencies and proportions. Continuous data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) or mean and (standard deviation). As type 1 and type 2 VWD have different mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, we analysed each separately.

VWF, FVIII and bleeding score were not normally distributed. However, the variables fulfilled the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity, whereas the sample size was large. Therefore, we used multiple regression analyses to calculate the effect of comorbidities on VWF and FVIII levels and bleeding score. For all comorbidities multiple regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex and blood group. The effect of an individual comorbidity on VWF levels was only adjusted for other comorbidities when the other comorbidities were relevant confounders (i.e. when addition of the other comorbidity to the regression model caused at least 10% change in the regression coefficient). For each of the disorders; hypertension, diabetes, arterial thrombotic events and hypercholesterolaemia, the other three disorders were analysed to identify whether they were confounders or effect modifiers. For hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, we additionally investigated whether the use of anti‐hypertensive drugs and statins acted as confounders or effect modifiers.

In the multiple regression models for analysing the association between comorbidities and the bleeding score, we adjusted for age, sex and blood group. We report linear regression outcomes as unstandardized β coefficient (difference) followed by the 95% confidence interval (CI). A P ‐value less than 0.05 was defined as significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).

### Regulation of VWF (von Willebrand factor) in inflammatory thrombosis [^116xDR5x]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Increasing evidence indicates that inflammation promotes thrombosis via a VWF (von Willebrand factor)-mediated mechanism. VWF plays an essential role in maintaining the balance between blood coagulation and bleeding, and inflammation can lead to aberrant regulation. VWF is regulated on a transcriptional and (post-)translational level, and its secretion into the circulation captures platelets upon endothelial activation. The significant progress that has been made in understanding transcriptional and translational regulation of VWF is described in this review. First, we describe how VWF is regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational level with a specific focus on the influence of inflammatory and immune responses. Next, we describe how changes in regulation are linked with various cardiovascular diseases. Recent insights from clinical diseases provide evidence for direct molecular links between inflammation and thrombosis, including atherosclerosis, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and COVID-19. Finally, we will briefly describe clinical implications for antithrombotic treatment.

Summary

Some comorbidities, such as hypertension, are associated with higher von Willebrand factor levels in the general population. No studies have been conducted to assess this association in patients with von Willebrand disease. Therefore, we studied this association in patients with type 1 (n = 333) and type 2 (n = 203)from the 'WiN" study.antigen (:Ag) was higher in type 1patients with hypertension [difference: 0.23 iu/ml, 95% confidence interval: 0.11–0.35], diabetes mellitus (0.11 iu/ml, 95%: −0.02 to 0.23), cancer (0.14 iu/ml, 95%: 0.03–0.25) and thyroid dysfunction (0.14 iu/ml, 95%: 0.03–0.26) than in patients without these comorbidities (all corrected for age, sex and blood group). Similar results were observed forcollagen binding capacity, activity as measured by themonoclonal antibody assay (:Ab) and factor coagulant activity (:C). In type 1, age was associated with higher:Ag (0.03 iu/ml; 95%: 0.01–0.04),:(0.02 iu/ml; 95%: 0.00–0.04),:Ab (0.04 iu/ml; 95%: 0.02–0.06) and:C (0.03 iu/ml; 95%: 0.01–0.06) per decade increase. After adjustment for relevant comorbidities, these associations were no longer significant. Despite the higherandlevels, type 1patients with comorbidities had more bleeding episodes, particularly during surgery. There was no association between comorbidities and/levels or bleeding phenotype in type 2patients. In conclusion, comorbidities are associated with higherandlevels in type 1and may explain the age‐related increase ofandlevels.

### A pilot study of homocyst (e) ine levels in essential hypertension: relationship to von Willebrand factor, an index of endothelial damage [^1151ZGkw]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

An interaction between homocyst(e)ine and the endothelium in hypertensive patients may promote thrombogenesis and atherogenesis, leading to adverse cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that homocyst(e)ine levels are abnormal in patients with essential hypertension, and that this may be related to an adverse effect on the vascular endothelium. Accordingly, we compared plasma levels of homocyst(e)ine and von Willebrand factor (marking endothelial damage) in 83 patients (43 men; mean age 54 ± standard deviation 15.9 years) with essential hypertension (> 160/90 mm Hg), with levels in 25 healthy normotensive controls (13 men; mean age 56 ± 11.8 years). Baseline levels of the markers and other clinical indices were then related to adverse cardiovascular events at follow-up. Plasma homocyst(e)ine (P = 0.0001) and von Willebrand factor (P = 0.031) levels were significantly higher in hypertensives compared to controls. After a mean follow-up of 76 patients for 45 months (range, 1 to 66 months), 17 subjects experienced an end point of either cardiovascular death (n = 10) or adverse cardiovascular event (n = 7). Comparing these 17 with the 59 free of an end point, the former were older (P = 0.0002) and had a longer duration of known hypertension (P = 0.018). There was a nonsignificant trend toward higher median plasma homocyst(e)ine levels in the patients sustaining a vascular end point (P = 0.07). In this pilot study, we suggest that essential hypertension may be associated with increased plasma homocyst(e)ine levels, but that this amino acid is unrelated to endothelial damage (von Willebrand factor), clinical indices, or prognosis.

### Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension causing acquired von Willebrand disease and menorrhagia [^113dVtbD]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) maybe inherited or acquired; both etiologies can be associated with heavy menstrual bleeding. Pulmonary arterial hypertension may result in acquired VWD due to the destruction of high molecular weight von Willebrand multimers. We report a case of menorrhagia due to acquired VWD in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.

Case

An adolescent female with known idiopathic pulmonary hypertension developed acquired VWD. Her primary disease necessitates the use of platelet inhibitors and intermittent anticoagulation. At menarche she also developed menorrhagia due to acquired VWD. She is currently controlled with stimate and progesterone-only therapy. VWD in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension causing menorrhagia. Although VWD and menorrhagia are commonly linked, the treatment and disease process in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is incredibly complex.

### Health disparities in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a blueprint for action. An official American Thoracic Society statement [^116bFynd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Environmental stressors and pulmonary vascular disease — air pollution: There is a paucity of data examining the impact of the physical and social environment on pulmonary vascular disease, and exploring environmental stressors has the potential to be a useful avenue for improving understanding and for highlighting strategies to prevent or slow disease progression. Outdoor and, to a lesser extent, indoor air pollution has been shown to increase risk of morbidity and mortality associated with cardiopulmonary diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmia, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma; this may be more pronounced where environmental protection plans are lacking, and findings from the Health Effects Institute indicate ambient particulate matter and household air pollution are now the fourth and fifth leading causes of death in East Asia. However, much less is known about the relationship between ambient pollution and pulmonary vascular disease, although there is a strong rationale for a link between particulate matter and vascular disease. Prior epidemiologic and basic studies have demonstrated hypercoagulability in response to particulate matter exposure, evidenced by increased plasma levels of factor VII, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen, and air pollution may also influence RV structure and function, independent of underlying cardiovascular disease.

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^114QRbpQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

The most important limitation of this study is that we did not longitudinally asses VWF levels in patients, therefore we could not assess the association between comorbidities and the age‐related increase of VWF levels intra‐individually. In addition, the data on comorbidities is patient‐reported. However, we also obtained information on medication use and, in most patients, the use of medication confirmed the presence of the patient‐reported comorbidities. Moreover, we previously evaluated the medical records of patients that reported arterial thrombotic events. All patient‐reported diagnosis were confirmed and no other arterial thrombotic events were found in a random sample of 237 VWD patients (Sanders et al, 2013). Furthermore, although the total sample size is large, for hyper‐ and hypothyroidism the numbers of patients were small. Therefore, for these comorbidities the analysis could potentially be overfitted. Another limitation of this study is that the bleeding phenotype was retrospectively assessed, which is less accurate than an assessment at diagnosis, for which it was originally developed. Furthermore, we do not have detailed information on comorbidity‐related measurements, such as the blood pressure and HbA1c. However, this study aimed to assess the influence of comorbidities on VWF and FVIII levels, independent of disease control. To validate our findings a prospective study should be performed with measurement of VWF and FVIII levels over time in individuals who develop comorbidities during follow‐up.

In conclusion, this is the first study on the association between comorbidities and VWF and FVIII levels in patients with VWD. Type 1 VWD patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer and thyroid dysfunction had higher VWF and/or FVIII levels than VWD patients without these disorders. Comorbidities may explain the age‐related increase of VWF and FVIII levels in patients with type 1 VWD. Despite the higher VWF and FVIII levels, patients with comorbidities had more bleeding episodes, particularly bleeding during surgery.

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^112Hmzx6]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, and is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding due to a deficiency of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) (Leebeek & Eikenboom, 2016). VWD can be caused by reduced levels (type 1), abnormal function (type 2) or complete absence (type 3) of VWF (Sadler et al, 2006).

VWF levels have a large inter‐ and intra‐individual variability (de Maat et al, 2016). The inter‐individual variability is mostly caused by genetic variations and blood group, while the intra‐individual variability is mainly caused by environmental factors (Gill et al, 1987; Jenkins & O'Donnell, 2006; van Schie et al, 2011). Furthermore, an age‐related increase of VWF levels has been observed in both healthy individuals and patients with type 1 VWD (Gill et al, 1987; Coppola et al, 2003; Tofler et al, 2005; Vischer et al, 2005; Sanders et al, 2014; Rydz et al, 2015; Albanez et al, 2016). Both in healthy individuals and patients with VWD, higher levels of VWF are observed after exercise, trauma or surgery and during infectious diseases, pregnancy or use of certain medication (Prentice et al, 1972; Clark et al, 1998; Sadler et al, 2000; James & Lillicrap, 2012; Kawecki et al, 2017). In individuals without VWD increase of VWF has been associated with several disorders, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia (Conlan et al, 1993; Kessler et al, 1998; Seligman et al, 2000; Brunner et al, 2005). Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated increased VWF levels in patients with cancer, hyperthyroidism, chronic liver disease and renal failure (Danielsson et al, 1990; Liu et al, 1993; Holvoet et al, 1996; Auwerda et al, 2005, 2007; Franchini et al, 2013; Elbers et al, 2016; Leebeek, 2016).

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^114jY1a2]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that comorbidities are associated with VWF and FVIII levels in type 1 VWD patients. VWD type 1 patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer and thyroid dysfunction had higher VWF and/or FVIII levels than VWD patients without these disorders. In patients with type 1 VWD, these comorbidities may explain the age‐related increase of VWF and FVIII levels. Despite the higher VWF and FVIII levels, patients with comorbidities had more bleeding episodes in the year prior to inclusion of the study, and had a higher total bleeding score, which was mainly caused by more bleeding during surgery. Furthermore, VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio was lower in patients with type 1 VWD with comorbidities, suggesting there is a slower clearance of VWF in patients with comorbidities. In type 2 VWD, we did not find an association between comorbidities and VWF or FVIII levels or bleeding phenotype.

In accordance with previous population studies in individuals without VWD (Brunner et al, 2005; Seligman et al, 2000; Auwerda et al, 2007; Elbers et al, 2016; Franchini et al, 2013.), we found that individuals with hypertension, diabetes, cancer and hyperthyroidism had higher VWF and FVIII levels than individuals without these disorders. In our study, this was observed in both young and elderly VWD type 1 patients.

We did not expect VWD patients with hypothyroidism to have higher VWF and FVIII levels than VWD patients with normal thyroid function, as hypothyroidism is known to be associated with reduced VWF levels and may even cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome (Dalton et al, 1987; Stuijver et al, 2014). This also seems contradictory, because hyperthyroidism is known to be associated with higher VWF levels (Liu et al, 1993; Elbers et al, 2016). However, it has been shown that VWF levels can increase after treatment with levothyroxine (Rogers & Shane, 1983; Stuijver et al, 2014). In our study, all patients with hypothyroidism used levothyroxine. Therefore, hypothyroidism may have resulted in lower VWF levels in our population before they were treated, but this effect could have been reversed by treatment with levothyroxine. In nine of 12 patients with hypothyroidism, VWD was clearly inherited, based on family history. Of the remaining patients, one patient had type 2 VWD. Therefore, in most patients acquired VWD due to hypothyroidism could be excluded.

The association between the number of comorbidities and VWF and FVIII levels

All comorbidities that had an association with higher VWF and FVIII levels were defined as relevant comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer and thyroid dysfunction. Patients with renal disease were excluded from this analysis, due to the insufficient number of patients (< 5). In total, 146 patients (27%; 96 with type 1 VWD and 50 with type 2 VWD) had any of these relevant comorbidities. Patients with relevant comorbidities were more often female (74.0% vs. 61.1%, P = 0.006) and were older [58 years (11) vs. 42 years (14), P < 0.001], than patients without relevant comorbidities. There was no difference in blood group (61.4% vs. 62.3% blood group O, P = 0.839).

VWF and FVIII levels were strongly associated with the number of comorbidities in patients with type 1 VWD. As the number of relevant comorbidities increased, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, VWF:Ab and FVIII:C increased for presence of each additional comorbidity (Fig 6). VWF:Ag increased from 0.36 iu/ml [0.23–0.49] in patients without comorbidities to 0.44 iu/ml [0.29–0.62] in patients with one comorbidity to 0.67 iu/ml [0.39–0.90] in patients with two comorbidities (P < 0.001 corrected for age, sex and blood group). Similar results were observed for VWF:CB, VWF:Ab and FVIII:C (Fig 6).

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^111wFEAS]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest that the association between aging and increase in VWF and FVIII levels in patients with type 1 VWD may be explained by the presence of relevant comorbidities. The age‐related increase of VWF and FVIII levels was demonstrated previously in several studies. However, many of these reports did not take comorbidities into account (Favaloro et al, 2005; Tofler et al, 2005; Vischer et al, 2005; Miesbach & Berntorp, 2011; Sanders et al, 2014; Rydz et al, 2015; Borghi et al, 2017; Abou‐Ismail et al, 2018). Gill et al (1987) found that medication use was associated with higher VWF:Ag in VWD patients with blood group A. This could have been caused by the comorbidities, i.e. hypertension, for which the medication was used, as many patients (43%) used an anti‐hypertensive drug. In a well‐designed study, Coppola et al (2003) found an age‐related increase of VWF:Ag in 74 healthy centenarians and 110 healthy controls younger than 82 years (range 21–86). However, they defined "healthy" based on the Senieur Protocol in which some disorders, including thyroid dysfunction, is defined as healthy (Ligthart et al, 1984). Moreover, although centenarians might not have a disorder, the combination of reduced function in several organ could have led to an increase of VWF or FVIII levels in a similar pattern as in patients with relevant comorbidities. Albanez et al (2016) found that the age‐related increase of VWF and FVIII is strongest in patients with non‐O blood group. Also, in our population, the age‐related increase in VWF and FVIII levels seemed to be stronger in patients with non‐O blood group. However, the association with comorbidities was independent of the blood group. Furthermore, there was no association between the previously reported CLEC4M and STXBP5 mutations and the effect of comorbidities on VWF levels (data not shown) (Sanders et al, 2015b).

Results

We included 536 patients in this study from the total WiN‐study population of 837 patients. Figure 1 shows a consort diagram illustrating patient inclusion. Most patients were female (64%), had blood group O (62%) and had type 1 VWD (62%) (Table 1). The mean age in type 1 and type 2 VWD were 47 (SD 15, range 17–81) and 46 (SD 16, range 16–83) years, respectively. Comorbidities were reported in 175 patients (33%), of whom 47 patients had two comorbidities, 19 patients had three comorbidities and 2 patients had four comorbidities. The most frequent reported comorbidity was hypertension (21.8%), followed by hypercholesterolaemia (9.5%) (Table 2).

### Association of hypertension and incident diabetes in Chinese adults: a retrospective cohort study using propensity-score matching [^117E6Szu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

It is still unclear whether there is a direct causal relationship between high blood pressure and diabetes risk. However, there is a substantial overlap between hypertension and diabetes in etiology and disease mechanisms. The two diseases share common mediators, including obesity, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. In hypertensive people, the presence of obesity leads to overactivation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, as well as proinflammatory/pro-oxidative mechanisms, which are related to diabetes. As we know, hypertension could induce endothelial dysfunction. The Framingham Offspring Study revealed that some plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction (such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen and von Willebrand factor antigen) were associated with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes independent of other diabetes risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Besides, endothelial dysfunction could inhibit NO synthase and reduce NO bioavailability which is a crucial factor for the vasodilator action. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction reduces vasodilation and increases vascular resistance, limiting insulin and glucose delivery in the sensitive tissues (ie, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue) and blunts insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. There was a low-grade inflammatory reaction in patients with diabetes and hypertension. High blood pressure increases inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 and adhesion molecules related to the insulin signaling pathway and β-cell function, and further leads to the incident diabetes. In addition, oxidative stress-related cytokines (interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a) could modify glucose metabolism, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.

### Inflammation does not influence arterial stiffness and pulse-wave velocity in patients with coronary artery disease [^116rDGno]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Vascular function is an important pathophysiological factor in cardiovascular disease, and is influenced by many factors, one of the principles being hypertension. Developing evidence suggests that inflammation may be another risk factor. Vascular function and blood pressure haemodynamics can be assessed by arterial stiffness, pulse pressure and plasma markers. Testing the hypothesis of a relationship between inflammatory markers, hypertension and vascular function, we recruited 222 stable coronary artery disease outpatients, assessing inflammation with levels of high sensitivity CRP and interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular function/arterial stiffness by pulse-wave velocity (PWV), augmentation (SphygmoCor system Artcor, Sidney, Australia), aortic and brachial artery pulse pressure, Von Willebrand factor (vWf) and soluble E-selectin (both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In multivariate regression analysis, PWVs, augmentation indices and pulse pressures were linked with age, blood pressure and (some) with heart rate (all P < 0.01), while vWf was associated with age (P = 0.01). We conclude that, in patients with stable coronary artery disease, arterial stiffness and pulse pressure are related strongly and independently with age, blood pressure and heart rate, and that any effect of inflammation is minimal.

Diabetes mellitus

Twenty VWD patients (3.7%) had diabetes mellitus at the time of inclusion in the WiN study. Patients with diabetes were older and were less often blood group O compared to patients without diabetes (Table 2). Fourteen patients had type 2 diabetes; the type of diabetes was not reported in the other six patients.

Type 1 VWD patients with diabetes had higher VWF:Ab and FVIII:C compared to patients without diabetes, with a difference of 0.23 iu/ml (95% CI: 0.05–0.40) and 0.27 iu/ml (95% CI: 0.11–0.44), respectively. A similar association, although not significant, was observed for VWF:Ag and VWF:CB, respectively 0.11 iu/ml (95% CI: −0.02 to 0.23) and 0.15 iu/ml (95% CI: −0.01 to 0.31) (Fig 3). In patients with type 2 VWD no association between diabetes and VWF or FVIII levels was found (Fig 3; Table SI).

### Low von Willebrand factor: sometimes a risk factor and sometimes a disease [^112yCf5o]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

A sufficiently low level of von Willebrand factor (VWF) predisposes to bleeding that can be quite serious, and low VWF is a diagnostic feature of von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 1, which is characterized by partial quantitative deficiency of VWF. Recent groundbreaking studies of patients with VWD type 1 have delineated several pathophysiologic mechanisms that determine the plasma concentration of VWF, but the relationship between VWF level and the likelihood of bleeding remains less well understood. In part, this problem reflects the broad range of VWF levels in the population, so that the distinction between "normal" and "low" is arbitrary. The risk of bleeding certainly increases as the VWF level decreases, but the relationship is not very strong until the VWF level is very low. Furthermore, mild bleeding symptoms are common in apparently healthy populations and have many causes other than defects in VWF, which can make it impossible to attribute bleeding to any single factor, such as low VWF. These difficulties might be resolved by an epidemiologic approach to VWF and other risk factors for bleeding, analogous to how physicians manage multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease or venous thromboembolism.

### Relation of nocturnal blood pressure dipping to cellular adhesion, inflammation and hemostasis [^111eP7Sh]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subjects who fail to dip their nocturnal blood pressure (BP) are at substantially increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. The pathogenetic mechanisms of this relationship have not been elucidated. We investigated whether non-dipping would relate to procoagulant and proinflammatory activity.

Design

Study participants were 76 unmedicated normotensive and hypertensive subjects (44 male, 32 female; 41 white, 35 black; mean age, 36 ± 8 years) who underwent 24-h outpatient ambulatory BP monitoring. Based on whether their average nocturnal systolic BP relative to their average daytime systolic BP declined by less than 10%, 34 subjects were categorized as non-dippers. D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, von Willebrand factor, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6 were measured in plasma.

Results

Multivariate analyses showed that D-dimer (median/interquartile range, 242/162–419 ng/ml versus 175/132–254 ng/ml; P = 0.041), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (36/19–61 ng/ml versus 17/6–44 ng/ml; P = 0.010), von Willebrand factor (122/91–179% versus 92/66–110%; P = 0.001), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1(227/187–291 ng/ml versus 206/185–247 ng/ml; P = 0.044) were all higher in non-dippers than in dippers. Adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension status, and social class revealed independent effects of non-dipping. Non-dippers continued to have higher D-dimer (P = 0.030) and von Willebrand factor (P = 0.034) than dippers. A similar trend not reaching statistical significance emerged for soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (P = 0.055). In contrast, dipping status had no effect on interleukin-6.

Conclusion

Nocturnal BP non-dipping is associated with elevated levels of molecules related to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. The finding provides one possible mechanism linking non-dipping with cardiovascular disease.

### Subcortical ischaemic changes in young hypertensive patients: frequency, effect on cognitive performance and relationship with markers of endothelial and haemostatic activation [^114Rapzp]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Information on subcortical ischaemic changes (SIC) in young hypertensive patients is scarce. We evaluated the frequency of SIC at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the possible effect on cognition of these patients, and the role of plasma markers known as indicators of endothelial and haemostatic activation. Inclusion criteria were age ≤ 54 years, hypertension for at least 2 years and absence of cerebrovascular disease or other conditions possibly related to SIC. Patients with SIC at MRI and two control groups (matched for age, sex and education) of hypertensive patients without SIC and non-hypertensive healthy subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological examination and evaluation of plasma markers. Amongst the 200 patients evaluated, 50 (25%) showed SIC at MRI. Mean age was 48.4 ± 4.8 years. Compared with both control groups, hypertensive patients with SIC performed significantly worse in general cognition, attention, memory and executive functions. Moreover, they showed significantly more often increased levels of all plasma markers compared with healthy controls, and of von Willebrand factor (vWF) compared with both control groups (P < 0.001). In young hypertensive patients SIC are frequent, related to a worse cognitive performance and endothelial dysfunction. Our findings suggest vWF as marker of end-organ damage, underscoring the relevance of treating hypertension at younger age.

### Clinical significance of substantially elevated von Willebrand factor antigen levels in patients with advanced chronic liver disease [^111sQWjE]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF) is a non-invasive marker for clinically significant portal hypertension (HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg) and confers HVPG-independent prognostic information. While quantification of increased VWF-levels is not relevant in the context of von Willebrand disease, highly elevated VWF may be of clinical significance in ACLD. Thus, we have modified our analytical approach to quantify very high VWF-levels (i.e., > 420%) and investigated their prognostic value.

Methods

Patients undergoing HVPG-measurement at the Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab with evidence of ACLD and information on VWF were considered. Clinical stages (CS) were defined as follows: Probable compensated ACLD (cACLD): LSM ≥ 10kPa&HVPG < 6 mmHg; 0: cACLD&6–9 mmHg; 1: cACLD&HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg; 2: bleeding; 3: non-bleeding decompensation; 4: ≥ 2 decompensations.

Results

124 (16%) of 793 patients had VWF > 420%. The proportion of VWF > 420% increased with disease severity (probable cACLD-0: 5(4%) vs. 1: 22(10%) vs. 2–4: 97(23%), p ≤ 0.001) as well as across HVPG (< 6mmHg: 1(2%) vs. 6–9: 6(6%) vs. 10–15: 17(9%) vs. ≥ 16: 100(22%), p ≤ 0.001) and MELD (< 10: 17(6%) vs. 10–14: 27(10%) vs. ≥ 15: 79(32%), p ≤ 0.001) strata. In patients with VWF > 420%, median VWF was 533 (IQR:466–611)% and VWF was unrelated to HVPG (Spearman's ρ = 0.139, p = 0.123), but showed direct correlations of weak/moderate strength with MELD (ρ = 0.336, p < 0.001) and CRP (ρ = 0.286, p = 0.001). In the subgroup with VWF > 420%, VWF was predictive of decompensation/liver-related mortality (VWF per 10%; hazard ratio (HR): 1.02(95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.01–1.04), p = 0.008, even after adjusting for other factors (VWF per 10%; adjusted HR: 1.02(95%CI: 1.00–1.05), p = 0.031).

Conclusion

The proportion of patients with substantially elevated VWF values steadily increases with disease progression. While VWF is not reflective of HVPG in these patients, it is correlated with hepatic dysfunction and systemic inflammation. Importantly, quantification of high values provides prognostic information.

### BMI is an important determinant of VWF and FVIII levels and bleeding phenotype in patients with von Willebrand disease [^112YxFWU]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

We compared continuous variables between two groups using an independent t test, and categorical variables with a chi‐square test. The association between BMI categories and occurrence of bleeding in the year prior to inclusion in the study was adjusted for confounders using logistic regression analysis. Outcomes of logistic regression analysis are reported as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). Multiple regression analyses were used to analyze the association between BMI and VWF and FVIII levels and total bleeding score. We report linear regression outcomes as unstandardized β coefficient (difference) and 95%CI. In the logistic and multiple regression analysis, confounders were selected based on previous literature (age, sex, blood group [O vs non‐O], and presence of relevant comorbidities [cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid gland dysfunction]). 3 Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corp.

### Platelet and haemorheological markers in' high risk' hypertensives are improved by tighter blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk management: a substudy of the anglo-scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial (ASCOT) [^1117btMi]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the impact of intensified cardiovascular risk management on soluble markers of platelet, endothelial and rheological function in a population of middle-aged hypertensive patients at high risk of cardiovascular complications.

Design

Prospective follow-up study.

Subjects and Methods

A total of 159 hypertensive patients [138 male, mean age 64 (± 8) years] and 80 healthy controls were studied. Plasma levels of soluble P-selectin (sP-sel, a marker of platelet function), von Willebrand factor (vWF, an index of endothelial damage/dysfunction) and rheological indices [fibrinogen (Fib), plasma viscosity (PV), haematocrit (HCT), white blood count (WBC) and platelet count] were measured at baseline and again (in the patients) after 6 months' treatment.

Results

As expected, 6 months of intensified cardiovascular risk management resulted in a significant fall in mean blood pressure (BP) and total cholesterol. It also resulted in reduced haematocrit, vWF, sP-sel, WBC and PV levels (all P < 0.001), but not plasma fibrinogen. There were no correlations between the fall in BP and the improvement in any of the research indices.

Conclusions

Intensified cardiovascular risk management results in significant improvements in indices of endothelial, platelet and rheological function in a population of hypertensives at high risk of cardiovascular events. These improvements appear to be independent of the degree of change in BP. Given the fundamental role of interactions between the endothelium and circulating blood components in the pathogenesis of hypertensive complications this may be of importance in preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

### D-dimer relates positively with increased blood pressure in black south Africans: the SABPA study [^111dxByg]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is highly prevalent in black South Africans in which morbidity and mortality from stroke are on the increase. Elevated blood pressure and haemostatic markers can induce changes in blood rheology and endothelial function which could result in a procoagulant state that increases the risk for cerebrovascular disease. Information about the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems of people from African descent are limited. We therefore, investigated the haemostatic profile and its relationships with blood pressure in black South Africans.

Materials and Methods

We measured ambulatory blood pressure and haemostatic markers of 201 black and 208 white school teachers. The haemostatic markers included measurements representing coagulation and fibrinolysis (von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fibrin D-dimer and clot lysis time).

Results

Black participants displayed significantly higher blood pressure, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and D-dimer levels and longer clot lysis times (p ≤ 0.001). Single, partial and multiple regression analyses showed that systolic (p ≤ 0.011) and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.010) correlated positively with D-dimer in black participants, while systolic (p ≤ 0.001) and daytime diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.011) correlated negatively with clot lysis time in white participants.

Conclusion

The black population had a more prothrombotic profile, with higher levels of coagulation markers and inhibited fibrinolysis, than the white study participants. The positive association between blood pressure and elevated D-dimer in the blacks may contribute to the high prevalence of hypertension and related increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk in this group.

### Recombinant von Willebrand factor prophylaxis in patients with severe von Willebrand disease: phase 3 study results [^113cMpMG]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to assess the efficacy and safety of rVWF prophylaxis and to compare on-study rVWF prophylaxis with intrapatient historical pdVWF prophylaxis based on medical records. In patients previously treated on-demand with VWF products, rVWF prophylaxis reduced the frequency of spontaneous BEs requiring VWF treatment. Patients switching from pdVWF to rVWF prophylaxis experienced levels of control over treated spontaneous BEs similar to their historical levels. Based on the data available in the medical records, 94% of historical bleeds were spontaneous, and > 95% were mild or moderate bleeds. Most of these BEs were mucosal. During the study, a high proportion of patients in each group achieved 0 treated spontaneous BEs (prior on-demand: 11/13; switch: 7/10). All treated spontaneous BEs occurred in patients with type 3 VWD, and most were mucosal bleeds and/or menorrhagia. There were no fatal or life-threatening BEs and no spontaneous gastrointestinal BEs. One joint bleed occurred in a patient with historical joint bleeding. One AE (nonserious headache) was considered to be related to rVWF by the investigator, although there were confounding factors (medical history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and depression).

5.3 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with von Willebrand's Disease Type IIB

Use of DDAVP in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis.

5.4	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with intravenous and intranasal DDAVP, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous DDAVP. DDAVP Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or to any of the components of DDAVP Injection [see Contraindications (4)]. It is not known whether antibodies to DDAVP Injection are produced after repeated injections. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration, interrupt treatment should a reaction occur, and manage medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.5	Fluid Retention

DDAVP Injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. DDAVP Injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Comorbidities associated with higher von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels may explain the age-related increase of VWF in von Willebrand disease [^111kWyLn]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Although VWF levels are altered in patients with the above‐mentioned disorders, the association between these disorders and VWF levels in patients with VWD is unknown. Also, the relationship between comorbidities, mostly occurring at older age, and the age‐related increase of VWF levels is unknown.

Therefore, our primary aim was to assess the association between comorbidities and VWF and factor VIII (FVIII) levels in patients with VWD type 1 and 2. The second aim was to study whether comorbidities can explain the previously reported age‐related increase of VWF in VWD type 1 patients. Thirdly, we aimed to assess the association between comorbidities and the bleeding phenotype of VWD patients.

### Relevance of hemostatic risk factors on coronary morphology in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 [^113nksta]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemostasis and fibrinolysis in diabetes mellitus

Type 2 diabetes mellitus, most often being part of a metabolic syndrome is closely associated with obesity, peripheral insulin resistance, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and predisposes for atherosclerosis. Peripheral insulin resistance is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, even after adjusting for other more conventional risk factors. Whether this relation is causal, can only be suspected, other authors discussed whether an impaired fibrinolysis could be the link to atherosclerosis.

The changes of hemostasis and endogenous fibrinolysis of diabetic patients in this study correspond with the literature, although most often only single parameters were evaluated. These alterations might be responsible for higher atherogenicity and more cardiovascular events in a diabetic population.

We showed, that plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI) was increased in diabetic patients; this corresponds to other studies. Additionally we found a strong correlation between PAI and insulin levels, which confirms results from experimental studies, where insulin decreased PAI activity in a dose dependent manner.

The potential role of insulin as one of the mechanisms in atherogenesis in diabetic patients has been discussed for 25 years. Results of various prospective studies indicated that elevated plasma insulin levels cause and enhance atherosclerosis. Diverse diseases associated with hyperinsulinemia show an early and extended manifestation of atherosclerosis. Several studies proved that elevated insulin levels are accompanied by reduced endogenous fibrinolysis. On the one hand hyperinsulinemia is associated with a decreased t-PA concentration, on the other hand it causes an increase of PAI activity.

The importance of PAI is underlined by a follow up study of men after primary myocardial infarction. Those patients who showed elevated PAI concentrations as a sign of reduced fibrinolysis were at increased risk of reinfarction. High concentrations of von Willebrand factor antigen are supposed to be markers of endothelial lesions and present a procoagulative mechanism due to an enhanced platelet adhesion.

The question remains, how does diabetes mediate its specific effects towards a diabetic specific morphology? Some authors suggest that diabetics undergo invasive evaluation later than others due to their cardiac neuropathy and the resulting lack of symptoms, others, that the impact of the often combined risk factors (e.g. hypertension, high LDL etc.) may trigger an accelerated form of atherosclerosis. This study extends these views by showing a close association between coronary morphology and a diabetic status with alterations of haemostasis and fibrinolysis, especially for distal coronary artery disease. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis revealed a strong relationship between the extent of coronary and especially distal coronary atherosclerosis and fasting glucose, PAI-1 and von-Willebrand-factor.

### Von Willebrand disease and gastrointestinal bleeding: a national inpatient sample study [^112j93Vt]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal tract bleeding (GIB) is a serious complication of von Willebrand Disease (VWD), but little is known regarding prevalence and risk factors. We, therefore, evaluated correlates of GIB among VWD using a large national database.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult discharges from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2009 and 2014. International Disease Classification codes were used to identify those with and without VWD with and without GIB. Prevalence estimates were weighted using NIS-provided discharge-level weights to reflect national estimates. Categorical variables were compared by Rao-Scott chi-square test, continuous variables by weighted simple linear regression, and independent factors associated with GIB in VWD were determined by weighted multivariable logistic regression.

Results

GIB is more prevalent in VWD, 3.70%, than those without VWD, 1.49%, p < .0001, and is more common in those who are younger, male, or Black than in VWD without GIB, each p < .001. Comorbidities of GIB in VWD include surgery, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, each more common than in VWD without GIB, p < .0001. VWD with GIB also have higher length of stay and inpatient mortality, p < .0001. In a multivariable model, variables significantly associated with GIB in VWD were angiodysplasia, diverticulitis, hepatitis C, black race, male gender, and smoking, each p < .001.

Conclusions

GIB is more common in VWD who are young, black, or male, and the most significant predictors of GIB include angiodysplasia, diverticulitis, hepatitis C, and smoking. After a first GIB, such individuals should consider factor prophylaxis to prevent GIB recurrence and associated morbidity.

### Association between thrombotic microangiopathy and reduced ADAMTS13 activity in malignant hypertension [^115nAAL7]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

The thrombotic microangiopathy observed in malignant hypertension is similar to that of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is associated with a deficiency of ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving protease that cleaves large prothrombogenic multimers. We hypothesized that ADAMTS13 is deficient in malignant hypertension and that the severity of thrombotic microangiopathy is associated with decreased ADAMTS13 activity. We included 20 patients with malignant and 20 patients with severe hypertension, and 20 matched normotensive individuals served as control subjects. VWF, active VWF, and free hemoglobin were assessed to explore predictors of ADAMTS13 activity. Patients with malignant hypertension had lower ADAMTS13 activity (80%; interquartile range: 53% to 130%) compared with control subjects (99% interquartile range: 82% to 129%; P < 0.01) but not compared with patients with severe hypertension (P = 0.14). ADAMTS13 activity negatively correlated with lactic dehydrogenase levels after logarithmic transformation (r = -0.65; P < 0.001) and was associated with platelet count (r = 0.34; P = 0.04) and the presence of schistocytes (r = -0.37; P = 0.02). Apart from the association with thrombotic microangiopathy, ADAMTS13 was inversely associated with creatinine (r = -0.42; P = 0.008). Increasing levels of VWF were associated with a decrease in ADAMTS13 activity (r = -0.34; P = 0.03). There was no significant association between ADAMTS13 activity and other parameters, including blood pressure. In conclusion, ADAMTS13 is decreased in malignant hypertension and associated with the severity of thrombotic microangiopathy, likely because of the release of VWF after endothelium stimulation. A severe deficiency could not be demonstrated. More studies are needed to identify the role of ADAMTS13 in the thrombotic microangiopathy and ischemic complications of malignant hypertension.

### Evidence that high von Willebrand factor and low ADAMTS-13 levels independently increase the risk of a non-fatal heart attack [^113gw7wx]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Results

ADAMTS-13 or VWF data were available for 950 plasma samples. Due to incomplete residual aliquots, VWF was measured in 875 (88%) and ADAMTS-13 in 919 (94%) of the 995 participants in GLAMIS. Cases had significantly higher average values for triglycerides, BMI, fibrinogen, CRP and VWF than controls, but lower values for blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol (Table 1). Cases were also more likely than controls to have ever smoked (89% vs. 74%), to have diabetes (12% vs. 2%), and to be taking medication for high blood pressure (39% vs. 17%) or for high cholesterol (28% vs. 1%) (data not shown). As anticipated by design, there were no significant differences in either age or sex between cases and controls. There were also no significant differences in levels of total cholesterol or ADAMTS-13.

Summary statistics for ADAMTS-13, von Willebrand factor (VWF) and continuous coronary risk factors

In Table 2, plasma levels of ADAMTS-13 and VWF in control subjects (for whom both values were available) are shown according to the different binary variables. In controls there was no significant age-/sex-adjusted difference (P > 0.05) in mean VWF by sex, ever-smoking status, diabetes status, or use of medication for high blood pressure or for high cholesterol (Table 2). ADAMTS-13 was higher in those taking compared with those not taking medication for high blood pressure. None of the other comparisons of ADAMTS-13 levels showed any differences amongst the different groups analyzed.

### Association of prothrombotic status with markers of cerebral small vessel disease in elderly hypertensive patients [^114vhaVn]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Aging and hypertension are well-known risk factors for cerebral white matter lesions. Prothrombotic status has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In this study, we investigated the relationships among prothrombotic status, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in elderly hypertensives.

Methods

Measurement of prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2), von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), ABP monitoring (ABPM), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in 514 Japanese elderly hypertensives (72.3 years old, male 37%). WMH cases were further divided into deep subcortical white matter lesion (DWML) or periventricular hyperintensity (PVH).

Results

Deep WMH (DWMH) had significant positive correlations with age, use of antiplatelet agents, log F1+2, log vWF, log PAI-1, and 24-h systolic BP (SBP). PVH had significant positive correlations with age, male gender, smoking, use of antiplatelet agents, white coat hypertension (WCH), log vWF, and 24-h SBP. Severe PVH had significant positive correlations with age, use of antiplatelet agents, WCH, and 24-h SBP, and that was marginally correlated with log F1+2. In the logistic linear regression analysis, log F1+2 was significantly associated with DWMH (P < 0.01) and severe PVH (P < 0.05) adjusted for age and 24-h SBP. Log PAI-1 was significantly associated with DWMH (P < 0.05) adjusted for age and 24-h SBP.

Conclusions

In the present study, F1+2 and PAI-1 were positively associated with WMH after adjustment for 24-h SBP in elderly hypertensives. In addition to the conventional risk factors, prothrombotic status might serve as a significant determinant for WMH.

### A therapeutic antibody targeting osteoprotegerin attenuates severe experimental pulmonary arterial hypertension [^114BY6gt]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Previous data suggest that the predominant function of OPG is to regulate osteoclastogenesis, with data from mice demonstrating that reduced OPG expression results in osteoporosisand over-expression of OPG causes osteopetrosisvia binding to RANKL. These data perhaps suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting OPG might have detrimental effects on bone remodelling; however, encouragingly in our studies we demonstrate a positive therapeutic effect on pulmonary vascular remodelling with no significant effect on bone phenotype. OPG also binds proteins other than RANKL and TRAIL, e.g. syndecan-1, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), von Willebrand factor and factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex. We therefore performed an unbiased screen of around 60% of known transmembrane proteins and identified OPG binding to RANKL, syndecan-1 but also with Fas, IL-1RAcP, GAP43 and TMPRSS11D (Fig. 4). Having previously examined RANKL and syndecan-1, we assessed the expression of the other binders within PASMCs, and subsequently focused on Fas due its relatively high expression levels within diseased tissue and its close relationship to OPG and TRAIL (all belong to the TNF superfamily). Our data suggest that neutralisation of Fas, either by anti-Fas antibody or binding to OPG, up-regulates TRAIL expression. This may reflect a redundancy mechanism between the two death-receptor signalling pathways. FasL has been reported to induce PASMC apoptosis, so our data highlight another potential mechanism by which increased OPG (via Fas) may drive PAH pathology. Inhibiting FasL/Fas binding with endogenous OPG may limit the ability of FasL to cause apoptosis. Indeed, we clearly show that OPG induces a pro-survival/anti-apoptotic phenotype, and activates many genes previously associated with PAH, including TRAIL, suggesting a pivotal role in the disease process. The implication that OPG can regulate the local expression of TRAIL within the vessel wall fits with our reports demonstrating that TRAIL, and specifically tissue-derived TRAILis required for mice to develop PAH. Of note, TRAIL was also recently described to be an important member of an immune cluster of circulating proteins that defined poor prognosis in patients with mixed aetiology PAH. The relationship between cell expressed, and circulating TRAIL is however complex. TRAIL is widely expressed, including by immune cells and circulating "soluble" TRAIL requires proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal extracellular domain of the transmembrane TRAIL protein. Whether disease is mediated by locally expressed and retained TRAIL or by released circulating TRAIL remains unclear.

### Von Willebrand factor and von Willebrand disease in ageing: mechanisms, evolving phenotypes, and clinical implications [^116nwoDN]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

The global population is ageing and this demographic shift has profound effects on haemostasis, notably a progressive tilt towards a hypercoagulable state. A major age-associated change in haemostasis is the increase in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a plasma glycoprotein essential for primary and secondary haemostasis. VWF deficiency causes von Willebrand disease, which is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and affects approximately 1% of the population. Conversely, elevated VWF concentrations are linked to increased thrombotic risk; VWF concentrations increase with age by approximately 10–15 IU/dL per decade. Moreover, longitudinal data indicate that VWF concentrations might normalise over time in individuals initially diagnosed with von Willebrand disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying age-related increases in VWF is crucial for refining the disease classification and optimising management. Given the strong association between VWF, coagulation factor VIII (which is stabilised and transported by VWF), and thrombotic risk, the interplay between ageing and VWF dynamics has clinical implications. This Review examines age-related changes in VWF synthesis, storage, multimeric structure, and clearance. We also discuss the consequences of rising VWF concentrations in older adults on bleeding symptoms, von Willebrand disease diagnosis and management, and the related risks of thrombosis and cardiovascular complications. Finally, we identify essential knowledge gaps and outline priorities for future research and clinical practice.

### Age at first birth and cardiovascular risk factors in the 1958 British birth cohort [^111zpHFt]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To assess relationships between age at first birth and cardiovascular risk factors in a large longitudinal study of men and women. By assessing associations for both genders, we were able to investigate biological versus social and behavioural explanations from early life through to adulthood.

Methods

Multiply-imputed data on more than 7600 men and women of a British birth cohort study (National Child Development Study, 1958 British birth cohort) were used. Cardiovascular risk factors at age 44/45 years included body mass index, waist:hip ratio, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), cholesterol (total, low and high-density lipoprotein), triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin, C reactive protein, von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. Age at first birth was categorised as < 20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years or > 34 years.

Results

Being younger than 20 years of age at time of first birth was associated with an adverse cardiovascular profile by mid-life. Conversely, older parents had a lower cardiovascular risk as captured by lower body mass index, waist:hip ratio, blood pressure, high and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin, C reactive protein and fibrinogen. The relationship between age at first birth and cardiovascular risk factors was graded. Few differences between men and women were observed. Associations were largely unchanged after adjustment for early life factors but were partially mediated through adult social and behavioural factors.

Conclusions

Age at first birth is inversely associated with differences in cardiovascular risk factors in mid-life in a large prospective birth cohort. Our results potentially suggest a social and behavioural rather than a biological explanation.

### Von Willebrand disease: key points from the 2008 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines [^114u6KD3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and may affect as many as one in 100 women. The condition results from a deficiency, dysfunction, or absence of von Willebrand factor (VWF). In women, the most common symptom of VWD is menorrhagia. Of women with menorrhagia, 5–20% have been found to have previously undiagnosed VWD. Besides menorrhagia, women with VWD are more likely to experience other conditions that manifest with abnormal reproductive tract bleeding. The patient with a suspected bleeding disorder should be referred to a hemophilia treatment center or hematologist with expertise in bleeding disorders for definitive diagnosis. After diagnosis, the first choice of therapy for the management of menorrhagia in adolescents or adult females who do not desire child bearing is still hormonal contraceptives. Women who fail hormonal contraceptives, yet desire future child bearing, and women who desire pregnancy are candidates for hemostatic therapy, which is generally reserved for patients with VWF levels less than 50 international units/dL. During pregnancy, VWF levels rise, frequently obviating the need for hemostatic therapy at the time of delivery. Minor procedures can be managed with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, antifibrinolytic medication, or both, but major surgery or childbirth requires replacement with VWF and should be conducted in a center with available hematologists, anesthesiologists, pharmacists, and laboratory support experienced in the management of bleeding disorders.

### Markers of inflammation are inversely related to physical activity and fitness in sedentary men with treated hypertension [^1174ZAJy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. We studied the relationship between physical activity and physical fitness and soluble markers of atherosclerotic activity in men with drug-treated hypertension.

Methods

The participants (n = 177, 40 to 74 years of age), who were randomly recruited from the Hypertension High Risk Management Trial (HYRIM), were overweight and had sedentary lifestyles. The inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (SICAM-1) and soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) and the hemostatic markers soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), von Willebrand factor (vWf), and tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPAag) were measured. Physical activity was measured by use of a questionnaire. Time to exhaustion in a bicycle test was used as an expression of physical fitness.

Results

The hs-CRP showed a significant inverse relationship with physical fitness independent of major cardiovascular risk factors (P = 0.017) but was not related to physical activity. The sE-selectin was significantly related to physical activity, although only when other factors were taken into account (P = 0.033), and it had no significant association with physical fitness. In addition there were strong associations between hs-CRP and sICAM-1 and the Framingham Coronary Heart Disease risk score (P < .001).

Conclusions

The observed inverse relations between physical fitness and hs-CRP and between level of physical activity and sE-selectin in drug-treated, hypertensive sedentary men indicates a beneficial effect of good fitness status as well as activity of low intensity on vessel wall inflammation.

### Von Willebrand disease and angiodysplasia: a wider view of pathogenesis in pursuit of therapy [^111jJwc7]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

von Willebrand factor and pathways regulating angiogenesis

Like many other biological processes, angiogenesis is controlled by a balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors via crosstalk between several signaling pathways, the disruption of which can favor angiodysplasia. Data suggest that some of these effects only become significant when endothelial cells are also under the influence of various stressors such as age, muscular compression or inflammation and antigen exposure in tissues where endothelial cells express VWF. Such 'second hits' are more likely to be environmental in the context of VWD angiodysplasia, but it is possible that genetic second hits are also involved, as observed in many vascular abnormality syndromes.

As an intracellular, matrix and plasma protein, VWF interacts with many molecules with the potential to regulate angiogenesis. Platelets, growth factors, matrix proteins and intracellular components are all implicated and while the contribution of some of these has been delineated, the picture remains incomplete.

### Elevated levels of plasma von Willebrand factor and the risk of macro-and microvascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria [^112XrF4F]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to examine the concept suggesting that microalbuminuria in combination with high levels of plasma von Willebrand factor is a stronger predictor for cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications than microalbuminuria alone in type 2 diabetic patients.

Methods

One hundred and sixty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and persistent microalbuminuria were followed for an average of 3.8 (SD 0.3) years. 70% of the patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors. Patients in this subanalysis were divided into two groups according to baseline plasma von Willebrand factor levels below or above the median. The main outcome was cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft and revascularization or amputation of legs), progression to diabetic nephropathy or progression in diabetic retinopathy.

Results

At baseline the two groups were comparable for HbA(1c), fasting levels of s-total-cholesterol, s-HDL-cholesterol and s-triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, gender, known diabetes duration, smoking habits, previous cardiovascular disease and antihypertensive therapy as well as retinopathy. Odds ratio for cardiovascular disease was 1.11 (95% CI 0.45–2.73, P = 0.82) (multiple logistic regression), odds ratio for progression to nephropathy was 1.08 (0.41–2.85, P = 0.87) and odds ratio for progression in retinopathy was 0.96 (0.46–2.00, P = 0.92), all with plasma von Willebrand factor levels above the median.

Conclusions

Our results do not support the suggestion that the combination of high plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and microalbuminuria is a stronger predictor for cardiovascular disease, progression to diabetic nephropathy or progression in diabetic retinopathy than microalbuminuria alone in patients with type 2 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria.

### Beyond the guidelines: how we approach challenging scenarios in the diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease [^112o3sD9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Although von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, its diagnosis and management are often challenging. Clinical practice guidelines, developed through systematic review of the medical literature and considering the best available evidence, provide guidance for common clinical scenarios. However, in the clinical setting, patients often present with characteristics and nuances that may fall outside the realm of available evidence and guidelines, and hence, shared decision-making will be essential in the evaluation and management of these patients. The challenges in the diagnosis of VWD are mainly attributable to the heterogeneity of the disorder, limitations of laboratory assays, and the significant impact of various physiologic processes on von Willebrand factor. The impact of physiologic normalization of von Willebrand factor, which may occur in various settings such as pregnancy, inflammation, or aging, remains uncertain, as is the optimal management in these scenarios. Multidisciplinary and individualized care, based on evolving evidence supported by clinicians, patients, caregivers, and stakeholders, will be needed to ensure the highest quality care for those who live with VWD.

### Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension-a unrecognized cause of high-shear high-flow haemostatic defects (otherwise referred to as acquired von Willebrand syndrome) in children [^113cmmGe]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is reported in high-flow high-shear congenital cardiac disorders. We hypothesized that the narrowed pulmonary vasculature in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) may induce AVWS. We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of children with IPAH. Patients with bleeding symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, anomalies in coagulation screening tests) were tested in-depth for haemostatic defects. Fourteen children were followed with IPAH of which 8 were eligible. Four children exhibited abnormal bleeding scores (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool: 3–5). All 8 patients showed very prolonged platelet function analyser (PFA)-100 closure times. Six children demonstrated either mild thrombocytopenia or low-normal von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen (VWF:Ag) or VWF activity [mean (range), in iu/dl: VWF:Ag: 70 (61–91); VWF activity: 57 (34–70)]. Average VWF collagen binding capacity (VWF:CB) was 64 iu/dl (range: 53–123 iu/dl), with low-normal VWF activity/VWF:Ag or VWF:CB/VWF:Ag ratios occurring in five patients. All children had normal multimers distribution patterns. One patient underwent a lung transplantation, with normalization of haemostatic abnormalities post-surgery. Overall, 8 out of 14 children with IPAH had mild to moderate bleeding symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities in keeping with AVWS. Normalization of the haemostatic defects following lung transplantation and lack of family history of bleeding attests to the acquired nature of their defects.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11798kDm]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The reported prevalence of VWD is up to 1% in the general population based on epidemiologic studieswith a symptomatic prevalence ∼0.1% at the level of primary care. The prevalence of VWD is ∼15% in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, making it the most common inherited bleeding disorder known in humans.VWD is caused by deficiency or dysfunction of VWF, a multimeric glycoprotein that binds platelets at sites of vascular injury and stabilizes circulating coagulation factor VIII (FVIII).

Patients with VWD can experience easy bruising, bleeding from the oral cavity, heavy menstrual bleeding, as well as bleeding after dental work, surgical procedures, and childbirth. Joint bleeding may also occur in more severe deficiency. These symptoms vary among patients with VWD, and the bleeding phenotype can fluctuate throughout the life of a patient with VWD, leading to the need for accurate diagnosis of VWD types and subtypes and individualized management plans. Different types and subtypes of VWD have been defined depending on the type of abnormality in VWF. A patient with partial quantitative deficiency in VWF would have type 1 VWD, whereas a patient with virtual absence of VWF would have type 3 VWD. Patients with type 2 VWD have qualitative abnormalities of VWF: type 2A is characterized by reduced or absent high molecular weight VWF, type 2B results from a gain of function in VWF that increases its affinity for platelets, type 2M is caused by reduced VWF interactions with platelets or collagen, and type 2N results from reduced binding of VWF to FVIII.

Multiple variables that affect VWF levels can make confirming a clear diagnosis of VWD difficult. For example, estrogen therapy or pregnancy will lead to an elevation in VWF, obscuring the diagnosis of hereditary VWD in some women. Additionally, mildly reduced VWF:Ag and platelet-dependent VWF activity levels do not always establish a diagnosis of VWD; conversely, low normal VWF:Ag and platelet-dependent VWF activity do not always exclude the diagnosis. This is related, in part, to the VWF:Ag assays, which have good precision and reproducibility; however, the platelet-dependent VWF activity assay has greater variability, resulting in the potential for misdiagnosis and/or misclassification.

Data show that 43% of previously diagnosed patients with partial quantitative deficiency have normalized VWF levels with age. However, data are not available to show that an increase in VWF is accompanied by improvement in symptoms. This results in the need for health care providers to carefully consider excluding or removing the diagnosis.

### Von Willebrand disease-associated angiodysplasia: a few answers, still many questions [^113knjWM]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

The association between angiodysplasia and von Willebrand disease (VWD) has been known for more than 40 years. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract associated with angiodysplasia worsens the clinical course of this inherited haemorrhagic disorder and management may become difficult and challenging. Angiodysplasia associated with acquired defects or dysfunctions of von Willebrand factor (VWF) has also been reported in a variety of conditions such as monoclonal gammopathies, Heyde syndrome and in carriers of ventricular assist devices. The most recent advances concerning the mechanistic, clinical and therapeutic aspects of VWD-associated angiodysplasia are summarized in this review, together with the limitations of our knowledge that warrant further research in the frame of international cooperation.

### Von Willebrand disease: current status of diagnosis and management [^115K1zNd]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common bleeding disorder, affecting male and female individuals equally, that often manifests in mucosal bleeding. VWD can be secondary to a quantitative (Type 1 and Type 3) or qualitative (Type 2) defects in Von Willebrand factor (VWF). Initial testing includes VWF antigen, as well as a platelet binding assay to differentiate between qualitative and quantitative defects. Further subtyping requires additional testing and is needed to ensure appropriate treatment. Desmopressin, antifibrinolytics, hormonal treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, and VWF concentrates are commonly used in the treatment of VWD.

### Effects of anthocyanins on cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation in pre-hypertensive men: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover study [^116G9pMQ]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

High intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. A number of fruits and vegetables are rich in anthocyanins, which constitute a subgroup of the flavonoids. Anthocyanins have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, and anthocyanin-rich interventions have indicated beneficial effects on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors. We assessed whether a purified anthocyanin supplement improves cardiovascular metabolic risk factors and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in prehypertensive participants, and whether plasma polyphenols are increased 1–3 h following intake. In all, 31 men between 35–51 years with screening blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg without anti-hypertensive or lipid-lowering medication, were randomized in a double-blinded crossover study to placebo versus 640 mg anthocyanins daily. Treatment durations were 4 weeks with a 4-week washout. High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and blood glucose were significantly higher after anthocyanin versus placebo treatment (P = 0.043 and P = 0.024, respectively). No effects were observed on inflammation or oxidative stress in vivo, except for von Willebrand factor, which was higher in the anthocyanin period (P = 0.007). Several plasma polyphenols increased significantly 1–3 h following anthocyanin intake. The present study strengthens the evidence that anthocyanins may increase HDL-cholesterol levels, and this is demonstrated for the first time in prehypertensive and non-dyslipidemic men. However, no other beneficial effects in the short term were found on pathophysiological markers of cardiovascular disease.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a synopsis of the 2008 NHLBI / NIH guidelines [^116s7tr6]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediates blood platelet adhesion and accumulation at sites of blood vessel injury, and also carries coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) that is important for generating procoagulant activity. Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affects males and females, and reflects deficiency or defects of VWF that may also cause decreased FVIII. It may also occur less commonly as an acquired disorder (acquired von Willebrand syndrome). This article briefly summarizes selected features of the March 2008 evidence-based clinical and laboratory diagnostic recommendations from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Expert Panel for assessment for VWD or other bleeding disorders or risks. Management of VWD is also addressed in the NHLBI guidelines, but is not summarized here. The VWD guidelines are available at the NHLBI Web site (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/vwd).

### Molecular and cellular biology of von Willebrand factor [^1151QFhB]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand factor (vWF), a central protein in the regulation of blood coagulation, serves as a major adhesive link between platelets and the blood vessel wall and also functions as a carrier in plasma for factor VIII. Abnormalities of vWF result in von Willebrand disease (vWD), a common inherited human bleeding disorder. Deficient von Willebrand factor function has been proposed as potentially protective against the development of coronary vascular disease and several recent investigational therapies are directed at the vWF-platelet interaction. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the biosynthesis and processing of vWF and the relationship of vWF structure to function. Finally, recent progress in identifying specific genetic mutations responsible for the many variants of vWD is discussed.

### Biological correlates of blood pressure variability in elderly at high risk of cardiovascular disease [^112Gte6q]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. This study investigates biological correlates of intra-individual variability in blood pressure in older persons.

Methods

Nested observational study within the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) among 3,794 male and female participants (range 70–82 years) with a history of, or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Individual visit-to-visit variability in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (expressed as 1 SD in mm Hg) was assessed using nine measurements over 2 years. Correlates of higher visit-to-visit variability were examined at baseline, including markers of inflammation, endothelial function, renal function and glucose homeostasis.

Results

Over the first 2 years, the mean intra-individual variability (1 SD) was 14.4mm Hg for systolic blood pressure, 7.7mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure, and 12.6mm Hg for pulse pressure. After multivariate adjustment a higher level of interleukin-6 at baseline was consistently associated with higher intra-individual variability of blood pressure, including systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Markers of endothelial function (Von Willebrand factor, tissue plasminogen activator), renal function (glomerular filtration rate) and glucose homeostasis (blood glucose, homeostatic model assessment index) were not or to a minor extent associated with blood pressure variability.

Conclusion

In an elderly population at risk of cardiovascular disease, inflammation (as evidenced by higher levels of interleukin-6) is associated with higher intra-individual variability in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure.

ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 — cardiovascular disease and antithrombotic therapy in VWD emphasizes that the disease course is dynamic, the risk of complications increases over time, and the panel highlighted the importance of the cardioprotective effects of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulant therapy, if otherwise indicated, noting that a personalized treatment plan (eg, administration of VWF concentrate for prophylaxis) should be developed along with patient education. Consideration should be given to interventions that would limit the length of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy required (eg, non–drug-eluting stents). It should also be noted that bleeding is more of a risk in type 2 or type 3 VWD and in type 1 VWD with additional conditions such as FXI deficiency or a platelet function defect; prophylaxis with VWF concentrate and/or administration of tranexamic acid may be required in patients with a severe bleeding phenotype to minimize bleeding. The panel identified research priorities including studies on prophylaxis in VWD patients receiving antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy, on the incidence of cardiovascular disease in VWD, and on stent strategy comparisons for coronary artery stent placement.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the management of von Willebrand disease [^111UU1oS]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in von Willebrand disease — good practice statements, contraindications, and evidence emphasize shared decision making and low-certainty data. Good practice statements: Patients considered for treatment require individualized analyses of the risks and benefits of the specific therapy plan in conjunction with a multidisciplinary team that includes cardiovascular medicine specialists, hematologists, and the patient. Patient education about the risks and benefits of using antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy should be provided to inform a shared decision making. Desmopressin therapy is generally contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease) and/or increased risk of thrombosis. Evidence is limited: We found 2 case series reported in 3 sources; in an 8-patient case series, 1 patient died after experiencing intracranial posttraumatic bleeding while on aspirin after 11 years on therapy; across 2 observational studies, none of 6 patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin experienced thromboembolic events; and in the 26 patients with VWD in the series, there was 1 major bleeding event. In the 56 patients who received therapy and in the 9 patients who did not receive therapy even though it was recommended, outcomes such as median mortality, thrombotic events, serious adverse events, hospitalizations, and bleeding were low in both arms. The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit, and there is very low certainty that there is an effect on other outcomes.

Conclusions

The ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the diagnosis and management of VWD continue to be relevant based on an updated systematic review of the medical literature. Future research based on priorities outlined by the 2021 guideline panel using published definitions for clinical research in VWD will be critical to generating new data to strengthen the recommendations outlined in the current guidelines. To facilitate clinical trials of therapeutics for VWD, the coreVWD project has published a core outcome set for prophylaxis and perioperative treatment of VWD, including a special subset for women, girls, and people with the potential to menstruate. Periodic reassessment of the published literature will be necessary to trigger an update of the guidelines when sufficient evidence becomes available.

### High pulse pressure and nondipping circadian blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease: relationship to thrombogenesis and endothelial damage / dysfunction [^113as9MQ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with high ambulatory pulse pressure (APP) or nondipping pattern of circadian BP (nondippers) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease that may be due to abnormalities in coagulopathy and vascular function. We hypothesized that patients with high APP or nondipper status have an adverse hemostasis profile. Accordingly, we assessed hemorheology (by plasma viscosity and fibrinogen levels), endothelial damage/dysfunction (von Willebrand factor [vWf] and flow-mediated dilatation [FMD]), thrombogenesis (D-dimer), and platelet activation (soluble P-selectin).

Methods

Seventy-three patients (58 men, 59 ± 11 years) with stable coronary artery disease completed 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. Plasma viscosity was assessed on a Coulter viscometer, fibrinogen by Clauss, vWf, D-dimer and soluble P selectin by ELISA, and FMD by reactive hyperemia.

Results

High APP (median APP ≥ 51 mm Hg) and nondipping was associated with significantly higher levels of vWf, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and soluble P-selectin compared to patients with low APP and dippers, respectively (all P < .05), even after adjustment for ages, 24-h mean systolic, mean diastolic, and mean arterial BPs. After the same adjustments, as well as for dipping status, white coat effects, and left ventricular mass, patients with high APP also had more impaired FMD and still significantly higher levels of vWf and D-dimer, compared to patients with low APP (all P < .05). However, the highest levels of vWf, fibrinogen, and soluble P-selectin and the most impaired FMD were found in those nondipper patients with concurrent high APP.

Conclusions

High ambulatory pulse pressure or nondipping pattern of circadian BP per se are important pathophysiologic factors that may influence cardiovascular risk by altering hemostasis or endothelial function.

### Diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: guidelines for primary care [^1143F86Z]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease is an inherited condition characterized by deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which is essential in hemostasis. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has released new evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the disease. There are three major subtypes of von Willebrand disease, classified as partial quantitative deficiency (low levels) of von Willebrand factor (type 1), qualitative deficiency (type 2), or virtually complete deficiency (type 3). Diagnosis is usually made by reviewing the patient's personal and family history of bleeding and by clinical evaluation for more common reasons for bleeding, supplemented with laboratory tests. Assessment may be used to determine bleeding risk before surgery and other invasive procedures, and to diagnose reasons for unexplained hemorrhaging. Von Willebrand factor levels of 30 IU per dL or lower are required for the definite diagnosis of inherited von Willebrand disease. Persons with levels of 30 to 50 IU per dL may not have the disease, but may need agents to increase von Willebrand factor levels during invasive procedures or childbirth. Treatment is tailored to the subtype of the disease: increasing plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor by releasing endogenous stores with desmopressin or replacing nonexistent or ineffective von Willebrand factor by using human plasma-derived, viral-inactivated concentrates; treatment is often combined with hemostatic agents that have mechanisms other than increasing von Willebrand factor. Regular prophylaxis is seldom required, and treatment is initiated before planned invasive procedures or in response to bleeding.

### Clearance of von Willebrand factor [^1145NR3g]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Quantitative deficiencies in von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with abnormal hemostasis that can manifest in bleeding or thrombotic complications. Consequently, many studies have endeavored to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of VWF plasma levels. This review focuses on the role of VWF clearance pathways. A summary of recent developments are provided, including results from genetic studies, the relationship between glycosylation and VWF clearance, the contribution of increased VWF clearance to the pathogenesis of von Willebrand disease and the identification of VWF clearance receptors. These different studies converge in their conclusion that VWF clearance is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple mechanisms. Deciphering how such different mechanisms coordinate their role in this process is but one of the remaining challenges. Nevertheless, a better insight into the complex clearance pathways of VWF may help us to better understand the clinical implications of aberrant clearance in the pathogenesis of von Willebrand disease and perhaps other disorders as well as aid in developing alternative therapeutic approaches.

### Low VWF: insights into pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical management [^111UA8VK]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

von Willebrand disease (VWD) constitutes the most common inherited human bleeding disorder. Partial quantitative von Willebrand factor (VWF) deficiency is responsible for the majority of VWD cases. International guidelines recommend that patients with mild to moderate reductions in plasma VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) levels (typically in the range of 30–50 IU/dL) should be diagnosed with low VWF. Over the past decade, a series of large cohort studies have provided significant insights into the biological mechanisms involved in type 1 VWD (plasma VWF:Ag levels < 30 IU/dL). In striking contrast, however, the pathogenesis underpinning low VWF has remained poorly understood. Consequently, low VWF patients continue to present significant clinical challenges with respect to genetic counseling, diagnosis, and management. For example, there is limited information regarding the relationship between plasma VWF:Ag levels and bleeding phenotype in subjects with low VWF. In addition, it is not clear whether patients with low VWF need treatment. For those patients with low VWF in whom treatment is deemed necessary, the optimal choice of therapy remains unknown. However, a number of recent studies have provided important novel insights into these clinical conundrums and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the reduced levels observed in low VWF patients. These emerging clinical and scientific findings are considered in this review, with particular focus on pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical management of low VWF.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the management of von Willebrand disease [^1126mKgo]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Von Willebrand disease — desmopressin use (remarks and good practice statements) emphasizes that this recommendation does not apply to patients for whom desmopressin is not a reasonable treatment option and that desmopressin is contraindicated in type 3 VWD and type 2B VWD; many patients with type 2 VWD do not respond, and patients undergoing major surgery should not receive desmopressin as sole therapy. It is optimal to confirm desmopressin responsiveness, but adult patients with type 1 VWD whose baseline VWF levels are ≥ 0.30 IU/mL can be presumed responsive, whereas patients with type 1 VWD and VWF levels of < 0.30 IU/mL cannot be presumed responsive. The administration of desmopressin to patients with type 2B VWD is generally contraindicated, and desmopressin is generally contraindicated in patients with active cardiovascular disease, patients with seizure disorders, and patients age < 2 years. Patients receiving desmopressin are at risk for hyponatremia from free water retention; therefore, they should receive normal saline if IV fluid replacement is required, and oral free water intake should be restricted to prevent hyponatremia; counseling should include strategies to mitigate hyponatremia risk. Desmopressin has been used safely in many women during pregnancy, but it should be avoided in women with preeclampsia and those with cardiovascular disease, and IV fluid infusion and oxytocic medications during labor and delivery increase the risk of desmopressin‑induced hyponatremia.

### Criteria for low von Willebrand factor diagnosis and risk score to predict future bleeding [^115wSade]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein with an important role in primary hemostasis by binding platelets to subendothelial collagen at sites of vascular damage and by initiating platelet aggregation to form a platelet plug. 1, 2, 3 In addition, VWF is a carrier protein for coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), preventing its proteolytic degradation and thereby prolonging FVIII half‐life. 1, 3

A deficiency or an abnormal function of VWF, which is prevalent in approximately 1% of the general population, may lead to bleeding symptoms. 4, 5 Individuals with VWF levels below 0.30 IU/ml are diagnosed with von Willebrand disease (VWD). 1 Most patients with VWD have a significant bleeding phenotype and a VWF mutation, especially those with type 2 and type 3 VWD. 1 A milder decrease of VWF levels (i.e. levels of 0.31‐0.50 IU/ml) does not always lead to bleeding symptoms because only a small fraction of individuals with such VWF levels have a significant bleeding phenotype. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 As a consequence, it has been suggested that reduced VWF levels in the range of 0.31 to 0.50 IU/ml is a risk factor for bleeding and not a disease. 9, 10 According to current guidelines individuals with VWF levels of 0.31 to 0.50 IU/ml and a significant bleeding phenotype are classified as "low VWF". 6, 7, 8

### How I treat von Willebrand disorders in older adults [^1173VE7e]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common bleeding disorder and especially milder type 1 VWD might not be cared for in specialty clinics. VW factor levels rise with age, but the rise of these levels does not necessarily correlate with bleeding risk. A recent bleeding history combined with recent labs are important for hemostatic management decision during surgical interventions. Antifibrinolytics appear safe in the population of older adults, whereas desmopressin (DDAVP) should be used cautiously. Where needed, factor concentrates present a great treatment option. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is vastly underrecognized, but likely to surface in the aging, especially in the setting of comorbidities, such as plasma-cell dyscrasias. Intravenous immunoglobulin can be an effective treatment in this scenario, but potentially increases thrombotic risk.

von Willebrand's disease is one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders. Inherited and acquired disorders of coagulation and hemostasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of menorrhagia and abnormal uterine bleeding. This Committee Opinion provides screening recommendations for von Willebrand's disease and describes treatment options.

Key Points
- Von Willebrand disease is a blood disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.
- VWD is the most common bleeding disorder.
- Signs of VWD include nosebleeds, easy bruising, heavy menstrual bleeding, and longer than normal bleeding after injury, surgery, dental work, or childbirth. Normally, when a person is injured and starts to bleed, the VWF in the blood attaches to small blood cells called platelets. This helps the platelets stick together, like glue, to form a clot at the site of injury and stop the bleeding. When a person has VWD, because the VWF doesn't work the way it should, the clot might take longer to form or form incorrectly and bleeding might take longer to stop. This can lead to heavy, hard-to-stop bleeding. Although rare, the bleeding can be serious enough to damage joints or internal organs, or even be life-threatening.
- In type 2A, the VWF is not the right size and doesn't help the platelets attach together in order to form a clot.
- In type 2B, the VWF attaches to platelets at the wrong time. The body removes the platelets attached to VWF, causing a reduced amount of both platelets and VWF in the blood when needed to form a clot.
- In type 2M, the VWF does not attach to the platelets as it should, which decreases the platelets' ability to form a clot when an injury occurs.
- In type 2N, the VWF attaches to the platelets normally. However, the VWF does not attach to another protein, factor VIII, which is also needed for blood to clot. This causes the body to remove the factor VIII protein.

Heavy menstrual bleeding Women with VWD might have heavy menstrual periods during which they experience
- Soaking through a pad or tampon every 1–2 hours on the heaviest day
- Menstrual bleeding that lasts longer than 7 days from the time bleeding starts until the time it ends
- Flooding or gushing of blood
- Passing blood clots larger than the size of grapes or strawberries
- A diagnosis of anemia is made as a result of bleeding from heavy periods.

### Diagnosing von Willebrand disease… [^115sqcxV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Complete blood count This common test measures the amount of hemoglobin, the size and number of red blood cells, and the numbers of different types of white blood cells and platelets found in blood. The CBC is normal among people with VWD. However, if a person with VWD has unusually heavy bleeding or bleeds for a long time, the hemoglobin and the red blood cell count can be low. Activated partial thromboplastin time test This test measures how long it takes for blood to clot. It measures the clotting ability of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. If any of these clotting factors is too low, it will take longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will show a longer clotting time among some people with VWD. However, the results of this test will be normal among people with mild VWD.

Prothrombin time test This test also measures the time it takes for blood to clot. It measures primarily the clotting ability of factors I, II, V, VII, and X. If the level of any one of these factors is too low, it will take longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will be normal among most people with VWD. Fibrinogen test This test also helps doctors assess a patient's ability to form a blood clot. This test is ordered either along with other blood clotting tests or when a patient has an abnormal PT or APTT test result, or both. The results of this test will be normal among people with VWD. Fibrinogen is another name for clotting factor I.

The blood tests that a doctor can order to diagnose VWD include:

- Factor VIII clotting activity―To measure the amount of factor VIII in the blood
- Von Willebrand factor antigen―To measure the amount of VWF in the blood
- Ristocetin cofactor or other VWF activity―To measure how well the VWF works
- Von Willebrand factor multimers―To measure the makeup or structure of the VWF
- Platelet aggregation tests―To measure how well the platelets are working.

Key points
- Von Willebrand disease occurs with equal frequency among men and women, affecting up to 1% of the general population.
- Women are more likely to experience symptoms of VWD because of the increased bleeding it causes during their menstrual periods, during pregnancy, and after childbirth. Prevalence Von Willebrand disease occurs with equal frequency among men and women, affecting up to 1% of the general population. However, women are more likely to experience symptoms of VWD because of the increased bleeding it causes during their menstrual periods, during pregnancy, and after childbirth. Between 2012 and 2023, more than 33, 456 men, women, and children were seen at hemophilia treatment centers for treatment of VWD. About two thirds of them were women and girls. Complications In a CDC study of 102 women with all types of VWD compared to 88 controls:

- The most commonly reported bleeding symptoms among women with VWD were: heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding after minor injuries, and excessive gum bleeding
- 74% of women with VWD reported excessive bleeding from several sites or following several procedures or injuries compared to 6% of controls.
- 41% of women with VWD reported a diagnosis of migraine headaches compared with 13% of controls.
- 37% of women with VWD reported a diagnosis of arthritis compared with 15% of controls.
- 37% of women with VWD compared with 10% of controls indicated that their menstrual period limited routine work, social activities and had a negative effect on life.
- The most common bleeding symptoms were heavy menstrual bleeding in women and nosebleeds in men.
- 45% of women and 50% of men with VWD reported excessive bruising.
- 40% of women and 47% of men with VWD reported excessive bleeding with surgery.
- 34% of women and 29% of men with VWD reported dental bleeding.
- 21% of women and 26% of men with VWD had received a blood transfusion.
- 76% of men with VWD had been diagnosed by age 10, but 50% of women with VWD were not diagnosed until after age 12.
