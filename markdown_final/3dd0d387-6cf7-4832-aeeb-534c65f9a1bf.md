## Question

what exam findings would make polymyalgia less likely in someone with neck pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which physical examination findings would make polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) less likely in a patient presenting with neck pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype of PMR and how neck pain fits into that pattern. Then, I should verify the typical distribution of pain and stiffness and whether it is bilateral and proximal. Next, I will examine the expected inflammatory signs on exam, including morning stiffness duration and tenderness patterns. After that, I need to check for atypical features that point away from PMR, such as focal neurologic deficits, isolated distal or unilateral symptoms, true muscle weakness, and normal inflammatory markers. Finally, I will consider mimics that can confound the picture and synthesize the key exam findings that lower the likelihood of PMR in neck pain presentations.

> Let me first confirm the core PMR phenotype so I don't jump to conclusions. PMR typically presents in patients over 50 years with new-onset bilateral shoulder and/or hip girdle pain and stiffness, often with neck involvement, and prominent morning stiffness lasting more than 45 minutes; muscle strength is usually preserved despite pain-limited motion, and inflammatory markers are usually elevated, although exceptions exist [^115K9gsr] [^111HBBL1] [^113SU3FH] [^114e9q8Y].

> Wait, let me verify the distribution and symmetry expectations. PMR pain and stiffness are characteristically bilateral and proximal, involving the shoulder and hip girdles, with the neck commonly included but not in isolation. Unilateral neck pain without concurrent bilateral shoulder or hip symptoms would be atypical and should lower suspicion for PMR, as should purely distal or focal radicular pain patterns [^114e9q8Y] [^113s5jgk] [^117MvHAM].

> I need to check the inflammatory features on exam. PMR typically shows tenderness around the shoulders and paraspinal neck muscles, with restricted passive and active range of motion due to pain and stiffness, especially in the morning. True muscle weakness is not expected, and if present, I should reconsider the diagnosis and evaluate for myositis or other neuromuscular causes [^113SU3FH].

> Hold on, I should verify the duration of morning stiffness because it is a key discriminator. Morning stiffness lasting at least 45 minutes is a consistent feature in classification frameworks and supports PMR. Stiffness lasting only a few minutes or absent in the morning makes PMR less likely, particularly when combined with a lack of systemic inflammatory features or normal ESR/CRP [^114e9q8Y] [^113SU3FH].

> Let me consider age and systemic features carefully. PMR is rare before age 50, so in younger patients with neck pain I should be cautious and look for alternative diagnoses; likewise, the absence of constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, or low-grade fever, together with normal inflammatory markers, reduces the likelihood of PMR and should prompt evaluation for degenerative or mechanical etiologies [^115K9gsr] [^111HBBL1].

> I will now examine focal neurologic signs because they are red flags against PMR. The presence of focal neurologic deficits, pathologic reflexes, or clear radiculopathy on exam points toward cervical radiculopathy, myelopathy, or other structural disease rather than PMR, which is a systemic periarticular inflammatory process without focal nerve root involvement [^113WW878] [^117MvHAM].

> But wait, what if the neck pain is acute, severe, and febrile with marked rigidity? That pattern should raise concern for crowned dens syndrome due to CPPD at the atlantoaxial joint, which can mimic PMR or even meningitis. CT demonstrating calcifications around the dens would confirm this and steer management away from glucocorticoids toward NSAIDs or colchicine, making PMR less likely in that scenario [^116btHQb] [^111f4hxX].

> Let me think about mimics that can confound the picture. Isolated neck pain from cervical spondylosis or facet arthropathy, fibromyalgia without inflammatory labs, hypothyroidism with diffuse pain, and early seronegative rheumatoid arthritis can all resemble aspects of PMR. Careful exam for small joint synovitis, thyroid dysfunction, and the absence of PMR's bilateral proximal girdle pattern helps differentiate these entities and lowers the probability of PMR when the story does not fit [^113NBoSM] [^112wXBpZ].

> I should double-check the synthesis so I don't miss anything. In a patient with neck pain, PMR becomes less likely when the pain is isolated, unilateral, or purely distal; when morning stiffness is brief or absent; when muscle strength is reduced; when there are focal neurologic signs; when inflammatory markers are normal without systemic features; or when the patient is younger than 50 years; conversely, bilateral proximal girdle involvement, prolonged morning stiffness, and preserved strength despite pain-limited motion increase the likelihood of PMR [^115K9gsr] [^111HBBL1] [^114e9q8Y].

---

In a patient with neck pain, PMR is less likely when the following are present: **age < 50 years** [^115K9gsr], **normal ESR/CRP** [^113SU3FH], **absence of bilateral shoulder/hip girdle stiffness** [^111HBBL1], **focal neurologic deficits** [^113WW878], or **prominent distal small-joint involvement** [^113NBoSM]. PMR is also less likely with **normal passive range of motion** [^115K9gsr], **isolated neck pain without proximal girdle symptoms** [^116jSL9c], or a **poor response to low-dose prednisone** [^113SU3FH]. These findings should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as cervical spondylosis, radiculopathy, myopathy, or inflammatory arthritis [^113NBoSM].

---

## Clinical features that make PMR less likely

### Demographic factors

Age < 50 years makes PMR unlikely, as it predominantly affects individuals ≥ 50 years [^115K9gsr] [^112waiDL].

---

### Laboratory findings

Normal ESR/CRP makes PMR less likely, as elevated inflammatory markers are typical [^113SU3FH] [^115LYpJv].

---

### Clinical presentation

- **Absence of bilateral shoulder/hip girdle stiffness**: PMR typically presents with bilateral proximal girdle stiffness [^115LYpJv].

- **Focal neurologic deficits**: Suggests radiculopathy or myelopathy rather than PMR [^notfound].

- **Prominent distal small-joint involvement**: Favors inflammatory arthritis (e.g. RA) over PMR [^113NBoSM].

- **Normal passive range of motion**: PMR usually causes restricted motion due to pain/stiffness [^113SU3FH].

- **Isolated neck pain without proximal girdle symptoms**: Atypical for PMR [^117VikSX].

---

### Response to treatment

A **poor response to low-dose prednisone** makes PMR less likely, as most patients respond rapidly [^113SU3FH] [^115LYpJv].

---

## Alternative diagnoses to consider

When PMR is less likely, consider:

- **Cervical spondylosis**: Degenerative changes causing neck pain/stiffness [^112wXBpZ].

- **Cervical radiculopathy**: Nerve root compression with neurologic deficits [^notfound].

- **Inflammatory arthritis**: RA or other seronegative arthropathies [^116jSL9c].

- **Myopathy**: Proximal muscle weakness with elevated CK [^113NBoSM].

- **Fibromyalgia**: Chronic widespread pain without inflammatory markers [^113NBoSM].

---

## Clinical features making PMR less likely

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | < 50 years |
| Laboratory findings | Normal ESR/CRP |
| Clinical presentation | - Absence of bilateral shoulder/hip girdle stiffness <br/> - Focal neurologic deficits <br/> - Prominent distal small-joint involvement <br/> - Normal passive range of motion <br/> - Isolated neck pain without proximal girdle symptoms |
| Response to treatment | Poor response to low-dose prednisone |

---

In patients with neck pain, PMR is less likely when age is < 50, inflammatory markers are normal, proximal bilateral girdle stiffness is absent, neurologic deficits are present, distal small joints are prominently involved, range of motion is normal, pain is isolated without proximal symptoms, or there is a poor response to low-dose prednisone. These findings should prompt evaluation for **alternative diagnoses** such as cervical spondylosis, radiculopathy, inflammatory arthritis, myopathy, or fibromyalgia.

### Diagnosis… [^1128NaFs]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The disorder is a clinical syndrome characterized by pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders and hips, fatigue, weight loss and low-grade fever. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually elevated, and the response to corticosteroid therapy is generally dramatic. Autoimmune responses are believed to play a prominent role in polymyalgia rheumatica, with bursitis, synovitis and tenosynovitis of the proximal shoulder and hip girdles being characteristic features.
3. Laboratory tests revealed elevation of the ESR to 105 mm per hour and the presence of a normochromic, normocytic anemia. All other studies were normal. Radiographs of the cervical spine and both shoulders revealed mild degenerative changes in her cervical spine, but no other abnormalities. A presumptive diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica without temporal arteritis was made, and the patient was started on prednisone in a dosage of 20 mg taken orally each morning.

She was instructed to begin range-of-motion exercises for her shoulders. The patient demonstrated a stunning response to prednisone, with almost complete cessation of all neck, shoulder and arm pain. Her sleep improved, her mood lightened and her ESR fell to 39 mm per hour in two weeks. Within four weeks, she was able to resume golf and other activities. The clinical hallmarks of polymyalgia rheumatica are pain and stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle. Stiffness is greatest in the morning and lasts 30 to 60 minutes after patients arise. Patients complain of similar stiffness after prolonged sitting or reclining. The pain is most severe in the neck, shoulders and buttocks. Treatment Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. Typically, the response is dramatic, with symptoms improving within 48 to 72 hours after treatment is initiated.

A trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be attempted in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. If no response occurs in two to four weeks, corticosteroid therapy is initiated. The starting dosage of prednisone ranges from 5 to 20 mg per day. After symptoms resolve, the corticosteroid is tapered by 2. 5 mg every two to four weeks until a dosage of 10 mg per day is reached. Then the prednisone is tapered by 1 mg every two to four weeks until a dosage of 5 mg per day is attained.

### Real-world outcomes of a dedicated fast-track polymyalgia rheumatica clinic [^113N35nG]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To examine the clinical impact of a fast-track PMR clinic to enable early diagnosis and treatment, and to define both patient and disease characteristics in newly diagnosed PMR.

Methods

Primary care physicians were invited to refer patients with new PMR to our fast-track clinic. Referral criteria included new onset shoulder or pelvic girdle pain and/or stiffness with elevated inflammatory markers in patients over 50 years. All patients were seen within 72 h of referral. Patients with a rheumatology diagnosis of PMR had an US of their temporal and axillary arteries.

Results

172 patients were referred from primary care over 12 months. 39% of patients referred with suspected PMR had an alternative diagnosis for which PMR regimen glucocorticoids was inappropriate. 55% of the non-PMR diagnoses were other inflammatory rheumatological conditions requiring follow-up. Only 20% of patients referred from primary care already on glucocorticoids were commenced on bone protection. PMR patients were comorbid, with a mean of 2.5 other conditions. 75% of PMR patients experienced a glucocorticoid-related adverse event in the first 12 months of treatment. 17% of patients with new PMR had US features of subclinical GCA.

Conclusion

The commencement of glucocorticoid therapy should be deferred until after specialist evaluation to enable an accurate clinical diagnosis. A delay in treatment can only realistically be avoided if general practitioners have access to a fast-track PMR clinic. We believe that rheumatologists should consider establishing fast-track PMR clinics and this study provides a strong case for and a template to support this practice innovation.

### A history of polymyalgia rheumatica: a narrative review [^116keoZY]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulders, hips and neck and presents most commonly in the eighth decade. It can coexist with giant cell arteritis and the two diseases may share some pathophysiological mechanisms. This narrative review considers present-day ideas about PMR in a historical context, from the first names and descriptions of this disease entity, via successive generations of classification criteria sets, and finally to implications for clinical diagnosis. The characteristic distribution of musculoskeletal inflammation in PMR and its relationship to vasculitic and synovitic diseases have framed the way that PMR is described, classified, diagnosed and treated. A response to glucocorticoids is not specific to PMR and so it is important for rheumatologists to support general practitioners in making a definite diagnosis. Multi-stakeholder collaboration will improve current pathways for fast, accurate diagnosis and safe and effective treatment.

Rheumatology key messages
PMR shares many symptoms with a wide range of inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.
Specialist referral of PMR patients should be considered given potential diagnostic complexity and glucocorticoid side-effects.
Deferring glucocorticoid treatment in suspected PMR until after specialist review may allow more accurate diagnosis.

### Joint involvement in patients with early polymyalgia rheumatica using high-resolution ultrasound and its contribution to the EULAR / ACR 2012 classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica [^111h6eZM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess joint involvement and the contribution of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) to the novel European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) 2012 classification criteria in patients with polymyalgia rheumatic (PMR).

Methods

MSUS was performed in 54 consecutive patients with recent-onset PMR.

Results

Biceps tenosynovitis of at least 1 shoulder has been observed in 70.4% of patients, and 64.8% had a bilateral biceps tenosynovitis. Subdeltoid bursitis (27.8% unilateral, 5.6% bilateral), glenohumeral synovitis (22.2% unilateral, 9.3% bilateral), and hip involvement (22.2% unilateral, 16.7% bilateral) were observed less frequently. The sensitivities of the classification criteria were 85.2% for EULAR/ACR without MSUS and 81.5% for EULAR/ACR with MSUS.

Conclusion

The most common MSUS pathology was a biceps tenosynovitis. However, US findings had no effect on the sensitivity of the novel EULAR/ACR criteria for PMR.

### History, physical examination, and differential diagnosis of neck pain [^115c9WrM]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Neck pain is a common and costly problem in Western society. Nearly two-thirds of the US population will experience neck pain at some point in their lives, and at any one time about 5% of the US population has sufficient neck pain to cause disability. Although the likelihood of defining a precise cause of neck pain is low, if the etiology and structural source can be determined, they may be valuable in directing treatment. Patient history serves to identify red flags and yellow flags, whereas the physical examination, guided by the history, serves primarily to confirm those suspicions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to clinical evaluation, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to assess for and exclude relevant mimicking conditions (non-inflammatory, inflammatory, drug-induced, endocrine, infective, and neoplastic) as part of the initial evaluation of patients with PMR.

Patients and eligibility criteria

Enrolled patients (aged ≥ 50 years) met the 2012 EULAR/ACR provisional classification criteria for PMRand had a confirmed PMR diagnosis. Eligible patients must have experienced a clinical response to glucocorticoids following PMR diagnosis and must have had two or more episodes of unequivocal PMR flare while attempting to taper glucocorticoids (prednisone dose ≥ 5 mg/day or equivalent at the time of flare and the most recent flare within 24 weeks of baseline). Unequivocal PMR flare was defined as clinical signs and symptoms of PMR (shoulder and/or hip girdle pain with inflammatory stiffness, neck pain with inflammatory stiffness, or new or worsened limited range of motion in the hips and/or shoulders) resulting in increased glucocorticoid dose. Inflammatory stiffness associated with flares was determined by the expert clinical judgments of the investigators based on patient‐reported symptoms and findings on physical examination; however, the study protocol did not specify any assessment of specific markers of inflammation. Patients must not have exhibited any clinical signs or symptoms of PMR within two weeks of baseline. They must have received a stable glucocorticoid dose (prednisone 5–15 mg/day or equivalent) for two or more weeks before baseline and must not have been treated with a prior TNF antagonist. Patients with giant cell arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis not due to PMR, or a positive test for anticitrullinated protein were ineligible.

Malignancy

One important differential diagnosis in PMR is malignant diseases. PMR manifestations could represent a paramalignant symptom of occult cancer. Patients with PMR who do not respond to a prednisolone daily dose of 15–25 mg or have a rapid recurrence of symptoms directly after tapering of GCs should alert the treating physician to the possibility of an underlying malignant disease. Careful medical history and clinical examination together with basic laboratory screening are mandatory to make a correct diagnosis. Physicians treating a so‐called atypical or treatment‐resistant PMR need to consider relevant radiologic examination to rule out the possibility of an underlying cancer.

Remitting seronegative symmetric synovitis with pitting oedema syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterised by the onset of symmetrical small joint arthritis with oedema of the hands and feet, typically in elderly men who are rheumatoid‐factor negative. This condition usually responds well to a short course of oral GCs and should be one of important differential diagnosis for PMR. A similar phenotype may be seen in paramalignant syndromes.

Others

Noninflammatory degenerative diseases such as cervical spondylosis and hip joint osteoarthritis may mimic the presentation of PMR with symptoms like pain and morning stiffness. Radiologic confirmation of osteoarthrosis (OA) or spondylosis together with absence of active inflammatory parameters will favour the diagnosis of spondylosis and OA rather than PMR. Hypothyroidism is a common disease among female patients with clinical presentation of diffuse pain, fatigue and a fibromyalgia‐like syndrome. Checking serum levels of thyroid hormones is an important part of the investigation of female patients with pain syndrome.

### The crowned dens syndrome as a cause of neck pain: clinical and computed tomography study in patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease [^111HWWWr]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between articular chondrocalcinosis and calcification of the atlantoaxial region on a cervical computed tomography (CT) scan and to explore the relation between such calcifications and neck pain.

Materials and Methods

CT slices of the cervico-occipital junction were performed routinely in 49 consecutive patients (male/female ratio 28/21; mean age 70.4 yrs), diagnosed with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease (CPPD). Of these, 35 met criteria for definite CPPD and 14 met the criteria for probable. The cervical CT scans were analyzed for the presence of periodontoid calcifications by 2 independent musculoskeletal radiologists. Both assessors were blinded to the disease status of the patients. Furthermore, conventional radiographs of the upper cervical spine were performed. An ad hoc designed protocol was used to register information at diagnosis, including age, sex, location of pain and stiffness, fever, presence of synovitis and its location.

Results

CT scan of the cervico-occipital junction showed periodontoid calcified deposits in 25 out of 49 patients (51%) with CPPD. In 10 of the 25 cases (40%) with periodontoid calcified deposits, CT scanning showed osseous abnormalities of the odontoid process, such as subchondral cysts or erosions. Conventional radiographs showed calcification behind the odontoid process in 17 patients (34.7%). Nine of CPPD cases (18.4%) presented with neck symptoms. In three patients, articular chondrocalcinosis was revealed only by an acute attack of neck pain with segmentary stiffness, fever, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate; in one of them initial clinical examination found cervical stiffness with Kernig's and/or Brudzinski's sign. For the other two patients, impairment of general condition, occipito-temporal and mandible pain and weakness with inflammatory pain of the shoulder girdle was suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and/or polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). In the six additional patients, questioning elicited a history of previous subacute or chronic neck pain, from one week to one year before their admission to our ambulatory or hospital.

Conclusions

These results suggest that CPPD deposition disease frequently involves the cervical spine. Although such calcification often remains asymptomatic, it may be associated with attacks of acute neck pain with segmentary stiffness, fever, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sometimes mimicking PMR and/or GCA or neurological symptoms.

### Neck pain: initial evaluation and management [^113WW878]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Neck pain is a common presenting symptom in the primary care setting and causes significant disability. The broad differential diagnosis requires an efficient but global assessment; therefore, emphasis is typically placed on red flags that can assist in the early recognition and treatment of more concerning diagnoses, such as traumatic injuries, infection, malignancy, vascular emergencies, and other inflammatory conditions. The critical element in appropriate diagnosis and management of these conditions is an accurate patient history. Physical examination findings complement and refine diagnostic cues from the history but often lack the specificity to be of value independently. Diagnostic tools such as imaging and electrodiagnostic tests have variable utility, especially in chronic or degenerative conditions. Treatment of mechanical or nonneuropathic neck pain includes short-term use of medications and possibly injections. However, long-term data for these interventions are limited. Acupuncture and other complementary and alternative therapies may be helpful in some cases. Advanced imaging and surgical evaluation may be warranted for patients with worsening neurologic function or persistent pain.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^114xuhad]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — methotrexate (MTX) use (Recommendation 7) states that the panel conditionally recommends considering early introduction of MTX in addition to GCs, particularly for patients at high risk of relapse and/or prolonged therapy and in cases with risk factors, comorbidities and/or concomitant medications where GC-related adverse events are more likely; MTX may also be considered during follow-up in patients with a relapse, without a significant response to GC or experiencing GC-related adverse events. In clinical trials, MTX has been used at oral doses of 7.5–10 mg/week, and in practice may be considered for example in female patients with high initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 40 mm/hour), peripheral inflammatory arthritis and/or comorbidities that may be exacerbated by GC therapy.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^11169TWx]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease affecting people older than 50 years and is 2–3 times more common in women. The most common symptoms are pain and morning stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle and the onset may be acute or develop over a few days to weeks. General symptoms such as fatigue, fever and weight loss may occur, likely driven by systemic IL-6 signalling. The pathology includes synovial and periarticular inflammation and muscular vasculopathy. A new observation is that PMR may appear as a side effect of cancer treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on symptoms and signs combined with laboratory markers of inflammation. Imaging modalities including ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with computed tomography are promising new tools in the investigation of suspected PMR. However, they are still limited by availability, high cost and unclear performance in the diagnostic workup. Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is effective in PMR, with most patients responding promptly to 15–25 mg prednisolone per day. There are challenges in the management of patients with PMR as relapses do occur and patients with PMR may need to stay on GC for extended periods. This is associated with high rates of GC-related comorbidities, such as diabetes and osteoporosis, and there are limited data on the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics as GC sparing agents. Finally, PMR is associated with giant cell arteritis that may complicate the disease course and require more intense and prolonged treatment.

### Polymyalgia manifestations in different conditions mimicking polymyalgia rheumatica [^115MLkXG]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a generally benign syndrome involving the neck, shoulder, and hip girdles in the elderly. However, none of the clinical and laboratory findings are specific for this syndrome. Different diseases may present with features suggesting PMR. The consideration of other conditions which in some cases resemble PMR is very important, as their therapy and prognosis differ completely from that of PMR. Four patients presenting with typical PMR manifestations, who were finally diagnosed as having conditions very different from PMR, are described. The importance of the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with polymyalgia symptoms is underlined.

Introduction

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the second most frequent inflammatory immune-mediated disease following rheumatoid arthritis in people over the age of 50 years. Women are more likely to be affected by PMR. The symptoms of PMR include severe proximal muscle pain and morning stiffness, especially in the shoulder and neck, and, less frequently, in the pelvic girdle. Fatigue, arthralgia, weight loss, anorexia and low grade fever are common.

Provisional classification criteria of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) include age ≥ 50 years, increased inflammatory markers, shoulder and pelvic girdle pain, morning stiffness, negative rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated antibodies, and conspicuous findings on shoulder and hip ultrasound. The diagnosis of PMR should be based on typical clinical signs and symptoms, and exclusion of other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder and hip osteoarthritis, and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. However, diagnosis of PMR remains challenging due to the non-specific or generic symptoms as well as the heterogeneous presentation and course of disease.

Particularly proximal muscle pain and stiffness in PMR are linked to an inflammatory immune response. About 30% of PMR cases are associated with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a chronic inflammatory vasculitis with similar demographic features. Both disorders show elevated IL-6 levels and an imbalance between proinflammatory T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and immunosuppressive T regulatory (Treg) cells, contributing to systemic inflammation.

According to the 2015 EULAR/ACR recommendations, standard therapy for PMR is oral glucocorticoid (GC) treatment with initial prednisolone doses of 12.5–25 mg, aiming for the lowest effective dose due to long-term side effects. Off-label use of methotrexate (MTX) may be an option for PMR patients who suffer from GC-related toxicity or disease relapse although evidence is sparse. Recent trials of IL-6 receptor inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) have shown superior efficacy over placebo, and new therapies are in development. Sarilumab was recently approved by the FDA and the EMA for PMR patients with inadequate GC response or relapse. Patients treated with sarilumab had higher rates of sustained remission and lower cumulative GC doses compared with placebo. Another monoclonal antibody, the IL-17A inhibitor secukinumab, is currently under phase 3 evaluation.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) recommendations — general use emphasizes that these recommendations should be understood as clinical advice and do not dictate the care of a particular patient, and that the EULAR and ACR consider adherence to be voluntary, with the physician making the ultimate decision to apply them in light of each patient's individual circumstances.

### Laboratory evaluation in neck pain [^112zHKx7]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Laboratory investigations for neck pain play a minor role in most cases. When clinical suspicion of infection or tumor arises, however, laboratory testing can provide definitive information to direct the patient's care. Specialized laboratory testing including autoantibody titers can be useful in confirming and categorizing inflammatory arthritides. Judicious use of laboratory tests greatly enhances the physician's ability to provide appropriate care.

### Recognition and management of polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis [^113s5jgk]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica affects proximal muscles and joints, causing disability in older adults. Giant cell arteritis affects medium and large arteries and can result in blindness. These conditions overlap significantly, often occurring together. Despite the similarities, each has distinct symptoms, corticosteroid dosing requirements, and prognosis. The hallmark of both conditions is inflammation. Polymyalgia rheumatica primarily affects the shoulders, neck, and hips with prominent bilateral pain. Systemic findings such as fatigue and weight loss are common, and there is no definitive diagnostic test. Moderate-dose corticosteroid therapy with a slow taper rapidly resolves symptoms. Management of patients responding to treatment can occur in the primary care setting, if there is no concomitant giant cell arteritis. The clinical presentation of giant cell arteritis varies widely, from new-onset headache and constitutional symptoms, to jaw claudication, to less common isolated visual changes and upper extremity claudication. Treatment requires higher dosages of corticosteroids and urgent referral to a rheumatologist. Relapse is common in both diseases. Surveillance is important, as is monitoring for long-term complications of corticosteroid use. Osteoporosis management and gastrointestinal ulcer prophylaxis should be initiated. The primary care physician's coordination of care with a rheumatologist and with other subspecialists, if needed, is essential in the management of giant cell arteritis.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^115y9fYD]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, PMR is a common disorder and sometimes a major clinical challenge. Further studies on pathophysiology are needed to better understand the disease mechanisms as a basis for future targeted therapies. IL‐6 inhibition is a particularly promising therapeutic concept, but more data are needed. Furthermore, there is a need for better diagnostic methods, including further development of imaging modalities, to facilitate diagnosis and adequate treatment.

Introduction

PMR is one of the most common inflammatory rheumatic conditions in patients over 50 years, with a higher prevalence among women and in those of North European ethnicity. The annual rate of incidence of PMR is estimated between 0.12 and 2.3 cases/1000 people aged over 50 years. The incidence increases progressively with age, with a peak incidence occurring in those between 70 and 79 years of age. The phenomenon of global population ageing will likely further contribute to an increased incidence over the coming decades. PMR is commonly characterized by pain and stiffness of the shoulders and hip girdle, but some patients may have features of peripheral arthritis or interspinal bursitis. Shoulder and hip girdle symptoms may also be the presenting feature of many other rheumatic and non-rheumatic conditions. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, malaise and weight loss may be present which overlap with the symptoms of large vessel vasculitis and should prompt further evaluation of patients. To add to the complexity of presentation, it has been reported that almost a quarter of patients presenting with clinically isolated PMR have evidence of GCA on imaging studies suggesting a disease continuum that has been recently described as GCA-PMR Spectrum Disease. PMR is frequently accompanied by a rise in acute inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP concentrations, but this is not always the case. Consequently, it is essential to re-evaluate the concept of PMR, viewing it not as a monolithic clinical entity but rather as a complex, multifaceted clinical syndrome part of a larger spectrum of disease which includes GCA.

### MRI of shoulder girdle in polymyalgia rheumatica: inflammatory findings and their diagnostic value [^116H8Mms]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, we examined only one shoulder in all cases, though it is worth to be discussed whether an MRI scan of a single unilateral region is sufficient to diagnose a systemic disease which usually affects multiple musculoskeletal regions. However, our results show that an MRI-based definition of the underlying inflammatory pattern in only one clinically affected test region might be suitable to foster the diagnosis, especially in synopsis with clinical and laboratory data. Probably it would improve if additional regions like the contralateral shoulder or pelvic girdle were included, combining distributional and local pathomorphological pattern of inflammation.

For diagnostic and classificatory purpose, it might be helpful to include these non-synovial imaging findings as an additional criterion. An appropriate approach was made by Nakamura et al, who investigated 137 patients with a fraction of 58 patients suffering from PMR with shoulder girdle MRI and US in each case. They found enhancement of joint capsule and rotator cuff tendons in addition to joint effusion and focal bone marrow oedema (BME) the most significant differentiating findings in PMR compared with findings in non-PMR group. This MRI-based finding differentiated PMR from non-PMR group with a sensitivity/specificity of 76%/85% if two imaging findings from rotator cuff tendon enhancement, capsule enhancement and focal BME were positive. Whereas biceps tenosynovitis and subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis as detected by US performed with a shortened sensitivity/specificity of 50%/72%. By replacing the US criteria with these MRI criteria in the EULAR/ACR provisional classification they improved sensitivity from 86% to 93% while specificity remained constant.

### Clinical features of polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis [^116SKvV3]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are inflammatory diseases that typically affect white individuals > 50 years. Women are affected ∼2–3 times more often than men. PMR and GCA occur together more frequently than expected by chance. The main symptoms of PMR are pain and stiffness in the shoulders, and often in the neck and pelvic girdle. Imaging studies reveal inflammation of joints and bursae of the affected areas. GCA is a large-vessel and medium-vessel arteritis predominantly involving the branches of the aortic arch. The typical clinical manifestations of GCA are new headache, jaw claudication and visual loss. PMR and GCA usually remit within 6 months to 2 years from disease onset. Some patients, however, have a relapsing course and might require long-standing treatment. Diagnosis of PMR and GCA is based on clinical features and elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Temporal artery biopsy remains the gold standard to support the diagnosis of GCA; imaging studies are useful to delineate large-vessel involvement in GCA. Glucocorticoids remain the cornerstone of treatment of both PMR and GCA, but patients with GCA require higher doses. Synthetic immunosuppressive drugs also have a role in disease management, whereas the role of biologic agents is currently unclear.

### Longitudinal clusters of pain and stiffness in polymyalgia rheumatica: 2-year results from the PMR cohort study [^114XyhTE]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

PMR, a relatively common inflammatory rheumatological condition, is underresearched, especially in primary care, where the majority of patients are exclusively diagnosed and managed. PMR causes disabling pain and stiffness in the shoulder and hip girdles, often accompanied by elevated inflammatory markers (e.g. ESR, CRP), but it can present atypically or with non-specific symptoms, especially in the early stages. The mainstay of treatment is with oral glucocorticoids, which typically, although not always, bring about rapid relief of symptoms and improve physical function. Guidelines suggest a gradual tapering of glucocorticoid treatment over 18–24 months, although recent evidence suggests that treatment is often required for longer, which may increase the likelihood of experiencing potentially serious treatment-related adverse effects.

To date, the majority of PMR research has been conducted in secondary care settings, which given the guidance on indications for referral for specialist review, potentially induces spectrum bias (i.e. study samples including patients with atypical presentation and/or more severe/difficult to treat disease). We therefore have little knowledge of the course of PMR in relation to its symptoms or treatment in the setting in which it is most frequently diagnosed and managed.

In order to provide an evidence base to understand the wider epidemiology of PMR, the PMR Cohort Study was established in 2012. To our knowledge, this inception cohort of patients with PMR, recruited in England at the time of diagnosis, is the only prospective large-scale study of incident PMR in a primary care setting. A key aim of this cohort, supported by patient groups, is to better understand the prognosis of the condition. This may identify subgroups of patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids as expected or who are otherwise suitable for early interventions.

In this article we use latent class growth models in data from the PMR Cohort Study to derive clinically recognizable groups of patients with differing patterns of pain and stiffness over 2 years. We consider whether the presentation of a patient at the time of diagnosis is different in those who go on to have different symptom trajectories.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica: an autoinflammatory disorder? [^1174bUf7]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Summary of our interpretation of scientific data on polymyalgia rheumatica, in the view of its classification in the spectrum of immune-mediated diseases.

Age of onset and gender distribution are inconclusive in discriminating the prevalent autoinflammatory or autoimmune nature of PMR (figure 2C). Indeed, both in ADs and AIDs elderly onset is rare, and the main determinant of the onset age is the monogenic (childhood) or polygenic (adulthood) nature of the disease. Further, the preferential involvement of woman in PMR (female to male ratio = 2:1) seems related to a different and currently unknown mechanism than the arise in oestrogen production reported as one of the main determinants of the female prevalence in typical ADs, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (female to male ratio = 9:1).

Laboratory findings lean towards a predominant role of innate immune response in PMR. Indeed, a remarkable increase of inflammatory markers is one of the most consistent features in patients with both PMR and AIDs, so that it is included into the diagnostic criteria and monitoring parameters for both conditions. Increase of acute phase reactants can also occur in ADs, but with lower frequency and diagnostic accuracy (figure 2D). Further, autoantibodies carrying a significant pathogenic and/or diagnostic role have not been identified in PMR, as well as in AIDs, whereas they are frequently associated to prototypical ADs (eg, anti-double-stranded DNA in SLE, anti-citrullinated peptide in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) (figure 2E). Noteworthy, lack of pathogenetic autoantibodies is typically recorded in other immune-mediated diseases, such as the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-pathies (eg, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis) that are reported as prototypical mixed autoinflammatory/autoimmune disorders in the immunological continuum.

### Comparison and validation of FDG-PET / CT scores for polymyalgia rheumatica [^1127GoGa]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

PMR is the rheumatic inflammatory disease with the highest incidence above the age of 50. Patients with PMR develop debilitating pain and stiffness of the shoulder and hip girdle related to inflammation of articular and peri-articular structures. Most patients demonstrate an acute-phase response in the blood. PMR is frequently associated with GCA, an autoimmune vasculitis affecting large and medium-sized arteries.

The diagnosis of PMR can be challenging, since none of the symptoms and laboratory tests are entirely specific for the disease. For instance, elderly patients with late-onset SpA or OA may also present with predominant shoulder and hip complaints. An acute-phase response can also be observed in patients with RA, malignancies or para-infectious muscle pain. Current classification criteria for PMR (e.g. the 2012 EULAR/ACR criteria and Chuang criteria) have been instrumental for the conduct of research, but are not intended as diagnostic criteria.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — methotrexate (MTX) with glucocorticoids (GCs) may be co-administered with oral or i.m. GCs, with evidence from four randomized controlled trials and one retrospective study of MTX plus oral GCs using initial prednisone 15 to 25 mg/day; however, randomized trials enrolled a small total sample (n = 194), a reduction in GC-related adverse events with MTX has not been demonstrated, and the panel nevertheless felt that earlier discontinuation of GC and a lower cumulative GC dose in MTX users decreases the likelihood of GC-related side effects, with studies showing moderate to high quality of evidence for benefit in remission, relapse rate, discontinuation of GC, and cumulative GC dose while very low quality evidence also indicated no benefit for some outcomes.

### Longitudinal clusters of pain and stiffness in polymyalgia rheumatica: 2-year results from the PMR cohort study [^114dV4Jc]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Due to our recruitment strategy, we were reliant on the GP to accurately diagnose PMR. To ensure this, we provided all participating practices with a copy of the most recent BSR guidelines on the diagnosis of PMR. To improve diagnostic accuracy further, we constructed a set of criteria based on clinical symptoms considered suggestive of PMR. While the clusters derived from our LCGA were similar after applying these criteria, ∼30% of people did not meet them. This may reflect inaccurate diagnosis in primary care, but may also reflect a difference in opinion between primary and secondary care on what constitutes PMR, especially in the context of multimorbidity. However, as we do not have data related to other morbidities, we were unable to relate the different pain and stiffness trajectories to the presence of other comorbidities (e.g. OA, GCA) or medications. The potential co-occurrence of GCA is a particular point to consider, as people with PMR are known to also have GCA in up to 20% of cases. While it is unlikely that the presence of GCA has a dramatic effect on the reporting of pain and stiffness from PMR, it may influence glucocorticoid doses and hence symptom reporting.

Implications for research and practice

We have successfully identified a group of people with a classical PMR presentation, where current treatment guidelines appear to be appropriate. However, we have also identified a group that may not have PMR and may require more robust diagnostic processes, potentially involving additional investigations, periods of close monitoring or early specialist referral for diagnostic clarification or alternative interventions. The logical next steps for research should be to develop processes to identify these two groups at an early stage. Attention should then be paid to those remaining, who display some response to glucocorticoid treatment but do not maintain a full reduction in symptoms in the long-term. Further studies need to address whether the use of adjunctive treatments (e.g. exercise) are of benefit. Future research should therefore consider how best to stratify patients at initial diagnosis to identify those with potential differential diagnoses or a need for a different treatment pathway (e.g. adjunctive physiotherapy, rheumatology management).

In the meantime, clinicians, especially those in primary care, should be aware of the potential for PMR to be a more heterogeneous condition than the literature suggests. In particular, they should consider alternative diagnoses in those who do not respond as expected to glucocorticoids in the first month and be aware of the potential for the return of symptoms or inability to taper their treatment effectively over time.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica-like syndrome from checkpoint inhibitor therapy: case series and systematic review of the literature [^1111crWZ]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has caused a paradigm shift in the field of oncology, producing significant survival benefits in patients with an ever-growing list of malignancies. Their use, however, is attended by a spectrum of immune related adverse events (irAEs), both general and rheumatic, which threaten their overall effectiveness. A critical and presently unanswered question is what proportion of these rheumatic irAEs represent the occurrence of classic rheumatic diseases or, alternatively, represent new clinical variants with potentially different pathogenesis, clinical course and treatment responsiveness. Despite scattered clinical descriptions, little is known about the polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)-like entity that has been described in the setting of checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICI). In our experience with rheumatic irAEs we have increasingly encountered patients presenting with PMR-like clinical phenotypes. Traditional PMR still remains a poorly understood syndrome of unknown aetiology and without a diagnostic laboratory test. Clinicians generally rely on the presence of a compatible clinical picture combined with the detection of inflammatory markers as well as corticosteroid response as a 'test of treatment' to establish the diagnosis. A joint working group from American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) described a provisional set of classification criteria for PMR, incorporating select elements of the history and physical exam combined with select laboratory and imaging findings. It is the purpose of this study to address whether cases of PMR reported as irAEs are consistent with that defined by these current classification criteria. Here, we describe in detail the largest series of patients to date with the PMR-like syndrome in the setting of ICI therapy as well as all previous case reports to determine if they meet the 2012 EULAR/ACR provisional criteria for PMR.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis… [^111WeqF1]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The disorder is a clinical syndrome characterized by pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders and hips, fatigue, weight loss and low-grade fever. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually elevated, and the response to corticosteroid therapy is generally dramatic. Autoimmune responses are believed to play a prominent role in polymyalgia rheumatica, with bursitis, synovitis and tenosynovitis of the proximal shoulder and hip girdles being characteristic features.
3. On physical examination, the patient appeared distressed, but she was afebrile and had normal blood pressure and pulse. Marked tenderness to palpation was present over the paracervical and trapezius muscles and the glenohumeral joints. Muscle bulk, tone and strength were normal, but she displayed decreased range of motion in internal and external rotation, flexion and extension of both shoulders. Attempts to abduct either arm above 90 degrees produced marked pain.

She had no tenderness, pain or obvious swelling over her temporal arteries. An incidental finding was mild pitting edema of her lower extremities. Laboratory tests revealed elevation of the ESR to 105 mm per hour and the presence of a normochromic, normocytic anemia. All other studies were normal. Radiographs of the cervical spine and both shoulders revealed mild degenerative changes in her cervical spine, but no other abnormalities. A presumptive diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica without temporal arteritis was made, and the patient was started on prednisone in a dosage of 20 mg taken orally each morning. She was instructed to begin range-of-motion exercises for her shoulders. The patient demonstrated a stunning response to prednisone, with almost complete cessation of all neck, shoulder and arm pain. Her sleep improved, her mood lightened and her ESR fell to 39 mm per hour in two weeks. Within four weeks, she was able to resume golf and other activities.

The clinical hallmarks of polymyalgia rheumatica are pain and stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle. Stiffness is greatest in the morning and lasts 30 to 60 minutes after patients arise. Patients complain of similar stiffness after prolonged sitting or reclining. The pain is most severe in the neck, shoulders and buttocks. Treatment Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. Typically, the response is dramatic, with symptoms improving within 48 to 72 hours after treatment is initiated.

### MRI of shoulder girdle in polymyalgia rheumatica: inflammatory findings and their diagnostic value [^115fBsso]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study of real-world data, we present a relatively large cohort of patients with shoulder girdle pain, but the significance of our findings is limited by the retrospective nature and concept of the study. Shoulder girdle pain at the time of examination was the only clinical criterion for disease activity, information regarding symptom duration and already initiated therapy were not obtained, therefore, the influence of these factors cannot be addressed. Our reference standard was expert rheumatological diagnosis only, which reflects the real-world scenario of our data but limits its accuracy. As well classification of the non-PMR cases to six subgroups represents a rough simplification of the often-complex clinical scenario. A preselection of the PMR cases with more cases referred to MRI with discrepancy between presumptive diagnosis and clinical appearance is also possible, in addition patients with GCA and concomitant PMR are underrepresented in our study population since those run through a different diagnostic algorithm in our institution focusing on vasculitis detection by FDG-PET/CT or MRI with detection of PMR-related inflammation en passant. Furthermore, non-synovial inflammatory findings are reported in detail in our institution and this could have influenced clinical decision-making, leading to a circular reasoning our study might be impaired. Therefore, these findings cannot be generalised and must be confirmed in prospective studies. Besides, our routine imaging protocol was suboptimal for the detection of peritendinous inflammation of intramuscular segments of rotator cuff muscles. Addition of a contrast-enhanced oblique sagittal T1w sequence could eliminate partial volume effects and improve detection of peritendinous inflammation.

In conclusion, PMR exhibits a rather characteristic inflammatory pattern in the shoulder girdle consisting of peritendinous, periligamentous and capsular inflammation. Bursal, tenovaginal and articular synovitis are frequent concomitant findings but with less discriminatory potential from other causes of shoulder girdle pain. MRI of the shoulder girdle is a reliable imaging tool with significant diagnostic value in assessment of patients suffering from PMR.

Conclusion

Our findings support the notion that ICI-PMR is a different disease entity than primary PMR. Although ICI-PMR and primary PMR share a cluster of symptoms related to inflammation in the shoulder and hip girdle, ICI-PMR is associated with less intense inflammation and a lower treatment requirement than primary PMR. Although subsequent studies are necessary, our findings provide a framework for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this new PMR-like syndrome.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis: evidence and guidelines for diagnosis and management in older people [^112grNPF]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis commonly present for the first time in older people. Guidelines for diagnosis, investigation and management are available but have largely been developed by rheumatologists from studies where older people have been excluded. It is not clear whether geriatricians care for a group of patients with different clinical presentations compared to those under the care of other clinicians. There is a need for further prospective studies and randomised controlled trials to clarify a host of outstanding issues to improve the care of older people with polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.

### Accuracy of musculoskeletal imaging for the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica: systematic review [^113bUnfJ]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Literature searches were completed on 2 October 2013, yielding 1764 citations (figure 1). We identified 87 articles for full text review of which 23 studies from the original searches were chosen for full evaluation, with three further added on updating searches (January 2015): 10 ultrasound scanning studies (including one published in full text on the updated search); 6 MRI studies; 1 USS and MRI study; 7 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) studies (including two published in full text when the search was updated); 1 plain radiographyand 1 technetium scintigraphystudy. These last two studies did not meet our review inclusion criteria, one because of a lack of clear distinction between PMR and non-PMRand the other because it was published in 1976 and we could not exclude the possibility that changes in definition of the diagnostic reference standard may have occurred since then. Additionally, we reviewed four longitudinal studies. Vascular imaging studies in patients with a diagnosis of PMR were also initially reviewed (six ultrasound and two PET), but subsequently excluded as the primary purpose of these studies was to diagnose giant cell arteritis in patients presenting with PMR symptoms.

Figure 1
Flow chart for systematic review.

Study characteristics and results of quality assessment are shown in table 2. All but one of the studies we identified used a diagnostic case–control design, which is associated with inflation of sensitivity and specificity estimates because of the 'grey cases' seen in real-life clinical practice but omitted from the study. Other common sources of bias in this analysis included incomplete blinding of the person(s) performing the imaging test, diagnostic review bias (incomplete blinding of the diagnostician acting as reference standard) and spectrum bias (studies were generally conducted in academic rheumatology centres) (table 2). Table 3 summarises the accuracy of each imaging feature in PMR, using meta-analysis where appropriate. Original data used to create this table and further details regarding comparator subpopulations are found in the online supplementary. Many different abnormalities were reported by the studies, reflecting the widespread localisation of inflammation in PMR.

### Subacute bacterial endocarditis presenting as polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis [^113wAdTJ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report on several patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis who were initially presumed, incorrectly, to have polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis.

Methods

We report 3 cases of subacute streptococcal endocarditis mimicking giant cell arteritis in 2 cases and polymyalgia rheumatica in one. We reviewed the literature through Medline search of French and English-language articles published between 1966 and 2005 and found 5 similar cases.

Results

Shoulder and/or pelvic girdle pain was associated with neck or back pain in all patients. Scalp tenderness, bilateral jaw pain, amaurosis fugax were present in 2 patients. One patient had no fever. Two patients were treated with corticosteroids with initial good clinical response in one. Appropriate antibiotic therapy resulted in the rapid disappearance of rheumatic complaints in 2 patients and achieved a definitive cure of endocarditis in all cases.

Conclusion

Rheumatologic symptoms may hinder the correct diagnosis of infective endocarditis in patients who present with a clinical picture suggesting polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis. In such cases, blood cultures should be systematically drawn.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica [^111w289B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on polymyalgia rheumatica:

- **Definition**: PMR is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder associated with synovitis, tenosynovitis, and bursitis of proximal large joints.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of PMR remains unknown. Genetic polymorphisms in intercellular adhesion molecules and interleukins have been associated with an increased risk. Epidemiological studies have suggested that infectious triggers (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parvovirus B19, Chlamydia pneumoniae) may have a role in disease pathogenesis.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of PMR in the US is 63.9 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: PMR is associated with predominant inflammation of periarticular structures (bursitis, tenosynovitis), although synovitis has also been reported. Hallmark clinical features include pain and stiffness involving the neck or torso, shoulders or proximal regions of the arms, and hips or proximal aspects of the thighs. Although myalgias are prominent symptoms in patients with PMR, muscle inflammation is not typically seen.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Symptoms of PMR typically respond rapidly to low-dose prednisone or prednisolone (≤ 20 mg). Patients with PMR have reduced QoL at time of diagnosis, which improves with treatment. Overall survival is similar to that of the general population.

### Diagnostic value of [18F] FDG-PET / CT in polymyalgia rheumatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115szvcD]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

[18F]FDG-PET/CT may be a valuable diagnostic tool in the work-up of patients with suspected PMR, and this study provides insight into specific anatomic sites on [18F]FDG-PET/CT that are informative for a diagnosis of PMR. A composite [18F]FDG-PET/CT score might also be of interest, but agreement on the preferred anatomic sites in such composite score is awaited. Depending on the clinical probability of PMR, [18F]FDG-PET/CT may help to rule in or rule out the diagnosis. Furthermore, [18F]FDG-PET/CT aids in the detection of other serious conditions in part of patients. Further studies are needed to more precisely estimate the diagnostic accuracy of [18F]FDG-PET/CT for PMR. Such studies should ideally have a prospective study design, include all consecutive patients with suspected PMR and adhere to reported procedural recommendations and interpretation criteria for [18F]FDG-PET/CT in PMR.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica patients with and without elevated baseline acute phase reactants: distinct subgroups of polymyalgia rheumatica? [^116Kfs7D]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease characterised by pain and stiffness of neck, shoulder- and hipgirdle, typically with elevated acute phase reactants (APR). However, patients may present with normal APR. Our aim was to explore whether normal APR were due to 1) 'caught early in the disease', 2) misdiagnosis, or 3) a distinct subset of PMR with different clinical presentation and prognosis.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study on patients with clinical PMR diagnosis visiting the rheumatologists of the Sint Maartenskliniek from April 2008 to September 2017.

Results

Of 454 patients, 62 patients had normal, and 392 elevated APR. Normal APR patients had longer symptom duration before diagnosis (13 vs. 10 weeks; p = 0.02), however, during follow-up 31% developed elevated APR. In elevated APR patients with previous APR data available while already symptomatic, 58% had earlier normal APR. Fewer normal APR patients had peripheral arthritis (2% vs. 9%; p = 0.04), and anaemia (17% vs. 43%; p = 0.001). More often they had a previous PMR diagnosis (16% vs. 8%; p = 0.057) and a shorter median time to glucocorticoid-free remission (552 vs. 693 days; n = 36 vs. 160; p = 0.02). Route of GC administration differed between groups (p = 0.026). Fewer patients received methotrexate; 3 vs. 12%; p = 0.046). No difference in alternative diagnosis was observed.

Conclusions

PMR patients with long-term normal APR seem to be a milder subset of PMR in clinical presentation and prognosis. Additionally, our data also suggest there is a subgroup with normal APR who are caught early in the disease. Misdiagnosis does not appear to play a role.

### Concordance and agreement between different activity scores in polymyalgia rheumatica [^116bNtRL]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a chronic inflammatory disease that occurs in people > 50 years of age and is characterised by an increase in acute inflammatory reactants, inflammatory pain in the girdles, inflammatory lumbar or cervical pain, morning stiffness and nocturnal awakenings. The reference treatment is glucocorticoids for up to 18 months. Treatment is managed by practitioners during the follow-up based on clinical and inflammatory parameters and the absence of giant cell arteritis.

Disease activity scores are recommended for chronic diseases to target treatment efficacy homogeneously, to define remission and to stop treatment to limit the duration of exposure. A disease activity score must be simple and practical to use. This score must discriminate between clinical situations and identify differences between the treatment group and control group in trials. It must be truthful, unbiased and relevant. The score must also be based on characteristic symptoms of the disease. It should not be influenced by confounding factors such as a treatment that can normalise one of the parameters regardless of its effectiveness. In addition, then, the score must be validated.

In PMR, the tools used in therapeutic trials to evaluate disease activity have been heterogeneous, using (alone or in combination) the absence of inflammation on biological parameters or the clinical improvement of the patients (subjective parameters) assessed by the investigator and/or the ability to decrease the dosage of glucocorticoids. In 2004, an EULAR activity score, the polymyalgia rheumatica activity score (PMR-AS), was devised by a group of expertsand published by Leeb and Birdfor monitoring treatment in clinical practice and for use in therapeutic trials. The C reactive protein polymyalgia rheumatica activity score (CRP-PMR-AS) was used in this study to distinguish this score from the other ones proposed. After a literature review, the identification of several biological and clinical items by experts was validated in a cohort of 76 patients with PMR and in a replication cohort, and a core set of response criteria was defined. This final core set included five parameters, with one biological item (CRP), one patient-reported outcome (pain intensity), one morning stiffness duration, one physician's evaluation of global activity and one clinical item (elevation of the upper limbs) examination. The CRP-PMR-AS has thresholds defining remission (< 1.5) and high disease activity (> 17) with good sensitivity for improvement or relapse and a high internal validation. Since its development, it has been used in several therapeutic trials.

Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are inflammatory conditions that occur predominantly in people 50 years and older, with peak incidence at 70 to 75 years of age. Polymyalgia rheumatica is more common and typically presents with constitutional symptoms, proximal muscle pain, and elevated inflammatory markers. Diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica is clinical, consisting of at least two weeks of proximal muscle pain, constitutional symptoms, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica includes moderate-dose glucocorticoids with a prolonged taper. Giant cell arteritis, also known as temporal arteritis, usually presents with new-onset headache, visual disturbances or changes, constitutional symptoms, scalp tenderness, and temporal artery symptoms. Inflammatory markers are markedly elevated. Temporal arterial biopsy should be used for diagnosis. However, color duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography may be helpful when biopsy is negative or unavailable. All patients with suspected giant cell arteritis should receive empiric high-dose glucocorticoids because the condition may lead to blindness if untreated. Tocilizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for giant cell arteritis and should be considered in addition to glucocorticoids for initial therapy. Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis respond quickly to appropriate dosing of glucocorticoids but typically require prolonged treatment and have high rates of relapse; therefore, monitoring for glucocorticoid-related adverse effects and symptoms of relapse is necessary. Methotrexate may be considered as an adjunct to glucocorticoids in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis who are at high risk of relapse.

### Ultrasound imaging for the rheumatologist XLIII. ultrasonographic evaluation of shoulders and hips in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica: a systematic literature review [^114JNopB]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US) has lately been applied to patients with polymyalgia rheumatica for the examination of shoulders and hip, and included in the 2012 PMR classification criteria. We aimed to perform a comprehensive overview of the literature on this topic with a systematic review.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library and the proceedings from EULAR and ACR congresses (2011–2012). We included studies evaluating patients with confirmed or suspected PMR, undergoing US of shoulders and/or hips. The diagnosis of PMR could be based on expert opinion or diagnostic criteria. Cohort, case-control, diagnostic accuracy studies and case-series were eligible for inclusion. The features of the included studies were presented. When available, sensitivities and specificities were calculated for primary studies.

Results

Out of 1736 papers identified by our search, 13 articles and 1 abstract were finally included in the review. Eight studies focused on shoulder US, 1 on hip US, 4 on both. Studies were extremely variable in terms of population, US examination, reference standard and control population. In general, at the shoulder, pathological bilateral US findings in most studies were more prevalent in patients with PMR compared to controls. When sensitivity and specificity could be calculated, bilateral findings were more sensitive. Notably, less information was available on hip US.

Conclusions

US (especially in shoulder examination) is confirmed to be a potentially useful instrument to integrate clinical information in the management of patients with PMR. Its additional value in conjunction with the new classification criteria should be further tested.

### Clinical value of FDG-PET / CT for the evaluation of rheumatic diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and relapsing polychondritis [^115ZxTNC]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

FDG is a tracer for visualizing glucose metabolism. PET/CT using FDG is widely used for the diagnosis of cancer, because glycolysis is elevated in cancer cells. Similarly, active inflammatory tissue also exhibits elevated glucose metabolism because of glycolysis in activated macrophages and proliferating fibroblasts. Elevated FDG uptake by active inflammatory tissues, such as those affected by arthritis, vasculitis, lymphadenitis, and chondritis, has enabled the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases using FDG-PET/CT. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic inflammation of the joints resulting in synovitis. Several clinical studies of RA have demonstrated that FDG uptake in affected joints reflects the disease activity of RA, with strong correlations between FDG uptake and various clinical parameters having been noted. Furthermore, the use of FDG-PET for the sensitive detection and early monitoring of the response to RA therapy has been reported. RA is sometimes associated with subclinical vasculitis, which is related to systemic inflammation. FDG-PET/CT can be used to evaluate subclinical vasculitis in the aorta or carotid artery. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an autoimmune musculoskeletal disease of unknown etiology characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulder, neck, and pelvic girdle, but not in the small finger joints in the hands, together with fever, fatigue, and weight loss. There is no specific test for PMR, and its diagnosis is based on clinical diagnostic criteria and the exclusion of other diseases with similar symptoms. However, FDG-PET/CT reveals a characteristic FDG uptake by the bursitis in ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, lumbar or cervical spinous process, and scapulohumeral joint. A combination of FDG-PET/CT findings showed a high diagnostic value for PMR in a differential diagnosis from RA. FDG-PET/CT is also very useful for evaluating large vessel vasculitis, which is often associated with PMR. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare multisystem disease of unknown etiology involving cartilaginous and proteoglycan-rich structures. Its rarity and diversity of symptoms often result in a delayed diagnosis. FDG-PET/CT reveals unique FDG uptake findings for chondritis in the auricular, nasal, trachea, bronchial tree, and costal cartilage and in the cartilage of joints. Thus, the spread of knowledge regarding these very specific FDG-PET/CT findings could promote the early diagnosis and improved disease control of relapsing polychondritis.

- high risk or occurrence of therapy-related side effects

- PMR refractory to corticosteroid therapy

- occurrence of relapses or need for prolonged therapy.

Clinical presentation and disease course

A characteristic feature of PMR is a new and relatively acute onset of proximal muscle pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, hips and thighs. Patients often suffer from a pronounced morning stiffness with difficulty turning in or getting out of bed in the morning with some spontaneous relief of symptoms later in the day. The stiffness affects even other physical activities in the morning, including getting dressed or taking care of other daily activities. The symptoms are usually fully developed within a few days to a couple of weeks. Occasionally, the onset is more insidious and may lead to nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgia, loss of appetite, weight loss or fever. It is not unusual that some patients undergo investigations for suspicion of malignant disease before the diagnosis can be made with PMR.

The nonspecific clinical presentation and the absence of specific laboratory findings or serologic features often leads to some diagnostic delay. PMR imposes a major burden on the daily life of elderly people. The psychological impact is significant, including anxiety related to active disease and side effects of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic review [^115LYpJv]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are related inflammatory disorders occurring in persons aged 50 years and older. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are heterogeneous in clinical practice.

Objective

To summarize current evidence regarding optimal methods for diagnosing and treating PMR and GCA.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from their inception dates to March 30, 2016. Screening by 2 authors resulted in 6626 abstracts, of which 50 articles met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool or American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association methodology.

Findings

Twenty randomized clinical trials for therapy (n = 1016 participants) and 30 imaging studies for diagnosis and/or assessing response to therapy (n = 2080 participants) were included. The diagnosis of PMR is based on clinical features such as new-onset bilateral shoulder pain, including subdeltoid bursitis, muscle or joint stiffness, and functional impairment. Headache and visual disturbances including loss of vision are characteristic of GCA. Constitutional symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers (> 90%) are common in both diseases. Ultrasound imaging enables detection of bilateral subdeltoid bursitis in 69% of PMR patients. In GCA, temporal artery biopsy remains the standard for definitive diagnosis. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of large vessels revealing inflammation-induced wall thickening support the diagnosis of GCA (specificity 78%-100% for ultrasound and 73%-97% for MRI). Glucocorticoids remain the primary treatment, but the optimal initial dose and tapering treatment regimens are unknown. According to consensus-based recommendations, initial therapy for PMR is prednisone, 12.5 to 25 mg/day or equivalent, and 40 to 60 mg/day for GCA, followed by individualized tapering regimens in both diseases. Adjunctive methotrexate may reduce cumulative glucocorticoid dosage by 20% to 44% and relapses by 36% to 54% in both PMR and GCA. Use of tocilizumab as additional treatment with prednisone showed a 2- to 4-fold increase in remission rates of GCA in a randomized clinical trial (N = 30).

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnosis of PMR/GCA is made by clinical features and elevated inflammatory markers. In PMR, ultrasound imaging may improve diagnostic accuracy. In GCA, temporal artery biopsy may not be required in patients with typical disease features accompanied by characteristic ultrasound or MRI findings. Consensus-based recommendations suggest glucocorticoids as the most effective therapy for PMR/GCA. Methotrexate may be added to glucocorticoids in patients at risk for relapse and in those with glucocorticoid-related adverse effects or need for prolonged glucocorticoid therapy.

### Longitudinal clusters of pain and stiffness in polymyalgia rheumatica: 2-year results from the PMR cohort study [^111L36L2]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is unclear whether PMR is a single condition with multiple phenotypes or a group of conditions. It is unlikely that all of the heterogeneity seen in primary care is attributable to diagnostic inaccuracy. The spectrum of presentation, as well as varying responses to treatment, are made all the more difficult with the high level of multimorbidity in this group. The complex interaction of comorbidities and polypharmacy on the presentation and subsequent response to treatment is largely unknown in PMR but may be critical in our understanding of the condition. Future work should aim to delineate these subconditions early in the disease course in order for patients to receive appropriate management.

### Neck pain from a rheumatologic perspective [^11156dWF]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This article provides a comprehensive review of rheumatologic considerations for a clinician when evaluating a patient with neck pain. Clearly, anatomic derangements of the cervical spine should be considered when a patient complains of cervicalgia. However, one must also entertain the possibility of a systemic illness as the cause of the pain. Examples of diseases that may present with a prominent feature of neck pain are discussed, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, myositis, and fibromyalgia. Evidence of an underlying rheumatic illness may guide the clinician in a different therapeutic direction.

### Imaging in polymyalgia rheumatica: which technique to use? [^116nLdCE]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PM) is an inflammatory rheumatic disorder characterised by pain and stiffness, mainly in the neck, shoulders, and pelvic girdle and possible association with giant cell arteritis. Currently, there is no diagnostic gold standard for PM, however, an extensive assessment of patients' inflammatory status aided by imaging evaluation is crucial for disease stratification. Many imaging techniques study PM features and their possible complications or associations with giant cell arteritis: radiography, ultrasound, scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Each one has different advantages and disadvantages. The aim of this review is to clarify the current uses of imaging in PM for diagnosis and follow-up through a literature review of the last 10 years.

### Interleukin-6: a promising target for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis? [^117N4Eoz]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology affecting people aged over 50. The hallmark manifestations of PMR are pain and stiffness affecting the neck and shoulder and pelvic girdles. There is no specific laboratory test for the disease, and thus the diagnosis of PMR depends on a combination of clinical symptoms, raised acute phase reactants, the exclusion of other diagnoses and response to glucocorticoids (GCs). For classification purposes, a number of criteria have been proposed and the most recent were collectively drawn up by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a type of vasculitis of large-sized and medium-sized arteries affecting people aged over 50. The disease usually involves aorta, supra-aortic branches and the extracranial branches of the carotid artery. The clinical manifestations include headaches, temporal artery or scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, constitutional symptoms and PMR manifestations. At the time of diagnosis, the most serious consequence of GCA is the occurrence of visual loss in 12–14% of patients. Aortic aneurysm or dissection may develop during follow-up and can be potentially life-threatening. The gold standard for the diagnosis of GCA remains temporal artery biopsy (TAB). Approximately 60–80% of TABs show evidence of vasculitis with a mononuclear cell infiltrate, disruption of the internal elastic lamina and multinucleated giant cells, the hallmark of the disease, in ∼50% of patients. However, ACR classification criteria were developed in patients who already have evidence of vasculitis and do not take into account the additional value of imaging techniques. Indeed, ultrasonography of TAB may reveal a hypoechoic halo sign and is considered to be highly specific for GCA diagnosis despite interobserver and interstudy discrepancies. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) is a valuable method for the detection of occult arterial involvement of the aorta or large vessels in patients with GCA.

### Crowned dens syndrome: report of three cases and a review of the literature [^116btHQb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with crowned dens syndrome (CDS), which is pseudogout of the atlantoaxial junction induced by "crown-like" calcifications around the dens, present with symptoms of severe neck pain, rigidity, and high fever. CDS patients are often misdiagnosed as having meningitis or polymyalgia rheumatica, leading to potentially unnecessary invasive procedures for diagnosis and treatment.

Case Report

We report 3 patients with CDS who had characteristic findings on computed tomography (CT), all of whom quickly recovered with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) administration. In addition, we reviewed 72 published cases, including our patients. CDS typically occurs in elderly people (mean age 71.4 years). Common symptoms include neck pain (100%), neck rigidity (98%), and fever (80.4%), and most show elevated inflammatory markers (88.3%) on serum laboratory tests. Neck pain on rotation is a characteristic and helpful symptom in the diagnosis. The most useful modality is CT (97.1%), showing linear calcium deposits around the dens, mostly in the transverse ligament of atlas (TLA). CT number is especially helpful to distinguish a normal TLA (35–110 HU) from a calcified one (202–258 HU) in our cases. The most effective treatment is NSAID administration (85%), which usually leads to marked resolution of symptoms within days or weeks. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Due to acute and severe symptoms, CDS patients often present to an emergency department. To avoid unnecessary invasive procedures for diagnosis and treatment, CDS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile neck pain.

### An update on polymyalgia rheumatica [^112waiDL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a rheumatic disorder associated with musculoskeletal pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulder and hip area. The aetiology is not fully understood, but there are associated environmental and genetic factors. The incidence of PMR increases with age and is rarely seen in people under the age of 50. Women are approximately 2–3 times more likely to be affected by PMR than men. The annual incidence varies geographically and is highest in Scandinavian countries and people of northern European descent. Figure 1 illustrates the variation in the global incidence of PMR. In Sweden, the incidence of PMR ranges from 34 to 50 per 100,000 in the age group 50 years and older. In other European studies, for example, the incidence rates for a population ≥ 50 years are highest in northern regions (113 per 100,000 per year in Norway) and much lower in southern areas (13 per 100,000 per year in Italy). In Olmsted County, Minnesota, where the population is predominantly of Scandinavian descent, the incidence has been reported to be 63.9 per 100,000 per year, with a prevalence of 701 out of 100,000. PMR is 2–3 times more common than giant cell arteritis (GCA) and occurs in approximately 50% of patients with GCA. PMR can precede, accompany or follow GCA. A recent systematic literature review (SLR) retrieved a total of 467 papers in the search on the incidence of PMR. In the search on studies of prevalence, 461 papers on PMR were identified. This review confirms that PMR is more common in populations of Northern European ancestry than in others. The estimated incidence and prevalence of PMR were considerably lower in Southern Europe and other parts of the world, and a low incidence of PMR was reported in Korea, likely reflecting that GCA and PMR are less common in Asian populations. Furthermore, the estimated prevalence of GCA in Japan was very low, thus suggesting that PMR is distinctly less common in Asian populations. In addition, PMR is rarely reported in African American and Latino populations, though all racial and ethnic groups can be affected.

### Improving polymyalgia rheumatica care: considerations for routine vascular ultrasound in clinical practice [^112qbqfa]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Vascular ultrasound can be useful in the diagnostic investigation of patients with suspected giant cell arteritis. The clinical overlap between polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis raises the prospect that vascular ultrasound can be used to identify features suggestive of giant cell arteritis in polymyalgia rheumatica, and has generated debate on whether all patients with polymyalgia rheumatica should undergo vascular ultrasound. However, before this approach becomes routine practice, more careful and detailed scrutiny is needed of its clinical necessity, patient benefit, and cost-effectiveness, where data are currently lacking. We argue that the case for universal vascular ultrasound screening in polymyalgia rheumatica is speculative and there is a greater necessity to direct resources to address misdiagnosis and overtreatment with glucocorticoids, which carry risks such as osteoporosis, diabetes, ocular morbidity, and infection.

### 2012 provisional classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^114e9q8Y]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica" for polymyalgia rheumatica.

The Classification Criteria for Polymyalgia Rheumatica is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, a condition characterized by muscle pain and stiffness. The tool's primary components include the presence of morning stiffness lasting more than 45 minutes, hip pain or limited range of motion, absence of rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, and absence of other joint pain. These components are used to stratify patients based on the likelihood of having polymyalgia rheumatica, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.

This tool determines the likelihood of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) by evaluating four key criteria. Each criterion requires a yes or no (true/false) response, and certain responses contribute to a cumulative score that helps in identifying the condition. Here's how the scoring system works:

- Morning stiffness lasting more than 45 minutes adds 2 points.
- Hip pain or limited range of motion adds 1 point.
- Absence of both rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies adds 2 points.
- Absence of other joint pain adds 1 point.

After gathering these responses, each true answer is converted into its respective score. The points are then summed, resulting in a total score that can range from 0 to 6. This total score aids in interpreting the likelihood of PMR:

- A total score of 4 or more suggests a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica.
- A score below 4 indicates that the criteria necessary for diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica are not met.

This approach provides a structured assessment to determine if an individual is likely to have PMR based on specific symptoms and laboratory indicators. The tool delivers both the total score and its interpretation, offering valuable assistance in the diagnostic process.

### Management guidelines and outcome measures in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) [^114i8MNu]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease of the elderly that is subject to wide variations in clinical practice and is managed both in the primary and secondary care settings by general practitioners, rheumatologists and non-rheumatologists. Considerable uncertainty exists relating to diagnosis, management and outcome in patients with PMR. The guidelines presented here seek to improve outcomes for PMR patients by outlining a process to ensure more accurate diagnosis and timely specialist referral. The guidelines are directed to promote more conservative treatment and to ensure early bone protection in order to reduce the common morbidity of osteoporotic fractures. Furthermore, these guidelines specify the goals of treatment, including clinical and patient-based outcomes, and provide advice concerning monitoring for disease activity and complications.

### Accuracy of musculoskeletal imaging for the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica: systematic review [^114gKJXp]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an age-associated, inflammatory musculoskeletal disease with a lifetime risk of 2.4% for women and 1.7% for men, and affects 0.7% of the population over the age of 50 years. Patients report pain and stiffness of the shoulder and/or hip girdles, usually with elevation of inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Accurate diagnosis of PMR is essential, given the impact of PMR on quality of life unless it is treated with systemic glucocorticoids, usually for a year or more. Long-term glucocorticoids produce a significant risk of adverse events. However, PMR can be mimicked by many other conditions, many of which also respond initially to glucocorticoids. None of the various sets of classification criteria for PMR has yet been fully validated for clinical diagnostic use. There remains a need for additional tests providing diagnostic information, especially where the diagnosis is not clear-cut.

In PMR, there is inflammation in and around the shoulders and hips; this can often be visualised using imaging. Based on small, single-centre studies, it has been hypothesised that PMR compared to RA has predominantly extra-articular rather than intra-articular imaging abnormalities. However, the latest, data-driven provisional international classification criteria for PMR give equal weighting to extra-articular and intra-articular ultrasound features. Since extra-articular features such as subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis (SAB) and trochanteric bursitis are commonly seen with normal ageing, it is important to compare any imaging findings with those from non-PMR controls of similar ages.

The objective of this study was to review the evidence regarding the accuracy of musculoskeletal imaging for the diagnosis of PMR.

### Ultrasound of shoulder and knee improves the accuracy of the 2012 EULAR / ACR provisional classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica [^117VikSX]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

PMR is an inflammatory rheumatic condition that presents in an acute to subacute manner, particularly in elderly individuals, characterized by aching and morning stiffness in the shoulders, hip girdle and neck. The diagnosis of PMR can be challenging because the pathogenesis of PMR remains largely unknown and there are no specific serologic or imaging biomarkers.

In 2012, the provisional classification criteria for PMR by the EULAR/ACR initiative was published. In the process of their development, candidate criteria were determined by a systematic literature review, expert opinions and larger international surveys. These candidate items were then selected and validated using data from a prospective cohort of patients with PMR and conditions that mimic PMR. The final criteria require age ≥ 50 years, bilateral shoulder pain, and abnormal CRP and/or ESR, and the scoring part includes four clinical and laboratory items.

In the 2012 EULAR/ACR criteria, US findings were incorporated into the criteria for the first time as an option to improve their accuracy. However, the addition of US items did not substantially improve the diagnostic performance of the criteria. The reasons for the limited benefit of adding US may be that the US assessment was limited to the shoulder and the hip, that the threshold of severity for US abnormalities was not clearly defined and/or that Doppler assessment was not included.

Since the development of the 2012 EULAR/ACR criteria, the imaging research on the pathophysiology of PMR has substantially advanced. In particular, frequent involvement of the knee has been reported using MRI and PET/CT. Moreover, not only bursitis, synovitis and tenosynovitis but also tendon and muscle lesions have been suggested to be characteristic to PMR.

### Longitudinal clusters of pain and stiffness in polymyalgia rheumatica: 2-year results from the PMR cohort study [^11115bAR]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

This is the first large-scale study of PMR patients in primary care and reveals that there are multiple symptom trajectories. PMR, as diagnosed in primary care, appears to be a heterogeneous condition with patterns of symptom trajectories differing across patient groups. There is a group in which symptoms mirror the pattern of rapid and sustained recovery described in the literature. However, the majority of people report more varied and less straightforward symptom patterns.

Restricting the sample to those meeting criteria agreed upon by rheumatologists to be clinically suggestive of PMR excluded around one-third of the sample. The effect of these exclusions on the analysis was informative. Similar distinct groups were identified, however, the group with sustained symptoms was disproportionately affected. More than half of this group were excluded and the shape of the symptom trajectory also changed. A more substantial improvement in initial symptoms followed by a more extreme increase suggests that this group may not have had PMR, but had other conditions that were temporarily improved slightly by glucocorticoid treatment. Given the difficulty in making an accurate diagnosis of PMR, this scenario may not be uncommon and suggests that comorbidity may play a significant role in the accuracy of the diagnostic process and/or the symptom experience.

Comparison of our cohort to current research literature

The starting dose of glucocorticoid was similar in this cohort to that described in a recent American study (15.6 vs 16.9 mg), as was the dose at 1 year (5.6 vs 5.9 mg). However, both studies show that treatment with glucocorticoids in PMR lasts considerably longer than suggested by current guidelines and echoes some of the latest findings from large primary care database studies.

The causes of this longer glucocorticoid treatment require further study. Possible explanations include higher initial glucocorticoid dose, more severe baseline symptoms (e.g. levels of disability, inflammatory markers) and comorbidities. Shbeeb et al. found no association between initial dose and time to permanent discontinuation of treatment, but did find an association between initial dose and time to maintaining doses < 10 and < 5 mg/day. Our finding that the median dose over time was higher in clusters with persistent pain and stiffness suggests that doctors may be maintaining higher doses to treat continuing symptoms rather than to ensure symptoms do not reoccur.

### Impact of age at diagnosis in polymyalgia rheumatica: a retrospective cohort study of 218 patients [^115J7mCZ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common musculoskeletal inflammatory disease that may occur with giant-cell arteritis (GCA) or in an isolated form. While the incidence is highest in the elderly, there is a paucity of data on its presentation, clinical course and response to treatment in younger individuals.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 40 patients who were diagnosed with isolated PMR under the age of 60 and 178 patients diagnosed above this age, taking into account clinical and laboratory data and treatment history.

Results

Patients who were diagnosed at a younger age had lower acute-phase reactant levels at diagnosis but not after initiation of treatment or at the time of relapse. The risk of relapse was lower in the group diagnosed under age 60 (35% vs 55%). Cumulative and maximal glucocorticoid doses, use of glucocorticoid-sparing agents and duration of glucocorticoid treatment, did not differ between the groups. In multivariate analysis, younger age at diagnosis was associated with cervical pain and male gender.

Conclusion

Compared to patients diagnosed above age 60, patients diagnosed with PMR at a younger age have a lower risk of relapse, but similar long-term outcomes with regards to continued need for treatment.

### Case report: crowned dens syndrome in a patient with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis [^111f4hxX]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study involving more than 2000 patients with acute neck pain, Goto et al observed that 60% of CDS were elderly female patients. In the radiological classification of CDS calcification may be present posterior (50%), posterolateral (27.5%), circular (12.5%), anterior (5%), lateral (5%) to the odontoid process. Importantly, in our patient the calcifications were in transverse, alar and apical ligaments.

It is clear that CDS can be misdiagnosed as several conditions, including trauma, meningitis, discitis/osteomyelitis, giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, osteomyelitis, fever of unknown origin must be considered and as such an high index of suspicion, for this relatively benign condition is needed. In our case, in particular, the presence of fever, acute cervical pain in an RA patient already taking MTX and NPX raised several diagnostic queries and it was crucial to have the immediate answer through the CT scan that allowed us to avoid steroids and prefer the combination of NPX plus colchicine. This approach led to an almost immediate resolution of fever, and as reported in the literature steroids and NSAIDs may be sometimes unsuccesful.CDS may be detected in up to 2%–5% of patients over the age of 70 who present to hospital with severe neck pain, and since the CDS may cause chronic pain and even spinal cord compression, the diagnosis of simultaneous RA and CDS may represent a really challenging clinical setting. The prompt diagnosis of CDS led us to avoid lumbar puncture and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) examination. In an interesting report from a neurosurgical unit in Japan, out of 554 patients admitted to the neurosurgical ward because of acute cervical pain, calcifications around the odontoid process were found in 15.8%, the age ranging between 60 and 96 years for those with calcifications and between 0 and 99 years for those without calcifications and found in 56 (22%) of 259 women compared with only 32 (11%) of 295 men, thus suggesting that elderly females are at greater risk.CDS should be always considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute cervical pain especially in old females. This case also highlights the possibility of controlling the acute symptoms, resistant to NSAIDs (the patient was already taking NPX), with colchicine and without using corticosteroids, that in a patient with fever and possibly mimicking meningitis, should be, in our view avoided, unless CSF examination is made. The possible alternative approach could be interleukin 1 α/β antagonist which has been used in small case series.

### Developing classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica: comparison of views from an expert panel and wider survey [^1176H4tU]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This report summarizes the findings from a consensus process to identify potential classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).

Methods

A 3-stage hybrid consensus approach was used to develop potential PMR classification criteria. The first stage consisted of a facilitated meeting of 27 international experts who anonymously rated the importance of 68 potential criteria. The second stage involved a meeting of the experts, who were provided with the results of the first round of ratings and were then asked to re-rate the criteria. In the third stage, the wider acceptance of the 43 criteria that received > 50% support at round 2 was evaluated using an extended mailed survey of 111 rheumatologists and 53 nonrheumatologists in the United States, Canada, and Northern and Western Europe.

Results

A total of 68 and 50 criteria were identified and rated in round 1 and round 2, respectively. In round 2, 43 of the 50 items achieved at least 50% support, including 10 core criteria achieving 100% support. In round 3, over 70% of survey respondents agreed on the importance of 7 core criteria. These were age ≥ 50 years, duration ≥ 2 weeks, bilateral shoulder and/or pelvic girdle aching, duration of morning stiffness > 45 min, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, and rapid steroid response (> 75% global response within 1 wk to prednisolone/prednisone 15 20 mg daily). Among physical signs, more than 70% of survey respondents agreed on the importance of assessing pain and limitation of shoulder (84%) and/or hip (76%) on motion, but agreement was low for peripheral signs like carpal tunnel, tenosynovitis, and peripheral arthritis.

Conclusion

There are differences in opinion as to what PMR is and how it should be treated. These findings make it important to develop classification criteria for PMR. The next step is to perform an international prospective study to evaluate the utility of candidate classification criteria for PMR in patients presenting with the polymyalgic syndrome.

### Real-world outcomes of a dedicated fast-track polymyalgia rheumatica clinic [^111CtcWQ]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine the clinical impact of a fast-track PMR clinic to enable early diagnosis and treatment, and to define both patient and disease characteristics in newly diagnosed PMR.

Methods

Primary care physicians were invited to refer patients with new PMR to our fast-track clinic. Referral criteria included new onset shoulder or pelvic girdle pain and/or stiffness with elevated inflammatory markers in patients over 50years. All patients were seen within 72h of referral. Patients with a rheumatology diagnosis of PMR had an US of their temporal and axillary arteries.

Results

172 patients were referred from primary care over 12months. 39% of patients referred with suspected PMR had an alternative diagnosis for which PMR regimen glucocorticoids was inappropriate. 55% of the non-PMR diagnoses were other inflammatory rheumatological conditions requiring follow-up. Only 20% of patients referred from primary care already on glucocorticoids were commenced on bone protection. PMR patients were comorbid, with a mean of 2.5 other conditions. 75% of PMR patients experienced a glucocorticoid-related adverse event in the first 12months of treatment. 17% of patients with new PMR had US features of subclinical GCA.

Conclusion

The commencement of glucocorticoid therapy should be deferred until after specialist evaluation to enable an accurate clinical diagnosis. A delay in treatment can only realistically be avoided if general practitioners have access to a fast-track PMR clinic. We believe that rheumatologists should consider establishing fast-track PMR clinics and this study provides a strong case for and a template to support this practice innovation.

Differential diagnosis

Conditions affecting people in the age group 50 years and older and associated with bilateral shoulder pain should be included in the differential diagnoses of PMR. This is especially true as there are no specific diagnostic tests for PMR and a misdiagnosis of any condition as PMR may lead to unnecessary exposure to GCs for extensive periods of time. The differential diagnosis should include both rheumatic and nonrheumatic diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Among the most important rheumatic conditions in the differential diagnoses of PMR is seronegative RA. This is especially true early in the disease onset of RA, which might have a prodromal phase of bilateral shoulder joint arthritis. In addition, both RA and PMR can present with arthritis in wrist joints, and if patients test negative for rheumatoid factor and/or anti‐cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti‐CCP), the differentiation between these two conditions may not be easy. However, the presence of symmetric small joint arthritis should favour the RA diagnosis. Both RA and PMR can be successfully treated with prednisolone, limiting the utility of this medication in the differentiation. Typical extra‐articular manifestations (e.g. rheumatoid nodules, cutaneous vasculitis, serositis, etc.) and positive RF/anti‐CCP favour the diagnosis of RA rather than PMR.

Myositis

Polymyositis (PM) is another disease that may be misdiagnosed as PMR and vice versa. Both conditions affect the proximal muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities. However, the presence of muscle weakness rather than stiffness and pain is an important differential feature of PM. In addition, PM is usually associated with elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes, which is not a feature of PMR. Other features that favour the possibility of PM is the presence of myositis specific autoantibodies and extramuscular manifestations including in the lungs, skin, gastrointestinal tract or the heart. Difficulty in swallowing will favour the diagnosis of PM. Unlike PM, pure muscle weakness is not typical of PMR, where the predominant symptoms are muscle aches and pain and morning stiffness.

Pain syndromes

The differentiation between PMR and pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia should be easier compared to other differential diagnosis. Fibromyalgia usually has its onset in younger age groups than PMR. In addition, there is no elevation of laboratory parameters indicating an inflammatory condition in the former group. It is important to differentiate between these two conditions to avoid unnecessary use of GCs in patients with fibromyalgia and pain syndromes.

### Accuracy of musculoskeletal imaging for the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica: systematic review [^11336QCE]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

The systematic review protocol was uploaded to the PROSPERO database before running searches (registration number CRD42013005734). The reference standard was defined as a rheumatologist's diagnosis of PMR, without any better explanation of the presenting symptoms found during follow-up. Potential sources of heterogeneity, including study setting, eligibility criteria, technical aspects of the imaging and glucocorticoid therapy were pre-defined. A PICO-structured search was conducted to identify relevant studies in Pubmed, Ovid MEDLINE (1966−) and EMBASE (including EMBASE Classic) (table 1).

Table 1
Search strategy

Study selection

A study was eligible if it included humans with either suspected PMR (diagnostic cohort design), or both a PMR group and a comparator non-PMR group (diagnostic case–control design), with systematic application of imaging test(s). Expert (rheumatologist) diagnosis was the minimum acceptable reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy data had to be extractable in 2×2 format (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives). Non-systematic review articles, case reports and case series of less than 10 patients were excluded. No language restrictions were made. Case reports were excluded by the reviewers manually, rather than by using filters. Meeting abstracts (previous 2 years of British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conferences) were also screened, and experts in the field were contacted, to identify studies potentially in press or not fully published. Citations were exported to EndNote, duplicates removed in EndNote and results exported to Microsoft Excel.

Data extraction and quality assessment

A study quality assessment tool, based on QUADAS-2, and encompassing internal validity (risk of bias: test reliability, blinding to index test/clinical information, incorporation bias, diagnostic review bias) and external validity (relevance to our review question: participant selection, spectrum of disease and comparator condition, timing of test in relation to glucocorticoid treatment) was agreed in advance. Two reviewers (SLM and GK) independently extracted study characteristics (design, clinical spectrum, reference standard) and diagnostic accuracy data for the index test(s) of each study. Corresponding authors were contacted by email where queries arose. Assessment of methodological limitations and between-study clinical heterogeneity was guided by the study quality assessment tool. Data were entered into Review Manager V.5.2 (RevMan) and exported to Excel.

### Imaging findings in polymyalgia rheumatica [^1168goRz]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Modern imaging including ultrasound, MRI and PET have all played a pivotal role in characterizing the distinctive musculotendinous pathology that is now recognized to define PMR. Each of these modalities offers inherent advantages and disadvantages relative to availability, cost and radiation exposure, although MRI and hybrid PET/CT are particularly capable of detecting highly sensitive and specific findings, and thus should be considered reliable tools for PMR diagnosis in everyday clinical practice. By contrast, the utility of imaging for monitoring disease activity and predicting long-term clinical outcomes represents areas of ongoing research interest. This narrative review outlines the invaluable contribution made by imaging to our current understanding of PMR as a distinct disease entity and evaluates the diagnostic performance of available modalities together with their future potential for disease activity assessment and prognostication.

### Accuracy of musculoskeletal imaging for the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica: systematic review [^112ysEiq]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Some limitations of this analysis could have made imaging appear less accurate than it really is. First, the use of binary scores (present/absent) rather than grades of intensity of inflammation or number of sites involved is a limitation of diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis methods. Second, the necessity of using rheumatologist diagnosis as an (imperfect) reference standard; for future studies, adding a 'test of treatment'might be used to improve the reference standard, since ultrasound abnormalities were associated with complete response to glucocorticoid therapy. Third, it is not known whether adding power Doppler to the ultrasound might offer superior diagnostic accuracy for PMR compared to grey-scale ultrasound alone.

Overall, the accuracy of musculoskeletal imaging tests cannot currently be accurately quantified for clinical diagnosis of PMR, primarily due to the limited amount of published data and biases in the studies. The reference standard is still rheumatologist diagnosis, which may use clinical intuition rather than formal criteria; we might expect that tests adding additional information, including imaging tests, might help in 'grey cases' where the clinical diagnosis is not clear-cut, but there are no studies recruiting these 'grey cases' and evaluating them without incorporation bias. Finally, if the prognostic value of imaging were known, this might also have value for clinical practice and perhaps even for patient classification. This type of evidence would help determine the optimal place of imaging tests in diagnostic care pathways for patients with suspected PMR.

### MRI of shoulder girdle in polymyalgia rheumatica: inflammatory findings and their diagnostic value [^116hjFCH]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The potential of the aforementioned tests to differentiate between PMR and PMR-like onset RA was restricted. The prevalence of non-synovial inflammation alone discriminated with a sensitivity of 73.8% but limited specificity of 51.4%, AUC 0.611, if at least 3/6 sites were inflamed. The presence of synovial inflammation alone or in combination with bilateral shoulder pain and elevated inflammatory markers was uninformative, AUC 0.495 and 0.538, respectively.

Within the PMR group, there was a significant difference in average number of inflamed non-synovial sites in newly diagnosed patients versus cases with relapse of an established PMR, 3.6 ± 1.6 vs 2.4 ± 1.9, p = 0.006. But no significant difference in average number of inflamed synovial sites, 2.6 ± 0.8 vs 2.2 ± 0.9, p = 0.098. The presence of non-synovial inflammation alone performed best to discriminate cases with a newly established diagnosis of PMR from non-PMR cases, AUC 0.864, with a sensitivity of 89.4% and specificity of 73.8% if at least two non-synovial sites were rated as inflamed. In cases of relapse of PMR, performance of this test lowered, AUC 0.705. For the best result, at least three non-synovial sites had to be rated as inflamed, sensitivity 55.6% and specificity 85.8%.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to evaluation for comorbidities, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to screen for comorbidities in patients with PMR, in particular: diabetes or glucose intolerance, hypertension, CVD, dyslipidemia, peptic ulcer disease, osteoporosis, recent fractures, presence of cataract or risk factors for glaucoma, presence of chronic or recurrent infections, co-medication with NSAIDs or other relevant medications, risk factors for steroid-related side effects.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica-like syndrome from checkpoint inhibitor therapy: case series and systematic review of the literature [^116ehhzi]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PMR is increasingly recognised as one of the most common inflammatory rheumatic irAEs, based not only on the volume of clinical reports and clinical series, but also in a recent pharmocovigilance study demonstrating a fivefold elevated risk for developing PMR with ICI therapy versus cancer patients not treated with similar immunotherapies. A reasonable question at present is whether these cases of irAE-PMR represent a disorder identical to the idiopathic form of the disease or rather a new nosologic entity. Answering this is problematic however, given our lack of understanding of its etiopathogenesis and the absence of any highly specific diagnostic test. Given these obstacles, the EULAR/ACR classification criteria provide a logical starting point to address whether ICI-related PMR is similar or different.

Diagnosis

There is no gold standard for diagnosing PMR, and unlike many other rheumatic syndromes, there are no specific clinical manifestations, serology or other laboratory findings in PMR. As a result, diagnosis of PMR can be challenging with a considerable number of conditions in the list of differential diagnoses. However, in daily practice, the diagnosis of PMR relies mainly on the following combination of principles: new‐onset symptoms of both morning stiffness and pain in the shoulder and pelvis girdle in a person aged 50 years or older, evidence of systemic inflammation with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and or CRP, no other disease that would explain the clinical presentation better and finally abrupt response to GCs. In some diagnostic criteria, there are other specific requirements, such as a 2‐week duration of symptoms or negative tests for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.

The diagnosis of PMR should be considered clinically. The typical case is an elderly woman with early morning bilateral shoulder pain and stiffness. Similar symptoms often occur in the pelvic girdle. Typically, the symptoms ease during the day. Systemic manifestations such as fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss may occur in about a third of the patients. In addition, there is almost always an elevation of inflammatory parameters, especially ESR and/or CRP. Other inflammatory parameters can be elevated as white blood cell or platelet count and sometimes liver enzymes or alkaline phosphatase may be elevated as a sign of systemic inflammation. On clinical examination, tenderness with deep palpation of the muscles around the shoulders and thighs is often noted. In addition, there is usually restricted mobility in the shoulders, without muscle atrophy or weakness. Occasional signs of synovitis in the shoulders, wrist joints and the knees can be seen. PMR can be diagnosed in combination with GCA, especially in those with a cranial phenotype, that is, TA. Although temporal biopsy may be positive in a minority of patients with PMR, it is not included in the currently recommended investigation of the disease, unless there are concomitant cranial GCA symptoms. Finally, in PMR, most patients will respond rapidly and dramatically to GCs and according to some criteria, this response is required for diagnosis.

### MRI of shoulder girdle in polymyalgia rheumatica: inflammatory findings and their diagnostic value [^115tzy5w]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common rheumatic disease and the most frequent inflammatory rheumatic condition of the elderly. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), PMR can behave like an autoinflammatory disease with sudden onset, remarkable good response to glucocorticoid treatment and is without an autoimmune antibody profile. While imaging plays a key role in finding the diagnosis and in the follow-up of many rheumatic diseases like RA or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), the diagnostic decision-making in PMR is still based on clinical grounds including patient history with shoulder and/or pelvic girdle pain, laboratory findings such as elevation of C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) supported by rapid response to glucocorticoids. As imaging concerns, only ultrasound (US) has made its way to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) provisional classification criteriabased on the detection of subacromial bursitis and tenosynovitis of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle, but it still contributes only little to these classification criteria since inflammatory changes due to degeneration and/or stress are also relatively common in these locations and the typical age group.

Up to date, direct imaging of the inflammatory musculoskeletal changes beyond US has not played a role in the assessment of patients with possible PMR. However, using 18 fluordesoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) extracapsular inflammation of entheseal and bursal sites in pelvic and shoulder girdle sites, as well as lumbar and cervical interspinous inflammation, have been identified as characteristic for the myalgic pain symptoms reported by patients diagnosed by PMR. However, routine use of FDG-PET/CT is limited due to availability, costs and radiation dose. MRI studies have shown comparable performance to FDG-PET/CT, demonstrating peritendinous and pericapsular oedema and contrast enhancementas a correlate of inflammation at the same affected sites. Meanwhile, the broad availability of MRI makes it an appropriate modality for demonstrating the rather characteristic inflammation in PMR. In addition, due to its higher contrast and spatial resolution, MRI may allow for a more detailed look at the underlying pathoanatomy of inflammation in PMR.

Based on our experience with PMR and MRI diagnostics, we performed a retrospective case–control study to investigate whether and how these findings could contribute to its diagnosis in comparison to other causes of shoulder girdle pain.

### Real-world outcomes of a dedicated fast-track polymyalgia rheumatica clinic [^115EdxBq]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite being the most prevalent inflammatory rheumatic disease in those over the age of 50 years, there is a distinct paucity of research published on PMR, compared with other rheumatological conditions. This is largely because in the majority of countries PMR is diagnosed and managed in primary care, with only a minority of cases referred for specialist evaluation. However, over the past decade, there has been increased awareness of the diagnostic challenge that PMR presents, and of the potential morbidity and disability associated with both the disease, and the immunosuppression required for its management. The 2010 British Society of Rheumatology recommendations for the management of PMR advised specialist review of PMR patients with both atypical presentations and treatment-resistant disease/glucocorticoid contraindications. The international GCA/PMR study group has recently advised that all patients with suspected or recently diagnosed PMR should be considered for specialist evaluation. A Delphi exercise by PMR specialists included the recommendation for primary care to undertake a thorough history and clinical examination with basic laboratory investigations and for those with severe symptoms to be seen in a rapid access clinic, preferably with deferral of glucocorticoid therapy. Despite all this guidance, referral to secondary care only occurs in a minority of cases with an incomplete response or treatment-related adverse events. Few centres offer an early referral pathway, mainly due to capacity issues. Our objective was to assess the effectiveness and clinical impact of a newly established multicentre fast-track clinic to diagnose PMR. Our secondary objectives were to better define both patient and disease characteristics in those newly diagnosed with PMR in the community to inform future planning of rheumatology services.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica [^115K9gsr]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disease producing pain and stiffness, mainly in the shoulders and pelvic girdle, in people older than 50 years. Elevation of acute phase reactants is common due to the inflammatory nature of the disease. Since there are no specific diagnostic tests, diagnosis requires the exclusion of other diseases with similar presentations. Imaging has helped to identify the pathological substrate of polymyalgia rheumatica and it is increasingly used to support clinical diagnosis or to detect coexistent giant cell arteritis. Although polymyalgia rheumatica does not clearly impair survival or organ function, it can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Glucocorticoids at 12.5–25.0 mg prednisone per day are effective in inducing remission in most individuals but, when tapered, relapses occur in 40–60% of those affected and side-effects are common. Assessment of disease activity can be difficult because pain related to common comorbidities such as osteoarthritis and tendinopathies, can return when glucocorticoids are reduced, and acute phase reactants are increased less during flares in individuals undergoing treatment or might increase for other reasons. The role of imaging in assessing disease activity is not yet completely defined. In the search for more efficient and safer therapies, tocilizumab and sarilumab have shown efficacy in randomised controlled trials and additional targeted therapies are emerging. However, judicious risk-benefit balance is essential in applying therapeutic innovations to people with polymyalgia rheumatica.

Results

Between July 2022 and July 2023, a total of 172 patients were referred from primary care with new suspected PMR (see Fig. 1). This represented an average of 14 referrals a month or 2.4 referrals per 100 000 catchment population. Eighty-four (49%) patients met a clinical diagnosis of new PMR with agreement between two rheumatologists and were treated with a starting dose of glucocorticoid between 12.5 and 25 mg. Regarding presenting symptoms, 84 (100%) of patients with new PMR had bilateral shoulder pain, 74 (88%) had early morning stiffness, with the mean duration of stiffness lasting 164.19 min [± 116.10], 71 (88%) reported fatigue, 59 (70%) had bilateral hip involvement, 25 (29%) reported anorexia, with 18 (21%) reporting weight loss. Twenty (24%) patients reported peripheral joint involvement, 15 (18%) had night sweats and 9 (11%) reported fevers. No patient was diagnosed with concomitant GCA on clinical assessment and no patient had cranial symptoms of headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness or visual disturbance. Fourteen of 84 patients diagnosed with PMR (17%) had US features of subclinical GCA at the time of diagnosis. A further 21 patients (12%) were already on corticosteroid treatment > 10 mg for > 4/52 weeks from primary care for suspected PMR without active features at the time of initial rheumatology review. None of these patients had US-identified subclinical GCA, likely due to their duration of glucocorticoid exposure. All of these patients had a good initial response to glucocorticoids and were discharged to primary care with a plan for a glucocorticoid taper over 6–8 months. These patients did not require re-referral to the service during their first year of treatment.

Mortality

PMR is characterised by increased levels of inflammation, and therefore patients with PMR may have a predisposition to increased risks of certain conditions similar to patients with other rheumatologic conditions. Given the high burden of comorbidity among patients with PMR, it is important to ascertain whether a diagnosis of PMR is associated with an increased risk of mortality. A recent systematic review found that patients with PMR had a higher burden of comorbid disease when compared to age‐ and sex‐matched controls. However, three previous studies reported reduced mortality among patients diagnosed with PMR. A possible explanation for this could be surveillance bias. Patients with chronic illness (and especially PMR where regular assessment, follow‐up and monitoring are advised) are more likely to be under active follow‐up for their condition and any developing morbidity which leads to management of the illness at an early stage. Another study found an increase in mortality, but this study did not differentiate between patients with PMR and GCA. Yet another study, which is known to be the largest study to estimate the effect that a diagnosis of PMR has on life expectancy, showed that a diagnosis of PMR does not have a significant impact on life expectancy. The causes of death in patients with PMR were broadly similar to those of matched controls; however, a slightly higher proportion of patients with PMR died due to vascular causes, and a slightly lower proportion died due to neoplastic conditions when compared to matched controls. Thus, a diagnosis of PMR does not appear to increase the risk of premature death. Possibly, other factors with a positive effect on longevity predisposing to PMR may balance the negative effects of inflammation and treatment side effects in these patients.

### Polymyalgia rheumatica [^116jSL9c]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause that affects people over age 50 years. Classic symptoms include pain and long-term morning stiffness of the neck, shoulders, hips, upper arms, and thighs. Although markers of inflammation are often raised, no specific laboratory test exists for the disorder and the diagnosis is based on clinical assessment. Provisional classification criteria were published in April, 2012, by a collaborative initiative of the European League Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology. Several other disorders can mimic polymyalgia rheumatica. In particular, clinical manifestations can be difficult to differentiate from other forms of inflammatory arthritis such as spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Imaging studies such as ultrasonography and MRI typically show a predominantly periarticular inflammatory process. A subset of patients has an associated inflammatory vasculopathy affecting large arteries (giant cell arteritis). The standard treatment is low-dose glucocorticoids, which provide symptomatic relief for most patients. However, disease relapses are common, and treatment with glucocorticoids is associated with substantial morbidity. Improved understanding of disease pathogenesis might allow for more targeted immunotherapy.

Diagnostic and classification criteria

Many different diagnostic criteria have been proposed by several groups based on clinical and laboratory characteristics of PMR. The purpose of these criteria is to help physicians to make the diagnosis of PMR in individual patients. Most of these criteria are based on characteristics demographic, clinical and laboratory features of PMR. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued provisional criteria for the classification of PMR in 2012. The EULAR/ACR criteria are summarized in Table 1. Notably, classification criteria are aimed to be used in epidemiological studies and not to make a diagnosis in individual patients.

Table 1
EULAR/ACR provisional classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica

The EULAR/ACR classification criteria for PMR are based on a scoring algorithm using clinical and laboratory features. The sensitivity and specificity of the criteria vary depending on whether the PMR is discriminating from all conditions, including RA or conditions affecting shoulders. The sensitivity and specificity also vary depending on whether ultrasound is used or not. A score ≥ 4 had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 78%. When discriminating shoulder conditions from PMR, the specificity increased to 88%, while it was only 65% for discriminating RA from PMR. Using ultrasound, a score ≥ 5 had a sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 81%.

### Neck pain: initial evaluation and management [^113RCjA4]. American Family Physician (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, AAFP 2020 guidelines recommend to assess patients with neck pain for comorbidities, as underlying inflammatory or rheumatologic conditions can increase the risk of cervical spine injury.

### MRI of shoulder girdle in polymyalgia rheumatica: inflammatory findings and their diagnostic value [^1178UJ1U]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Our methodical approach did not allow a comparison between the influence of non-synovial versus synovial inflammation on the EULAR/ACR provisional classification criteria since they were not obtained in our retrospective study. Therefore, a comparison of our findings with studies addressing the discriminatory influence of synovitis in SAB and LBTS as detected by ultrasound is not possible. But within the cohort studied, we could show a superior diagnostic performance for the detection of non-synovial inflammation over synovial inflammation, even if additional clinical features bilateral shoulder girdle pain and elevated inflammatory markers, which are commonly used in diagnostic and classification criteria, were included (figure 4).

In our study group, the prevalence of non-synovial inflammation was significantly lower in cases with a relapse compared with new established diagnoses of PMR, this led to a markedly decreased sensitivity of only 55.6% but high specificity of 85.8% if at least three out six non-synovial sites were rated as inflamed. Since we did not obtain information about treatment and symptom duration at the time of the MRI, we cannot conclude whether residual treatment or patients awareness of disease activity influenced the inflammatory pattern. Therefore, further longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the correlation between disease activity and MRI-based inflammatory burden to qualify MRI as an objective monitoring tool for disease activity.

### New insights into the role of imaging in polymyalgia rheumatica [^115bbriF]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

PMR is an inflammatory rheumatic disease of elderly people characterized by pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulder and pelvic girdles. No specific diagnostic confirmatory tests exist and clinical symptoms, as well as increased acute phase reactants, are unspecific. The diagnostic value of imaging including ultrasound, MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with/without CT for PMR is increasingly studied. These techniques, particularly FDG-PET/CT, may help to detect underlying GCA in PMR patients with an incomplete response to glucocorticoids and/or recurrent relapses. Recent imaging studies provide novel insights into the anatomical basis of inflammation in PMR, particularly at hip and spine, which may help to distinguish this disease from other mimicking conditions. In this review, we discuss novel insights into the pathoanatomy of PMR, compare the diagnostic values of different imaging techniques and summarize current data on the role of imaging for monitoring and outcome prediction.

### Gallium-67 scintigraphy in polymyalgia rheumatica [^11271ws7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

A patient with atypical presentation of polymyalgia rheumatica is presented. Her major symptoms were mild weakness, pain on passive movement of the shoulder and hip girdles, with mild tenderness but no joint stiffness. Muscle enzymes were within the normal range. The diagnostic work-up included gallium-67 scintigraphy, which showed intense uptake in both shoulders, with remarkable improvement following steroid treatment. A prospective study may delineate the possible role of this imaging modality in establishing a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica.

INTRODUCTION

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a critically ischaemic organ-threatening disease, particularly at the onset. Hence, it is vital to make a secure diagnosis urgently, not only to confirm GCA but also to exclude GCA mimics. Several mimics, such as infection, cancer, head and neck pathology and systemic rheumatological diseases, are equally serious conditions with similar challenges for early diagnosis and treatment. In other less serious, chronic conditions such as non-specific headaches, migraine, fibromyalgia, neuralgia and spondylosis, it is important to avoid inappropriate empirical glucocorticoids (GC) and minimise GC side effects, while offering symptom alleviation, appropriate advice and therapy. Unfortunately, clinical presentations of GCA are protean, and they are often characterised by a mix of constitutional, cranial, ischaemic and polymyalgic symptoms combined with raised inflammatory markers, a clinical scenario that can be difficult to distinguish from symptoms and presenting features of other conditions. In particular, headache is a common but often misleading symptom experienced in GCA. Recent onset of headache, along with the presence of scalp tenderness and/or jaw claudication, may increase the likelihood of GCA. A non-specific response to empirical GC may compound this diagnostic conundrum, resulting in many patients with steroid-responsive headaches being mislabelled as GCA. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 GCA classification criteriaare often mistakenly used to diagnose GCA, but in clinical practice, they have low sensitivity and poor positive predictive value (PPV).
