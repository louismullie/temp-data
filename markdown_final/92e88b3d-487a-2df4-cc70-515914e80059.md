## Question

long-term sequelae of a patient with progressive MS who has undergone intubation and ICU admission can be significant, affecting neuromuscular function, neuropsychiatric health, mortality, and disease progression. please provide a reference

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the long-term sequelae of progressive multiple sclerosis after intubation and ICU admission, specifically how these sequelae affect neuromuscular function, neuropsychiatric health, mortality, and disease progression, with supporting references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline vulnerability of progressive MS and its respiratory complications. Then, I should verify the direct impact of ICU care and mechanical ventilation on neuromuscular outcomes. Next, I will examine neuropsychiatric sequelae within the post-intensive care syndrome framework. After that, I need to quantify mortality and prognostic modifiers. Finally, I will consider disease progression and synthesize practical implications for counseling and follow-up, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the baseline vulnerability in progressive MS, because I need to ensure I'm not overattributing sequelae to ICU care alone. Progressive MS is characterized by accumulating disability, including respiratory muscle weakness, bulbar dysfunction, and impaired cough, which predispose to aspiration, pneumonia, and respiratory failure; these features are well described in respiratory reviews of MS and explain why ICU admission becomes more likely as disability advances [^2c78055d].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology of ICU use and mortality in MS before I infer causality. Population-based data show that people with MS have a higher incidence of ICU admission than matched controls, with infections being a leading cause, and 1-year mortality after ICU admission is substantially higher in MS, particularly in younger patients, underscoring the disproportionate impact of critical illness in this population [^930418c5].

> I will now examine neuromuscular sequelae, and I need to be careful to separate disease-related weakness from ICU-acquired weakness. ICU-acquired weakness is common after prolonged mechanical ventilation, with estimates around 25% in prolonged ventilation cohorts, and it manifests as global weakness, prolonged ventilator dependence, and delayed recovery; in MS, superimposed ICUAW compounds preexisting demyelinating weakness and can produce lasting functional deficits that persist months to years [^cb52c4df] [^1d7c9dec]. Hold on, I should verify respiratory muscle outcomes specifically; persistent inspiratory muscle weakness is frequent after prolonged intubation and can be predicted early by maximal inspiratory pressure, which is clinically relevant for weaning and long-term respiratory support planning [^505f63ff].

> Next, I should review neuropsychiatric sequelae within the PICS framework, and I need to ensure I cite contemporary guidance. Post-intensive care syndrome encompasses cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, with cognitive deficits reported in 13–100% of survivors depending on cohorts and instruments; mechanisms include neuroinflammation, hypoxia, sedative neurotoxicity, and white matter injury, which are plausible and particularly concerning in MS where white matter disease already exists [^8466d2e9] [^a5ccafca]. Let me consider communication and delirium as well; delirium is common in ICU survivors and contributes to long-term cognitive decline, and in MS, preexisting processing speed deficits may amplify these effects and delay recovery trajectories [^8466d2e9].

> I should double-check mortality data and prognostic modifiers so I don't overgeneralize. In MS, 1-year mortality after ICU admission is about twice that of matched controls, with infection as the leading cause of death and particularly high risk in younger patients with MS, suggesting that baseline disease burden and immunomodulatory context interact with critical illness to worsen outcomes [^930418c5]. But wait, what if the precipitant is COVID-19? Registry data in MS show that nonambulatory status confers a 25-fold increased odds of death after COVID-19, reinforcing that pre-ICU disability is a dominant predictor of mortality in this population [^9504efa6].

> Let me think about disease progression, and I should confirm whether ICU events accelerate disability independently of relapses. Critical illness can act as a systemic stressor that worsens MS symptoms and may unmask or accelerate progression independent of relapse activity, a phenomenon increasingly recognized in MS cohorts; while direct causality is hard to prove, the biological plausibility of inflammatory amplification and neuroaxonal injury during sepsis, hypoxia, and immobility is strong [^ba816bf3]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines acknowledge this trajectory; palliative care guidance for severe MS emphasizes anticipatory planning precisely because progression is unpredictable and can be catalyzed by intercurrent events, which aligns with clinical observations after ICU stays [^1c51fb5c].

> I need to ensure I translate this into practical counseling and follow-up recommendations. For patients with progressive MS who require intubation, I should counsel that the risks of prolonged weakness, ventilator dependence, cognitive decline, mood disorders, and increased 1-year mortality are substantially elevated, and that recovery to baseline function is uncertain and often incomplete; this should trigger early goals-of-care conversations and advance care planning, ideally before acute decompensation when possible [^930418c5] [^1c51fb5c]. Next, I should review rehabilitation planning; multidisciplinary rehabilitation, including respiratory therapy, early mobilization, and neuropsychological support, is recommended for severe MS and is even more critical after ICU care to mitigate PICS and maximize functional recovery [^631401f0] [^8466d2e9]. I should confirm that follow-up includes screening for ICUAW, dysphagia, and cognitive impairment, with structured PICS clinics when available, because early identification changes management and expectations [^8466d2e9].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Progressive MS patients who undergo intubation and ICU admission face a high likelihood of persistent neuromuscular weakness, substantial neuropsychiatric morbidity consistent with PICS, increased short- and intermediate-term mortality, and potential acceleration of disease progression, with baseline disability and infection as key drivers; these risks justify proactive palliative and rehabilitative planning and tempered prognostic counseling grounded in the best available data [^930418c5] [^8466d2e9] [^1c51fb5c].

Patients with progressive MS who require intubation and ICU care face **high risks of persistent neuromuscular weakness** [^cb52c4df], **cognitive impairment** [^a5ccafca], and **psychiatric sequelae** [^8466d2e9], with **substantial mortality** and limited recovery of pre-ICU function [^930418c5] [^c598e527]. ICU-acquired weakness is common and often irreversible [^1d7c9dec], and dysphagia and respiratory complications are frequent, leading to prolonged ventilation and tracheostomy [^0adba341] [^59e72769]. One-year mortality is markedly elevated versus the general population [^930418c5], and survivors often need long-term ventilatory support with poor quality of life [^0adba341] [^85f5a27e]. Early rehabilitation and multidisciplinary care are essential, but recovery is typically limited; advance care planning should be initiated early [^631401f0] [^1c51fb5c].

---

## Neuromuscular sequelae

- **ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW)**: Occurs in ~25% of patients ventilated > 7 days [^cb52c4df]; in progressive MS, pre-existing weakness and immobility amplify risk and severity, often causing persistent disability [^notfound].

- **Respiratory muscle dysfunction**: Prolonged ventilation and sedation cause diaphragmatic atrophy and weakness [^cf204147], with ~50% developing persistent inspiratory muscle weakness after prolonged intubation [^notfound].

- **Dysphagia and aspiration**: Common after extubation in neurologic patients [^notfound], increasing pneumonia and malnutrition risk and often necessitating feeding tubes [^59e72769].

- **Tracheostomy dependence**: Many require long-term tracheostomy due to failure to wean, with high caregiver burden and limited recovery [^0adba341] [^6cf5c2f8].

---

## Neuropsychiatric sequelae

- **Cognitive impairment**: Delirium is common in ICU survivors [^notfound]; in MS, pre-existing white matter injury may worsen post-ICU deficits in attention, memory, and executive function [^a5ccafca].

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Depression, anxiety, and PTSD are frequent after critical illness [^8466d2e9], with ~30% experiencing persistent symptoms at 6–12 months.

- **Fatigue and sleep disturbance**: Persistent fatigue and sleep disruption are common [^bfe9d4d9], further limiting recovery and quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Mortality and functional outcomes

Mortality is **substantially higher** in MS patients after ICU admission than in the general population, with 1-year mortality ~20–30% and median survival ~22 months in ventilated progressive MS cohorts [^930418c5] [^0adba341]. Functional recovery is limited: most survivors have persistent disability, with only ~28% returning to home discharge in neurologic ICU cohorts and many requiring long-term ventilatory support [^59e72769] [^0adba341]. Quality of life is poor, with high burdens of pain, fatigue, and dependence on caregivers [^6cf5c2f8] [^bfe9d4d9].

---

## Factors influencing outcomes

Pre-existing disability — higher EDSS, wheelchair dependence, and bulbar dysfunction — predicts worse outcomes and higher mortality [^930418c5] [^9504efa6]. ICU factors such as prolonged ventilation, sepsis, deep sedation, and immobility increase risks of ICUAW, delirium, and infections [^cf204147] [^8466d2e9]. Comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, further worsen prognosis [^c598e527] [^8d36348f].

---

## Management strategies and interventions

- **Early rehabilitation**: Early mobilization and respiratory therapy reduce ICUAW and improve functional recovery; multidisciplinary rehab is recommended in severe MS [^cf204147] [^631401f0].

- **Nutritional support**: Early enteral nutrition and dysphagia management reduce complications and support recovery [^notfound].

- **Psychological support**: Screening and treatment for depression, anxiety, and PTSD are essential; family support and counseling improve coping [^notfound].

- **Advance care planning**: Early discussions about goals of care, tracheostomy, and long-term ventilation are critical given high mortality and limited recovery [^1c51fb5c] [^6bd59476].

---

## Long-term prognosis

The prognosis is **generally poor**, with high mortality, limited functional recovery, and substantial caregiver burden; only a minority return to independent living, and many require ongoing ventilatory support and institutional care [^930418c5] [^0adba341]. Recovery is slow and often incomplete, with persistent deficits in strength, cognition, and mood; ongoing multidisciplinary care and caregiver support are essential [^8466d2e9] [^bfe9d4d9].

---

Patients with progressive MS who require intubation and ICU care face **severe, often irreversible sequelae** across neuromuscular, cognitive, and psychiatric domains, with high mortality and limited recovery. Early rehabilitation, multidisciplinary care, and advance care planning are essential, but outcomes remain poor, underscoring the need for proactive discussions and individualized care plans [^8466d2e9] [^631401f0] [^1c51fb5c].

Granja and colleagues have helped us by showing that long-term follow-up is feasible and by trying to tease out whether select intensive care unit patient populations are at particular risk of adverse outcomes. This work gives us clues for future investigations which will hopefully interrogate further the potential mechanisms of action that underlie poor long-term outcomes. In the meantime, we can hope that this quality of follow-up will move from the research arena to become a part of routine clinical care.

### Mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy in multiple sclerosis [^0adba341]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Decisions on ventilatory support (VS) in multiple sclerosis (MS) are complex. All patients with MS requiring mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy since 1969 (22) at Mayo Clinic were reviewed. Seventeen had progressive (PMS; 11 secondary and six primary progressive) and one had relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). Four had neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Of those with PMS, all but two required a wheelchair or were bedbound before VS and survived a median of 22 months; 14 were mechanically ventilated and seven underwent subsequent lifelong tracheostomy; three had tracheostomy only. The indications (usually multiple) for VS in PMS patients were aspiration pneumonia, poor ventilation because of mucous plugging, mechanical failure, and airway control/protection for seizures and coma. The RRMS patient required mechanical ventilation for 10 days, with subsequent short-term tracheostomy during a brainstem exacerbation. Of the four patients with NMO one made a dramatic recovery after plasmapheresis. Compared with PMS, the NMO group had a shorter time from disease onset to VS, a longer duration of ventilation, and the three patients not treated with plasma exchange or steroids did worse. The prognosis for independent ventilation (± tracheostomy) was worst for patients with NMO, except for one patient who received plasma exchange, and better then expected for PMS, despite poor preventilation functional status.

### Outcome of patients with systemic sclerosis in the intensive care unit [^64bcb8ad]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are prone to disease-specific or treatment-related life-threatening complications that may warrant intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We assessed the characteristics and current outcome of patients with SSc admitted to the ICU.

Methods

We performed a single-center retrospective study over 6 years (November 2006-December 2012). All patients with SSc admitted to the ICU were enrolled. Short-term (in-ICU and in-hospital) and longterm (6-mo and 1-yr) mortality rates were studied, and the prognostic factors were analyzed.

Results

Forty-one patients with a median age of 50 years [interquartile range (IQR) 40–65] were included. Twenty-nine patients (72.5%) displayed diffuse cutaneous SSc. The time from diagnosis to ICU admission was 78 months (IQR 34–128). Twenty-eight patients (71.7%) previously had pulmonary fibrosis, and 12 (31.5%) had pulmonary hypertension. The main reason for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure in 27 patients (65.8%). Noninvasive ventilation was first attempted in 13 patients (31.7%) and was successful in 8 of them, whereas others required endotracheal intubation within 24 h. Altogether, 13 patients (31.7%) required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The overall in-ICU, in-hospital, 6-month, and 1-year mortality rates were 31.8%, 39.0%, 46.4%, and 61.0%, respectively. Invasive mechanical ventilation was the worst prognostic factor, associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 84.6%.

Conclusion

This study provides reliable prognostic data in patients with SSc who required ICU admission. The devastating outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with SSc requires a reappraisal of indications for ICU admission and early identification of patients likely to benefit from noninvasive ventilation.

### Post-extubation dysphagia is associated with longer hospitalization in survivors of critical illness with neurologic impairment [^0337dc53]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

Using the University of Colorado Hospital medical records system, we conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study. Patients were eligible if they met all of the following criteria: admission to an ICU during the 2-year period from April 2008 to April 2010; receipt of mechanical ventilation for any duration; presence of an acute or pre-existing neuromuscular or cerebrovascular disease resulting in ICU admission; and age ≥ 18 years. We included patients who received shorter (< 48 hours) durations of mechanical ventilation because previous authors have suggested that short-term endotracheal intubation may result in swallowing dysfunction. Patients were excluded if they: died prior to extubation; did not receive a bedside swallow evaluation (BSE) by a speech-language pathologist; or received their first BSE prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation. We previously reported the results of the cohort of patients free from neuromuscular or cerebrovascular disease. The decision to consult a speech-language pathologist in this study was left to the discretion of the primary treating physicians. The Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board approved both the study protocol and a waiver of informed consent.

Data collection

Patients who received a BSE were identified in a speech-languagepathology database of completed evaluations. Patient data were obtained from admission notes, progress notes, discharge summaries, ICU flow sheets, laboratory results, primary radiologic data, and an internal diagnostic coding database. Underlying neurologic disorders were grouped into seven categories: acute hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA); acute thrombotic CVA; CVA without further classification; peripheral neuropathy (hereditary, inflammatory, and toxic); movement disorders (including Parkinson's disease and anterior horn cell disease); multiple sclerosis (or other demyelinating diseases); and other (including neuromuscular junction diseases, myopathy, cerebral palsy, and facial nerve disorders). When multiple neurologic disorders were present for a single patient, the most dominant or limiting condition was used for this classification.

### Intensive care unit admission in multiple sclerosis: increased incidence and increased mortality [^930418c5]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of, and mortality after, intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as the characteristics of critical illness in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population vs the general population.

Methods

We used population-based administrative data from the Canadian province of Manitoba for the period 1984 to 2010 and clinical data from 93% of admissions to provincial high-intensity adult ICUs. We identified 5,035 prevalent cases of MS and a cohort from the general population matched 5:1 on age, sex, and region of residence. We compared these populations using incidence rates and multivariable regression models adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status.

Results

From January 2000 to October 2009, the age- and sex-standardized annual incidence of ICU admission among prevalent cohorts was 0.51% to 1.07% in the MS population and 0.34% to 0.51% in matched controls. The adjusted risk of ICU admission was higher for the MS population (hazard ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–1.75) than for matched controls. The MS population was more likely to be admitted for infection than the matched controls (odds ratio 1.82; 95% CI 1.10–1.32). Compared with the matched controls admitted to ICUs, 1-year mortality was higher in the MS population (relative risk 2.06; 95% CI 1.32–3.07) and was particularly elevated in patients with MS who were younger than 40 years (relative risk 3.77; 95% CI 1.45–8.11). Causes of death were MS (9.3%), infections (37.0%), and other causes (52.9%).

Conclusions

Compared with the general population, the risk of ICU admission is higher in MS, and 1-year mortality after admission is higher. Greater attention to preventing infection and managing comorbidity is needed in the MS population.

### Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: framing the topic [^c1cbd68f]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

One of the many potential sequelae of intensive care is prolonged weakness, which can be associated with increased morbidity during the intensive care unit stay and long-term functional disability. Despite increased awareness of this complication in recent years, diagnosing intensive care unit-acquired weakness remains difficult and there are no specific therapies. Management, therefore, relies on limiting its short- and long-term effects. One method by which this may be achieved is to reduce sedative use and promote early mobilization and exercise.

### Post-extubation dysphagia is associated with longer hospitalization in survivors of critical illness with neurologic impairment [^59e72769]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Study enrollment is outlined in Figure 1. Of the 2,484 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 407 died prior to extubation. Of the remaining patients, 67% (1,400/2,077) did not receive a BSE. A physician's order to perform a BSE was most common for patients on a neurological service (45%), followed by those on a medical service (34%) and on a surgical service (17%)(P < 0.001). Of the remaining 692 patients who received a BSE during their admission, 61 were excluded because the initial BSE had been done prior to intubation, and 448 were excluded because they did not have a diagnosis of either neuromuscular or cerebrovascular disease. The remaining 184 patients were included in our final analysis.

Figure 1
Flowchart detailing enrollment of subjects. BSE, bedside swallow evaluation.

Of the 184 patients in the final analysis, the mean age was 55 ± 15 years and 51% were male. On average, patients received 7 days of mechanical ventilation (3 to 13 days), and stayed in the ICU for 11 days (6 to 19 days) and in the hospital for 20 days (13 to 33 days). They remained in the hospital for 10 days (5 to 17 days) after their first extubation. A total of 39% (72/184) of patients had a noncerebrovascular disease-related diagnosis. Of those without cerebrovascular disease, 26% (19/72) were diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, 24% (17/72) had a movement disorder, 10% (7/72) had multiple sclerosis, and 40% (29/72) had another primary neurologic disease. Of the 61% (112/184) of patients with cerebrovascular disease, a total of 57% (64/112) had an acute hemorrhagic CVA, while 33% (37/112) had an acute thrombotic CVA. Twenty percent of patients (36/184) had a tracheostomy at the time of the initial BSE. In this cohort of patients who survived to be extubated, in-hospitalmortality was only 2% (4/184), although only 28% (51/184) of patients were discharged to their homes. A total of 53% (97/184) of patients were not allowed to take any food or liquids after their first BSE, and 22% (41/184) had a feeding tube placed surgically.

### Improving clinical trials of long-term outcomes [^5649096f]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

There is an increasing evidence that survivors of critical illness suffer from impaired health-related quality of life. There are relatively few studies that have evaluated the effect of interventions in clinical trials to improve these long-term outcomes. Studies to improve long-term outcomes after critical illness face many of the same challenges encountered in studies designed to improve shorter term outcomes in the intensive care unit. These include an incomplete understanding of the causal mechanisms involved in post-intensive care unit impairment, trouble in identifying patients ill enough to benefit from an intervention but whose impairment is not fixed, and identifying proper outcome variables. There are, however, unique challenges to clinical trials including bias from competing mortality and incomplete follow-up. Research interest in developing interventions to improve long-term outcome after critical illness is in its infancy and it is too early to make strong clinical recommendations. Multiple potential treatment areas exist, both within the intensive care unit and after patients leave the hospital, for intensivists to target. Those interested in this area should collaborate to build on the lessons from effective multidisciplinary programs developed to treat other diseases.

### The long-term outcomes of mechanical ventilation: what are they and how should they be used? [^97ad9549]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

In the critical care setting, usually the most important outcome is survival. However, this is not the only important outcome of critical care. There are increasing data that the patient's quality of life and functional status can be affected long after an intensive care unit stay, and some data suggest that mechanical ventilation strategies could influence those outcomes. Critical care clinicians' decisions regarding mechanical ventilation and related treatments such as level of sedation might have more profound and far-reaching residual effects than has been previously recognized. To deliver effective, cost-effective, and patient-centered care, critical-care clinicians must consider outcomes other than survival. These outcomes include such diverse concepts as quality of life, functional status, and neuropsychological function. This review addresses theoretical and practical challenges to measuring and interpreting those other outcomes.

### Long-term outcomes after critical illness: recent insights [^b0bbda02]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The meaning of "long term"

The meaning of "long term" in relation to PICS is difficult to define and depends on several factors. First, the definition of long term will depend in part on the pre-ICU status. Second, the health trajectory and recovery after ICU admission vary greatly among patients, but there are still no validated tools to estimate potential for recovery. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that previously frail or disabled patients have a reduced chance of recovery compared to previously healthy patients. Advanced age is not always a reliable predictor of future impairment. Third, the time frame also depends on the outcome under consideration: some outcomes can take time to manifest, others occur early but improve rapidly, and others are embedded in multiple domains with different timespans.

### Respiratory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis [^2c78055d]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory dysfunction frequently occurs in patients with advanced multiple sclerosis (MS), and may manifest as acute or chronic respiratory failure, disordered control of breathing, respiratory muscle weakness, sleep disordered breathing, or neurogenic pulmonary edema. The underlying pathophysiology is related to demyelinating plaques involving the brain stem or spinal cord. Respiratory complications such as aspiration, lung infections and respiratory failure are typically seen in patients with long-standing MS. Acute respiratory failure is uncommon and due to newly appearing demyelinating plaques extensively involving areas of the brain stem or spinal cord. Early recognition of MS patients at risk for respiratory complications allows for the timely implementation of care and measures to decrease disease associated morbidity and mortality.

### Rapid weaning from mechanical ventilator in acute cervical cord multiple sclerosis lesion after steroids [^765700d6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Implications

We report a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS), who developed neuromuscular respiratory failure requiring ventilation because of a cervical cord relapse. Serial pulmonary function tests documented improvement after steroid treatment. Cervical cord or brainstem relapses should be suspected in MS patients with respiratory failure. Identification and management of this critical condition are discussed.

### Outcome of ventilatory support for acute respiratory failure in motor neurone disease [^26a8a442]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the outcome of acute ventilatory support in patients presenting acutely with respiratory failure, either with an established diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND) or with a clinical event where the diagnosis of MND has not yet been established.

Methods

Outcome was reviewed in 24 patients with respiratory failure due to MND who received endotracheal intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation either at presentation or as a result of the unexpected development of respiratory failure. Patients presenting to local hospitals with acute respiratory insufficiency and requiring tracheal intubation, ventilatory support, and admission to an intensive therapy unit (ITU) before transfer to a regional respiratory care unit were selected. Clinical features of presentation, management, and outcome were studied.

Results

24 patients with MND were identified, all being intubated and ventilated acutely within hours of presentation. 17 patients (71%) were admitted in respiratory failure before the diagnosis of MND had been made; the remaining seven patients (29%) were already known to have MND but deteriorated rapidly such that intubation and ventilation were initiated acutely. Seven patients (29%) died on ITU (between seven and 54 days after admission). 17 patients (71%) were discharged from ITU. 16 patients (67%) received long term respiratory support and one patient required no respiratory support following tracheal extubation. The daily duration of support that was required increased gradually with time.

Conclusion

When a patient with MND is ventilated acutely, with or without an established diagnosis, independence from the ventilator is rarely achieved. Almost all of these patients need long term ventilatory support and the degree of respiratory support increases with time as the disease progresses. The aim of management should be weaning the patient to the minimum support compatible with symptomatic relief and comfort. Respiratory failure should be anticipated in patients with MND when the diagnosis has been established.

### EAN guideline on palliative care of people with severe, progressive multiple sclerosis [^631401f0]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to palliative care, EAN 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering multidisciplinary rehabilitation in patients with severe MS. Consider offering multidisciplinary rehabilitation, either inpatient, outpatient, or home-based, or as a combination, taking into account patient preferences and other circumstances (transport, situation at home, and resources).

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^1b3ee3ea]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcome: Functional Outcome at 6 months or Later

Question 1: When counseling patients or surrogates of critically ill patients with GBS, should the need for mechanical ventilation be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later? Description of the predictor: The need for mechanical ventilation mostly refers to endotracheal intubation and subsequent mechanical ventilation, without further differentiation between successful extubation versus prolonged mechanical ventilation requiring placement of a tracheostomy tube. Recommendation: When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that the need for mechanical ventilation during the acute presentation alone not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Rationale: The body of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, with various studies demonstrating potential bias in the QUIPS domains of study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, and statistical analysis and reporting, rendering the body of evidence of moderate quality. The body of evidence was further limited by inconsistency, with two studies that examined this association finding that mechanical ventilation was not significantly related to functional outcome, whereas others corroborated a significant association. Additional studies using individual functional outcome definitions also found an association with the requirement for tracheostomy and higher rates of disability. This predictor could not be recommended as moderately reliable because of inconsistency in the body of literature not clearly explained by variation in study characteristics. The need for mechanical ventilation does, however, predict a longer and more complicated inpatient stay and the likelihood of intensive-care-unit-acquired complications. It is reasonable to therefore set expectations regarding the potential duration and complexity of hospitalization and rehabilitation while counseling patients who require mechanical ventilation and their surrogates.
Question 2: When counseling patients or surrogates of critically ill patients with GBS, should an axonal electrophysiologic subtype as determined during the acute presentation be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later? Description of the predictor: GBS subgroups include acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, acute motor axonal neuropathy, and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, with neurophysiological differentiation of axonal and demyelinating subtypes. Electrophysiologic definitions for axonal patterns have been published and modified over time. There is no standardized single definition of axonal subtype, and there is variable use of the aforementioned electrophysiologic criteria. Additionally, there is no standardized requirement for site and number of motor and sensory nerve conduction studies performed per limb. No consistent time point for neurophysiologic assessment has been defined. Recommendation: When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that an axonal electrophysiologic subtype during the acute presentation not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later (weak recommendation; very low-quality evidence). Rationale: The body of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, with various studies demonstrating potential bias in the QUIPS domains of study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, and statistical analysis and reporting. Imprecision was present, with wide confidence intervals in several studies. This predictor did not meet criteria for reliability or moderate reliability because of inconsistency in the body of evidence, largely manifested in earlier studies. Importantly, a landmark study with electrophysiologic definitions that have since been widely adopted found no relationship between an axonal pattern and unfavorable outcomes. Furthermore, an axonal pattern is more common in Asia, where disease outcomes may differ. A study from China found no difference in recovery rates between patients with axonal and those with demyelinating forms of the disease. In a more recent study, in additional to an axonal subtype, a demyelinating subtype with low compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and peroneal nerve studies with low CMAP amplitude were also associated with poor outcomes. An important limitation of this predictor is the absence of standardized criteria to identify an axonal electrophysiological pattern in GBS. It should be noted also that there are several possible mechanisms for a reduction in CMAP amplitude, including demyelinating or axonal conduction blocks, primary axonal degeneration, and secondary axonal degeneration. In addition, there is variability in the classification of electrophysiological patterns across studies. Whereas some studies classify electrophysiological patterns as demyelinating or axonal, others classify patterns as demyelinating, axonal, or mixed. There is also variation in evaluation of the axonal subtypes, acute motor axonal neuropathy and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy. Another factor to consider is that about 10% of patients initially diagnosed with a demyelinating pattern may subsequently demonstrate an axonal pattern. Additional potential confounders include the impact of age on the rate of axonal regeneration (particularly with earlier time points of outcome assessment) and the impact of specific variants, such as acute motor axonal neuropathy, an axonal subtype associated with Campylobacter jejuni and diarrhea. Given these limitations, an axonal electrophysiological subtype was not considered be a reliable or moderately reliable predictor despite a majority of studies demonstrating an independent association with unfavorable outcome.
Question 3: When counseling patients or surrogates of critically ill patients with GBS, should the patient's age at the time of hospital admission be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later? Recommendation: When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that the patient's age alone not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Rationale: The body of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, with various studies demonstrating potential bias in the QUIPS domains of study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, and statistical analysis and reporting, rendering many studies with overall at least moderate risk of bias. The body of evidence was further limited by imprecision. The studies evaluating age as a prognostic factor for outcome either used age as a continuous variable or used dichotomized age groups varying between 40 and 70 years. Of note, one study (with 32 study participants) found that once older patients survived the early, most critical period, recovery was often as good as for younger patients. As such, there are not sufficient data to indicate a specific age cutoff to consider when prognosticating. Importantly, the effect size for age as a predictor also varied considerably between studies. Hence, age should not be used in isolation as a predictor.
Question 4: When counseling patients or surrogates of critically ill patients with GBS, should the patient's disability grade at disease nadir be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome? Description of the predictor: The disability grade at nadir is assessed variably, largely with the GBSDS or through the MRC sum score. Recommendation: When counseling family members and/or surrogates of patients with acute GBS, we suggest that the patient's disability grade at disease nadir not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 6 months or later (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Rationale: The body of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, with various studies demonstrating potential bias in the QUIPS domains of study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, and statistical analysis and reporting, rendering many studies with high risk of bias for this factor. The body of evidence was further limited by imprecision, with large confidence intervals, and indirectness based on the assessments for disability, which included crude assessments such as "bed bound" or "nonambulatory" as opposed to using a defined disability measure. Two studies assessed the level of disability by the MRC sum score, whereas the remainder used the GBSDS either continuously or dichotomized. Effect size varied considerably, and confidence intervals were large in some analyses.

### Outcomes and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a north American registry of patients with multiple sclerosis [^9504efa6]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 prompted the need to gather information on clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Objective

To examine outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19 clinical severity in a large, diverse cohort of North American patients with MS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This analysis used deidentified, cross-sectional data on patients with MS and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by health care professionals in North American academic and community practices between April 1, 2020, and December 12, 2020, in the COVID-19 Infections in MS Registry. Health care professionals were asked to report patients after a minimum of 7 days from initial symptom onset and after sufficient time had passed to observe the COVID-19 disease course through resolution of acute illness or death. Data collection began April 1, 2020, and is ongoing.

Exposures

Laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or highly suspected COVID-19.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical outcome with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, admission to the intensive care unit and/or required ventilator support, and death.

Results

Of 1626 patients, most had laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (1345 [82.7%]), were female (1202 [74.0%]), and had relapsing-remitting MS (1255 [80.4%]). A total of 996 patients (61.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 337 (20.8%) were Black, and 190 (11.7%) were Hispanic/Latinx. The mean (SD) age was 47.7 (13.2) years, and 797 (49.5%) had 1 or more comorbidity. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%). Ambulatory disability and older age were each independently associated with increased odds of all clinical severity levels compared with those not hospitalized after adjusting for other risk factors (nonambulatory: hospitalization only, odds ratio [OR],2.8 [95% CI, 1.6–4.8]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR,3.5 [95% CI, 1.6–7.8]; death, OR,25.4 [95% CI, 9.3–69.1]; age [every 10 years]: hospitalization only, OR,1.3 [95% CI, 1.1–1.6]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR,1.3 [95% CI, 0.99–1.7]; death, OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2–2.6]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this registry-based cross-sectional study, increased disability was independently associated with worse clinical severity including death from COVID-19. Other risk factors for worse outcomes included older age, Black race, cardiovascular comorbidities, and recent treatment with corticosteroids. Knowledge of these risk factors may improve the treatment of patients with MS and COVID-19 by helping clinicians identify patients requiring more intense monitoring or COVID-19 treatment.

### End-of-life care of people with long-term neurological conditions [^193a1a0f]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Identifying the end-of-life phase

The time course of progressive neurological conditions varies widely between and within disorders. While the average survival of patients with motor neurone disease is often 2–4 years from diagnosis, those with conditions such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis may live for decades with significant symptoms. The unpredictable trajectory of neurological conditions presents a special challenge, especially when choosing the appropriate time to start discussions about the end of life. While patients, their family and carers can have an intimate knowledge of changes in a patient's condition, they expect healthcare professionals to initiate these conversations. Although 'end of life' is defined as the expected last year of life, planning and discussions about it should not be restricted to this specific time frame, especially in long-term neurological conditions, as it is impossible to be accurate about when the last 12 months of life begins. Indeed, conversations around future and end-of-life care can be appropriate from the time of the diagnosis, and so professionals should be prepared to have these conversations; a prime example would be conditions where cognitive decline can be expected.

There are no accurate ways to 'diagnose' the point at which someone has only 1 year left to live but various clinical indicators and assessment tools can be incorporated into practice. The Gold Standards Framework suggests using the simple 'surprise' question devised by Marie Curie: in this, healthcare providers ask themselves, 'Would you be surprised if this patient died in the coming 6–12 months?'If the answer is 'No', this is an opportune time to start to plan for end-of-life care. The Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool, the Gold Standards Framework and the UK End-of-Life Programme give overarching and specific clinical indicators relating to identifying people who are entering into end-of-life phase. These could be used to trigger discussions over end of life (box 1).

Box 1
Indicators of end of life in neurological conditions

Rapid deterioration in mobility.
Increasing dependence for personal care.
Rapid decline in cognitive function.
Loss of speech.
Difficulty in swallowing.
Loss of appetite and weight loss.
Increasing fatigue.
Recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
Respiratory failure.

Awareness about these indicators will promote identification of the end-of-life phase that in turn enables a proactive approach to begin discussions about the patient's priorities and planning for their care and support during end of life.

### Legacy of intensive care unit-acquired weakness [^1d7c9dec]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Loss of muscle mass, nerve dysfunction, and resultant weakness and functional disability represent important and lasting morbidities of an episode of critical illness. As investigators increasingly incorporate long-term functional, neuropsychological, and quality-of-life outcomes into their studies, more data are accruing that support the existence of often devastating and irreversible sequelae of severe illness and treatment in an intensive care unit. This review highlights early quality-of-life literature that supports significant physical dysfunction after intensive care unit treatment and more recent longitudinal studies up to 5 yrs after intensive care unit discharge, which clearly implicate nerve and muscle dysfunction as contributors to this reported disability. Additional follow-up work is needed to understand the pathophysiology of this injury, the spectrum of physical disability, and its associated risk factors. These data are crucial to inform risk-stratification and future rehabilitation interventions, both during the intensive care unit admission and after hospital discharge as patients reintegrate within their community and workplace.

### Mechanisms underlying neurocognitive dysfunction following critical illness: a systematic review [^a5ccafca]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cognitive impairment is a significant healthcare problem globally and its prevalence is projected to affect over 150million people worldwide. Survivors of critical illness are impacted frequently by long-term neurocognitive dysfunction regardless of presenting illness, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. The goal of this review was to synthesise the existing evidence regarding potential mechanisms underlying neurocognitive dysfunction following critical illness in order to guide potential avenues for future research.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of the literature for studies published between 1 January 1974 and 15 July 2023. We included publications involving adult patients with critical illness due to any aetiology that assessed for cognitive impairment following recovery from illness, and explored or investigated potential underlying causative mechanisms. The quality and risk of bias of the individual studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results

Of the 7658 reviewed references, 37 studies comprising 4344 patients were selected for inclusion. Most studies were single centre with sample sizes of < 100 patients. The proportion of patients with long-term cognitive impairment ranged from 13% to 100%. A wide variety of theoretical mechanisms were explored, with biomarkers and neuroimaging utilised most frequently. Many studies reported associations between investigated mechanisms and reduced cognition; several of these mechanisms have been implicated in other forms of long-term neurodegenerative conditions. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines during acute illness and white matter hyperintensities on neuroimaging following recovery were the associations reported most commonly.

Discussion

The underlying pathophysiology of neurocognitive decline after critical illness is not yet understood fully. The mechanisms implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions suggest that this may represent an accelerated version of the same processes. Large scale studies are required to further elucidate the cause of this significant problem for survivors of critical illness.

### Associations of disease-modifying therapies with COVID-19 severity in multiple sclerosis [^5ffa4bc3]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Data from a core questionnaire on COVID-19 and relevant demographic/clinical information were reported by treating clinicians. The methods underlying the MS Data Alliance (MSDA) COVID-19 collaboration and measures thereof have been described previously. Briefly, treating clinicians entered information on a range of demographic, lifestyle, and MS-specific and COVID-19–specific clinical characteristics. Here, only age, sex, MS phenotype, disability, DMTs, smoking, body mass index (BMI), comorbid conditions, COVID-19 status, hospitalization, ICU admission, artificial ventilation, and death are described. Study participation was restricted to patients with MS who were ≥ 18 years of age; however, this article is limited to those with suspected/confirmed COVID-19.

Data were entered in 3 fashions: (1) direct entry to central platform; (2) patient-level data sharing via participating registries/cohorts, whereby MS registries and cohorts are regularly invited to share and upload their COVID-19 core dataset into the central data platform; and (3) aggregated data sharing via participating registries/cohorts, whereby some registries do not share data from individual patients but share aggregated results from specific queries.

Multidimensional contingency tables from 12 different data sources were merged, and then a combined anonymized dataset was reconstructed. Not all patients at each contributing data source necessarily participated in this study. Indeed, given the high proportion of patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, it is likely that a minority of patients at each center participated.

Data were entered for a given participant once, but information for that participant could be reentered, and these reentered data replaced the original record. This made for serial iterations of the analysis dataset, which were analyzed over time as the dataset expanded, thus allowing for assessment of temporal consistency of observed associations between the versions of the dataset. In this fashion, if associations were erratic in their appearance between iterations, this might suggest them to be statistical artifact, whereas consistency would indicate their veracity.

ALS and frontotemporal degeneration — advance preference elicitation and outcomes: For disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other progressive conditions, efforts should be made to elicit and document patient preferences for future disability-specific decisions (e.g., feeding tubes, mechanical ventilation), and when patients are considering opting for these life-sustaining interventions, it is important to identify the patient's minimal acceptable outcome; this is especially critical because interventions such as tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation prolong life for patients with ALS despite disease progression, such that many may become locked-in and have difficulty expressing a desire to shift the focus of care in the future; there is increasing recognition of cognitive impairment and dementia in ALS, and given the poor prognosis of patients with ALS — frontotemporal degeneration and their need for additional care and medical services, it is crucial to identify such patients at an early stage.

### Recovery from COVID-19 in multiple sclerosis: a prospective and longitudinal cohort study of the United Kingdom multiple sclerosis register [^da865a2c]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) evade the serious acute complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as hospitalization, respiratory failure, or death. Nevertheless, they may still have long-term effects of the infection, known as postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).

Understanding the burden of PASC among patients with MS and identifying its risk factors will inform MS rehabilitation services, which are going to deal with the emerging needs of patients with MS who had COVID-19. In this study, we aim to understand the course of recovery from COVID-19 in MS and to determine its predictors.

Summary

Introduction

Cognitive impairment is a significant healthcare problem globally and its prevalence is projected to affect over 150 million people worldwide. Survivors of critical illness are impacted frequently by long‐term neurocognitive dysfunction regardless of presenting illness, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. The goal of this review was to synthesise the existing evidence regarding potential mechanisms underlying neurocognitive dysfunction following critical illness in order to guide potential avenues for future research.

### Association of days alive and at home at day 90 after intensive care unit admission with long-term survival and functional status among mechanically ventilated patients [^d42535ad]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can days alive and at home at day 90 (DAAH 90) — a composite of mortality and the number of days at home at day 90 after intensive care unit (ICU) admission — be used to capture the burden of acute hospitalization and long-term functional outcomes in patients who require at least 7 days of mechanical ventilation?

Findings

In this cohort study of 463 patients receiving invasive ventilation across 10 medical or surgical ICUs in Canada, lower DAAH 90 was associated with multiple markers of higher ICU intensity and with worse functional outcomes and higher mortality up to 1 year following ICU discharge.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that DAAH 90 reflects the burden of critical illness and captures the long-term consequences of critical illness for functional status, quality of life, and survival.

### COVID-19 and MS disease-modifying therapies [^9768c137]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The dangers in life are infinite, and among them is safety.

Johann Wolfgang Goethe, German poet, novelist, and scientist (1749–1832)

In the treatment of MS, choosing the appropriate disease-modifying therapy (DMT) requires a balance between the benefits of the agent in suppressing disease activity and preventing progression and the risks associated with its administration, chiefly the potential for infectious disease that arises from the immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory effects. MS DMT use during the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has sparked growing concern among patients with MS and physicians alike.

The calculation regarding DMT risk in the face of COVID-19 can be distilled to the following: "risk of active disease consequent to DMT discontinuation relative to the risk of acquiring the infection and the risks of developing more aggressive COVID-19 once infection is acquired while on DMT, particularly the potentially life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ICU care and ventilatory support". Few elements of this equation are truly quantifiable with available data. However, knowledge of clinical prognostic factors and risks for rebound MS activity with DMT discontinuationshould be considered and melded with insights into COVID-19 pathophysiology and the biology of its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2.

With respect to acquisition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the risk to individuals with MS who are not on DMT is likely similar to that of the general population. Viral infection is dependent on exposure, which may be difficult to avoid, as it spreads through communities, especially as carriers may be asymptomatic yet infectious. Whether treatment of patients with MS with a given DMT confers an increased risk of becoming infected with the virus and whether it affects the risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications are currently unknown.

Importantly, severe SARS-CoV-2–mediated disease, including ARDS, appears to be the consequence of a robust and dysregulated immune response rather than an immune-deficient state with unchecked viral replication. This observation parallels that noted with the related virus, SARS-CoV-1, in which the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) appeared to be mediated by a massive proinflammatory response in infected lungs with an elaboration of cytokines and chemokines and recruitment of inflammatory cells leading to tissue damage, vascular leakage, and pulmonary fibrosis, in addition to complement activation.

### Critical care and pandemic preparedness and response [^a6b8bd52]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Long-term outcomes

In addition to bearing the mental and physical scars of general critical illness complications, such as PTSD, digital injuries from pressors, ICU acquired weakness, patients can have disease specific complications from pandemic illnesses. Whilst they may not bear the visible stigmata of post-polio neuropathies or smallpox scars, the survivors of critical COVID-19 continue to suffer with persistent organ dysfunction well after the initial insult. In one large-scale study of a large United States Veterans Administration data set of the patients admitted with to critical care units with COVID-19 compared with patients admitted to hospital without a positive test, there was a 6-month hazard ratio of 13.26 for developing end stage kidney disease — this represents a truly life-changing event.

One peculiarity of critical COVID-19 was its propensity to require attritional periods of tracheal intubation with high pressures from poorly compliant lungs. In addition, tracheostomies for profound neuromuscular weakness and parenchymal damage aggregated to lead to a remarkable incidence of tracheal lesions, including tracheo-oesophageal fistulae, subglottic stenosis, and tracheomalacia. It is our experience that many of these complications will need outpatient surgical management, and some might lead to the need for long-term artificial airways.

Patients also bear the mental scars of their illness, for example Ebola survivors are haunted by traumatic memories of their illness, and brush with mortality. This is especially challenging in environments such as Liberia, with one psychiatrist and one mental health hospital in the country as of 2015 at the end of the outbreak.GPICS and NICE guidance both advocate the follow-up of critical care survivors inclusive of psychological sequalae.

Management of critically ill pandemic survivors through their acute stay can become a Pyrrhic victory if their longer-term health needs are not met upon discharge. A structured and multidisciplinary approach is fundamental to tackling the multiple sequalae of post-pandemic critical care. The post-intensive care syndrome — a constellation of: skeletal muscle wasting and neuromuscular dysfunction, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and speech problems can persist for many years, greatly affecting functional status and quality of life. This is equally applicable to post-pandemic survivors as a general ITU population. The Post ICU Presentation Screen Tool (PICUPS) was developed during the pandemic and is the first multiprofessional tool to facilitate selection of patients for closer follow-up and generation of an appropriate rehabilitation prescription.

### Predictive factors for death and long-term outcomes in elderly critically ill patients following tracheotomy: a retrospective analysis [^85f5a27e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elderly patients with respiratory failure following acute exacerbation of underlying diseases often require intensive care unit admission for rescue treatment involving tracheal intubation. A small percentage, ranging from 5 to 10%, of mechanically ventilated patients opt for tracheostomy. The aging organ function and compromised immune system of elderly patients often lead delayed removal from tracheal intubation. Tracheotomy can facilitate better clinical airway management and aid in the weaning process. However, clinical observations have revealed a high mortality rate among elderly and very elderly critically ill patients who undergo tracheostomy. Decision-making regarding further tracheostomy in such cases is complex for family members, and doctors struggle to provide clear guidance. While some studies suggest that early tracheotomy in severely ill patients may reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, it does not impact short-term all-cause mortality. Many very elderly critically ill patients have a short life expectancy following tracheostomy due to underlying irreversible conditions, causing distress and psychological burden for both patients and their families. Research on the long-term survival outcomes of patients following tracheotomy is limited, with some studies indicating an increase in mortality rates over time and a significantly diminished quality of life for these individuals. Some studies suggest that the Tracheostomy Well-Being Score (TWBS) could enhance the quality of life for posttracheostomy patients by enabling early intervention and improved management. However, further promotion of its clinical application is necessary. A review of the literature revealed that there is a lack of research on the survival outcomes of critically ill elderly patients after tracheotomy. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for mortality within six months after tracheotomy in elderly critically ill patients while also analyzing their quality of life. The findings should provide insight for decision-making regarding tracheotomy surgery in elderly critically ill patients, ultimately improving their prognosis and enabling early intervention, Additionally, the societal implications of the burden faced by family members of these patients are often overlooked. This study derived its results from extensive follow-up, highlighting its significance for public health.

### Multiple sclerosis and COVID-19: how many are at risk? [^da575728]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent months, there have been various attempts to quantify the cumulative risk for COVID‐19 severity/mortality. Most of the studies combined demographic data and comorbidities with clinical, laboratory‐chemical, or radiographic findings at admission, which is not suitable for quantifying the risk in the general population. Hence, we used a recently developed risk score categorizing patients' risk of COVID‐19 mortality based on age and comorbidities. The score was modified by adding severe physical disability (EDSS ≥ 6) as an additional risk factor relatively weighted according to a recent publication indicating that an EDSS ≥ 6 was associated with a twofold increased risk of severe COVID‐19.

Encouragingly, the proportion of patients theoretically at high risk of COVID‐19 mortality if they contract the virus is below 1%, which is within the range of global mortality reports averaging about 3% in the general population. Although there is no evidence‐based guidance, various expert committees have published recommendations on how to manage MS patients and DMT during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The initial approaches offered very conservative advice, with some even suggesting discontinuation of DMT, whereas published guidelines have now become less cautious as assuring experiences are growing. Our data add to that, as they show that the overwhelming proportion of MS patients are not to be considered at high risk of COVID‐19 mortality. Also, most of the high‐risk group is not even receiving DMT, thus rendering the question of stopping DMT in patients with high risk of COVID‐19 mortality somewhat marginal. Theoretical considerations suggest that DMTs might even mitigate the overshooting immune response, which is likely pathophysiologically underlying the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID‐19. However, there are no conclusive data regarding the effect of DMTs on the frequency of serious COVID‐19 complications, including ARDS, to date. Still, in patients with low to moderate risk of COVID‐19 mortality, the benefit–risk ratio seems to be in favor of at least continuing and likely also initiating DMT when indicated by the course of MS in the respective individual patient. Importantly, the standard of care for MS patients including continuation of safety monitoring procedures needs to be upheld as far as possible depending on local circumstances. As always, treatment decisions should be extensively discussed with patients and individually tailored, taking into account all MS‐specific parameters as well as, for example, comorbidities, social circumstances, and personal risk perception.

### Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) / motor neuron disease (MND) [^066d44eb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Riluzole is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in most countries. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival, and to assess the effect of riluzole upon functional health.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011) and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: randomized controlled trials

Types Of Participants

adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author performed data extraction and two other authors checked them. One author checked the data and entered them into the computer. The other authors verified the data entry. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible.

Main Results

The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P = 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P < 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P = 0.046). This represented a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49% in the placebo and 58% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.31).

Authors' Conclusions

Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

### Long-term consequences of an intensive care unit stay in older critically ill patients: design of a longitudinal study [^16497af3]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Design

A prospective longitudinal study will be conducted in older critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Data will be collected over a period of two years at the following intervals: during ICU admission and 1 week, 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge. A flow chart of the study is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Flow Chart of the Study Design. Schedule of the Study and Measurements of the ICU and Comparison Groups.

Participants and Setting

The study will be conducted in the interdisciplinary ICU of a Swiss university hospital, where approximately 4000 patients with surgical procedures, illnesses, and trauma are treated each year, as well as at 12 follow-up clinics. From this ICU, 150 older critically ill patients (age 65 years and older) will be recruited, to be followed until 1 year after discharge from the hospital (the ICU group). A sample of 100 patients will be needed, based on a power analysis; with a 95% confidence interval for an estimated prevalence of pain between 0.30–0.50 and a total of 0.20, a sample size of 81–96 is needed. In order to ensure a large enough sample, and to counteract the potential loss of participants through mortality, relocation, attrition, or other problems, an additional 50 participants will be recruited (150 total). In order to be able to interpret trends in scores in the ICU group for the outcome variables pain, anxiety, agitation, HRQOL, use of the health care system (readmissions, GP visits, rehabilitation, length of hospital stay), medication use, living situation, and survival, we decided to collect similar data in a comparison group. Participants of the comparison group are a convenience sample of older people from the Swiss population, who have not been admitted to an ICU for the last 15 years. Through matching of age and gender, an attempt is made to increase the comparability of the groups at baseline.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To participate in this study, the participants must have a minimum age of 65 years, have had an ICU stay of at least 48 hours (ICU group) or no stay for the last 15 years (comparison group), be able to speak and read either German or French, and live in Switzerland. Excluded were participants because of temporary tracheostomies, chronic mechanical ventilation, illness-related cognitive impairment (dementia), or psychotic illnesses including delusions and changes in mental state, and potentially terminal illnesses such as lung or heart diseases and cancer.

### Practice parameter update: the care of the patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: drug, nutritional, and respiratory therapies (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^37466ee1]. Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) drug therapy — riluzole — has been the only drug approved for slowing disease progression in ALS, and prior guidance recommended riluzole 50 mg BID for patients with definite or probable ALS less than 5 years duration, with forced vital capacity (FVC) > 60%, and without tracheostomy (Level A). Based on 4 Class I trials, riluzole has a modest beneficial effect with prolonged survival of 2–3 months, with a number needed to treat to delay 1 death until after 12 months of 11. Observational database studies spanning 5 to 10 years suggested prolonged survival of 6 months (Class II), 7 to 10 months (Class III), 8–12 months (Class III), 9–14 months (Class III), or even 21 months (Class III). After 10 years of patient experience, the drug appears to be safe but expensive, and fatigue and nausea are known side effects. Conclusion and recommendation statements specify that riluzole is safe and effective for slowing disease progression to a modest degree in ALS (4 Class I studies) and that riluzole should be offered for slowing disease progression in patients with ALS (Level A).

### Planned dose reduction of ocrelizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a single-centre observational study [^4d490cf4]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our study has generated evidence supporting the potential for dose reduction of ocrelizumab in patients with RRMS as a risk mitigation strategy. Considering the natural progression of MS, characterised by heightened inflammatory activity in the early stages that tends to diminish with age and disease duration, our findings suggest that initiating full dose ocrelizumab treatment at disease onset, alongside a gradual reduction in treatment intensity, may emerge as a preferred treatment strategy. This approach not only demonstrates promise in maintaining clinical and radiological stability but also effectively addresses key considerations in MS treatment. It has the potential to mitigate the risk of serious infections associated with prolonged ocrelizumab use, reduce the significant costs of this MS medication for patients and providers and reduce pressure on infusion units. Nevertheless, recognising inherent challenges and limitations, further exploration through larger trials is imperative to validate and comprehensively evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of this strategy.

### Recovery after critical illness: putting the puzzle together-a consensus of 29 [^bfa56355]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Multidisciplinary approaches

For the immediate future, the research agenda is rich and challenging. Ample data on the long-term (years) adverse effects of relatively short periods (weeks) of critical illness are available. Additional trials based on the insights gained should be conducted and could be designed with reasonable equipoise. Studies to date suggest that early interventions may be beneficial, and later interventions less so. Yet, we also need to better understand whether there is a vulnerable period during which damage could result from an intervention being "too early". Common definitions need to be better developed to create a shared glossary of terms related to ICU recovery.

Collaboration is essential between scientists and clinicians define the cerebral and neuromuscular complications of critical illness in terms of the pathophysiologic and pathobiological mechanisms. Further studies focused on early physical therapy are needed to determine the most appropriate target population who are most likely to benefit with attention paid to the specific comorbidities or diagnoses to facilitate risk stratification and to promote response to treatment. Residual axonal loss should be evaluated in patients with critical illness polyneuropathy and persistent physical impairment and fatigue. Altered muscle regeneration should be examined in patients with critical illness myopathy and persistent physical impairment and fatigue. These collaborative efforts may lead to promising novel treatments such as mesenchymal cell therapy.

Perhaps most importantly, effective interventions must be developed, tested, and implemented, at various levels, to improve patients' and caregivers' abilities to cope with critical illness and its sequelae (prevent tissue impairment, rehabilitate activity limitations, compensate limitations, or adapt with reduction in quality of life). Some evidence exists that rehabilitation should start early during critical illness, but modalities of rehabilitation remain to be tested and clarified. Although additional studies are needed to reconcile uncertainties about early physical and occupational therapy, addressing the detrimental effects of immobilization and sedation is urgent as they are already known to impair physical and cognitive status. Whether weaning strategies should be tailored based on respiratory muscle monitoring prior to extubation requires further evaluation. More research is needed to further document the (non)recovery of the neuro-endocrine alterations that occur during critical illness and on how these correlate with/affect the legacy of an ICU stay.

### Disease-modifying therapies and coronavirus disease 2019 severity in multiple sclerosis [^e3bf1e79]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Percentage of patients with pneumonia/hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU)/death in the subgroup of subjects with age < 65 years and Expanded Disability Status Scale < 6.5, according to multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotype (relapsing–remitting vs progressive MS), in the anti‐CD20, no therapy, and other therapies groups. DMT = disease‐modifying therapy.

The increase of risk associated with anti‐CD20 was maintained on hard end points (death or ICU admission), even if the small number of events did not allow this to reach statistical significance (Supplementary Appendix).

The adjusted OR for anti‐CD20 therapy versus all the other therapies was 2.37 (95% CI = 1.36–4.12, p = 0.002). Exploratory analyses revealed no association between COVID‐19 severity and the time passed since the last anti‐CD20 infusion (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.31–5.89, p = 0.012 for last infusion within 3 months and OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 0.97–4.28, p = 0.023 for last infusion before 3 months), whereas there was a trend with therapy duration; as compared to PwMS treated with other therapies, patients on anti‐CD20 therapy for < 6 months had an OR = 1.65 (95% CI = 0.56–4.90, p = 0.36), patients on anti‐CD20 therapy for 6–12 months had an OR = 2.24 (95% CI = 0.91–5.55, p = 0.08), and patients on anti‐CD20 therapy for > 12 months had an OR = 2.98 (95% CI = 1.37–6.46, p = 0.006; Supplementary Appendix).

No severe outcomes (no pneumonia, hospitalization, ICU, or death) were observed in the 11 patients treated with cladribine or in the 14 patients treated with alemtuzumab.

Applying Our Framework

Case 1

(A young, previously healthy woman who survived ARDS but suffers PTSD and cognitive impairment): Ms. Smith, I can only imagine what you've been through these last 2 weeks. You were on the ventilator to support failing lungs. I'm so glad you're getting better, but it's important to remember that there is still a long road to full recovery ahead. Often it takes the body and brain longer to get well than it takes them to get sick. However, most people who come into the ICU at your young age, and in such previous good state of health, will return to close to their baseline or even back to baseline. Remember, though, that a large fraction will have impairments over the first several months, and some of these could even last longer. For you, that might mean difficulty immediately returning to your job as a computer programmer or remembering the details needed to manage your household with 2 kids. As an ICU survivor, you may develop mental health problems from the suffering you went through. We did our best to lower your risk of developing these problems by minimizing sedation and keeping you mobile. This is a lot to take in after what you've been through, and our ICU recovery clinic would be happy to see you after discharge. They can screen for these problems and provide available resources. You're not alone in your recovery.

### Long-term outcome of patients hospitalized in intensive care units with central or extrapontine myelinolysis* [^2172ec71]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Very few data are available for critically ill patients with central or extrapontine myelinolysis and according to available evidence, the prognosis seems to be poor. We aimed to describe the baseline characteristics, the management, the long-term prognosis, and the prognostic factors in central or extrapontine myelinolysis.

Design

Retrospective observational study considering modified Rankin Scale score > 3 or death as an unfavorable outcome.

Setting

Forty-six French intensive care units.

Patients

Thirty-six patients with central or extrapontine myelinolysis treated in 2000–2010.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

At baseline, 31 (86%) patients were alcoholics and 33 (92%) presented with hyponatremia. Mechanical ventilation was required in 32 (89%) patients. At 1-yr follow-up, 11 (31%) patients have died, whereas 14 (56%) survivors have returned to a Rankin score ≤ 1. Life-supporting therapies were withheld in 11 (31%) patients. Severe cerebral motor disability was the most frequently cited reason. However, five of them were still alive at 1 yr with Rankin score ≤ 1 for four of them. We found no statistical difference between the 18 (50%) patients with a favorable outcome and the 18 (50%) patients with an unfavorable outcome with regard to severity of illness, suggesting that recovery is possible and unpredictable on the basis of clinical presentation. Chronic alcoholism was less frequent in patients with a favorable outcome as compared with patient with an unfavorable outcome (13 [72%] vs. 18 [100%], p = .04).

Conclusions

The prognosis of critically ill patients with central or extrapontine myelinolysis is better than thus far thought despite initial severe clinical manifestations. Regarding the high rate of decisions to withhold life-supporting therapies, the probability of a favorable outcome might be underestimated by intensivists.

### Long-term outcomes after critical illness: recent insights [^bfe9d4d9]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Expanding the definition of PICS

The current, syndrome-based definition of PICS has primarily helped to raise awareness and engagement among all stakeholders (physicians, nurses and (para)medical specialties involved in the recovery process, patients, families, health authorities). However, PICS may be viewed as an "umbrella term" rather than an actual syndrome, because the underlying mechanisms for the many different components may vary. Indeed, there is huge heterogeneity among survivors of critical illness in terms of expressed components, intensity and duration of "PICS".

Over the last few years, several new conditions have been described in ICU survivors and have been suggested as additional components of PICS, for example, accelerated bone loss and increased risk of fragility fracture, swallowing disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders (including new-onset diabetes and transient alteration of cortisol and anterior pituitary hormones) and sleep disorders. Other post-intensive care sequelae include residual fatigue, defined as a feeling of extreme physical or mental tiredness. It may be explained by axonal losses, but is highly influenced by perceived social support. Persistent pain is also a frequent problem in ICU survivors and can be both nociceptive and neuropathic. Some potential sources of prolonged or chronic pain include poorly treated acute pain with overuse of opioids, immobilization and subsequent stiffness of tendons or ligaments, and nerve injuries or degeneration. Importantly, there is a strong interplay between physical, mental and psychological disorders, which merits more attention.

In view of the growing awareness of these additional post-ICU conditions, it may be time to revise the current syndromic definition. We suggest expanding the definition of PICS to include other domains (Fig. 1) that may be relevant to post-ICU survivors and could further increase awareness of the long-term sequelae of ICU survival. Nevertheless, the validity of this approach needs to be assessed before it can be widely adopted.

### Long-term outcomes and clinical predictors of hospital mortality in very long stay intensive care unit patients: a cohort study [^0b66b0b1]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	ICU patients admitted over a 3-year period with very long lengths of stay (= 30 days in the ICU) accounted for only 8% of total admissions but 48% of total occupied beds.

- 	Six months after hospital discharge, 50% of the cohort was still alive and 80% of the survivors were living in their previous place of residence.

- 	Prolonged requirements for life support therapies (mechanical ventilation, inotropes/vasopressors, or acute dialysis) and a limited number of pre-existing co-morbidities (immunosuppression and, to a lesser extent, patient age) were predictors of increased hospital mortality.

- 	These predictors may assist in clinical decision making for this resource intensive patient population, and their reproducibility in other very long stay patient populations should be explored.

### Intensive care unit-acquired weakness [^cf204147]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Severe weakness is being recognized as a complication that impacts significantly on the pace and degree of recovery and return to former functional status of patients who survive the organ failures that mandate life-support therapies such as mechanical ventilation. Despite the apparent importance of this problem, much remains to be understood about its incidence, causes, prevention, and treatment.

Design

Review from literature and an expert round-table.

Setting

The Brussels Round Table Conference in 2009 convened more than 20 experts in the fields of intensive care, neurology, and muscle physiology to review current understandings of intensive care unit-acquired weakness and to improve clinical outcome.

Main Results

Formal electrophysiological evaluation of patients with intensive care unit-acquired weakness can identify peripheral neuropathies, myopathies, and combinations of these disorders, although the correlation of these findings to weakness measurable at the bedside is not always precise. For routine clinical purposes, bedside assessment of neuromuscular function can be performed but is often confounded by complicating factors such as sedative and analgesic administration. Risk factors for development of intensive care unit-acquired weakness include bed rest itself, sepsis, and corticosteroid exposure. A strong association exists between weakness and long-term ventilator dependence; weakness is a major determinant of patient outcomes after surviving acute respiratory failure and may be present for months, or indefinitely, in the convalescence phase of critical illness.

Conclusion

Although much has been learned about the physiology and cell and molecular biology of skeletal and diaphragm dysfunction under conditions of aging, exercise, disuse, and sepsis, the application of these understandings to the bedside requires more study in both bench models and patients. Although a trend toward greater immobilization and sedation of patients has characterized the past several decades of intensive care unit care, recent studies have demonstrated that early physical and occupational therapy, including during the period of intubation and ventilator support, can be safely performed and will likely improve patient outcomes with regard to functional status.

### An observational study of changes to long-term medication after admission to an intensive care unit [^31954b23]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Many patients admitted to intensive care units consume long-term medication. New drugs may be commenced during intensive care intended for the short term or longer. Patients are often cared for by several teams during hospital admission and long-term medication may inadvertently be permanently discontinued. Following admission, new therapies relevant only in the short term could be continued beyond intensive care and hospital discharge. We conducted a retrospective analysis of drug prescription by examining patients' notes and charts before, during and after intensive care admission. Of 197 drugs prescribed up to intensive care admission to 59 patients, 112 (57%) were stopped. Ninety-nine of these were not reintroduced by intensive care discharge and 34 were not reintroduced by hospital discharge. Of 154 drugs commenced during intensive care, 96 (62%) had no listed reason for their introduction. Twenty-eight were continued beyond hospital discharge, some without apparent ongoing indication. Reliable mechanisms to prevent prescription errors are required.

### Mechanisms underlying neurocognitive dysfunction following critical illness: a systematic review [^86cafe1c]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Included studies were anticipated to be exploratory and observational with multiple different hypothesised mechanisms; given the variation in reported outcomes, a meta‐analysis was not possible and therefore the data were synthesised in narrative format. The modalities used to identify potential mechanisms were discussed and grouped thematically, based on broad techniques used (such as biomarkers and neuroimaging) and subsets of these methods. Study results were categorised and assessed based on specific aetiologies underlying initial critical illness. Identified lesions on neuroimaging, changes from pre‐illness imaging or identified biomarkers and their reported associations with cognitive outcomes were pooled and discussed. No restrictions were placed on number of studies required for synthesis for investigating individual mechanisms.

### Associations of disease-modifying therapies with COVID-19 severity in multiple sclerosis [^4dc08b57]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to prior clinic-based studies, our cohort focused on a predefined limited set of demographic and clinical characteristics. Thus, we could not assess other clinical features, particularly prior MS clinical course and DMT use, paraclinical information such as radiologic burden of MS, or the nuanced details of COVID-19 onset and evolution. Another limitation of our data is that they likely comprise greater proportions of severe cases requiring medical attention. One particular element lacking in our data is treatment duration or duration since treatment; both may have bearing on the degree of B-cell depletion and thus on COVID-19 severity. This information was included in the core questionnaire, but the level of missingness was too high to be a component of analyses. These data would have been useful in better describing and explaining the differences in the associations between rituximab and ocrelizumab, but unfortunately, this information was not available here. In addition, data on steroid use and other DMTs that might have affected clinical progression or resulted in less severe COVID-19 were not available.

Heterogeneity in the definitions of exposure and outcomes and in patient inclusion among the data sources is a known problem in combining multiple data sources. Related to this are the differences in protocols for hospital and ICU admission and initiation of artificial ventilation between hospitals, as well as differences in the availability/use of DMTs between countries. To ensure that our results were not being driven by single influential data sources, we undertook all analyses using random-effects logistic regression, as well as serial-exclusion sensitivity analyses. These analyses showed that, while there was some variation in the magnitudes and significance of associations, trends tracked as seen for the whole cohort, indicating that the results were not driven by a specific data source.

Another issue lies in the anonymous nature of the data entry, such that patients may be entered more than once in different data sources. We are unable to account for whether participants already participated or had their data entered in another study because there is no identifying information to assess this or any query of prior participation in the survey.

Short versus long ICU care — We suggest that patients receive ICU treatment if their prognosis for recovery and quality of life is acceptable regardless of their length of ICU stay; however, factors such as age, comorbidities, prognosis, underlying diagnosis, and treatment modalities that can influence survival should be taken into account (ungraded). Supporting context notes that older patients and those with prolonged requirement for life-supportive therapies, pre-existing comorbidities, and multisystem organ failure have higher mortality rates, and that the dominant reasons for prolonged ICU stays are multiple organ failure, ventilatory support, or single-organ failure in nonventilated patients.

### A 30-year clinical and magnetic resonance imaging observational study of multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndromes [^ab7f29ad]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly variable condition. Some people with MS accrue little or no neurological disability over decades, 1, 2 whereas others have their life significantly shortened. 3 With a view to preventing long‐term disability, there is growing interest in the early use of MS disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) capable of inducing sustained remission, albeit with the caveat that these may themselves be associated with life‐changing side effects. 4, 5 Given this, it is important that the approach to DMTs should, as far as possible, involve a personalized risk–benefit analysis, ideally early in the disease course.

About 85% of people with MS initially develop the relapsing–remitting form, and first present with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), an episode of neurological symptoms that at least partially resolves. 6 Features associated with more favorable longer‐term outcomes in MS include an early age at symptom onset, an initially relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) course, optic neuritis (ON), or a predominantly sensory CIS, complete remission after a CIS, and a longer interval between the first and second relapse. 1, 7 Following a CIS, a higher initial brain lesion load and greater accrual of lesions over the first 5 years, measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, are associated with an increased likelihood of developing disability within 20 years. 8 Lesions within the brainstem and spinal cord also appear to be associated with a greater risk of subsequent disability. 9, 10 Natural history studies have demonstrated that in the majority of people with RRMS, it took over a decade for their mobility to become limited, and over 2 decades before they were immobile without aids. 7 Given this, assessment of the relationships between early prognostic features and later outcomes ideally requires clinical follow‐up of 2 decades or more.

In this study, we considered 2 main questions: How diverse are clinical outcomes at 30 years following a CIS? Can we identify early on (within 5 years) those who will develop progressive MS or have their life shortened by MS? We addressed these questions using data from a unique cohort of people recruited prospectively following a CIS between 1984 and 1987. 11, 12 The group was followed up clinically and had MRI at 1, 5, 10, 14, 20, and now 30 years. As recruitment predated the DMT era, the cohort was largely untreated.

### Outcomes and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a north American registry of patients with multiple sclerosis [^91ba0537]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 Symptoms

Fewer than 55% (n = 878) reported fever as a symptom of COVID-19. Dry cough and fatigue were each reported in about 40% of patients (637 [39.2%] and 657 [40.4%], respectively), with shortness of breath in 30.3% (n = 492). Anosmia, ageusia, pain, and headache were each reported in approximately 25% of patients (423 [26%], 412 [25.3%], 416 [25.6%], and 418 [25.7%], respectively) (Figure 1). Neurological symptoms were reported in 144 patients (8.9%). Of those with neurological symptoms, 64 (44.4%) reported motor dysfunction, and 37 (25.7%) reported cognitive dysfunction. Eighty-five cases (5.2%) were reported as asymptomatic. Symptoms lasted for 14 or more days in more than half of patients (0–6 days, 214 [20.8%]; 7–13 days, 285 [27.7%]; 14–20 days, 284 [27.6%]; and ≥ 21 days, 247 [24.0%]).

To the Editor:

Comprehensive data on long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are scarce, especially in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 survivors. Previously, we reported on persisting respiratory, physical, and mental impairments of these patients at 3 months after hospital discharge. To assess long-term evolution of these sequelae, we repeated our multidomain assessment at 12 months after hospital discharge.

### Autoimmune encephalitis at the neurological intensive care unit: etiologies, reasons for admission and survival [^079ced16]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

In concert with the results from Mittal et al. we found seizures to be common (48 vs. 40.7%) clinical manifestation in AE patients requiring ICU admission. Behavioral changes and subacute cognitive decline, in contrast, occured predominantly among seropositive AE patients in our series (38.5 vs. 7.1%), but were more prevalent in the antibody-negative group of the mixed ICU cohort in Mittal's study (38.5 vs. 66.7%, respectively). When interpreting these data, one has to take a referral bias innate to a NICU population into account.

The most common reason for ICU admission in our study population was status epilepticus (26%). Status epilepticus is a predictor of poor outcome in general for patients with encephalitis and specifically in critically ill patients with encephalitis. Remarkably, only one of the study patients admitted because of status epilepticus had lethal outcome. Interestingly, a recent French study reported that the occurrence of status epilepticus during the ICU stay in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was not associated with poor outcome. For GABA A receptor antibody encephalitis high antibody titers were shown to be associated with a more severe clinical course and occurence of seizures, refractory status epilepticus, or both. Thus, future studies should confirm and expand the relevance of antibody titers on the risk for the development of seizures.

We found that AE non-survivors (at ICU/hospital discharge/1 year) presented with more severe comorbidities, had more severe degree of critical illness as assessed by SAPS II scores, and had a higher requirement for mechanical ventilation than survivors. The latter finding is consistent with previous studies of critically ill patients suffering from encephalitis. Although not specific for an encephalitis population, comorbidity scores have been shown to be higher among neurological critical care non-survivors, albeit not in critically ill multiple sclerosis patients from our ICU, as we have studied previously.

As concerns the results of paraclinical investigations in our study population, only 46% showed abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings. More than one-third of patients had MRI (FLAIR/T2) abnormalities supporting the diagnosis of AE. A recent multicenter study suggested that the cerebrospinal fluid analysis and MRI remains unremarkable in a significant proportion of patients with AE (37 and 41%, respectively). Together with these reports, our results emphasize the need for a multimodal approach and a high degree of clinical suspicion to diagnose AE. Therefore, improved recognition of the disease and awareness among medical practitioners is paramount.

### Percutaneous versus surgical tracheostomy: a randomized controlled study with long-term follow-up [^85b63f54]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety, availability, and long-term sequelae of percutaneous vs. surgical tracheostomy.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled study.

Setting

Combined medical/surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary referral hospital.

Patients

Two hundred critically ill mechanically ventilated patients who required tracheostomy.

Interventions

Tracheostomy by either percutaneous tracheostomy or surgical tracheostomy performed in the intensive care unit.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome measure was the aggregate incidence of predefined moderate or severe complications. The secondary outcome measures were the incidence of each of the components of the primary outcome. Long-term follow-up included clinical assessment, flow volume loops, and bronchoscopy. Both groups were well matched for age, gender, admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, period of endotracheal intubation, reason for intubation, and admission diagnosis. There was no statistical difference between groups for the primary outcome. Bleeding requiring surgical intervention occurred in three percutaneous tracheostomy patients and in no surgical tracheostomy patient (p = .2). Postoperative infection (p = .044) and cosmetic sequelae (p = .08) were more common in surgical tracheostomy patients. There was a shorter delay from randomization to percutaneous tracheostomy vs. surgical tracheostomy (p = .006). Long-term follow-up revealed no complications in either group.

Conclusions

Both percutaneous tracheostomies and surgical tracheostomies can be safely performed at the bedside by experienced, skilled practitioners.

### Intensive care risk and long-term outcomes in pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [^5621ec87]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers a potential cure to over thousands of children annually across the world, including those with high-risk leukemia, immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies, and other life-threatening disorders. However, a key barrier to HCT success is the development of acute organ failure because of chemotherapeutic toxicity, radiation exposure, infection, genetic predisposition, and impaired or dysregulated immunity. Children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission suffer > 20% mortality, with rates exceeding 45% when intubation and mechanical ventilation are required.

A prominent goal of transplant and intensive care physicians is to quickly and correctly identify patients who are at high risk to stop the advancement of critical illness and prevent irreversible organ failure. This is predicated based on compelling evidence indicating that organ failure can be modified by promptly recognizing and intervening in its early stages. However, predicting who will require intensive care after HCT has been challenging because of relatively small number of patients spread out across multiple institutions with varying ICU admission criteria. Specifically, HCT databases do not capture ICU transfer data, and ICU databases do not rigorously phenotype HCT complexity, precluding deeper analyses of risk for critical illness.

In addition, although recent reports have shown improved survival to ICU discharge, long-term outcomes are lacking because ICU databases do not typically follow patients after ICU discharge. In 1 report of pediatric patients with HCT who survived to pediatric ICU (PICU) discharge, survival at 1 year was 40% relative to 1-year survival of 65% in patients who never required PICU admission; this suggests an ongoing burden of chronic organ toxicity in these vulnerable patients. All major international HCT organizations recommend following all pediatric patients who undergo HCT for long-term cardiopulmonary, renal, and multiorgan toxicities as well as for neurodevelopmental outcomes and health-related quality of life. These recommendations are even more crucial in light of estimates that the number of pediatric survivors of HCT doubled between 2009 and 2020 and will likely double again between 2020 and 2030 to reach nearly 64 000 patients. Taken together, these data suggest that both short- and long-term outcomes for pediatric patients with HCT who are critically ill remain suboptimal and that the toxicity of HCT remains a major barrier to a disease-free childhood for many patients.

This chapter will review the spectrum of immune-mediated diseases that affect the nervous system and may result in an admission to the neurological intensive care unit. Immunomodulatory strategies to treat acute exacerbations of neurological diseases caused by aberrant immune responses are discussed, but strategies for long-term immunosuppression are not presented. The recommendations for therapeutic intervention are based on a synthesis of the literature, and include recommendations by the Cochrane Collaborative, the American Academy of Neurology, and other key organizations. References from recent publications are provided for the disorders and therapies in which randomized clinical trials and large evidenced-based reviews do not exist. The chapter concludes with a brief review of the mechanisms of action, dosing, and side effects of commonly used immunosuppressive strategies in the neurocritical care unit.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^cb52c4df]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) epidemiology includes estimates that 13 to 20 million people annually require life support in intensive care units worldwide; in the United States, more than 750,000 people receive mechanical ventilation, with almost 300,000 requiring prolonged support (> 5 d) annually. Multiple series estimate that ~25% of patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation develop global and persistent weakness, and based on this, more than 75,000 patients in the United States and up to 1 million worldwide may develop ICUAW. Physical impairment is common and may persist for years, and in some patients physical deficits manifest as profound weakness associated with worsened outcomes.

### Long-term consequences of an intensive care unit stay in older critically ill patients: design of a longitudinal study [^84f84e1a]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Modern methods in intensive care medicine often enable the survival of older critically ill patients. The short-term outcomes for patients treated in intensive care units (ICUs), such as survival to hospital discharge, are well documented. However, relatively little is known about subsequent long-term outcomes. It is generally recognized that survival alone is not the only important outcome following an ICU stay. Various stress factors experienced in the ICU and the severity of illness or injury have long-term consequences. Over the long term, discomfort experienced in the ICU and stressful memories of an ICU stay have been associated with the development of acute posttraumatic stress disorder-related syndromes, anxiety, depression, and impaired health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). For some patients these symptoms are chronic and cause lasting personality changes. Other studies focus on outcomes such as functional status, ability to live at home, influence on the social network, and the burden on the family, all of which can, at times, be more important than the length of survival. Recent research has indicated that there may be significant cognitive and emotional dysfunction following critical illness. Another study shows that survivors of critical illnesses have increased health care system needs. Continuing hospital care, and/or rehabilitation, community support services or other healthcare services after the ICU stay were needed. In addition, there was an increase in the use of medication and of doctor visits. An increasing proportion of critically ill patients are aged (65 years and older). Older patients with severe injuries are at risk of poor outcome. Mortality rates are almost 22% in older surgical patients, and yet age alone does not appear to be a reliable predictor of outcome after ICU admission. Older patients express preferences for longer life under compromised health conditions more frequently than healthy persons. Until now, few studies have examined long-term outcomes after ICU admissions in older critically ill patients. Pain, anxiety and agitation are important stress factors for many critically ill patients, yet these symptoms are difficult to distinguish from one another. Pain, anxiety and agitation can have consequences for the health-related quality of life. In addition, pain, anxiety, and agitation, and their consequences for long-term outcomes, have rarely been examined in older critically ill patients in the ICU. In contrast to other studies, the present study examines the relationship between the ICU stay and post-hospital pain, anxiety and agitation in older critically ill patients, and addresses whether acute experiences in the ICU can cause more serious chronic conditions after discharge. This article describes a longitudinal study in which older critically ill patients are followed one year after their discharge from the hospital. Under investigation were their pain experiences, levels of anxiety and agitation, health-related quality of life, and use of the health care system, in order to detect relationships between these main outcomes and their ICU experiences.

### Registry studies of long-term multiple sclerosis outcomes: description of key registries [^47096e29]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) registries can provide valuable insights into the natural history of MS. Key observational findings of the registries include MS patient disability progression rate, predictors of increased disability, and changes in lifespan. MS registries have been established in Canada, the United States, and Europe, some of which have existed for decades. Recommendations for registry use and improvement based on a review of a selection of MS registries from these countries are presented.

Methods

A panel of experts analyzed the current status of a number of the established MS registries and made recommendations on their usefulness and on improvements for the creation of future MS registries.

Results

Improved inter-registry consistency in order to better compare and contrast the results of different registries was advocated. To follow the course of MS, the initiation of a prospective, complete, verifiable database of patients with clinically isolated syndrome was also recommended. Time to Expanded Disability Status Scale 6 was supported over mortality as the central endpoint of a registry study, because it can be detected earlier in the course of the disease than mortality.

Conclusions

The data collected from registries are considered valuable in understanding MS, despite difficulties with registries such as a lack of consistency between their databases.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^6cf5c2f8]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation options in progressive respiratory failure — the preponderance of evidence "favors invasive home MV via tracheostomy as a treatment option for patients with progressive respiratory failure", particularly those "unable to clear secretions or with changes in mental status such as frontotemporal dementia". Nonetheless, "continuous NIV also may be a possibility", and "Both invasive ventilation and full-time NIV should be considered acceptable options based on patient preferences, tolerability, ability to maintain mouthpiece ventilation, and availability of resources". MV "is associated with high costs and caregiver burden compared with NIV", evidence largely comes from ALS, and in slowly progressive disease "two-thirds of patients receiving MV reported improved quality of life". Timing remains uncertain: "no consensus exists" with "recommendations ranging from 12 to 24 h for NIV", while "Many patients can manage 24-h NIV effectively", and "the decision to transition to MV must not be solely time-based". Local expertise "can drive care choice between MV and NIV", including ease during "sleep, oral feeding, talking, and facial expression with invasive ventilation".

### Weakness in the intensive care unit [^429711c9]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

When asked to assess patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) who have respiratory muscle weakness, oropharyngeal weakness and a vulnerable airway, our immediate thought may be of Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis, but there are many other possible causes. For example, previously unrecognised chronic neurological conditions may decompensate and require ICU admission. Clinicians can use various clinical clues to help recognise them and need to understand how patterns of weakness reflect differing causes of reduced consciousness on ICU. Additionally, patients admitted to ICU for any reason may develop weakness during their stay, the most likely cause being ICU-acquired weakness. Assessing patients in ICU is challenging, hampered by physical barriers (machines, tubes), medication barriers (sedatives) and cognitive barriers (delirium, difficulty communicating). Nonetheless, we need to reach a clinical diagnosis, organise appropriate tests and communicate clearly with both patients and ICU colleagues.

### Guideline on multimodal rehabilitation for patients with post-intensive care syndrome [^8466d2e9]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Modern intensive care medicine enables more critically ill patients to survive life-threatening critical conditions. Critical illness can result from surgery, trauma, infection, or an exacerbation of a medical condition and results in malfunction of at least one organ, requiring medical, nursing, therapeutic, psychological, social, and/or technical support. This support is usually provided in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) but does not always restore health. Although survival rates are considered benchmarks of intensive care, ICU survivors are faced with increased morbidity, rehospitalization, and mortality as well as a lasting decline in health-related quality of life and participation in society. The symptoms and outcomes experienced by critically ill patients are subsumed under the term post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). PICS consists of a neurologically heterogenous complex of impairments which can be observed in critically ill patients after treatment in an ICU. The syndrome is characterized by new or increased impairments of physical cognitive, and/or psychological functions that outlast the stay in hospital. PICS is present if one or more of the following domains of function is impaired. Cognitive impairments present as delirium and deficits of attention, memory, executive functions, and visuospatial perception. Psychological impairments consist of depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Physical impairments, often summarized as "intensive care unit-acquired weakness" (ICU-AW), include neuromuscular functions of swallowing, breathing, mobility, and personal autonomy. Severe axonal critical care neuropathies can result in prolonged periods of convalescence and incomplete recovery. Impairment of one function may result in impairment of another; for example, depressive symptoms may lead to a reduction of physical health or cognitive function. Symptoms of PICS may appear as early as 24 h after admission to an ICU and may persist for 5–15 years after discharge. Symptoms of all three domains may emerge during any phase of the critical illness, acute, early or late. Symptoms of PICS are not specific to certain phases of critical illness. The risk to develop PICS is multifactorial; risk factors can contribute before (e.g. frailty, preexisting functional impairments), during (e.g. sedation, duration of delirium, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome), and after (e.g. early symptoms of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder) staying in the ICU. The family can be affected, too, leading to a complex, interacting phenomenon (Fig. 1).

Examples of illustrative cases of oscillating curative and comfort care

Case 1

This gentleman was admitted following a fall and sustaining a spine injury. He underwent surgery but remained quadriplegic and ventilator dependent. On day 2 of this admission the neurosurgical team decided not to escalate above non-invasive ventilation with the agreement of the ICU consultant. He had capacity to be involved with decision-making about his care at this time and his condition was discussed with him. He was asked if he wanted to continue having ventilatory support, in which case they would do a tracheostomy. He expressed that he wanted full active treatment, including resuscitation, and a tracheostomy was subsequently performed. He was discharged from ICU but re-admitted in respiratory failure secondary to infection. On the first day of this second admission it was documented that his resuscitation status was to be discussed with his family and the neurosurgeons and that prolonged resuscitation or multi-organ support was inappropriate. The next day the ICU consultant discussed the situation with the family and emphasised that, although he had improved slightly, he still had a serious spinal injury and the chance of any useful function return was very small and that he would not live as long as he would have without the injury. His condition continued to fluctuate; he was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation unit.

Case 2

This lady was admitted with an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. On admission, the ICU consultant made the decision that she was not for intubation or resuscitation because of her poor prognosis and pre-admission condition. This was discussed with her family but they were still keen for her to be treated actively. She was then reviewed by a respiratory consultant who felt that, as there was some evidence of reversibility and because of her previous reasonable exercise tolerance and quality of life, she deserved a trial of intubation and ventilation, if required physiologically. The ICU consultant then documented that after the discussion with the family, the decision was made to proceed with intubation and invasive ventilation, but with the proviso to limit intensive care interventions to treat breathing failure only, and not to add in treatment for failure of other organs should this occur. He also mentioned possible scenarios of continuing deterioration and of weaning failure in which case he would stop ineffective treatment and allow her to die. On Day 3, a respiratory physician who had known the patient for some time reviewed her and agreed that treating her respiratory disease was in the patient's best interests. This patient gradually improved and was discharged from ICU 24 days after admission.

Clinicians summarized events of the COVID-19 course by indicating whether the patient was hospitalized, admitted to the intensive care unit, required ventilator support, or died, with response options of yes, no, or unknown to each. Responses of unknown were considered as not having the outcome.

These events were used to create a single outcome of severe COVID-19 with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, ICU and/or required ventilator support, and death. If a patient had more than 1 of the events, they were assigned to the highest level of event that occurred.
13. Regarding individual components of the outcome, 425 visited an emergency department, 320 were hospitalized, 112 had pneumonia, 104 were admitted to the ICU, and 61 required ventilator support. A 25-fold increased odds of death for nonambulatory patients with MS compared with fully ambulatory patients was observed after adjustment for other risk factors. Cardiovascular disease was associated with a 91% increased risk of hospitalization alone and more than 3-fold increased odds of death from COVID-19. Hypertension was also associated with more than 3-fold increased risk of death but not other levels of clinical severity.

Results for the model including number of comorbidities were also consistent. Having 2 or more comorbid conditions was associated with increased odds of poorer clinical outcome compared with having no comorbidities.

### Hospitalizations due to respiratory failure in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their impact on survival: a population-based cohort study [^ce272ad4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

By the end of follow-up, 81.7% of patients were deceased; 53.3% of them died in hospital. During follow-up, the cohort had 885 hospitalizations (Table 2). Emergency admissions accounted for 47.6%. Median length of stay was 8 days (Inter Quartile Range IRQ 4; 15) in elective and 8 days (IQR 4; 17) in emergency admissions (data not shown).

Table 2
Number and distribution of the most common discharge diagnoses, by type of admission

a Number and percentage (%) of hospitalizations with the corresponding discharge diagnosis as primary code

b Number and percentage (%) of hospitalizations with the corresponding discharge diagnosis as primary or any secondary code

Respiratory failure was the most common discharge diagnosis, occurring as primary code in 19.4% and in any position in 31.6% hospitalizations, followed by pneumonia (5.5 and 14.2%, respectively) and aspiration pneumonia (1.0 and 2.1%, respectively).

Respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure and pneumonia were more frequent in emergency admissions, occurring as primary and/or secondary code in 45.6, 32.8 and 24.9% hospitalizations, respectively. Conversely, acute respiratory failure or pneumonia were uncommon in day hospital admissions (each 1.2%). Aspiration pneumonia occurred almost exclusively in emergency admissions.

More than 80% of the 114 patients who died in hospital, died in emergency hospitalizations. In hospitalizations ending with death, respiratory failure (58.8%) and diseases of the respiratory system (43.9%) were the most common codes (Additional file 1: Table S1).

The most common procedure was MV, performed in 18.4% hospitalizations and more frequently (13.2%) lasting ≥ 96 h, followed by tracheostomy (7.1%) and NIV (3.9%) (Table 3). MV was more common in emergency (29.9%) than in elective (12.4%) admissions, as well as NIV (5.0% vs. 2.0%) and tracheostomy (12.6% vs. 3.3%). Conversely, gastro–or entero–stomies were performed more frequently in elective (13.0%) admissions.

Balance of desirable and undesirable consequences — accurate prediction of the need for mechanical ventilation or protracted illness and disability supports planning of appropriate consecutive care including rehabilitation measures, and accurate prognostication also allows patient-centered goal setting; however, disadvantages of an inaccurate prediction of a poor outcome include fear and anxiety about the future, limitations of care, or even withdrawal of life support in an individual who could otherwise have made a meaningful recovery; the expert panel's consensus considered withdrawal of life support measures based on unreliable predictors in patients with GBS less likely compared with that in patients with other neurointensive conditions, such as severe traumatic brain injury, stroke, or cardiac arrest.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^245e7750]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Neurological assessment in Long COVID states that performance of a standard neurological examination should be guided by a patient's reported symptoms and the associated neurological differential diagnosis for central and peripheral nervous system conditions that can masquerade as Long COVID and/or become unmasked after SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, with examples including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, transverse myelitis, polyneuropathy, and radiculopathy. With regard to potential new treatment targets, elevated levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 during acute COVID‑19 infection have recently been associated with subsequent development of the neurologically predominant and multidomain clusters of Long COVID, and additional research regarding immunomodulatory function may hold promise for future interventions for neurologic symptoms.

### Practice parameter update: the care of the patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: drug, nutritional, and respiratory therapies (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^feacc1ca]. Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Quality of life (QOL) with ventilation in ALS — effects and recommendations are: NIV had a positive impact on QOL in 4 Class III studies with improvements lasting for 10 months or more and, in one Class III study, increased duration of QOL above 75% of baseline; there was no difference in QOL between NIV and tracheostomy invasive ventilation (TIV); most patients using either NIV (94%) or TIV (81%) would choose ventilation again, and another series found that 52% of patients using TIV rated their general health as good on the SF-12 with none regretting the decision; conclusions state NIV is possibly effective in raising QOL (5 Class III studies) and TIV is possibly effective in preserving QOL (2 Class III studies); recommendations are that NIV may be considered to enhance QOL in ALS with respiratory insufficiency (Level C) and TIV may be considered to preserve QOL in patients wanting long-term ventilatory support (Level C).

### Disease-modifying therapies and coronavirus disease 2019 severity in multiple sclerosis [^2848e884]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).

Methods

We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19. All the patients had complete follow‐up to death or recovery. Severe COVID‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization versus pneumonia or hospitalization versus intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated with severe COVID‐19 by multivariate and propensity score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.

Results

Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) COVID‐19, 13 (1.54%) died; 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.

After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration, body mass index, comorbidities, and recent methylprednisolone use, therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (ocrelizumab or rituximab) was significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–4.74, p = 0.015) with increased risk of severe COVID‐19. Recent use (< 1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted analysis and by all the sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the COVID‐19 pandemic persists. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:780–789

Variables Assessed

Collected data are detailed in the eCRF. We collected demographic data, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), patient‐reported race and ethnic group, work status, number of cohabitants and number of cohabitants positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, patient‐reported smoking and drinking status, and comorbidities; MS history data, including type of MS (relapsing–remitting MS [RRMS], primary progressive, or secondary progressive), disease onset date, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), DMTs at the date of symptoms start, and date of last treatment dose; and COVID‐19 infection data, including suspected geographic area of infection, symptoms, laboratory and radiological data, hospitalization, pneumonia and severity of pneumonia according to radiological examinations and ventilation support, therapies for COVID‐19, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and recovery or death.

Each week a query for follow up update was sent to all centers, until they filled the outcome report (death or recovery).

End Points

We run 2 main analyses on the following primary endpoints: (1) observed number of deaths over the whole follow‐up; and (2) severe COVID‐19 characterized by a 3‐level variable; the highest severity level was death or ICU admission, the intermediate severity level was diagnosis of pneumonia or hospitalization, and the lowest severity level was a milder disease with no need for hospitalization or documented diagnosis of pneumonia.

### Long-term return to functional baseline after mechanical ventilation in the ICU [^c598e527]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Predictors of long-term functional impairment in acute respiratory failure of all causes are poorly understood. Our objective was to assess the frequency and predictors of long-term functional impairment or death after invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure of all causes.

Design

Population-based, observational cohort study.

Setting

Eight adult ICUs of a single center.

Patients

All adult patients from Olmsted County, Minnesota, without baseline functional impairment who received mechanical ventilation in ICUs for acute respiratory failure of all causes from 2005 through 2009.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

In total, 743 patients without baseline functional impairment received mechanical ventilation in the ICU. At 1- and 5-year follow-up, the rates of survival with return to baseline functional ability were 61% (366/597) and 53% (356/669). Among 71 patients with new functional impairment at 1 year, 55% (39/71) had recovered and were alive without functional impairment at 5 years. Factors predictive of new functional impairment or death at 1 year were age, comorbidities, discharge to other than home, mechanical ventilation of 7 days or longer, and stroke. Of factors known at the time of intubation, the following are predictive of new functional impairment or death: age, comorbidities, nonsurgical condition, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, stroke, and sepsis. Post hoc sensitivity analyses revealed no significant change in predictor variables in patient populations when stroke was excluded or who received more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

At 1- and 5-year follow-up, many patients who received mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure from all causes are no longer alive or have new moderate-to-severe functional impairment. Functional recovery between year 1 and year 5 is possible and common. Sepsis, stroke, illness severity, age, and comorbidities predict long-term functional outcome at intubation.

Post-intensive care syndrome

Post-intensive care syndrome occurs when patients have new or worsening impairments in at least one of three domains, following and persisting after an ICU admission. These domains include physical function (e.g. neuromuscular or pulmonary disease), cognitive function (e.g. memory, attention, or executive function), and mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder). There are both subjective and objective instruments used to measure these impairments, although there is no widely accepted consensus on which specific instruments to use and at what point to assess patients after discharge. Impairments in these domains affect social aspects, such as employment, and health-related quality of life. Approximately 50% of acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors do not return to work within 1 yr after discharge. The term post-intensive care syndrome applies to family members and the survivors themselves. Thus, post-intensive care syndrome gives a patient-focused approach in its definition, and this can be useful for ICU service evaluations and quality improvement initiatives. The broad nature of its definition underlies the heterogeneity in symptoms reported by this patient cohort. A limitation of the definition is that it does not provide mechanistic insights that could aid treatment development.

### Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: clinical phenotypes and molecular mechanisms [^74e13a87]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) begins within hours of mechanical ventilation and may not be completely reversible over time. It represents a major functional morbidity of critical illness and is an important patient-centered outcome with clear implications for quality of life and resumption of prior work and lifestyle. There is heterogeneity in functional outcome related to ICUAW across various patient populations after an episode of critical illness. This state-of-the art review argues that this observed heterogeneity may represent a clinical spectrum of disability in which there are recognizable clinical phenotypes for outcome according to age, burden of comorbid illness, and ICU length of stay. It further argues that these functional outcomes are modified by mood, cognition, and caregiver physical and mental health. This proposed construct of clinical phenotypes will be used as a framework for a review of the current literature on the molecular biology of muscle and nerve injury. This translational approach for the development of models pairing clinical phenotypes for different functional outcomes after critical illness with molecular mechanism of injury may offer unique insights into the diagnosis and treatment of muscle and nerve lesions.

### Neuromuscular disease in respiratory and critical care medicine [^c119fa43]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular diseases that affect the respiratory system are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both acute and long-term settings. This conference examined the pathophysiology and management of neuromuscular diseases in both settings. Presentations by experts representing respiratory, physiologic, pediatric, neurologic, and intensive-care disciplines covered a broad range of topics. This summary of the conference briefly describes the main points of each presentation and highlights areas that need addressing in the future. Major topics covered include the basic respiratory pathophysiology of neuromuscular disease; respiratory complications and management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; techniques of noninvasive ventilation and secretion removal; and evaluation and management of neuromuscular-induced respiratory failure in the acute-care setting, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic crisis, and critical-illness myoneuropathy.

Primary and secondary outcome definition

The primary outcome was the need for endotracheal intubation for MV. A cut‐off of MV starting within 8 weeks from onset of weakness was used, because if a lower cut‐off (4 or 6 weeks) was used patients with respiratory failure due to TRF or prolonged progressive phase could potentially be missed. With respect to the censoring method for patients with MV, the time until MV start was used, whilst patients not requiring MV were censored at 2 months, or at the date of lost to follow‐up or death. As per institutional protocol, endotracheal intubation and MV were initiated when the physiological and/or clinical parameters vital capacity < 20 mL/kg or negative inspiratory force < −20 cmH₂O were identified and/or persistence of the following clinical signs: unsustainable work of breathing, refractory hypoxaemia, hypercapnia or acidaemia. Bulbar muscle dysfunction with inadequate airway protection, ineffective cough, retention of bronchial secretions and altered consciousness were factors which generally contraindicated a non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) trial and required elective endotracheal intubation. The secondary outcome was the need for tracheostomy due to weaning failure. In patients who underwent endotracheal intubation a weaning trial was considered when physiological parameters showed clear evidence of improved respiratory muscle strength: maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) > −20 cmH₂O, maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) > 40 cmH₂O, forced vital capacity (FVC) > 10 mL/kg. Extubation was attempted when patients showed no clinical signs of respiratory fatigue during a spontaneous breathing trial with pressure support ventilation (PSV), in conjunction with other physiological parameter improvement: FVC of at least 15 mL/kg, MIP ≥ −20 cmH₂O, normal exchanges on arterial blood gas analysis. In patients who failed several weaning trials and/or showed no improvement of physiological respiratory muscle parameters after 15 days of MV, tracheostomy was performed with the percutaneous dilatational technique. In patients who underwent intubation, the duration of MV in days was dichotomized for statistical purposes as less than or more than 7, to distinguish patients successfully extubated from those who required prolonged intubation.

### Mechanical ventilation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / motor neuron disease [^ae00b070]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Neuromuscular respiratory failure is the most common cause of death, which usually occurs within two to five years of the disease onset. Supporting respiratory function with mechanical ventilation may improve survival and quality of life. This is the second update of a review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mechanical ventilation (tracheostomy-assisted ventilation and non-invasive ventilation (NIV)) on survival, functional measures of disease progression, and quality of life in ALS, and to evaluate adverse events related to the intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 30 January 2017. We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving non-invasive or tracheostomy-assisted ventilation in participants with a clinical diagnosis of ALS, independent of the reported outcomes. We included comparisons with no intervention or the best standard care.

Data Collection and Analysis

For the original review, four review authors independently selected studies for assessment. Two review authors reviewed searches for this update. All review authors independently extracted data from the full text of selected studies and assessed the risk of bias in studies that met the inclusion criteria. We attempted to obtain missing data where possible. We planned to collect adverse event data from the included studies.

Main Results

For the original Cochrane Review, the review authors identified two RCTs involving 54 participants with ALS receiving NIV. There were no new RCTs or quasi-RCTs at the first update. One new RCT was identified in the second update but was excluded for the reasons outlined below. Incomplete data were available for one published study comparing early and late initiation of NIV (13 participants). We contacted the trial authors, who were not able to provide the missing data. The conclusions of the review were therefore based on a single study of 41 participants comparing NIV with standard care. Lack of (or uncertain) blinding represented a risk of bias for participant- and clinician-assessed outcomes such as quality of life, but it was otherwise a well-conducted study with a low risk of bias. The study provided moderate-quality evidence that overall median survival was significantly different between the group treated with NIV and the standard care group. The median survival in the NIV group was 48 days longer (219 days compared to 171 days for the standard care group (estimated 95% confidence interval 12 to 91 days, P = 0.0062)). This survival benefit was accompanied by an enhanced quality of life. On subgroup analysis, in the subgroup with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function (20 participants), median survival was 205 days longer (216 days in the NIV group versus 11 days in the standard care group, P = 0.0059), and quality of life measures were better than with standard care (low-quality evidence). In the participants with poor bulbar function (21 participants), NIV did not prolong survival or improve quality of life, although there was significant improvement in the mean symptoms domain of the Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index by some measures. Neither trial reported clinical data on intervention-related adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence from a single RCT of NIV in 41 participants suggests that it significantly prolongs survival, and low-quality evidence indicates that it improves or maintains quality of life in people with ALS. Survival and quality of life were significantly improved in the subgroup of people with better bulbar function, but not in those with severe bulbar impairment. Adverse effects related to NIV should be systematically reported, as at present there is little information on this subject. More RCT evidence to support the use of NIV in ALS will be difficult to generate, as not offering NIV to the control group is no longer ethically justifiable. Future studies should examine the benefits of early intervention with NIV and establish the most appropriate timing for initiating NIV in order to obtain its maximum benefit. The effect of adding cough augmentation techniques to NIV also needs to be investigated in an RCT. Future studies should examine the health economics of NIV. Access to NIV remains restricted in many parts of the world, including Europe and North America. We need to understand the factors, personal and socioeconomic, that determine access to NIV.

### Clinical review: intensive care unit acquired weakness [^149ec423]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

ICUAW affects many critically ill patients and is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay, as well as increased ICU and hospital mortality and healthcare-related hospitalization costs. In addition, following the acute phase of illness, ICUAW may be an important contributor to the physical limitations persisting in ICU survivors, associated with reduced health-related quality of life, as well as higher 1-year mortality. This underscores the importance for future research on prevention of ICUAW. In parallel, the underlying mechanisms contributing to the poor outcome of weak patients and the potential to avert unfavorable outcomes by post-ICU follow-up of these patients should also be investigated further.

### Cognitive dysfunction after critical illness: measurement, rehabilitation, and disclosure [^9f369af2]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

A growing consensus seems to be emerging that neurocognitive outcomes are poor for patients who have been critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. However, intensive care unit delirium, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other outcomes must be considered as potentially confounding factors. Once the uncertainty around the causes of postmorbid cognitive functioning is acknowledged, there are practical implications for appropriate rehabilitative interventions and there are ethical implications for the kinds of appropriate disclosure to patients.
