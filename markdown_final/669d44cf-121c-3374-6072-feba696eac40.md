## Question

What is the order of treatment for a stemi

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the order of treatment for STEMI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify the reperfusion strategy selection based on time and access to PCI. Next, I will review adjunctive pharmacotherapy, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, analgesic, and anti-ischemic agents. After that, I need to check special scenarios like cardiogenic shock, in-hospital STEMI, and late presenters. Finally, I will consider secondary prevention and quality metrics, and I will double-check any points that seem uncertain as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: activate EMS, obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of first medical contact, establish IV access, give oxygen if hypoxic, and start continuous monitoring with defibrillation readiness, because early ECG acquisition and interpretation are foundational to timely reperfusion and directly influence outcomes [^0128c090] [^c6677206].

> Wait, let me verify the reperfusion decision framework before jumping ahead. Primary PCI is preferred when it can be achieved within guideline-directed time frames, specifically within 90 minutes of first medical contact at a PCI-capable hospital or within 120 minutes if transfer is required, and this timing target is consistently associated with lower mortality when met [^b090073b] [^aa453770]. If the anticipated delay to PCI is 120 minutes or more, fibrinolysis should be administered as soon as possible, ideally prehospital, with a target door-to-needle time under 30 minutes, and then patients should be transferred immediately for coronary angiography and PCI within 24 hours [^7629ad2e] [^5b196868] [^18e0ee57].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacoinvasive pathway details. After fibrinolysis, routine early angiography with intent to perform PCI between 2 and 24 hours reduces death or reinfarction compared with a rescue-only approach, and immediate transfer after lysis is recommended to enable this strategy [^590b174e] [^18e0ee57]. I initially thought facilitated PCI within 2 hours might be beneficial, but wait, I need to correct that — facilitated PCI immediately after lysis increases bleeding and may worsen outcomes, so the safer and more effective approach is the pharmacoinvasive strategy with angiography after a few hours, not immediate PCI right after lysis [^15cbc091] [^63ba20d6].

> Next, I should review antiplatelet therapy and make sure I get the dosing right. Aspirin should be given immediately as a loading dose of 150–300 mg orally or chewed, followed by 75–100 mg daily long term if no contraindications exist, and this reduces mortality and adverse events [^716ac271] [^94afc891]. For P2Y12 inhibition, ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose then 90 mg twice daily is preferred regardless of reperfusion strategy, with clopidogrel 300–600 mg loading as an alternative when ticagrelor is not suitable or in combination with fibrinolysis, and I should confirm that clopidogrel is the P2Y12 agent paired with lysis in contemporary guidance, which it is [^2efd1d06] [^c5f7a872].

> I need to check anticoagulation choices and align them with the reperfusion strategy. With primary PCI, unfractionated heparin is standard, with bivalirudin as a reasonable alternative in selected patients, whereas with fibrinolysis, enoxaparin is preferred and fondaparinux is an alternative when enoxaparin is not suitable, and these choices reduce ischemic events when used appropriately [^ed9d3a58] [^faab9ebb] [^531a4066]. But wait, what if the patient is high bleeding risk or elderly? In that case, I should individualize and consider dose adjustments or alternative strategies per guideline nuances, while still prioritizing timely reperfusion [^notfound].

> Let me consider symptom control and supportive care, and I should double-check beta-blocker timing. Morphine 2–4 mg IV for persistent chest pain is reasonable, nitroglycerin SL or IV for ongoing ischemia or heart failure is appropriate unless contraindicated, and beta-blockers should be started early if there is no heart failure, bradycardia, or hypotension, but held if there is risk of cardiogenic shock, with reassessment for later initiation [^bf57d02e] [^98adfec0]. I should confirm that early IV beta-blockade is avoided in hemodynamically unstable patients, which is correct and supported by guideline cautions [^98adfec0].

> Now, I will examine special scenarios, starting with cardiogenic shock. Patients with shock or mechanical complications should be managed in centers with cardiac surgical capability, and early mechanical circulatory support may be considered in refractory cases, with transfer prioritized to PCI-capable facilities when feasible [^96878f41] [^05495b33]. For in-hospital STEMI, I need to ensure we do not miss delays in ECG acquisition and interpretation, because atypical presentations and system delays lead to underuse of reperfusion; standardized protocols and rapid activation of the STEMI system are essential in this setting [^12d7edd4].

> For late presenters, let me reconsider the thresholds. Beyond 12 hours, primary PCI is still reasonable if there is ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic instability, or large myocardium at risk, whereas beyond 48 hours without ongoing ischemia, routine PCI is not indicated, and decisions should be individualized based on clinical and ECG evidence of ischemia [^34435da6]. I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary guidance, which it does, albeit with weaker evidence for the 12–48 hour window [^34435da6].

> Next, I should review secondary prevention and discharge planning, and I need to ensure I cover the essentials. High-intensity statin therapy, ACE inhibitor or ARB unless contraindicated, continued dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months after PCI or 1 month after fibrinolysis, risk-stratified beta-blocker use, smoking cessation, cardiac rehabilitation, and structured follow-up are core elements that reduce recurrent events and mortality [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify DAPT duration after fibrinolysis — yes, 1 month of DAPT is typical in that pathway, with longer courses after PCI, and this should be reconciled with bleeding risk and stent status [^notfound].

> I should double-check quality metrics and system targets because they shape bedside decisions. Total ischemic time is the key determinant of outcomes, and system goals include first medical contact to device within 90 minutes at PCI-capable hospitals and within 120 minutes for transfers, with door-in to door-out under 30 minutes at non-PCI hospitals; meeting these targets is consistently associated with lower mortality across presentation routes [^aa453770] [^c6677206]. Regional STEMI systems of care with prehospital ECG, field triage, and single-call activation improve timeliness and should be implemented and maintained in communities [^7b4e233b] [^e74e1a7a].

> Let me synthesize the flow to ensure nothing is missing. Immediate stabilization and ECG within 10 minutes, then choose primary PCI if achievable within 90–120 minutes depending on presentation site, otherwise give fibrinolysis rapidly and transfer immediately for pharmacoinvasive care, all while administering guideline-directed antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, analgesia, and anti-ischemic support, followed by early angiography with PCI as indicated, and then transition to secondary prevention with close attention to system quality metrics and total ischemic time reduction [^b090073b] [^7629ad2e] [^590b174e].

---

The order of treatment for STEMI is: **immediate reperfusion** with primary PCI within 90 minutes if available [^b090073b], or fibrinolysis within 30 minutes if PCI is delayed [^7629ad2e] [^5b196868]. Concurrently, give **aspirin 150–325 mg** [^716ac271] and a **P2Y12 inhibitor** (ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 300–600 mg) [^2efd1d06] [^c5f7a872]. Add anticoagulation (UFH, enoxaparin, or bivalirudin) [^ed9d3a58] [^faab9ebb], nitroglycerin for pain/ischemia, and a beta-blocker if no contraindications [^bf57d02e]. After fibrinolysis, transfer for **urgent angiography within 24 hours** [^590b174e] [^63ba20d6]; if reperfusion fails, perform rescue PCI [^4e7b43f6] [^3d563213]. Provide supportive care, treat complications, and start secondary prevention with high-intensity statin, ACE inhibitor/ARB, and risk-stratified beta-blocker therapy [^6b8049db].

---

## Immediate assessment and diagnosis

- **Rapid ECG**: Obtain within 10 minutes of first medical contact (FMC) [^0128c090]; prehospital ECGs reduce time to treatment [^0128c090].

- **Clinical evaluation**: Assess symptoms, hemodynamics, and contraindications to reperfusion [^9ad17ff6].

- **Laboratory tests**: Cardiac troponins, electrolytes, renal function, and coagulation profile [^notfound].

---

## Reperfusion therapy

### Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

Primary PCI is the **preferred reperfusion strategy** [^a9e26381] when available within 90 minutes of FMC [^b090073b]. Time targets are ≤ 90 minutes from FMC to device activation at PCI-capable hospitals and ≤ 120 minutes if transfer is required [^b090073b] [^c6677206]. Indications include STEMI within 12 hours of symptom onset [^84e5d767] or ongoing ischemia, with PCI also considered for 12–48 hours if ischemia persists [^34435da6].

---

### Fibrinolysis

Fibrinolysis is indicated when **PCI is not available within 120 minutes** [^7629ad2e] or there is no contraindication [^7629ad2e]. The door-to-needle time should be ≤ 30 minutes [^notfound]. Agents include tenecteplase, alteplase, reteplase, or streptokinase [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacoinvasive strategy

After successful fibrinolysis, transfer for **urgent angiography within 24 hours** [^590b174e] is recommended [^63ba20d6]. If reperfusion fails, perform immediate rescue PCI [^4e7b43f6] [^3d563213].

---

## Adjunctive pharmacological therapy

### Antiplatelet therapy

Give **aspirin 150–325 mg** immediately [^716ac271], then 75–100 mg daily [^94afc891]. Also administer a P2Y12 inhibitor — ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose [^2efd1d06] or clopidogrel 300–600 mg [^c5f7a872] — unless contraindicated.

---

### Anticoagulant therapy

Options include **unfractionated heparin (UFH)** during PCI [^notfound], **enoxaparin** for fibrinolysis or PCI [^faab9ebb], or **bivalirudin** as an alternative during PCI [^ed9d3a58].

---

### Analgesic and anti-ischemic therapy

Administer **nitroglycerin** for chest pain or ischemia unless contraindicated [^bf57d02e]. Use **morphine** for persistent pain unresponsive to nitroglycerin [^notfound]. Start a **beta-blocker** early if no contraindications (e.g. cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia) [^98adfec0].

---

## Management of complications

- **Cardiogenic shock**: Admit to cardiac ICU; consider mechanical circulatory support [^05495b33] [^96878f41].

- **Arrhythmias**: Immediate defibrillation for VF/VT; antiarrhythmic drugs as indicated [^9ad17ff6].

- **Pericarditis**: Aspirin for post-STEMI pericarditis [^835d9ac7].

---

## Secondary prevention and long-term management

- **High-intensity statin**: Initiate and continue long-term [^notfound].

- **ACE inhibitor or ARB**: Start within 24 hours if no contraindications [^notfound].

- **Beta-blocker**: Continue long-term if tolerated [^notfound].

- **Lifestyle modification**: Smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and cardiac rehabilitation [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

In elderly patients, **individualize reperfusion strategy** based on comorbidities and risk [^1cab246d]. In low-resource settings, adapt reperfusion to local capabilities and transfer logistics [^35ccedda]. For in-hospital STEMI, use standardized protocols to reduce delays [^12d7edd4].

---

The order of treatment for STEMI is: **immediate reperfusion** with primary PCI or fibrinolysis, concurrent antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, adjunctive analgesic and anti-ischemic treatment, management of complications, and secondary prevention. This sequence maximizes myocardial salvage and improves outcomes [^a9e26381].

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

Despite substantial progress in the diagnosis and treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), implementation of this knowledge into routine clinical practice has been variable. It has become increasing clear that primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred method of reperfusion if it can be performed in a timely manner. Recent European data suggest that transfer for direct PCI may also be preferable to fibrinolytic therapy. We believe it is time to establish a national policy for treatment of patients with STEMI to develop a coordinated system of care similar to that of the level 1 trauma system.

### Highlights from the 2013 ACCF / AHA guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and beyond [^dea7b942]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a cardiology emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment aimed at successful and early reperfusion to ensure optimal outcomes. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction since 1990. These guidelines are based on clinical research exploring reperfusion modalities and adjunctive therapies. They are further supported by expert opinion where randomized trial evidence is lacking. In January 2013, the ACCF/AHA released the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. This review focuses on the newest and most important recommendations taken from the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of STEMI and highlight important new studies that have emerged over the past year.

The introduction of Mission: Lifeline significantly increased timely access to percutaneous coronary intervention for patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In the years since, morbidity and mortality rates have declined, and research has led to significant developments that have broadened our concept of the STEMI system of care. However, significant barriers and opportunities remain. From community education to 9-1-1 activation and emergency medical services triage and from emergency department and interfacility transfer protocols to postacute care, each critical juncture presents unique challenges for the optimal care of patients with STEMI. This policy statement sets forth recommendations for how the ideal STEMI system of care should be designed and implemented to ensure that patients with STEMI receive the best evidence-based care at each stage in their illness.

### ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^a9e26381]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the most acute manifestation of coronary artery disease and is associated with great morbidity and mortality. A complete thrombotic occlusion developing from an atherosclerotic plaque in an epicardial coronary vessel is the cause of STEMI in the majority of cases. Early diagnosis and immediate reperfusion are the most effective ways to limit myocardial ischaemia and infarct size and thereby reduce the risk of post-STEMI complications and heart failure. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become the preferred reperfusion strategy in patients with STEMI; if PCI cannot be performed within 120minutes of STEMI diagnosis, fibrinolysis therapy should be administered to dissolve the occluding thrombus. The initiation of networks to provide around-the-clock cardiac catheterization availability and the generation of standard operating procedures within hospital systems have helped to reduce the time to reperfusion therapy. Together with new advances in antithrombotic therapy and preventive measures, these developments have resulted in a decrease in mortality from STEMI. However, a substantial amount of patients still experience recurrent cardiovascular events after STEMI. New insights have been gained regarding the pathophysiology of STEMI and feed into the development of new treatment strategies.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to fibrinolytic therapy, administration, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to administer fibrinolysis as soon as possible after diagnosis in the prehospital setting (aim for a target of < 10 minutes to lytic bolus) if it is the reperfusion strategy.

### Contemporary challenges in the management of acute myocardial infarction: ST-elevation myocardial infarction guidelines and the real world [^802f8dff]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Timely reperfusion is the primary treatment goal for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines utilize time since symptom onset, anticipated time to treatment, patient risk factors, and center volume and experience to determine the optimal reperfusion strategy. There continues to be a considerable number of patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy and treatment delays are still too long. Institution-specific protocols which reflect current guidelines may increase the number of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who receive timely reperfusion.

### Timely and optimal treatment of patients with STEMI [^afc459ae]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Fibrinolysis is recommended in European and US guidelines for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when a strategy of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is associated with ≥ 120 min delay from first medical contact (FMC), defined as call to the emergency medical services or self-presentation at hospital. Current evidence indicates that reperfusion therapy should be initiated as soon as possible after FMC. However, fibrinolysis cannot be initiated instantaneously at FMC, and PPCI is superior to fibrinolysis in reducing mortality if the extra time needed to perform PPCI instead of fibrinolysis (so-called PCI-related delay) is < 120 min. During the past 10 years, the terms 'FMC-to-PPCI delay' and 'PCI-related delay' have been used in guidelines synonymously; however, a distinction should be made between the recommended FMC-to-PPCI delay and the acceptable PCI-related delay. In the future, an ideal recommendation would be to initiate reperfusion as soon as possible, preferably within 120 min of FMC in the case of PPCI. When the expected PCI-related delay is < 120 min, PPCI should be the preferred reperfusion strategy, even if the FMC-to-PPCI delay is > 120 min. Setting up a health-care system enabling prehospital diagnosis of STEMI with field triage of patients directly to catheterization laboratories at large-volume PCI centres (bypassing local hospitals, coronary care units, emergency departments, and intensive care units) will help to increase the proportion of patients with STEMI who will benefit from PPCI.

### In-hospital ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: improving diagnosis, triage, and treatment [^12d7edd4]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

In-hospital ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a unique clinical entity with epidemiology, incidence, and outcomes distinct from that of out-of-hospital STEMI and has only within the past 10 years begun to receive increased attention and research. Patients with in-hospital STEMI are older, have more comorbidities, and more frequently have coagulopathies and contraindications for anticoagulation and fibrinolytic therapy. A standardized clinical definition of in-hospital STEMI is lacking. The objectives of this special communication are to (1) summarize the knowledge base regarding in-hospital STEMI; (2) review the challenges of diagnosis and treatment of patients with in-hospital STEMI; (3) present a standardized clinical definition for in-hospital STEMI; and (4) provide a quality improvement protocol to improve diagnosis, triage, and treatment of patients with in-hospital STEMI.

Observations

Patients with in-hospital STEMI less frequently present with typical angina symptoms, and an electrocardiogram is often obtained owing to changes in clinical status, changes on telemetry, or a finding of elevated cardiac biomarker. The frequent nontypical presentations often lead to substantial delays in the diagnosis of STEMI. Only 34% to 71% of patients with in-hospital STEMI undergo diagnostic catheterization, and only 22% to 56% undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. Even in contemporary reports, some studies report in-hospital mortality in the range of 31% to 42%. Three areas of delay in the treatment of patients with in-hospital STEMI that merit particular attention are (1) delays in electrocardiogram acquisition, (2) delays in electrocardiogram interpretation, and (3) delays in activation of existing STEMI systems of care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment of patients with in-hospital STEMI is more complex and challenging than treatment of patients who develop out-of-hospital STEMI, leading to delays in diagnosis and triage and less frequent use of reperfusion therapy. Quality improvement programs targeted at decreasing delays and streamlining treatment of such patients may improve treatment and outcome.

### Treatment time and in-hospital mortality among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 2018–2021 [^aa453770]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Recognizing the association between timely treatment and less myocardial injury for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), US national guidelines recommend specific treatment-time goals.

Objective

To describe these process measures and outcomes for a recent cohort of patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study of a diagnosis-based registry between the second quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2021 for 114 871 patients with STEMI treated at 648 hospitals in the Get With The Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease registry.

Exposures

STEMI or STEMI equivalent.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment times, in-hospital mortality, and adherence to system goals (75% treated ≤ 90 minutes of first medical contact if the first hospital is percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]-capable and ≤ 120 minutes if patients require transfer to a PCI-capable hospital).

Results

In the study population, median age was 63 (IQR, 54–72) years, 71% were men, and 29% were women. Median time from symptom onset to PCI was 148 minutes (IQR, 111–226) for patients presenting to PCI-capable hospitals by emergency medical service, 195 minutes (IQR, 127–349) for patients walking in, and 240 minutes (IQR, 166–402) for patients transferred from another hospital. Adjusted in-hospital mortality was lower for those treated within target times vs beyond time goals for patients transported via emergency medical services (first medical contact to laboratory activation ≤ 20 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 3.6 vs 9.2] adjusted OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.48–0.60], and first medical contact to device ≤ 90 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 3.3 vs 12.1] adjusted OR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.36–0.44]), walk-in patients (hospital arrival to device ≤ 90 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 1.8 vs 4.7] adjusted OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.40–0.55]), and transferred patients (door-in to door-out time < 30 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 2.9 vs 6.4] adjusted OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32–0.78], and first hospital arrival to device ≤ 120 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 4.3 vs 14.2] adjusted OR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.26–0.71]). Regardless of mode of presentation, system goals were not met in most quarters, with the most delayed system performance among patients requiring interhospital transfer (17% treated ≤ 120 minutes).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study of patients with STEMI included in a US national registry provides information on changes in process and outcomes between 2018 and 2021.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^a0a69766]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) recommend an invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization, revascularization when clinically appropriate, and initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy regardless of whether the patient receives revascularization. However, although patients with NSTEMI have a higher long-term mortality risk than patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), they are often treated less aggressively; with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment-risk paradox"). Here, using evidence gathered from across the world, we examine some reasons behind the suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI, and recommend approaches to address this issue in order to improve the standard of healthcare for this group of patients. The challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be categorized into four "P" factors that contribute to poor clinical outcomes: patient characteristics being heterogeneous; physicians underestimating the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk; procedure availability; and policy within the healthcare system. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that incorporate rigorous definitions of NSTEMI; risk assessment and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

### Resource and infrastructure-appropriate management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in low-and middle-income countries [^35ccedda]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The 143 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of the world constitute 80% of the world's population or roughly 5.86 billion people with much variation in geography, culture, literacy, financial resources, access to health care, insurance penetration, and healthcare regulation. Unfortunately, their burden of cardiovascular disease in general and acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in particular is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Compounding the problem, outcomes remain suboptimal because of a lack of awareness and a severe paucity of resources. Guideline-based treatment has dramatically improved the outcomes of STEMI in high-income countries. However, no such focused recommendations exist for LMICs, and the unique challenges in LMICs make directly implementing Western guidelines unfeasible. Thus, structured solutions tailored to their individual, local needs, and resources are a vital need. With this in mind, a multicountry collaboration of investigators interested in LMIC STEMI care have tried to create a consensus document that extracts transferable elements from Western guidelines and couples them with local realities gathered from expert experience. It outlines general operating principles for LMICs focused best practices and is intended to create the broad outlines of implementable, resource-appropriate paradigms for management of STEMI in LMICs. Although this document is focused primarily on governments and organizations involved with improvement in STEMI care in LMICs, it also provides some specific targeted information for the frontline clinicians to allow standardized care pathways and improved outcomes.

### Comparison of reperfusion strategies for ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a multivariate network meta-analysis [^2325f6cd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Primary PCI is the preferred treatment for STEMI. Our findings suggest that when primary PCI is unavailable as a reperfusion therapy, a pharmacoinvasive approach is superior to facilitated PCI or standard fibrinolytic therapy in terms of mortality, stroke, and major bleeding.

We recommend that for future guidelines, professional societies on both sides of the Atlantic acknowledge the current confusion about the terminologies on treatment delays in STEMI and uncertainties in utilising available data for information regarding the proper treatment for various patient subsets, and avoid recommendations that may have deleterious consequences. It is uncertain whether a pharmacoinvasive strategy in the future will qualify as an alternative reperfusion strategy. However, the Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction trial found no mortality benefit but an increased risk of stroke in patients randomised to a pharmacoinvasive strategy compared to patients randomised to a PPCI strategy.

### Reperfusion treatment of ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction [^05e88f84]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Reperfusion treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is one of the medical interventions with the largest potential for saving human lives, independently of age and gender. An attempt to reopen an acutely occluded coronary artery can be done within a wide array of possibilities, from the simple administration of aspirin to the combination of drugs and complex coronary artery interventions. Fibrinolytic drugs and aspirin represent the easiest way to attempt reperfusion and together offer an acceptable compromise between opportunity for treatment and efficacy. Other drugs and the use of invasive revascularization alternatives yield further advantages, and in some high-risk subgroups may be the most rational treatment approach. Beyond investigator's bias and dedication to either form of reperfusion treatment, interventions and/or drugs should be used as needed (and as possible) to increase the overall impact of reperfusion treatment in the community, taking advantage of the best potential of each approach. Most resources have been directed toward the improvement of reperfusion rates with the combination of fibrinolytic and antiplatelet drugs or with angioplasty. These efforts have certainly raised costs, but have not decisively improved clinical outcome nor have they broadened the impact of reperfusion treatment in the community. Indeed, the main shortcoming of reperfusion therapy is that the cohort of untreated patients is still larger than the cohort of treated patients. At a time when mortality of patients with STEMI reaching the hospital and receiving treatment has decreased significantly, the prehospital diagnosis and treatment of STEMI with the objective of enlarging the treated population and shortening the pretreatment delays is likely the best strategy to further reduce mortality. The need for a population approach to treatment of STEMI is even more obvious when considering the expanding patient load that continuously worsens its clinical risk profile, together with the increasing incidence of diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and smoking habits. The target for improving reperfusion treatment of STEMI in the future, and thereby saving more lives, seems now to involve a cultural change and fulfillment of an organizational mission more than an incremental improvement in the current pharmacologic or interventional approach. These epidemiologic and social aspects of contemporary medicine deserve full attention at a time when researchers, clinicians, and health care providers tend to focus primarily on technological advances.

### Reperfusion therapy for STEMI: is there still a role for thrombolysis in the era of primary percutaneous coronary intervention? [^7bac97d1]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

In the past ten years, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has replaced thrombolysis as the revascularisation strategy for many patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, delivery of primary PCI within evidence-based timeframes is challenging, and health-care provision varies substantially worldwide. Consequently, even with the ideal circumstances of rapid initial diagnosis, long transfer delays to the catheter laboratory can occur. These delays are detrimental to outcomes for patients and can be exaggerated by variations in timing of patients' presentation and diagnosis. In this Series paper we summarise the value of immediate out-of-hospital thrombolysis for STEMI, and reconsider the potential therapeutic interface with a contemporary service for primary PCI. We review recent trial data, and explore opportunities for optimisation of STEMI outcomes with a pharmacoinvasive approach.

### The pharmaco-invasive approach to STEMI: when should fibrinolytic-treated patients go to the "cath lab"? [^b3a5dda3]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Although primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in clinical trials has lower rates of reinfarction, stroke and mortality than fibrinolytic therapy, because of system delays in routine practice, field triage and prehospital administration of fibrinolytic therapy may lead to similar clinical outcomes, especially in those patients who present in the first 2 h after symptom onset. Necessary for these outcomes is the liberal use of both rescue PCI and in-hospital revascularisation. Non-invasive prediction of failed reperfusion may be enhanced by the use of ST recovery, patient characteristics and troponin T levels, measured by point-of-care assays. This review focuses on the timing of, and indications for, an invasive strategy after fibrinolytic therapy, including that for failed pharmacological reperfusion.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains a significant global public health concern. Practice guidelines in both the United States and Europe have been major contributors to providing evidence-based care. Rapid advances in contemporary therapies mandate regular and timely updates to guideline recommendations. In the fall of 2012, the European Society of Cardiology published their latest guidelines for the management of STEMI. In 2013 (∼3 months later), the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association jointly published their most recent STEMI guideline statements. In this review, we compare the transatlantic guidelines, highlighting differences in their recommendations and the interpretation of evidence addressing STEMI care.

### Challenges in implementation of institutional protocols for patients with acute coronary syndrome [^3070a0af]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation ACS (non-STEMI and unstable angina). In recent years, there have been improvements in the rates of death, cardiogenic shock, and recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with ACS, primarily due to the introduction of new pharmacological and interventional therapies, as well as the introduction of and adherence to new treatment guidelines. However, ACS still represents a considerable public health burden. Treatment recommendations for STEMI and non-ST-segment elevation differ and there is wide variation in practice patterns and adherence among and within hospitals especially for the latter diagnosis. Adoption of institutional protocols may help decrease variability and improve quality of care, efficiency, and, ultimately, patient outcomes. This report discusses the process of developing and implementing institutional protocols for patients with ACS, from initial medical contact to discharge and beyond.

### Myocardial infarction: contemporary management strategies [^fcb4f56c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common clinical diagnosis, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, not only in the short term, but also years following the index event. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of MI has ushered the era of multipronged treatment approach, with a combination of goal-directed revascularization, a broad adjunctive pharmacological therapy and aggressive secondary prevention measures. The goals of this article are to review the basic pathophysiological processes, which lead up to a clinical diagnosis of MI, to highlight the essential elements of clinical presentation and to summarize the evidence for comprehensive therapy. Emphasis has been placed on the choice of primary reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation MI, on risk-stratification of patients with non-ST elevation MI, and on rationale behind the selection of anti-ischaemic and antithrombotic therapy. Finally, evidence-based approach to secondary prevention is outlined.

### Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients hospitalized for noncardiac conditions [^6b777ecb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rapid reperfusion with early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard of care for patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who present to a hospital with interventional cardiology capabilities. Recognition of the importance of rapid reperfusion has led to significant improvement in door‐to‐balloon times in the last 5 years (from a median of 96 minutes in 2005 to 64 minutes in 2010), which correlates with an improvement in overall outcomes of STEMI patients. Research and nationwide initiatives on STEMI care have targeted patients who have onset of STEMI while outside the hospital. Much less is known about clinical presentation, sources of delay in diagnosis and treatment, and outcomes in patients who develop STEMIs while hospitalized for a noncardiac condition. Patients in the hospital for treatment of active medical or surgical conditions are susceptible to developing STEMIs, but we know surprisingly little about optimal care in this setting.

### 2012 ESC STEMI guidelines and reperfusion therapy: evidence base ignored, threatening optimal patient management [^217f3bf7]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

The 2012 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) guideline acknowledges that STEMI patients should receive reperfusion therapy as soon as possible, and that prehospital fibrinolysis or field-triage directly to Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI) centres is the preferred reperfusion strategy. However, when recommending fibrinolytic therapy (FT) within 30 min from First Medical Contact (FMC), if PPCI cannot be performed 'within 60 min of FMC in patients presenting early, with a large amount of myocardium at risk', the guidelines imply that only 30 min extra may be expended to perform PPCI instead of administering FT ('PCI-related delay') (figure 1).

Figure 1
Various delays when treating patients with ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) with fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).

Discussion

Our study adds to the substantial body of evidence indicating that during STEMI, primary PCI, when performed in a timely manner, is the best strategy for reducing short‐term major adverse cardiac events, including death. The key novel insights provided by our study, however, pertain to situations where timely primary PCI is not possible — scenarios in which the best approach to treatment of STEMI remains unclear and controversial. Our findings suggest that fibrinolysis followed by routine early invasive therapy is more effective in this setting as compared with standard fibrinolytic therapy alone. Importantly, our study also suggests that the time interval between fibrinolysis and PCI is a key determinant of the efficacy and safety of any approach combining fibrinolysis with routine early invasive therapy.

A key advantage of our study is that it incorporates data from trials involving all 4 reperfusion strategies that are currently utilized in contemporary practice, synthesizing them in a manner that allows for comparison and ranking. A single model leverages both direct and indirect comparisons between reperfusion strategies, which is useful for clinicians taking care of these patients as well as policy makers who design STEMI systems of care. This approach also allowed us to directly examine heterogeneity among trials in the time interval between fibrinolysis and PCI in those studies that examined routine early invasive therapy following fibrinolysis. For this issue, our results suggest that when the time interval between fibrinolysis and PCI is < 2 hours (facilitated PCI), there is an increased risk of major bleeding and possibly death as compared with when the interval is 2 to 24 hours (pharmacoinvasive approach).

### Evolving management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: update on recent data [^ec60e552]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Significant recent advances have been made in strategies for managing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Based on new findings, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have updated their guidelines for acute myocardial infarction (MI) with newer recommendations for STEMI management. Many of these recommendations focus on antithrombotic agents, with a movement toward lower doses of long-term aspirin and lower doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Studies have also been completed on the use of enoxaparin and fondaparinux as potential alternatives to heparin, and clinical trial data support the early use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (along with aspirin, UFH, and clopidogrel) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute STEMI. Clopidogrel has also been shown to improve angiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI who are undergoing thrombolysis or being treated medically. The new ACC/AHA recommendations support clopidogrel pretreatment and long-term therapy.

### ACC / AHA release guidelines on management of patients… [^bf57d02e]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Patients without contraindications to beta blockers who did not receive them within the first 24 hours after STEMI should have them started in the early convalescent phase. Patients with early contraindications within the first 24 hours of STEMI should be reevaluated for candidacy for beta-blocker therapy. Nitroglycerin Class I Intravenous nitroglycerin is indicated in the first 48 hours after STEMI for treatment of persistent ischemia, congestive heart failure, or hypertension. The decision to administer intravenous nitroglycerin and the dosage used should not preclude therapy with other proven mortality-reducing interventions, such as beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Antiplatelets Class I Aspirin should be given on day 1 of STEMI and in the absence of contraindications should be continued indefinitely on a daily basis thereafter at a dosage of 75 to 162 mg.

A thienopyridine should be administered to patients who are unable to take aspirin because of hypersensitivity or major gastrointestinal intolerance. Antithrombotics Class I Intravenous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin should be used in patients after STEMI who are at high risk for systemic emboli. Class IIa It is reasonable that patients with STEMI who are not undergoing reperfusion therapy and do not have a contraindication to anticoagulation be treated with intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous LMWH for at least 48 hours.

In patients whose clinical condition necessitates prolonged bed rest and/or minimized activities, it is reasonable that treatment be continued until the patient is ambulatory.

### Reperfusion strategies in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a comprehensive review of contemporary management options [^1cdd204f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

There are an estimated 500,000 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) events in the U.S. annually. Despite improvements in care, up to one-third of patients presenting with STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset still receive no reperfusion therapy acutely. Clinical studies indicate that speed of reperfusion after infarct onset may be more important than whether pharmacologic or mechanical intervention is used. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), when performed rapidly at high-volume centers, generally has superior efficacy to fibrinolysis, although fibrinolysis may be more suitable for many patients as an initial reperfusion strategy. Because up to 70% of STEMI patients present to hospitals without on-site PCI facilities, and prolonged door-to-balloon times due to inevitable transport delays commonly limit the benefit of PCI, the continued role and importance of the prompt, early use of fibrinolytic therapy may be underappreciated. Logistical complexities such as triage or transportation delays must be considered when a reperfusion strategy is selected, because prompt fibrinolysis may achieve greater benefit, especially if the fibrinolytic-to-PCI time delay associated with transfer exceeds approximately 1 h. Selection of a fibrinolytic requires consideration of several factors, including ease of dosing and combination with adjunctive therapies. Careful attention to these variables is critical to ensuring safe and rapid reperfusion, particularly in the prehospital setting. The emerging modality of pharmacoinvasive therapy, although controversial, seeks to combine the benefits of mechanical and pharmacologic reperfusion. Results from ongoing clinical trials will provide guidance regarding the utility of this strategy.

### Interventional management of acute coronary syndromes: applying the lessons of ST-elevation services to non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^f8612f4f]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Many countries have embarked on national strategies to translate evidence from trials of reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) into clinical practice. Primary angioplasty has become the dominant mode of reperfusion, but the best outcomes depend on appropriate service re-configurations to ensure rapid, effective and comprehensive treatment. Although there are many differences in the treatment of STEMI and non-STEMI acute coronary syndromes (ACS), there are many parallels. Many of the changes in the system of care for STEMI patients could now be applied to the non-STEMI ACS population, providing faster and more efficient care and promising to deliver better outcomes. This article highlights additional changes to healthcare services that should be considered.

### The role of fibrinolytics in the prehospital treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) [^5a5c9e5e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The efficacy of fibrinolytics in the treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction is directly related to the time of administration, with the first 2 h after symptom onset seen as a critical period for greatest improvement in cardiovascular parameters and mortality. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommends a medical contact to treatment time of 30 min for fibrinolysis in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In selected patients, reperfusion goals may be expedited with prehospital administration of fibrinolytics. In clinical trials, prehospital fibrinolysis markedly reduced the time from symptom onset to treatment, allowed earlier ST-segment resolution, and reduced short- and long-term mortality compared with in-hospital treatment. Prehospital fibrinolysis has become more feasible with the introduction of prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography, improved skills of emergency medical services personnel, improved communication with the Emergency Department, and the advent of bolus fibrinolysis. Rapid and accurate administration of a fibrinolytic is vital for the success of prehospital fibrinolysis.

### Prolonged door-to-balloon time: is treatment delayed always treatment denied? [^d6597947]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Rapid reperfusion following the onset of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction has been shown to provide life-saving benefit. Both systemic fibrinolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention have been shown to be effective in reducing mortality, and their effectiveness is greater the sooner they are applied. Percutaneous coronary intervention has become the dominant method of reperfusion and may offer benefit over systemic fibrinolysis in some patients. Accordingly, physicians, hospitals, and professional organizations have developed guidelines and algorithms to both speed and standardize care. In addition, the institutional rapidity of therapy-the mean or median door-to-balloon time-is often publically reported providing further impetus to rapid triage and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, some patients do not receive reperfusion within the time guidelines set out by professional organizations. In many instances, this delay relates to medical issues that exist in addition to the patient's myocardial infarction. These data raise the question of whether the most rapid reperfusion is always superior to more delayed but potentially more comprehensive therapy.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^0128c090]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction — an electrocardiogram (ECG) "should be acquired and interpreted promptly (ie, target within 10 minutes) after first medical contact", and "prehospital ECGs reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment, and can facilitate the triage of STEMI patients… if within the recommended time interval (120 minutes from STEMI diagnosis)". For ongoing symptoms or a nondiagnostic tracing, "recording several standard ECGs… at 15–30 minute intervals for the initial 1–2 hours, or the use of continuous computer-assisted 12-lead ECG recording… is reasonable". Certain patterns carry prognostic/diagnostic implications: "ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm in 6 leads… is suggestive evidence of multivessel disease or left main disease", while a comparison tracing helps but "should not delay the decision for treatment". Early ischemic changes include "increased hyperacute T wave amplitude… in at least 2 contiguous leads", and infarction evolution is reflected as "the development of new Q waves" indicating necrosis that "starts minutes/hours after the myocardial insult", with "transient Q waves" sometimes seen during acute ischemia or "(rarely) during acute MI with successful reperfusion".

### ACC / AHA guideline update for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^98adfec0]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have issued an update of the 2004 guideline for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Aspirin should be given to symptomatic patients. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in the acute setting because they may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock and death. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is indicated in patients who have had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A stepped care approach to analgesia for musculoskeletal pain in patients with coronary heart disease is provided. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase mortality risk and should be avoided. Primary prevention is important to reduce the burden of heart disease. Secondary prevention interventions are critically important to prevent recurrent events in patients who survive.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^3bc20654]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) recommend an invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization, revascularization when clinically appropriate, and initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy regardless of whether the patient receives revascularization. However, although patients with NSTEMI have a higher long‐term mortality risk than patients with ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), they are often treated less aggressively; with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment‐risk paradox"). Here, using evidence gathered from across the world, we examine some reasons behind the suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI, and recommend approaches to address this issue in order to improve the standard of healthcare for this group of patients. The challenges for the treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be categorized into four "P" factors that contribute to poor clinical outcomes: p atient characteristics being heterogeneous; p hysicians underestimating the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk; p rocedure availability; and p olicy within the healthcare system. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that incorporate rigorous definitions of NSTEMI; risk assessment and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long‐term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

### Reperfusion strategies in ST-elevation myocardial infarction – current status and perspectives for early and pre-hospital treatment [^88c49f14]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

The latest guidelines on the emergency care of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction were published by the European Resuscitation Council at the end of 2005. Since then, numerous studies have been presented, which have led to important conclusions. Among pharmacological interventions, the opinion on adjuncts to anticoagulant treatment in the area of thrombolysis as well as in primary coronary intervention seems to be moving away from unfractionated heparin towards low molecular weight heparin, and possibly even factor Xa-specific pentasaccharide or the direct antithrombin bivalirudin. Clopidogrel has developed to become an accepted standard alongside aspirin in thrombolytic therapy of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, even if some questions still remain open. The promising idea of "facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention" has shown itself to at least be problematic if performed immediately and routinely after thrombolysis; "rescue" intervention in the event of ineffective thrombolysis is, on the other hand, useful and effective. Apparently, a more individualistic approach is required, which combines new therapeutic options and patients' conditions on the one side with regional resources on the other, to produce an optimal and timely strategy, remembering that one size does not fit all.

### NRMI and current treatment patterns for ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^ead06f08]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI) is one of the oldest and largest registries of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Since 1990, 4 NRMI studies have been launched, one of which is ongoing (Table I). In all, 1600 hospitals have participated and > 2.2 million patients have been followed. This paper highlights some of our discoveries pertaining to ST-segment elevation and subsequent contributions to patient care.

Clinical Perspective

In spite of considerable advances in cardiovascular care, there still have been largely missed opportunities in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Rapid myocardial revascularization in patients with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who present within 48 hours of symptom onset is critical for increasing the chances and extent of myocardial salvage and better clinical outcomes. The initial diagnosis of STEMI based on symptoms and signs, including an ECG, is critical to achieving timely myocardial revascularization. However, it was reported that ≈10% to 20% of patients with STEMI have no chest pain or atypical symptoms like dyspnea at presentation. Furthermore, there are variations in interpreting potential STEMI ECGs among physicians. In addition, diverse health care professionals, including primary care physicians, residents, emergency medical physicians, and cardiologists, alone or collaboratively, make the initial working diagnosis in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes. Failure to timely diagnose acute myocardial infarction (AMI), including STEMI (missed diagnosis), is not rare and leads to delay in the initiation of appropriate treatment or failure of reperfusion therapy. However, there have been few investigations on why STEMI is not diagnosed timely and the clinical consequences of delayed diagnosis in the contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) era. Understanding these issues may be helpful in optimizing care delivery and improving the clinical outcomes of STEMI.

In the present study, we sought to investigate the incidence, relevant patient factors, and clinical outcomes of the misdiagnosis of STEMI as non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from a nationwide, prospective Korean registry of AMI.

### Total ischemic time: the correct focus of attention for optimal ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction care [^184f8bcc]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Currently accepted standards for gauging quality of care in the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mainly focus on shortening the time to treatment after the patient arrives at the hospital. But this narrow focus fails to consider the substantial duration of myocardial ischemia that exists prior to hospital arrival, and the large number of deaths that occur during the pre-hospital period. The time from symptom onset until reperfusion occurs is one estimate of total ischemic time. Several experimental studies and now human clinical studies have confirmed that infarct size and mortality are strongly correlated with the total ischemic time, and much less so with its subintervals like door-to-balloon time. This review will discuss the importance of total ischemic time in STEMI.

### Treatment of acute coronary syndrome: part 2: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^6b8049db]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Familiarize clinicians with recent information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Data Sources

PubMed search and review of relevant medical literature.

Summary

Definition, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are reviewed.

Conclusions

Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction benefit from prompt reperfusion therapy. Adjunctive antianginal, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, beta blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and statin agents minimize ongoing cardiac ischemia, prevent thrombus propagation, and reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

Methods

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We gathered data from randomized controlled trials of patients with STEMI, presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset, in which any of the following treatments were compared: primary PCI, fibrinolytic therapy, and fibrinolysis followed by routine early (ie, within 24 hours) invasive therapy.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, from January 1, 1999, to March 20, 2019, using the following key words: "primary angioplasty", "primary percutaneous coronary intervention", "facilitated angioplasty", "facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention", "pharmacoinvasive", "acute myocardial infarction", "ST elevation myocardial infarction", and "ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction". We restricted our search to studies following 1999 to focus on those trials that used contemporary management strategies for PCI. We excluded trials that did not routinely use stenting during PCI (use of stents in < 50% of coronary interventions) and those without follow‐up beyond hospital discharge.

We only included reports published in English. We performed our search on March 20, 2019, and identified 62 reports that were reviewed by 2 independent readers (R.F. T. I.J.), with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (B.K.N.).

Data Extraction and Definition of the Reperfusion Strategies

We extracted data regarding study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical short‐term outcomes, number of patients enrolled, and time delay intervals. The primary clinical end points we abstracted were death, nonfatal reinfarction, stroke, and major bleeding at 30 to 90 days. In all cases, we used the definitions utilized within the individual trials to define these outcomes. These definitions as well as details of protocols for each trial are outlined in Table S1.

We defined primary PCI as immediate PCI without prior administration of fibrinolytics. For our primary analysis, in accordance with time thresholds discussed in the 2017 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for STEMI management, we categorized routine early PCI after fibrinolysis as facilitated PCI when the average time interval between administration of fibrinolytics and PCI was < 2 hours and as a pharmacoinvasive approach when this interval was ≥ 2 hours. We did not consider pretreatment of STEMI before PCI with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors without fibrinolysis as either facilitated PCI or a pharmacoinvasive approach.

### Improving the non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) pathway using quality improvement methodology [^ea7cc39f]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Problem

The term 'acute coronary syndromes' (ACS) encompasses a range of conditions including unstable angina, and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, collectively termed non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There are distinct pathways for patients with NSTEACS and STEMI.

The STEMI pathway differs from the NSTEACS pathway as ST elevation on an ECG usually indicates a complete occlusion of a coronary artery, which is an emergency. Typically, these patients call 999, paramedics attend and perform an ECG, and if STEMI is diagnosed, transport urgently to the nearest centre that provides 24/7 primary angioplasty.

This paper focuses on the NSTEACS pathway, a group of patients without ST elevation on ECG usually admitted to their local hospital. People with ACS have a poor prognosis without prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on the management of ACS contains a quality standard that states "adults with NSTEACS with an intermediate or higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events who are having coronary angiography (with follow-on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if indicated), undergo this within 72 hours of first admission to hospital".

In Wales, there is poor compliance with this quality standard, with unwarranted variation across the country. In this report, the NSTEACS pathway for the hospitals studied had a compliance of 18% with this standard — well below the compliance published in the annual Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Program (MINAP) and reflects incomplete data collection for MINAP.

A recent meta-analysis of 17 randomised controlled trials with > 10 000 patients has reported that for patients with NSTEACS, an early invasive coronary angiogram strategy significantly reduced the risk of recurrent ischaemia and length of stay, it did not have a significant impact on all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, admission with heart failure or repeat revascularisation.

Long inpatient delays before angiography in patients with NSTEACS reduce opportunities for other patients to be admitted to acute medical beds and create a higher cost per case for NSTEACS treatment.

### Impact of ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction regionalization programs on the treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^b0be5cbd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Many communities have established regionalized systems of care for ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) over the past decade. 1, 2, 3 Although this focus on the organization and delivery of care may improve treatment and outcomes for patients with STEMI, regionalization could have unintended effects on patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), a condition with high prevalence and significant mortality, and for which angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are associated with better outcomes. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

Specifically, STEMI regionalization could affect volume and staffing in both PCI and non‐PCI centers, potentially influencing the type of care given to patients with NSTEMI. 14, 15 It also could improve outcomes through several mechanisms, including through increased adherence to guidelines recommending angiography, via a volume‐outcomes relationship, or through external factors, such as better follow‐up care. 16 However, whether regionalization of STEMI care impacts treatments and outcomes for patients experiencing NSTEMIs, whether beneficial, neutral, or harmful, remains unexplored.

In this study, we set out to determine whether and to what extent STEMI regionalization might impact treatment and outcomes for patients with NSTEMIs. We hypothesized that risk‐adjusted outcomes for patients with NSTEMIs improved more in regionalized compared with nonregionalized communities. We also hypothesized that the probability of receiving invasive therapy (ie, guideline‐directed angiography and possible PCI within 72 hours) increased for patients with NSTEMI in regionalized communities compared with nonregionalized communities.

### Impact of ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction regionalization programs on the treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^dad94394]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We found that STEMI regionalization policies were not associated with changes in angiography, PCI, or 1‐year mortality of patients presenting with NSTEMI. Mortality from NSTEMI is decreasing, and early invasive therapy is becoming increasingly common, but these trends are not attributable to STEMI regionalization policies and nearly half of patients with NSTEMIs still do not receive guideline‐directed timely angiography. Policy makers should not expect STEMI regionalization programs to have either positive or negative unintended consequences for patients presenting with NSTEMIs.

Figure 1 — Reperfusion timeline in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) specifies time-to-treatment goals by presentation route: With emergency medical services (EMS) contact, EMS performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 10 minutes of arrival and PCI is performed within 90 minutes of EMS contact. For patients arriving directly to a PCI-capable hospital, ECG is performed within 10 minutes of patient arrival and PCI is performed within 90 minutes of arrival to the PCI hospital. For patients first presenting to a non-PCI hospital, ECG is performed within 10 minutes of arrival, the patient departs the non-PCI hospital within 45 minutes of arrival for transport to a PCI hospital, and PCI is performed within 120 minutes of arrival to the non-PCI hospital.

### What is the optimum adjunctive reperfusion strategy for primary percutaneous coronary intervention? [^032de5f6]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a dynamic, thrombus-driven event. As understanding of its pathophysiology has improved, the central role of platelets in initiation and orchestration of this process has become clear. Key components of STEMI include formation of occlusive thrombus, mediation and ultimately amplification of the local vascular inflammatory response resulting in increased vasoreactivity, oedema formation, and microvascular obstruction. Activation, degranulation, and aggregation of platelets are the platforms from which these components develop. Therefore, prompt, potent, and predictable antithrombotic therapy is needed to optimise clinical outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We review present pharmacological and mechanical adjunctive therapies for reperfusion and ask what is the optimum combination when primary percutaneous coronary intervention is used as the mode of revascularisation in patients with STEMI.

### Multicentre analysis of current ST-elevation myocardial infarction acute care pathways [^4cd9bc21]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid reperfusion with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is vital for patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the guideline-recommended time targets are regularly exceeded. The goal of this study was to gain insight into how Dutch PCI centres try to achieve these time targets by comparing their care processes with one another and with the European guideline-recommended process. In addition, accelerating factors perceived by care providers were identified.

Methods

In this multiple case study, interviews with STEMI care providers were conducted, transcribed and used to create process descriptions per centre. Analyses consisted of within-case and between-case analyses of the processes. Accelerating factors were identified by means of open and axial coding.

Results

In total, 28 interviews were conducted in six PCI centres. The centres differed from the guideline-recommended process on, for example, additional, unavoidable patient routings and monitoring delays, and from one another on the communication of diagnostic information (eg, transmitting all, only ambiguous or no ECGs) and catheterisation room preparation. These differences indicated diverging choices to maintain a balance between speed and diagnostic accuracy. Factors perceived by care providers as accelerating the process included trust in the tentative diagnosis, and avoiding unnecessary intercaregiver consultations. The combination of processes and accelerating factors were summarised in a model.

Conclusions

Numerous differences in processes between PCI centres were identified. Several time-saving strategies were applied by PCI centres, however, in different configurations. To further improve the care for patients with STEMI, best practices can be shared between centres and countries.

### Invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: understanding and addressing the global risk-treatment paradox [^831c2672]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Patients with NSTEMI have a higher long‐term mortality risk than patients with STEMI but are often treated less aggressively, with those who have the highest ischemic risk often receiving the least aggressive treatment (the "treatment‐risk paradox"). The suboptimal treatment of patients with NSTEMI can be explained by the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, an underestimation of the high ischemic risk compared with bleeding risk by physicians, procedure availability, and policy. To address these challenges, potential approaches include: developing guidelines and protocols that include rigorous definitions of NSTEMI, risk assessment, and integrated quality assessment measures; providing education to physicians on the management of long‐term cardiovascular risk in patients with NSTEMI; and making stents and antiplatelet therapies more accessible to patients.

### Treatment choices in elderly patients with ST: elevation myocardial infarction-insights from the vital heart response registry [^1cab246d]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Elderly patients have more comorbidities, worst in-hospital clinical outcomes and are more likely to receive no reperfusion therapy for STEMI compared to patients < 75 years. When reperfusion is undertaken practising clinicians preferred primary PCI over fibrinolysis in both age groups. Acknowledging physician driven patient selection, outcomes appear favourable in the elderly receiving fibrinolysis. Further systematic assessment of elderly patients with STEMI is warranted.

### Timing and completeness of revascularisation in acute coronary syndromes [^34435da6]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients presenting with STEMI

Despite progressive improvements in reperfusion therapy strategies, antithrombotic drugs and secondary prevention during the past four decades, in-hospital mortality following STEMI remains substantial — ranging from 4% to 12% among different registries. Emergency medical system-based STEMI networks are pivotal to shorten ischaemia time, maximise efficiency and improve patients' clinical outcomes.

When to revascularise patients presenting with STEMI

Primary PCI remains the gold-standard reperfusion strategy in patients with STEMI within 12 hours from symptom onset. However, if time from STEMI diagnosis to mechanical reperfusion is expected to be ≥ 120 min, fibrinolysis followed by coronary angiography within 24 hours is recommended. Data supporting the extent to which PCI-related time delay diminishes the advantages of PCI over fibrinolysis must be interpreted with caution, as they mainly come from post hoc analyses. In the most recent STREAM trial, 1892 patients who presented with early STEMI (within 3 hours from symptoms onset) and were unable to undergo primary PCI within 1 hour were randomised to undergo either primary PCI or fibrinolytic therapy followed by early angiography. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were shown between both strategies. However, the rate of intracranial haemorrhage in the fibrinolysis group was five times higher than in the primary PCI group (1.0% vs 0.2%, p = 0.04). In patients with time from symptom onset of > 12 hours but < 48 hours, routine primary PCI should be considered despite evidence supporting this strategy is limited. The BRAVE-2 trial randomised 365 patients with STEMI who were assessed between 12 and 48 hours from symptom onset to undergo PCI or conservative management. At 4-year follow-up, mortality in the PCI group was lower than in the conservative arm (adjusted HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97, p = 0.04). However, the trial was not powerful to demonstrate a difference in mortality. Conversely, in patients presenting > 48 hours after symptom onset, routine PCI should not be performed unless there is clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of ongoing ischaemia (figure 3).

### Role of fibrinolytic therapy in the current era of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction management [^423e713d]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

In patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, early, effective reperfusion of the culprit artery is needed to salvage myocardium, maintain left ventricular function, and reduce mortality. According to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of these patients, the time from medical contact (i.e., firm ST-elevation myocardial infarction diagnosis) to initiation of fibrinolytic therapy (door-to-needle time) should be 30 minutes, and the time from medical contact to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (door-to-balloon time) should be 90 minutes. Because many patients present to hospitals that are not equipped to administer PCI, door-to-balloon time often falls far short of the ideal. When PCI is not readily available, efficient prehospital treatment with t-PA-based fibrinolytic agent formulations that can be delivered in a bolus and do not require weight-based adjustment may reduce mortality rates and result in outcomes similar to PCI when administered promptly.

### Rationale and design of the OPTIMAL-REPERFUSION trial: a prospective randomized multi-center clinical trial comparing different fibrinolysis-transfer percutaneous coronary intervention strategies in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^41a52464]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), the preferred reperfusion strategy for all acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, is not universally available in clinical practice. Pharmacoinvasive strategy has been proposed as a therapeutic option in patients with STEMI when timely PPCI is not feasible. However, pharmacoinvasive strategy has potential delay between clinical patency and complete myocardial perfusion. The optimal reperfusion strategy for STEMI patients with anticipated PPCI delay according to current practice is uncertain. OPTIMAL-REPERFUSION is an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, superiority trial with blinded evaluation of outcomes. A total of 632 STEMI patients presenting within 6 hours after symptom onset and with an expected time of first medical contact to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) ≥ 120minute will be randomized to a reduced-dose facilitated PCI strategy (reduced-dose fibrinolysis combined with simultaneous transfer for immediate invasive therapy with a time interval between fibrinolysis to PCI < 3 hours) or to standard pharmacoinvasive treatment. The primary endpoint is the composite of death, reinfarction, refractory ischemia, congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock at 30-days. Enrollment of the first patient is planned in March 2021. The recruitment is anticipated to last for 12 to 18months and to complete in September 2023 with 1 year follow-up. The OPTIMAL-REPERFUSION trial will help determine whether reduced-dose facilitated PCI strategy improves clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI and anticipated PPCI delay. This study is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04752345).

Presenting Characteristics and In‐Hospital Management

In patients with and without SMuRFs, there were no significant differences in hemodynamic observations, Killip Class, cardiac arrest on admission, and GRACE risk score. There was also no significant difference in the incidence of significant multivessel disease (Table 2). A higher proportion of SMuRF‐less patients received primary percutaneous coronary intervention than patients with 1 or more SMuRF (49% versus 45%), and a smaller proportion received thrombolysis (32% versus 37%). The proportion of SMuRF‐less patients who were transferred to another hospital was lower than those with 1 or more SMuRFs (37% versus 44%). There was no clinically significant difference in evidence‐based secondary prevention medications prescribed at time of discharge between those with and without SMuRFs (Table 3). We observed higher in‐hospital and discharge use of angiotensin receptor blocker therapy use in patients with 1 or more SMuRFs. In secondary prevention angiotensin receptor blockers are second‐line therapy generally reserved for patients unable to tolerate angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. The higher rate of use of angiotensin receptor blockers in those with 1 or more SMuRFs may reflect a known intolerance to angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor administration.

Changing Proportion of SMuRF‐Less STEMI

During the study period from 1999 to 2017, the proportion of STEMI patients with 0 SMuRFs increased from 14% to 23% (Cochrane‐Armitage trend test, P = 0.0067; Figure 1). Although this current study is focused on the STEMI cohort, we also performed a simple analysis of the SMuRF‐less proportion in the 3773‐subject subgroup of non–ST‐segment–elevation acute coronary syndrome GRACE/CONCORDANCE subjects without prior CVD. It is important to note that this group is not broadly representative of all non–ST‐segment–elevation acute coronary syndromes, as it was intentionally enriched for patients with high‐risk features based on their clinical presentation. Although the overall proportion (18%) was similar to that in the STEMI cohort, there was no statistically significant change in the SMuRF‐less proportion during the study period.

### Routine early angioplasty after fibrinolysis for acute myocardial infarction [^63ba20d6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with a myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation who present to hospitals that do not have the capability of performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) often cannot undergo timely primary PCI and therefore receive fibrinolysis. The role and optimal timing of routine PCI after fibrinolysis have not been established.

Methods

We randomly assigned 1059 high-risk patients who had a myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation and who were receiving fibrinolytic therapy at centers that did not have the capability of performing PCI to either standard treatment (including rescue PCI, if required, or delayed angiography) or a strategy of immediate transfer to another hospital and PCI within 6 hours after fibrinolysis. All patients received aspirin, tenecteplase, and heparin or enoxaparin; concomitant clopidogrel was recommended. The primary end point was the composite of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, new or worsening congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock within 30 days.

Results

Cardiac catheterization was performed in 88.7% of the patients assigned to standard treatment a median of 32.5 hours after randomization and in 98.5% of the patients assigned to routine early PCI a median of 2.8 hours after randomization. At 30 days, the primary end point occurred in 11.0% of the patients who were assigned to routine early PCI and in 17.2% of the patients assigned to standard treatment (relative risk with early PCI, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.87; P = 0.004). There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of major bleeding.

Conclusions

Among high-risk patients who had a myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation and who were treated with fibrinolysis, transfer for PCI within 6 hours after fibrinolysis was associated with significantly fewer ischemic complications than was standard treatment.

### Performance of emergency department screening criteria for an early ECG to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^336cce38]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite decades of quality‐improvement efforts, the timely diagnosis of STEMI patients in the ED presents significant operational challenges. In managing the timely care of patients with STEMI, EDs encounter 3 distinct types of patients who differ on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment continuum. First are patients who have been prediagnosed with STEMI, who have had an ECG performed and interpreted by another provider. They are usually transferred to an ED or a hospital capable of definitive treatment, most often percutaneous coronary intervention. The expectation is that treatment will be initiated on arrival. Second are prescreened patients who have been evaluated by another provider and referred to the ED with an ECG concerning for ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a repeat ECG or reinterpretation of the ECG on arrival. The burden of screening for STEMI from the report of symptoms has already been met in these 2 scenarios; however, treatment has not been initiated. Third are the patients at greatest risk of delays in care: those arriving in the ED with undifferentiated symptoms who are primarily screened by that ED. In these cases, timely STEMI diagnosis is dependent on the patient's condition and symptoms triggering ED intake staff to perform an early ECG. 4, 5 The ECG is often considered the screening test for STEMI. In the context of emergency care, however, treatment is initiated with ECG evidence of STEMI, making it a diagnostic test. 6 The true screening test is the criteria by which ED care providers initiate an ECG (Figure 2).

Overly comprehensive screening criteria for a rare disease like STEMI risks underutilization. The sole use of chest pain is user friendly but likely produces inadequate case capture. Overall, 20% to 30% of patients with STEMI will report atypical symptoms like shortness of breath and dizziness 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or will focus on associated symptoms like jaw, neck, or back pain. In addition, age positively influences the probability of STEMI, and elderly patients with STEMI more frequently report atypical symptoms. 12, 13, 14 Shorter time to reperfusion has been shown to improve outcomes. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Door‐to‐ECG time interval is the first STEMI care target toward achieving timely intervention.

### Reperfusion therapies and in-hospital outcomes for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Europe: the ACVC-EAPCI EORP STEMI registry of the European Society of Cardiology [^32bca911]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to determine the contemporary use of reperfusion therapy in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member and affiliated countries and adherence to ESC clinical practice guidelines in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Methods and Results

Prospective cohort (EURObservational Research Programme STEMI Registry) of hospitalized STEMI patients with symptom onset < 24h in 196 centres across 29 countries. A total of 11 462 patients were enrolled, for whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (total cohort frequency: 72.2%, country frequency range 0–100%), fibrinolysis (18.8%; 0–100%), and no reperfusion therapy (9.0%; 0–75%) were performed. Corresponding in-hospital mortality rates from any cause were 3.1%, 4.4%, and 14.1% and overall mortality was 4.4% (country range 2.5–5.9%). Achievement of quality indicators for reperfusion was reported for 92.7% (region range 84.8–97.5%) for the performance of reperfusion therapy of all patients with STEMI < 12h and 54.4% (region range 37.1–70.1%) for timely reperfusion.

Conclusions

The use of reperfusion therapy for STEMI in the ESC member and affiliated countries was high. Primary PCI was the most frequently used treatment and associated total in-hospital mortality was below 5%. However, there was geographic variation in the use of primary PCI, which was associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.

### A comparison of pharmacologic therapy with / without timely coronary intervention vs. primary percutaneous intervention early after ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the WEST (which early ST-elevation myocardial infarction therapy) study [^d548e5e0]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Uncertainty exists as to which reperfusion strategy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) is optimal. We evaluated whether optimal pharmacologic therapy at the earliest point of care, emphasizing pre-hospital randomization and treatment was non-inferior to expeditious primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods and Results

Which Early ST-elevation myocardial infarction Therapy (WEST) was a four-city Canadian, open-label, randomized, feasibility study of 304 STEMI patients (> 4 mm ST-elevation/deviation) within 6 h of symptom onset, emphasizing pre-hospital ambulance treatment and participation of community and tertiary care centres. All received aspirin, subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg), and were randomized to one of three groups: (A) tenecteplase (TNK) and usual care, (B) TNK and mandatory invasive study ≤ 24 h, including rescue PCI for reperfusion failure, and (C) primary PCI with 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel. Time from symptom onset to treatment was rapid (to TNK for A = 113 and B = 130 min and for PCI in C = 176 min). The primary outcome, a composite of 30-day death, re-infarction, refractory ischaemia, congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and major ventricular arrhythmia, was 25% (Group A), 24% (Group B), and 23% (Group C), respectively. However, there was a higher frequency of the combination of death and recurrent MI in Group A vs. Group C (13.0 vs. 4.0%, respectively, P-logrank = 0.021), yet no difference between Group B (6.7%, P-logrank = 0.378) and C.

Conclusion

These data suggest that a contemporary pharmacologic regimen rapidly delivered, coupled with a strategy of regimented rescue and routine coronary intervention within 24 h of initial treatment, may not be different from timely expert PCI.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to management of AF, antithrombotic therapy, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and an OAC for > 1 week after percutaneous intervention when the risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk. Decide the total duration (≤ 1 month) according to the assessment of these risks and ensure clear documentation.
