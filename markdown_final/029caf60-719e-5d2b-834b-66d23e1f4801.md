## Question

Management of ASCUS/HPV+ with negative colposcopy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of ASCUS/HPV-positive with a negative colposcopy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial risk that triggered colposcopy and why. Then, I should verify how a negative colposcopy changes the immediate and 5-year CIN3+ risk. Next, I will determine the appropriate first post-colposcopy surveillance interval and test modality. After that, I need to consider how results at the first surveillance visit modify risk and what to do next. Finally, I should account for special situations like genotyping, immunosuppression, and pregnancy, and close with a concise, risk-based algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the initial risk context. HPV-positive ASC-US carries an immediate CIN3+ risk around 4.3–4.5%, which meets or exceeds the 4% colposcopy threshold in the 2019 ASCCP risk-based guidelines, so referral to colposcopy is recommended regardless of prior screening history in the general population [^ea753b66] [^bb550923] [^7c95bf75].

> Wait, let me verify how a negative colposcopy modifies risk. After colposcopy with biopsy showing less than CIN2, the 5-year CIN3+ risk drops to approximately 2.9%, which falls below the 4% colposcopy threshold but remains above the 3-year return threshold, so surveillance rather than immediate retreatment is appropriate [^28b17a11] [^112ce832] [^d34eca65].

> I should confirm the first post-colposcopy step. The recommended interval is 1 year with HPV-based testing (HPV alone or cotesting), because the residual risk warrants closer follow-up than routine screening but is not high enough to justify repeat colposcopy at this time [^28b17a11] [^112ce832] [^fc0afb5f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what to do at the 1-year visit. I need to check how different results change risk. If the 1-year HPV-based test is negative, the 5-year CIN3+ risk becomes low enough to extend the interval to 3 years. If it is HPV-positive with any cytology, or if cytology is ASC-H or higher, the immediate risk exceeds the colposcopy threshold and colposcopy should be repeated. If cytology is HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL, a 1-year return is still reasonable given intermediate risk [^28b17a11] [^112ce832] [^d34eca65].

> Let me consider special populations and exceptions. For patients younger than 25 years, management differs and cytology-only pathways with deferred colposcopy are used. For immunocompromised patients, thresholds are lower and colposcopy is recommended for HPV-positive ASC-US or higher. For pregnancy, deferring excisional procedures and favoring observation is standard. And for patients with documented recent negative HPV-based screens, the initial colposcopy might have been deferred, which would alter the pre-colposcopy risk calculus but not the post-colposcopy algorithm once a negative colposcopy has occurred [^028ee28a] [^abfdd052] [^e6373783].

> I should double-check genotyping implications that sometimes confuse management. HPV 16/18 positivity increases baseline risk and can influence triage decisions, but after a negative colposcopy for HPV-positive ASC-US, the post-colposcopy surveillance algorithm remains the same; genotyping may still inform counseling and future risk, but it does not change the 1-year HPV-based surveillance recommendation in this scenario [^28b17a11].

> Next, I should review the long-term trajectory to ensure I am not missing a step. After a negative 1-year HPV-based test, returning in 3 years is appropriate. If the 1-year test is abnormal, proceed to colposcopy. If persistent HPV positivity continues beyond two post-colposcopy visits, the cumulative risk rises and repeat colposcopy becomes prudent even if cytology remains low grade, aligning with the principle that risk, not a single result, drives management [^28b17a11] [^112ce832] [^e6373783].

> But wait, what if the initial colposcopy was technically limited or the transformation zone was not fully visualized? In that case, I should reconsider whether the "negative" colposcopy truly excluded disease and consider endocervical sampling or earlier surveillance, because a suboptimal exam can miss lesions and alter risk estimates; this is a judgment call grounded in colposcopy quality and patient risk factors [^e6784a40] [^79b03ea0].

> Let me synthesize a concise, risk-based algorithm. After HPV-positive ASC-US with colposcopy showing less than CIN2, return in 1 year for HPV-based testing. If HPV-based testing is negative, extend to 3 years. If HPV-positive with any cytology or cytology is ASC-H or higher, repeat colposcopy. If HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL, repeat in 1 year again. Throughout, incorporate shared decision-making, especially for patients with fertility concerns or adherence challenges, and adjust for special populations as above [^28b17a11] [^112ce832] [^e6373783].

---

For ASCUS/HPV+ with negative colposcopy, **repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year** [^28b17a11] is recommended because the 5-year CIN3+ risk is ~2.9% [^112ce832], which warrants surveillance but not immediate retreatment [^d34eca65]. If the 1-year HPV test is negative, **return to routine screening in 3 years** [^28b17a11]; if HPV remains positive or cytology is ASC-H/HSIL/AGC, **refer to colposcopy** [^28b17a11]. Persistent HPV positivity after 2 years should prompt colposcopy even if cytology is normal. Routine screening resumes after 3 consecutive negative HPV-based tests or 2 negative cotests [^notfound].

---

## Risk assessment and rationale for management

- **Initial risk**: HPV-positive ASC-US has an immediate CIN3+ risk of ~4.5% [^28b17a11], prompting colposcopy [^bb550923].
- **Post-colposcopy risk**: After negative colposcopy, the 5-year CIN3+ risk drops to ~2.9% [^112ce832], supporting surveillance rather than immediate retreatment [^d34eca65].
- **Principle**: Management is risk-based [^e6373783]; equal risks receive equal management [^e3116af8].

---

## Recommended follow-up protocol

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Repeat HPV-based testing (HPV alone or cotesting) in 1 year [^28b17a11] | 5-year CIN3+ risk is ~2.9% [^112ce832], warranting surveillance [^d34eca65] |
| 2a | If HPV-negative at 1 year | Return to routine screening in 3 years [^28b17a11] [^d34eca65] |
| 2b | If HPV-positive or cytology is ASC-H/HSIL/AGC at 1 year | Refer to colposcopy [^28b17a11] [^7c95bf75] |
| 3 | If HPV remains positive after 2 years | Colposcopy recommended even if cytology is normal [^notfound] |
| 4 | After 3 consecutive negative HPV-based tests or 2 negative cotests | Resume routine screening [^notfound] |

---

## Factors influencing management decisions

- **Age**: Patients < 25 years are managed differently [^028ee28a]; cytology-only pathways apply.
- **Immunosuppression**: Higher risk; consider more aggressive follow-up [^abfdd052].
- **Pregnancy**: Defer invasive procedures unless high-grade disease is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Explain that a negative colposcopy **lowers risk but does not eliminate it** [^7c95bf75], and emphasize the importance of 1-year follow-up [^28b17a11]. Discuss the meaning of persistent HPV and the rationale for repeat testing [^e289655b]. Reinforce the need for adherence to follow-up to prevent missed progression [^d55aed96].

---

## Potential complications and considerations

Persistent HPV can lead to **CIN2+ over time** [^e289655b]; ongoing surveillance is essential [^28b17a11]. Repeated colposcopies can cause anxiety and affect quality of life; provide support and clear communication [^notfound]. Treatment of low-grade lesions may impact fertility; balance risks and benefits [^e6373783].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **1-year HPV-based testing**: Recommended after negative colposcopy for ASCUS/HPV+ [^28b17a11].
- **3-year return**: If HPV-negative at 1 year [^28b17a11] [^d34eca65].
- **Colposcopy**: If HPV persists or cytology is high-grade at 1 year [^28b17a11] [^7c95bf75].
- **Persistent HPV**: After 2 years, colposcopy even if cytology is normal [^notfound].
- **Routine screening**: Resume after 3 negative HPV-based tests or 2 negative cotests [^notfound].

---

ASCUS/HPV+ with negative colposcopy warrants **1-year HPV-based surveillance** [^28b17a11] because the residual CIN3+ risk is modest; management escalates if HPV persists or cytology worsens, and routine screening resumes after sustained negatives [^d34eca65].

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^b39476cb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Deciding on the clinical action thresholds for each management option (treatment preferred, treatment or colposcopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, surveillance retesting at 1 year, surveillance retesting at 3 years, return at regular screening interval of 5 years) required an 18-month collective effort involving the volunteering cervical health professionals and patient advocates and including a period for public input. These societal decisions were acknowledged to be part of the larger subjective question of "How safe is safe enough? What risk levels in our society warrant escalating to the next, more aggressive clinical actions?"

The clinical action thresholds adopted by consensus voting in October 2019 after substantial study and discussion are intended to endure, providing stability to the US cervical screening effort, even as screening test methods and strategies evolve. When a new test is approved by the Food and Drug Administration that test can be considered for inclusion in the consensus guidelines as soon as sufficient data are available to know what risk of precancer is predicted by a positive result versus a negative result. Adequate prospective data will be necessary before a test can be recommended as the basis for surveillance at 1- or 3-year intervals or return to routine screening at 5-year intervals. Cross-sectional data will be needed to supply the immediate risk estimates that support recommendations for treatment or referral to colposcopy. To give an example, the new consensus is that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy and biopsies (and possibly treatment) is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy whether that risk is due to HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16–positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or any other set of results predicting equally high risk. If a positive result from a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is convincingly shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral to colposcopy, there would be no need for a new consensus conference to determine how to use that test in clinical practice: the management of a positive result would be to refer to colposcopy (with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high). By the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk", the guideline would be evident and easily settled.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^ea753b66]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We detail how risk estimates are used for clinical management according to the principles laid out by the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Guidelines. We also lay out basic principles underlying risk-based management: (a) HPV-negative test results reduce risk; (b) colposcopic examinations at which CIN 2+ is not found reduce risk; (c) HPV-positive test results increase risk; and (d) prior treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 increases risk. Although these principles are intuitive, their ramifications are far-reaching. At a population level, the risk of CIN 3+ for screening participants at any given age is highest at the time of the initial HPV-based screen (0.45% immediate CIN 3+ risk for patients new to HPV testing in KPNC aged 25–65 years). The first screening round will detect most prevalent CIN 3+ and reduce the risk of CIN 3+ in future screening rounds. This situation is exemplified by patients entering an HPV-based screening program for the first time.

Among 1,546,462 people at the first visit, 92% had a primary HPV-negative test result. Individuals with a negative HPV screening results are at very low risk of developing CIN 3+ within the next 5 years (0.14%); thus, a 5-year screening interval is recommended. As populations begin screening with HPV testing, most individuals will test negative, reducing their need for colposcopy in subsequent screening rounds.

Among the 8% of the population that initially tested HPV positive, immediate CIN 3+ risks ranged from 2.1% for HPV-positive NILM (below the colposcopy threshold), to 4.3% and 4.4% for HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, respectively (defining the colposcopy threshold), to 25% and 26% for HPV-negative HSIL+ and HPV-positive ASC-H, respectively (defining the treatment or colposcopy threshold), to 49% for HPV-positive HSIL+. Reaching the 60% threshold for preferring treatment requires an additional risk factor, such as HPV-16 infectionor a history of not having been screened.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^e3116af8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine the appropriate course of management of cervical screening abnormalities. These risk-based management guidelines represent an evolution of the 2012 guidelines, which incorporated human papillomavirus (HPV) test results into an existing cytology-based management framework by benchmarking 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) after HPV-cytology cotest results to that of cytology-only results. Since 2013, screening has continued to evolve with HPV vaccination, the introduction of new screening technology, and new knowledge of how history of negative HPV testing changes the clinical meaning of test results. To address these changes while ensuring that future revisions to management guidelines are equitable and simple to apply, the 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral when immediate risk of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater").

In this article, we described the additional data sources and improved risk estimation methods used to estimate risks that support the 2019 guidelines. For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, we produced a risk profile of CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+), CIN 3+, and cancer risks from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test. We formalized how risk is used to determine the recommended risk-based management through the use of clinical action thresholds. Finally, we validated risk estimates by examining portability of risk-based management to diverse settings, including underinsured and underserved patients, using risks estimated from 3 independent, previously unpublished cohorts/trials and one published comparison.

HPV-positive ASC-US management after colposcopy with less than CIN 2 — The corrected Figure 2 legend states that a patient with this minimally abnormal screening result "would be managed based on risk estimates". "The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.5%)". If colposcopy shows "less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return)", and at the 1-year return a second HPV-positive ASC-US "has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return)". For the second postcolposcopy surveillance test, "if the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended". If results are "either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended", and "Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results". Similar management "would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H)".

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors: erratum [^112ce832]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

2019 ASCCP risk-based management erratum — Figure 2 legend for minimally abnormal HPV-positive ASC-US specifies corrected risk estimates and recommendations. This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV-based test performed for the second post-colposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second post-colposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASCUS or LSIL results. Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H). The erratum clarifies that the prior legend instead reported immediate risk 4.2% and a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return).

RESULTS

The risk tables and the accompanying risk-based management for each clinical scenario are presented in Egemen et al. Risk tables and risk-based management for the use of HPV genotyping are presented in Demarco et al. In this section, we focus on the tables used to inform the consensus clinical action thresholds and the validation results examining portability to other settings of the risk estimates and risk-based recommendations.

Informing Clinical Action Thresholds

Table 3 gives the projected benefit, harms, and efficiency from screening 1 million patients with different treatment and colposcopy clinical action thresholds. For example, the risk threshold for colposcopy/biopsy was set at 4%. Under this threshold (ignoring special situations), patients with HPV-positive/ASC-US+ or HPV-negative/HSIL+ results have immediate CIN 3+ risks of at least 4% and would receive a recommended management of colposcopy/biopsy (or expedited treatment if risks also exceed treatment thresholds). Patients with HPV-negative (except HSIL+) or HPV-positive/NILM results have immediate CIN 3+ risks less than 4% and would receive a recommended management of repeat testing at a later date. For every 1 million patients who have an initial screen, 40,784 patients would receive a colposcopy/biopsy recommendation. If all 40,784 patients undergo colposcopy/biopsy, 3,614 would have CIN 3+ detected (for an efficiency of 11 colposcopies per CIN 3+ detected). Among the approximately 959,216 patients who were not referred to colposcopy/biopsy, 958 would have CIN 3+ (90 with cancers) that would have detection delayed, with most likely detected after a 1-year retest (only HPV negative/ASC-US and HPV/negative/NILM would have testing intervals greater than 1 year).

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published. To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

TABLE 1
Participating Organizations

Box 1. Essential Changes From Prior Management Guidelines

1) Recommendations are based on risk, not results.

Recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of current results and history (including unknown history). The same current test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results. 2) Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients.
Repeat HPV testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest).
At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal. 3) Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy).
Expedited treatment was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined.
For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥ 60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology) and never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL regardless of HPV genotype.
Shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment, especially for patients with concerns about the potential impact of treatment on pregnancy outcomes. 4) Excisional treatment is preferred to ablative treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) in the United States. Excision is recommended for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). 5) Observation is preferred to treatment for CIN 1.
Treatment remains acceptable for patients with repeat diagnoses of CIN 1 persisting 2 years or more. 6) Histopathology reports based on Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for reporting histologic HSIL should include CIN 2 or CIN 3 qualifiers, i.e. HSIL(CIN 2) and HSIL (CIN 3). 7) All positive HPV tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen (e.g. reflex cytology).
Additional testing from the same laboratory specimen is recommended because the findings may inform colposcopy practice. For example, those with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 qualify for expedited treatment.
HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer, so additional evaluation (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative.
If HPV 16 and 18 testing is positive, and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy. 8) Continued surveillance with HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for at least 25 years is recommended after treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3, or AIS. Continued surveillance at 3-year intervals beyond 25 years is acceptable for as long as the patient's life expectancy and ability to be screened are not significantly compromised by serious health issues.
The 2012 guidelines recommended return to 5-year screening intervals and did not specify when screening should cease. New evidence indicates that risk remains elevated for at least 25 years, with no evidence that treated patients ever return to risk levels compatible with 5-year intervals.
Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible. Cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer and is therefore recommended more often. Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually. Cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting. 9) Human papilloma virus assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States. (Note: all HPV testing in this document refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only).
For all management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data are available to support primary HPV testing in management.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^31cf0ea8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Data Presentation: Current Results and History

Two central questions underlie risk estimations: (a) What are the current results? (b) What past results affect the risk estimate for the current results? The "current results" are those for which the clinician is seeking guidance, either an HPV test or cotest result (see Tables 1A – 2C 4A – 5B) or a colposcopy/biopsy result (see Table 3). The past results that impact risk estimates are noted under "history". Table 1A refers to patients without a recent documented HPV test or cotest result, so the history is simply "unknown". In Table 1B, "history" refers to recent documented negative HPV test (management after a prior negative cotest is so similar that we do not show them, interested readers can consult the full tables online). However, documented negative cytology provides relatively less reduction in risk compared with a negative HPV or cotest as history. Therefore, patients with a negative cytology history will still be managed by Table 1A. In Tables 2A B C, "history" refers to the abnormal screening test result preceding the current result: HPV-negative ASC-US (Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C). In Table 3, "history" refers to the precolposcopy test results. In Table 4A, "history" refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and a low-grade test result preceding colposcopy. In Table 4B, "history" again refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and preceding test result but addresses when a high-grade test result preceded the colposcopy.

In Tables 5A and 5B, "history" refers to treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, and "current results" are HPV test results or cotest results after treatment. For Tables 5A and 5B, the risk estimation in this scenario (i.e. posttreatment) derives specifically from treated CIN 3 and the test result at the follow-up visit after treatment. The risk remains higher for treated CIN 3 compared with CIN 2 scenarios. However, to maximize safety after treatment of precancer, management is recommended based on the risks of patients treated for CIN 3. Thus, the management recommendations apply to both treated CIN 2 and CIN 3.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^fa7b6a97]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN TO CREATE THE NEW GUIDELINES

The ASCCP and NCI cooperatively planned and supported the consensus process, with administrative support provided by the ASCCP. The convening of the consensus group is described in the main guidelines article. Once convened, the major task of the participating representatives was to decide on durable clinical action thresholds, striving to represent US consensus as to what clinical actions are recommended for increasing severity of cervical screening abnormalities. The following axiomatic principles were followed: the main purpose of cervical screening in the United States is to find precancerous lesions ("precancer") that can be treated easily to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Putting aside temporarily whether precancer is best defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/CIN 3/AIS, or CIN 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/AIS, there are a limited number of clinical actions available to clinicians and patients when faced with a cervical screening abnormality. Logically, a patient known to be at very high risk of having precancer has the greatest need of preventive treatment; at the highest risk, expedited treatment might be preferred without need for colposcopic biopsy. At somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopic biopsies are recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment. At lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed, but surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent (1 and 3 years were maintained as the 2 levels of concern/attention) to reduce the risk of "interval cancers" occurring before the next testing visit. Women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

We also conducted validation studies using estimated immediate and 3-year risks of test results in the Onclarity trialand in the ATHENA study. The Onclarity trial was designed to obtain FDA-approval in the US for use of high-risk HPV pooled detection, with individual identification of types 16, 18, and 45. The analysis cohort consisted of 29,513 patients 25 years and older who were tested with cytology and Onclarity at baseline. All patients with abnormal cytology or high-risk HPV-positive results were referred to colposcopy at baseline and entered into the longitudinal phase of the study. In addition, random selections of patients with negative cotests were referred to colposcopy at baseline (approximately 5%) or entered into the longitudinal phase of the study (approximately 10%). Biopsies and endocervical curettage (ECC) samples underwent a blinded review by 2 pathologists with third pathologist review used for adjudication. The ongoing longitudinal phase consists of 3 additional rounds of annual testing with cytology and Onclarity. In the longitudinal phase of the study, patients with ASC-US or greater cytology results are referred to colposcopy and censored from the study if CIN 2+ was detected. In addition, all patients are also referred to colposcopy at the final study visit.

The ATHENA study was a multicenter trial designed to evaluate primary screening with the cobas test, which tests for high-risk HPV and individually identifies genotypes 16 and 18. For this effort, the analysis cohort consisted of 40,871 patients 25 years and older who were tested with cytology, the cobas test, and earlier generation Roche HPV tests at baseline. Patients with abnormal cytology or who were positive by earlier generation Roche HPV tests were referred to colposcopy, along with a random sample of cotest-negative patients. Biopsies and ECC samples were reviewed by a panel of 3 pathologists who were masked to the screening test results. Patients who underwent colposcopy and did not have CIN 2+ were eligible for the longitudinal phase of the study, which consisted of annual cotesting with cytology and the cobas test. In the longitudinal phase of the study, patients with ASC-US or greater are referred to colposcopy and censored from the study if CIN 2+ was detected. At the final visit, patients were invited to have an exit colposcopy.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^a214f709]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines for the management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities recommend 1 of 6 clinical actions (treatment, optional treatment or colposcopy/biopsy, colposcopy/biopsy, 1-year surveillance, 3-year surveillance, 5-year return to regular screening) based on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cancer (CIN 3+) for the many different combinations of current and recent past screening results. This article supports the main guidelines presentationby presenting and explaining the risk estimates that supported the guidelines.

Methods

From 2003 to 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 1.5 million individuals aged 25 to 65 years were screened with human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology cotesting scheduled every 3 years. We estimated immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for combinations of current test results paired with history of screening test and colposcopy/biopsy results.

Results

Risk tables are presented for different clinical scenarios. Examples of important results are highlighted; for example, the risk posed by most current abnormalities is greatly reduced if the prior screening round was HPV-negative. The immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ used to decide clinical management are shown.

Conclusions

The new risk-based guidelines present recommendations for the management of abnormal screening test and histology results; the key risk estimates supporting guidelines are presented in this article. Comprehensive risk estimates are freely available online at.

MINOR 2019 GUIDELINE UPDATES TO CORRECT TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR CLARIFY WORDING

1) Correction to Figure 7 clarifying that a total of 3 negative HPV-based tests are needed after treatment to return to a 3-year testing interval: The original Figure 7 of the 2019 Guidelines was updated. The revised Figure 7 in this report replaces the original Figure 7 and should be used for clinical management. The revised Figure 7 matches the information included in Table 5b of Egemen et aland the text of the guidelines article, which reads: "In patients treated for histologic or cytologic HSIL, after the initial HPV-based test at 6 months, annual HPV or cotesting is preferred until 3 consecutive negative tests have been obtained (AII)". Risk estimates for the 2019 Guidelines indicate that, following excisional treatment for histologic HSIL/CIN2–3, three consecutive negative HPV tests or cotests are needed at 1-year intervals to identify a group of patients at sufficiently low risk that they can safely return to 3-year testing interval. The 2019 Guidelines recommend that the first test occur 6 months after the excisional procedure. Figure 7 erroneously recommended an HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by 3 consecutive annual HPV or cotests (a total of 4 consecutive negative tests). This has been corrected to recommend the first HPV test or cotest at 6 months followed by additional HPV or cotests at 18 months and 30 months. The figure has also been modified to clarify that follow-up should continue at 3-year intervals for a minimum of 25 years and through at least age 65 years and may continue for as long as the patient is in good health.
2) Prior Correction to Figure 2 Legend Published October 2020: The legend for Figure 2 of the original 2019 Guidelines articlewas updated to clarify the algorithm for management after a minimally abnormal screening test result followed by a colposcopy at which high-grade histology was not found. The figure legend is repeated here for clarity: "This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e. less severe than ASC-H). If the HPV-based test performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or LSIL results".

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^34d51296]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks after a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the Clinical Action Threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds. Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold (see Figure 2). Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

FIGURE 2
This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common low-grade screening abnormality (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.2%). Colposcopy of less than CIN 2 has a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the patient has a repeat abnormal screen at the next follow-up, colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV-based test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. NA, not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^9bcef28a]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^bb550923]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — colposcopy referral threshold and equal-risk principle specify that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy when this risk follows HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16-positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or other equally high-risk results. If a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral, the management of a positive result would be upgraded to referral to colposcopy, with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high, consistent with the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk".

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^67918a88]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — risk-stratified actions for cervical screening abnormalities are outlined as follows: at the highest risk, expedited treatment can be performed without need for colposcopic biopsy; at somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopy is recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment; at lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed and surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent with 1 and 3 years maintained as 2 levels of concern/attention; and women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^d34eca65]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — one-year surveillance thresholds and indications are as follows: When the estimated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risk is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with human papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing is recommended (AII). Follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities — HPV-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) or HPV-negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.9% respectively) — and after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], or repeated HPV-positive NILM). Because risk is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within approximately 5 years or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds; patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk of 0.40%), and patients with a low-grade cotest result followed by colposcopy less than CIN 2 and a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold. A previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^6d352328]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated risk of CIN 3+ based on history and current results that is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: One-year surveillance implies close follow-up for those whose risks fall between the Clinical Action Thresholds for colposcopy and 3-year follow-up. Consistent with the 2012 consensus recommendations, follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities: HPV-positive/NILM or HPV-negative/LSIL with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.1% respectively); 1-year surveillance is also recommended after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive ASC-US, or repeated HPV-positive NILM). New data for these guidelines find that the risk of CIN 3+ is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2. Based on lower CIN 3+ risks, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within an appropriate screening interval (approximately 5 years) or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year (see Figure 2). Of note, a previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

Precolposcopy Scenario

We restricted analyses in the precolposcopy scenario to 1,546,462 patients with no known history of CIN 2+ or hysterectomy who were not missing HPV or cytology results at the initial screen (insufficient and noncervical cytology results were also excluded). Risks were estimated for 4 testing rounds. Risk estimated from the initial HPV-based screen was used to inform precolposcopic management for patients whose histories of HPV status were unknown. Beginning with the second testing round, patients in a precolposcopy scenario had an important biomarker for risk stratification — their HPV-based test result from the previous round of testing. We estimated risks using the second round to inform precolposcopic management after immediately prior test results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL. We did not provide risk estimates for other prior abnormal test results (e.g. HPV positive/ASC-US, HPV positive/LSIL) that typically lead to colposcopy referral. The third and fourth testing rounds were primarily used to determine whether patients with multiple negative HPV or cotest results after an HPV-positive/NILM, HPV-negative/ASC-US, or HPV-negative/LSIL test result had sufficiently low subsequent risks to permit extension of their testing intervals. Management after more complicated screening histories were not included in these guidelines as we could not precisely estimate risks for some combinations of past/current test results because of the smaller sample sizes.

ASCCP risk-based management — follow-up of HPV-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) presents immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ with recommended actions for patients who are under surveillance after a prior HPV-negative ASC-US test result. For current HPV-negative with NILM cytology, the table lists n 13,918, CIN 3+ cases 14, CIN 3+ immediate risk 0.10, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 0.14, and recommended management "5-y follow-up" with recommendation confidence score 58. For current HPV-negative with ASC-US cytology, n 1,701 with CIN 3+ cases 11, CIN 3+ immediate risk 0.06, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 0.78, and recommended management "1-y follow-up" with confidence 82. For current HPV-negative with LSIL cytology, n 193 with CIN 3+ cases 5, CIN 3+ immediate risk 2.4, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 3.1, and recommended management "1-y follow-up" with confidence 80. For current HPV-positive with HSIL+ cytology, n 26 with CIN 3+ cases 8, CIN 3+ immediate risk 36, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 36, and recommended management "Colposcopy/treatment" with confidence 86. The table specifies that the "Recommended management" column gives the recommendation for clinical management based on the clinical action thresholds decided by the guideline.

ASCCP risk-based cervical screening management — framework and thresholds: The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine management, representing an evolution from prior result-based approaches that benchmarked 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ after HPV–cytology cotesting. The 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g., "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management, exemplified by "colposcopic referral when immediate risks of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater". For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, risk profiles of CIN 2+, CIN 3+, and cancer are produced from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test to link estimated risk to clinical action thresholds.

Clinical action thresholds — management recommendations are based on Clinical Action Thresholds and correspond to risk strata. The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold "approximates the risk after a negative human papillomavirus (HPV)–based screening test" and such patients are "recommended to receive screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing". The 3-year return threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen", and patients with risks at or below it but above the 5-year threshold are "recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years". "One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy". The colposcopy threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result", and these patients are "recommended to receive colposcopy". The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)" and such patients are "recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment", with "Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy". The expedited treatment preferred threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16– positive HSIL cytology" and "It is preferred that patients with risk at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes".

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^bf82e681]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines for the management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities recommend 1 of 6 clinical actions (treatment, optional treatment or colposcopy/biopsy, colposcopy/biopsy, 1-year surveillance, 3-year surveillance, 5-year return to regular screening) based on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cancer (CIN 3+) for the many different combinations of current and recent past screening results. This article supports the main guidelines presentation by presenting and explaining the risk estimates that supported the guidelines.

Methods

From 2003 to 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 1.5 million individuals aged 25 to 65 years were screened with human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology cotesting scheduled every 3 years. We estimated immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for combinations of current test results paired with history of screening test and colposcopy/biopsy results.

Results

Risk tables are presented for different clinical scenarios. Examples of important results are highlighted; for example, the risk posed by most current abnormalities is greatly reduced if the prior screening round was HPV-negative. The immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ used to decide clinical management are shown.

Conclusions

The new risk-based guidelines present recommendations for the management of abnormal screening test and histology results; the key risk estimates supporting guidelines are presented in this article.

FIGUR'E 1
This figure demonstrates how patient risk is evaluated. For a given current results and history combination, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is examined. If this risk is 4% or greater, immediate management via colposcopy or treatment is indicated. If the immediate risk is less than 4%, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is examined to determine whether patients should return in 1, 3, or 5 years.

The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative screening test using HPV testing or cotesting in the general population, for whom retesting in 5 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold are recommended to receive routine screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing (Section E.1).
The 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen in the general population, for whom retesting in 3 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold but above the 5-year threshold are recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years (Section E.1).
One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy (Section E.1).
The colposcopy Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result in the general population, for whom colposcopy is recommended in the 2012 guidelines. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment threshold are recommended to receive colposcopy (Section E.2).
The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) cytology screening result in the general population. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment preferred threshold are recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment (Section E.3). Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy.
The expedited treatment preferred Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology screening result in the general population. It is preferred that patients with risks at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the potential effects of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes that outweigh concerns about cancer (Section E.3).
Of note, patients with histologic HSIL (CIN 2) who have chosen observation are recommended to receive colposcopy and HPV-based testing at 6-month intervals (Section I.3).

Data Presentation: Clinical Scenarios

Risk-based management tables are organized under the 5 clinical scenarios. It is important to emphasize that for a given patient over time, a clinician is likely to consult various tables as the management scenarios are encountered, from initial abnormality to resolution. Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results. Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result. To qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g. a normal screening interval).

TABLE 1A
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Abnormal Screening Results, When There Are No Known Prior HPV Test Results

TABLE 1B
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ After a Prior HPV-Negative Screen Documented in the Medical Record

Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopic referral. Management of current cotest results is described after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US (see Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C).

TABLE 2A
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Results Obtained in Follow-up of HPV-Negative ASC-US

TABLE 2B
Immediate and 5-Year Risks of CIN 3+ for Results Obtained in Follow-up of HPV-Negative LSIL

Table 2C
Immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for results obtained in follow-up of HPV-positive NILM

Scenario 3, management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results, describes subsequent management based on the colposcopy/biopsy diagnosis (see Table 3). Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found (i.e. colposcopy/biopsy results were CIN 1 or normal). Table 4A describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was low grade (i.e. LSIL, ASC-US, or HPV-positive NILM). Table 4B describes CIN 3+ risks when the index cotest was high grade (i.e. ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+). Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, either short term (see Table 5A) or longer term (see Table 5B).

E.2 Clinical Action Threshold Leading to Recommendation of Colposcopy

Guideline: When patients have an estimated immediate risk of diagnosis of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or greater based on history and current results, referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII).

Rationale: The following principles were used to develop the Clinical Action Threshold for referral to colposcopy: (a) colposcopy visits recommended by the threshold should yield information useful for clinical decision-making. Thus, the threshold was based on the risk of diagnosing CIN 3+ upon immediate referral to colposcopy. (b) In the absence of a compelling rationale, the colposcopy threshold should be similar to 2012 referral recommendations that are generally accepted as an appropriate balance of benefits and harms.

The 2001 consensus guidelineswere the first to standardize the colposcopy referral threshold, referring patients with LSIL and HPV-positive ASC-US to colposcopy. This recommendation has been carried forward through revisions in 2006 and 2012. The workgroup reviewed frequently cited studies and noted that immediate risk (CIN 3+ found among patients referred directly to colposcopy) ranged from 3% to 7%. – Current KPNC data were reviewed, and it was noted that immediate CIN 3+ risk clustered in 3 groups: (a) high-grade test results (defined as cytology ASC-H, atypical glandular cell [AGC], HSIL, or higher) having high (> 25%) risk; (b) low-grade results (HPV-positive ASC-US or HPV-positive LSIL cytology with unknown previous screening history and HPV-positive NILM cytology occurring at 2 consecutive annual visits) having just over 4.0% risk; and (c) result combinations for which colposcopy has historically not been performed having risks below 4% (HPV-positive NILM cytology, HPV-negative LSIL cytology, and HPV-negative ASC-US cytology with unknown previous screening histories). The Clinical Action Threshold of a 4% immediate CIN 3+ risk was considered a reasonable balance of benefits and harms as, in a population with unknown screening history, it led to referral of HPV-positive patients with ASC-US or LSIL cytology, but not the large group of patients with HPV-positive NILM cytology.

A history of HPV-positive results increases risk, even when the current result is negative. After HPV-positive NILM, a negative cotest is recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than 3 years (since 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.9%, higher than the 0.55% 3-year surveillance threshold, see Table 2C), as was recommended in 2012 guidelines. Only after 2 negative cotests can the screening interval can be safely extended to 3 years because the 5-year CIN 3+ risk drops to 0.29% (see Table 2C). Data after 3 negative cotests continue to support a 3-year interval, although data are sparse and recommendations may change in the future as more data accrue (See Section J.4 main article for discussion).

Prior treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 increases risk. After treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, most treated patients (82.3%, in total 4,695) have a negative HPV test result on the first follow-up screening, with immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risks of 0.34% and 2.0% leading to 1-year follow-up (see Table 5A). Any abnormality on any follow-up test leads to re-referral to colposcopy, including HPV-negative ASC-US/LSIL cytology, HPV-negative high-grade cytology, and all HPV-positive results (see Table 5A). Two negative HPV tests (HPV negative × 1 followed by HPV negative in Table 5B) after a treated CIN 2 or CIN 3 will give a 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.91% resulting in 1-year follow-up (see Table 5B). Observing one more negative HPV test result decreases this risk to 0.44%, which leads to 3-year follow-up (see Table 5B). Results are similar when cotesting is considered rather than primary HPV testing. Even after 3 negative HPV tests or cotests, risks remain well above the 0.15% 5-year CIN 3+ risk threshold needed to return to screening at 5-year intervals, leading to a recommendation of continued follow-up at 3-year intervals.

E.1 Clinical Action Thresholds Leading to Recommendation of Surveillance

Introduction

Surveillance is defined as follow-up testing at a shorter interval than that currently recommended for routine screening with either HPV primary testing or cotesting (5 years). Surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk of CIN 3+ based on current test results and screening history is higher than the risk for the general screening population, but lower than the risk at which colposcopy is recommended. Unlike colposcopy and treatment, which are performed as soon as possible after a qualifying abnormal result, surveillance entails retesting at intervals of 1 to less than 5 years. Therefore, we used the 5-year risk of CIN 3+ as the estimated risk level when assigning surveillance Clinical Action Thresholds. Surveillance intervals are defined in Figure 1 and explained in detail hereinafter. Surveillance thresholds are based on the principle of equal management for equal risks and were designed to support current screening and surveillance recommendations, which are generally accepted as a reasonable balance of benefits and harms. In the 2012 guidelines, intervals of 1 and 3 years were used for surveillance, with return to routine HPV-based screening at 5 years. Because clinicians and patients are familiar with these intervals, and review of evidence did not reveal a compelling reason to change these intervals, these intervals are retained. Note that for observation in very high-risk patients (e.g. untreated CIN2, AIS treated with conization) colposcopy and repeat testing at 6-month intervals is recommended.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of less than 0.15% based on past history and current test results, return to routine screening at 5-year intervals using HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, this Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative HPV-based screening (HPV testing or cotesting) in the general population (see Table 1 A in Egemen et al) for whom national guidelines recommend a 5-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks in the KPNC database after a negative HPV test and cotest are 0.14% (95% CI = 0.13%–0.15%) and 0.12% (95% CI = 0.12%–0.13%), respectively. Note that cytology alone is never recommended at 5-year intervals.

Cytology-negative, HPV-positive women 30 years and older — risk and follow-up: Women negative by both tests have a "less than 1 in 1,000 risk of having CIN 2+" and "should not be rescreened before 3 years". In screened populations, the prevalence data showed "6.5%, and 58% of the HPV-positive women had a concurrent negative cytology", and the risk of undetected CIN 2+ in cytology-negative, HPV-positive women ranged "from 2.4% to 5.1%". For comparison, "CIN 2+ was detected at enrollment colposcopy in 10.2% of women of unknown HPV status with ASC-US in ALTS". Natural history data indicate "60% of HPV-positive women became HPV negative after a median follow-up of 6 months". Accordingly, "repeat cytology and HPV testing at 12 months seems to be the best management approach", with persistently HPV-positive women on repeat testing who "should undergo colposcopy, even if cytology negative", while those negative on both tests "can be rescreened in 3 years".

Use of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to cytology for cervical cancer screening in women 30 years and older — algorithmic management is specified as follows: Under "Cytology Negative", "HPV (-)" leads to "Routine Screening Not before 3 years", while "HPV (+)" leads to "Repeat BOTH Tests @ 12 mos". After repeating both tests, "Both Negative" proceeds to "Routine Screening @ 3 years", "Cytology Negative HPV (+)" proceeds to "Colposcopy", and "Cytology Abnormal Any HPV Result" proceeds to "Colposcopy". For "Cytology ASCUS or Greater", the pathway is to "Manage per ASCCP Guideline". The footnote clarifies to "test only for high-risk (oncogenic) types of HPV".

Clarification to recommendation for observation of CIN 2 — both human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone and cotesting are acceptable options for patients undergoing observation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, and either observation or treatment is acceptable provided the squamocolumnar junction is fully visualized and CIN 2+ or ungraded CIN is not identified on endocervical sampling. For patients 25 years or older, observation includes colposcopy and HPV-based testing at 6-month intervals for up to 2 years. If during surveillance, all evaluations demonstrate less than CIN 2 histology and either less than ASC-H cytology (using cotesting) or HPV negative if using HPV testing alone on 2 successive occasions, 6 months apart, subsequent surveillance should occur at 1 year after the second evaluation and use HPV-based testing. If negative on 3 consecutive annual surveillance tests, proceed to long-term surveillance. If CIN 2 remains present for a 2-year period, treatment is recommended.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management — after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for abnormal screening results when there are no known prior HPV test results are presented with recommended actions. For Unknown HPV-positive HSIL+, CIN 3+ immediate risk is 49 and CIN 3+ 5-year risk is 53 with Colposcopy/treatment. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-H, risks are 26 immediate and 35 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive LSIL, risks are 4.3 immediate and 6.9 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-US, risks are 4.8 immediate and 7.3 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive NILM, risks are 2.1 immediate and 4.8 at 5 years with 1-y follow-up. For Unknown HPV-negative NILM, risks are 0.04 immediate and 0.12 at 5 years with 5-y follow-up. Notes specify that HPV-negative ASC-H and AGC are referred to colposcopy although they do not exceed the 4% immediate colposcopy threshold, and that HPV-negative HSIL+ is seen in only 0.01% of the population with an immediate risk of 25%; HPV-positive "ALL" are excluded from the table to avoid duplication.

ASCCP risk-based management — clinical actions and data source: The 2019 consensus guidelines recommend 1 of 6 clinical actions based on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+), explicitly including 1-year surveillance, 3-year surveillance, and 5-year return to regular screening, with treatment and colposcopy/biopsy options. Using screening data from 2003 to 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 1.5 million individuals aged 25 to 65 years underwent human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology co-testing scheduled every 3 years, and the study estimated immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for combinations of current results with past screening and colposcopy/biopsy history; risk tables are presented for scenarios common in clinical practice.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — patients younger than 25 years, initial management after an abnormal screening test result: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL], atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude HSIL [ASC-H], atypical glandular cells [AGC], adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e., histologic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL; CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g., repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher).

ASCCP risk estimation cohorts and follow-up definitions (Table 2) detail sample sizes, age ranges, and follow-up durations across scenarios. Examples include Primary cytology (21–24) with n 203,877, median follow-up 0 (0–0.25), and n with > 5-y follow-up 4,680; Postcolposcopy at colposcopy (25–65) with n 89,489, median follow-up 1.5 (0–5.2), and n with > 5-y follow-up 22,557; Posttreatment first visit (25–65) with n 15,105, median follow-up 1.3 (0–4.4), and n with > 5-y follow-up 3,259; and Posttreatment third visit (25–65) with n 5,923, median follow-up 1.2 (0–3.3), and n with > 5-y follow-up 920. Age ranges are at the time of the initial precolposcopy screen, and follow-up time is defined as time (in years) until CIN 2+ detection (or repeat CIN 2+ for posttreatment scenarios), or if CIN 2+ was never detected, time until the last < CIN 2 colpo, cotest negative, or HPV negative/ASC-US.

Risks were estimated for a given testing round, and beginning with the second round risks informed precolposcopy management after immediately prior results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL; risk estimates were not provided for other prior abnormal results such as HPV positive/ASC-US or HPV positive/LSIL.

Prior risk was dichotomized by referral after lower-grade abnormalities (HPV positive/NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL) versus high-grade cytology (ASC-H, AGC, or HSIL+). Risk estimates were used to determine management immediately after the < CIN 2 colposcopy and at the first postcolposcopy follow-up, and second and third surveillance visits determined when multiple negative HPV or cotests results could safely extend testing intervals.

ASCCP 2019 unsatisfactory cytology — management recommendations state: "For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII)". "Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII)". "Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII)". "For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII)". "If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII)". Figure 5 operationalizes this via "No HPV or unknown result (any age)", "HPV Negative (age ≥ 25 years)", and "HPV Positive (unknown genotype) (age ≥ 25 years)" leading to "Repeat Age-based Screening after 2 to 4 months", while "HPV 16 or 18 Positive" goes to colposcopy; the caption clarifies that "unknown genotype" includes both scenarios described.

### Response to letter to the editor regarding: 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^28181bb2]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — revised Figure 2 legend for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) outlines risk-based actions. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk = 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV test or cotest performed for the second postcolposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second postcolposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASC-US or HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion results. Note similar management would be recommended for any minimally abnormal test result less severe than atypical squamous cells–cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. NA indicates not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

Highlights include that colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk; if a patient has a minimally abnormal test result that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended; referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit; and treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.

Box 1 — essential changes from prior management guidelines emphasize that recommendations are based on risk, not results, with recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by current results and past history; colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients, with repeat human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (eg, HPV-positive, low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest); and guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (ie, treatment without colposcopic biopsy), noting expedited treatment was an option for patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology in the 2012 guidelines and that this guidance is now better defined. Additionally, the new consensus guidelines follow a risk-based approach and recommend consideration of a patient's screening history along with current test results to guide decision making.

ASCCP risk-based management — exceptions to colposcopy threshold: For patients with ASC-H cytology, colposcopy is recommended regardless of HPV result (AII). In the KPNC data, HPV-positive ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 26% and a cancer risk of 0.92%, whereas HPV-negative ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 3.4%, but an immediate cancer risk of 0.69%, and the working group recommended colposcopy for all patients with ASC-H, regardless of HPV test results. For patients with HPV 18–positive NILM, colposcopy is recommended (AII) (note colposcopy is also recommended for HPV 16–positive NILM), as HPV 18–positive NILM had a 3.0% prevalent CIN 3+ risk with cancer risk 0.2% immediately and 0.56% at 5 years; given the elevated cancer risk, referral to colposcopy is recommended.

The HPV–negative ASC-US is also a reassuring history result (see Table 2A). A negative cotest after HPV-negative ASC-US warrants return to screening at 5-year intervals (5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.14%, which is less than the 0.15% 5-year surveillance threshold). Minor abnormalities (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US and HPV-positive LSIL) after HPV-negative ASC-US are recommended to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 2A). Though higher risk than HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL is less risky than previously thought, allowing minor abnormalities after HPV-negative LSIL (i.e. HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM) to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 2B). In addition, HPV-negative ASC-US and HPV-negative LSIL after HPV-positive NILM are recommended to have a deferred management of 1-year surveillance (see Table 2C).

Colposcopy performed for low-grade abnormalities, which confirms the absence of CIN 2+ reduces risk. After a colposcopic examination performed for low-grade abnormalities (e.g.; HPV-positive NILM × 2, HPV-positive ASC-US, or HPV-positive LSIL) at which CIN 1 or less was confirmed via biopsy, minor abnormalities (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US and HPV-positive LSIL) found on the first follow-up test are recommended to be followed in 1 year, rather than proceed immediately to colposcopy (see Table 4A). Because all repeat abnormalities were referred back to colposcopy at KPNC, we cannot estimate risks for additional rounds of follow-up. Therefore, the 2019 guidelines recommend referral for colposcopy for abnormal results occurring on subsequent rounds of follow-up testing.

Guideline: For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with an estimated immediate risk of CIN 3+ 25% or greater and less than 60% based on history and current results, treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation or histologic evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy are both acceptable (AII).

Rationale: The 2012 guidelines allow treatment without biopsy-proven histologic confirmation include patients who have HSIL cytology independent of HPV status. In the KPNC data set, the 25% to 59% risks strata includes patients with the following results and immediate CIN 2+/CIN 3+ risks, respectively: (a) HPV-negative HSIL cytology: 47%/25%; (b) HPV-positive ASC-H cytology: 50%/26%; (c) HPV-positive AGC (all categories): 40%/26%; and (d) HPV-positive HSIL cytology: 77%/49%. Using this threshold, 2.8 patients will undergo excisional procedures for every CIN 3+ treated.

J. SURVEILLANCE AFTER ABNORMALITIES

J.1 Guidance for Specific Tests and Testing Intervals When Managing Abnormal Results

Guideline: After abnormal cervical cancer screening test results for patients 25 years or older, colposcopic biopsy results, or treatment of histologic HSIL, surveillance with either HPV testing alone or cotesting is preferred (AI). Surveillance with cervical cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible (CIII). Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when 1-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting, and annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting (AII). Cytology should be used for patients younger than 25 years, with transition to HPV-based testing at 25 years or older (AII).

Rationale: Individuals treated for histologic HSIL or with a recent abnormal screening test result have an elevated risk of cervical precancer warranting close follow-up. HPV testing and cotesting are more sensitive than cytology alone in detecting CIN 2+ in both the postcolposcopy and posttreatment settings. – As there is marginal difference between cotesting and HPV testing alone in detection of recurrent or persistent CIN 2+, either test may be used for surveillance. Because cytology is less sensitive than HPV or cotesting, cytology must be performed more frequently to achieve similar sensitivity for the detection of CIN 3+. For example, in cases of low-grade cytology followed by colposcopy/biopsy less than CIN 2, follow-up testing at 1 year is recommended. If the follow-up test is an HPV test with negative results, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.51%, consistent with a 3-year return. However, if the follow-up test is cytology only with negative results, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 1.5%, consistent with a 1-year return.

From 2003 to 2009, conventional cytology specimens were manually reviewed after processing by the BD FocalPoint Slide Profiler (BD Diagnostics, Burlington, NC) primary screening and directed quality control system, which automatically scores and sorts slides based on the probability of squamous abnormalities. In 2009, the KPNC transitioned to liquid-based cytology using BD SurePath (BD Diagnostics). Cytology results were reported according to the 2001 Bethesda systemas shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Cytology Results According to the Bethesda System

Patients with cytologic abnormalities were referred to colposcopy per Kaiser guidelines, which closely resembled US consensus recommendations. However, those without abnormalities, specifically patients who tested HPV negative/NILM (cotest negative) were asked to return for testing in 3 years. We note that this differs from the 5-year testing interval that has been recommended nationally since 2012. However, sensitivity analyses restricting to patients who returned from a negative cotest in 5 or more years had risk estimates not much different from those at 3 years. Patients with HPV-negative/ASC-US or HPV-positive/NILM results were monitored annually and referred to colposcopy for either a subsequent abnormal cytology result or HPV positivity (after 2005).

Histopathology results were reported in order of increasing severity as normal, CIN grades 1, 2, and 3, AIS, or cancer. We use the terms < CIN 2 or < CIN 3 to indicate histopathology results less severe than CIN 2 or CIN 3, respectively. Similarly, the terms CIN 2+ or CIN 3+ will refer to histopathology results at least as severe as CIN 2 or CIN 3, respectively.

Three Distinct Clinical Scenarios

Using the KPNC and PaP studies, we created analytic cohorts to address each round of testing in the following clinical scenarios: (1) prior to colposcopic (precolposcopy) referral, (2) after colposcopic findings of < CIN 2 histopathology (postcolposcopy), and (3) after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 histopathology (posttreatment) (see Table 2). The goal was to develop risk-based management for most of the (relatively) common decision points that occur in cervical screening programs including the management of abnormalities.

Management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) — initial follow-up, HPV triage, and post-colposcopy care are specified with graded recommendations. Cytological testing should be performed at 6-month intervals until 2 consecutive "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy" results are obtained (AII), and colposcopy is recommended for women with ASC-US or greater cytological abnormality on a repeat test (AII); after 2 repeat negatives, women can return to routine cytological screening (AII). HPV DNA testing is presented as "Preferred if liquid-based cytology or co-collection available", with "HPV Positive* (managed in same manner as women with LSIL)". When colposcopy is used, "Endocervical sampling [is] preferred in women with no lesions, and those with unsatisfactory colposcopy", and if CIN is not identified, repeat cytology at 12 months is recommended (BIII); the algorithm lists "Cytology @ 6 to 12 mos OR HPV DNA Testing @ 12 mos", proceeding to "Repeat Colposcopy" for " ≥ ASC or HPV (+)" and to "Routine Screening" if "Negative", while cases with "CIN" are to "Manage per ASCCP Guideline". Because of overtreatment concerns, "the routine use of diagnostic excisional procedures such as the loop electrosurgical excision is unacceptable for women with an initial ASC-US in the absence of histologically diagnosed CIN 2,3. (EII)".

Atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude high-grade (ASC-H) management — The recommended management of women with ASC-H is referral for colposcopic evaluation (AII). In women in whom cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2,3) is not identified, follow-up with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing at 12 months or cytological testing at 6 months and 12 months is acceptable (CIII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for HPV DNA or who are found to have ASC-US or greater on their repeat cytological tests (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AI). If CIN 2,3 is identified, manage per ASCCP Guideline.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^1cf092c4]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and clinical management in the KPNC describe testing platforms and intervals: Since 2001, HPV testing was used to triage atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US); beginning in 2013, patients 30 years and older underwent concurrent HPV and cytology cotests, and in 2013 cotesting was extended to ages 25–29 years. Clinical HPV testing used Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and reported infection with any of the 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 59, and 68). From 2003 to 2009, cytology used the BD FocalPoint Slide Profiler, transitioning in 2009 to liquid-based cytology using BD SurePath, with results reported according to the 2001 Bethesda system. Patients who tested HPV negative/NILM were asked to return for testing in 3 years versus the 5-year testing interval recommended nationally since 2012, and sensitivity analyses restricting to those returning in 5 or more years had risk estimates not much different from 3 years. Patients with HPV-negative/ASC-US or HPV-positive/NILM were monitored annually and referred to colposcopy for a subsequent abnormal cytology result or HPV positivity (after 2005). Histopathology results were ordered as normal, CIN stages 1, 2, and 3, AIS, or cancer, with < CIN 2 or < CIN 3 indicating results less severe than those thresholds and CIN 2+ or CIN 3+ indicating at least as severe as those thresholds.

ASCCP risk-based management — initial HPV-based screening risks and intervals: At the initial HPV-based screen for patients new to HPV testing in KPNC aged 25–65 years, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is 0.45%. At the first visit, 1,546,262 people were screened and 92% had a primary HPV-negative result; for those with a negative screen, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.14%, and a 5-year screening interval is recommended. Among the 8% initially HPV-positive, immediate CIN 3+ risk was 2.1% for HPV-positive NILM, 4.3% for HPV-positive ASC-US, 4.9% for HPV-positive LSIL, and 49% for HPV-positive HSIL.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — reflex triage for positive HPV tests and HPV16/18 actions: All positive HPV screening tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen, HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer so additional evaluation is necessary even when cytology results are negative, and if HPV 16 or 18 testing is positive and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy.

ASCCP 2019 HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) follow-up — immediate and 5-year cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risks with management are tabulated for current HPV and cytology results obtained during surveillance. Patients who are under surveillance after a prior HPV-negative LSIL test result can be managed by Table 28b. For HPV-negative NILM, CIN 3+ 5-y risk is 0.40 with recommended 3-y follow-up and recommendation confidence score 57. For HPV-negative ASC-US and LSIL, CIN 3+ 5-y risks are 4.0 and 4.4 with recommended 1-y follow-up and recommendation confidence scores 100 and 96. For HPV-positive NILM, CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks are 4.0 and 8.6 with recommended 1-y follow-up. For HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks are 5.3 and 6.9, and 5.0 and 7.9, respectively, with recommended Colposcopy. Special situations include HPV-positive ASC-H with CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks of 50 and 50 managed with Colposcopy and HPV-positive HSIL+ with risks 33 and 33 managed with Colposcopy/treatment. After Cotest negative ×2, CIN 3+ 5-y risk is 0.27 with recommended 3-y follow-up. In the 2012 guidelines, repeat cotesting at 3 years was recommended for HPV-negative NILM after HPV-negative LSIL and this recommendation does not change; however, HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM after HPV-negative LSIL lead to 1-year surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy. Evaluation of return intervals indicates that 2 negative cotests after HPV-negative LSIL do not provide enough reassurance to return to 5-year regular screening.

### Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection-STI treatment… [^d55aed96]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients should be provided a copy of their test results; those with normal results should be provided information on follow-up visits and the importance of continued cervical cancer screening, if applicable. Those with abnormal screening tests should be managed per published guidelines. National consensus guidelines are available for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests. Follow-Up of Abnormal Cytology and Human Papillomavirus Test Results If the result of the cytology is abnormal, follow-up care should be provided according to the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines for Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests and Cancer Precursors. Clinics that serve clients who might have difficulty adhering to follow-up recommendations and for whom linkage to care is unlikely should consider offering in-house colposcopy and biopsy services.
- Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk.
- If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended.
- Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
- Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.
- If a patient has a high-grade cytology result and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first.
- If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test, then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first.
- When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^fc0afb5f]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Surveillance after abnormalities — test modality and intervals: After abnormal cervical cancer screening test results, colposcopic biopsy results, or treatment of histologic HSIL, surveillance with either HPV testing alone or cotesting is preferred (AII), and cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible (CIII). Because cytology is less sensitive than HPV or cotesting, cytology must be performed more frequently, with cytology recommended at 6-month intervals when 1-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting and annually when 3-year intervals are recommended; cytology should be used for patients younger than 25 years, with transition to HPV-based testing at 25 years or older (AII). As an example of risk-based follow-up, after low-grade cytology followed by colposcopy/biopsy less than CIN 2, if the follow-up HPV test is negative the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 0.51% (consistent with a 3-year return), whereas if the follow-up test is cytology only and negative the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is 1.5% (consistent with a 1-year return).

K. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Introduction: Guidelines described previously apply to the average risk individual with an intact cervix and are based primarily on screening and management data from patients aged 25 to 65 years in the KPNC population. However, several populations require special management considerations. Management of patients who are younger than 25 years, pregnant, immunosuppressed, posthysterectomy, and older than 65 years are detailed hereinafter.

K.1 Management of Patients Younger Than 25 Years

In the 2012 guidelines, patients aged 21 to 24 years were considered to be a special population. In the current guidelines, the consensus was to reference this group as "patients younger than 25 years".

Initial Management After an Abnormal Screening Test Result

Guideline: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results of LSIL, ASC-US HPV-positive, or ASC-US without HPV testing, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (HSIL, ASC-H, AGC, AIS) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex HPV testing for ASC-US is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e. histologic LSIL [CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g. repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher). Clinicians should switch to using risk estimates when patients reach the age of 25 years (see Figures 12, 13).

ASCCP post-treatment CIN 2 or CIN 3 — immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risk by current results (Table 5A) shows that for history CIN 2 or 3 (treated) with HPV-negative and NILM cytology, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 0.03 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 1.7 with 1-y follow-up and recommendation confidence score 100; for HPV-positive with NILM, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 5.8 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 12 with Colposcopy and confidence 86; for HPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 10 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 21 with Colposcopy and confidence 100; and for HPV-positive High grade, CIN 3+ immediate risk, % is 53 and CIN 3+ 5-y risk, % is 63 with Colposcopy/treatment. The text states that "all of the HPV-positive results lead to immediate referral back to repeat colposcopy", whereas HPV-negative NILM and HPV-negative ASC-US/LSIL have deferred "1-year surveillance", and that to maximize safety "management is recommended based on treated CIN 3"; patients "being followed after a treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 can be managed by Table 5A".

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^e6784a40]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Recommended management of women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) states that colposcopy is recommended for managing women with LSIL, except in special populations (AII). Endocervical sampling is preferred for nonpregnant women in whom no lesions are identified (BII) and for those with an unsatisfactory colposcopy (AII), but is acceptable for those with a satisfactory colposcopy and a lesion identified in the transformation zone (CII). After colposcopy when cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is not identified, acceptable options are testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) at 12 months or repeat cervical cytology at 6 and 12 months (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AII). If the HPV DNA test is positive or repeat cytology is ASC-US or greater, colposcopy is recommended (AII). Women with CIN should be managed according to the 2006 Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, and in the absence of histologically confirmed CIN, neither excisional nor ablative procedures are acceptable for the initial management of LSIL (EII).

### Role of screening history in clinical meaning and optimal management of positive cervical screening results [^b3fc1f43]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical cancer is caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. US consensus management guidelines for a positive cervical screening result typically focus on the current screening result only. A negative testing history may alter risk of the following positive screening results, caused by a new HPV infection, and therefore its optimal management.

Methods

Women ages 30years and older were screened with triennial HPV and cytology co-testing at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2003 to 2014. We estimated the subsequent 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or more severe diagnoses (CIN3+) in a cohort of 1 156 387 women following abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or worse) cytology and/or positive HPV testing, when the test result followed 0 (n = 990 013), 1 (n = 543 986), 2 (n = 245 974), or 3 (n = 79 946) consecutive negative co-test(s). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Following 0–3 successive negative co-tests, 5-year CIN3+ risks following a positive HPV test decreased progressively from 7.2% (95% CI = 7.0% to 7.4%) to 1.5% (95% CI = 0.7% to 3.4%) (Ptrend < .001). Similarly, risks following an abnormal (ASC-US or worse) cytology result decreased from 6.6% (95% CI = 6.4% to 6.9%) to 1.1% (95% CI = 0.5% to 2.3%) (Ptrend < .001). Risks following low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the risk threshold for referral to colposcopy in the United States, decreased from 5.2% (95% CI = 4.7% to 5.7%) to 0.9% (95% CI = 0.2% to 4.3%). Risks following high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or more severe, a specific marker for the presence of precancerous lesions, decreased from 50.0% (95% CI = 47.5% to 52.5%) to 10.0% (95% CI = 2.6% to 34.4%).

Conclusions

Following one or more sequential antecedent, documented negative co-tests or HPV tests, women with HPV-positive ASC-US or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion might have sufficiently low CIN3+ risk that they do not need colposcopy referral and might instead undergo 6-12-month surveillance for evidence of higher risk before being referred to colposcopy.

### 2001 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities [^ab8d4aae]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer precursors.

Participants

A panel of 121 experts in the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer precursors, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, were invited to participate in a consensus conference sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP).

Evidence and Consensus Process

Guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities were developed through a multistep process. Starting 6 months before the conference, working groups developed draft management guidelines based on formal literature reviews of English-language articles published in 1988–2001, as well as input from the professional community at large, obtained using interactive Internet-based bulletin boards. On September 6–8, 2001, the ASCCP Consensus Conference was held in Bethesda, Md. Guidelines with supporting evidence were presented and underwent discussion, revision, and voting.

Conclusions

Management of women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) depends on whether the Papanicolaou test is subcategorized as of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or as cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H). Women with ASC-US should be managed using a program of 2 repeat cytology tests, immediate colposcopy, or DNA testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Testing for HPV DNA is the preferred approach when liquid-based cytology is used for screening. In most instances, women with ASC-H, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL, and atypical glandular cells should be referred for immediate colposcopic evaluation.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^2fbba565]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

ASC-US general management — women older than 20 years: A program that includes testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), repeat cervical cytological testing, or colposcopy are all acceptable methods for managing women older than 20 years with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (AI). When liquid-based cytology is used, or when co-collection for HPV DNA testing can be done, reflex HPV DNA testing is the preferred approach (AI). Women with ASC-US who are HPV DNA negative can be followed up with repeat cytological testing at 12 months (BII). Women who have HPV DNA positive should be managed in the same fashion as women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and be referred for colposcopic evaluation (AII). Endocervical sampling is preferred for women in whom no lesions are identified (BII) and those with an unsatisfactory colposcopy (AII) but is acceptable for women with a satisfactory colposcopy and a lesion identified in the transformation zone (CII). Acceptable postcolposcopy management options when CIN is not identified are HPV DNA testing at 12 months and repeat cytological testing at 6 and 12 months (BII), and it is recommended that HPV DNA testing not be performed at intervals less than 12 months (EIII).

Approaches to managing women with ASC-US: Clinical data from ALTS and other studies have demonstrated that 2 repeat cytological examinations performed at 6-month intervals, testing for HPV, and a single colposcopic examination are all safe and effective approaches, and the 2001 Consensus Guidelines recognized that all 3 approaches were acceptable; a meta-analysis performed in 2004 reported that the pooled estimate of the sensitivity of HPV testing for detecting women with CIN 2,3 is considerably higher than that of a single repeat cytology, and in ALTS repeating cytology twice at 6-month intervals detected 95% of CIN 3 lesions using an ASC-US threshold for colposcopy and referred 67% of the women to colposcopy, while for comparison a single HPV test identified 92% of CIN 3 lesions.

ASCCP risk-based management — when CIN 2+ is not identified after ASC-H or HSIL cytology allows review of cytology, histology, and colposcopy; if HSIL cytology with histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less, either immediate diagnostic excision or observation with HPV-based testing and colposcopy at 1 year is acceptable if colposcopy fully visualizes the squamocolumnar junction and lesion limits and endocervical sampling, if collected, is less than CIN 2. For ASC-H with complete colposcopic visualization and negative endocervical sampling, observation at 1 year with HPV-based testing is recommended and a diagnostic excisional procedure is not recommended. If observation is elected and all tests are negative at the 1‑year visit, repeat HPV-based testing is recommended in 1 year; a diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended for HSIL cytology at the 1‑ or 2‑year visit or ASC‑H persisting at 2 years.

ASCCP risk-based management example (HPV-positive ASC-US) — initial screening shows Immediate CIN3+ Risk = 4.5% with management of Colposcopy; if colposcopic biopsy result is < CIN2, the 5-year CIN3+ risk is 2.9% and management is 1-year follow-up; at first follow-up surveillance with HPV-positive ASC-US, Immediate CIN3+ Risk = 3.1% and management is 1-year follow-up; at second follow-up surveillance, HPV-negative NILM leads to 5-year CIN3+ Risk = NA with management of 3-year follow-up, whereas HPV-positive ASC-US yields Risk = NA with management of Colposcopy; NA indicates not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

H.2 Exceptions to Colposcopy Threshold

Guideline: For patients with ASC-H cytology, colposcopy is recommended regardless of HPV result (AII).

Rationale: In the KPNC data, HPV-negative ASC-H and HPV-positive ASC-H had very different CIN 3+ rates, but similar cancer rates. The HPV–positive ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 26% and a cancer risk of 0.92%, whereas HPV-negative ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 3.4%, but an immediate cancer risk of 0.69%. Because the immediate cancer risk for ASC-H is disproportionately high compared with the CIN 3+ risk, the working group carried forward the 2012 recommendations and recommended colposcopy for all patients with ASC-H, regardless of HPV test results.

Guideline: For patients with HPV 18–positive NILM, colposcopy is recommended (AII). (Note colposcopy is also recommended for HPV 16–positive NILM, repeated here for clarity.)

Rationale: HPV 18–positive NILM had a 3.0% prevalent CIN 3+ risk, less than the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy. However, HPV 18–positive NILM had a disproportionately high cancer risk compared with other results: 0.2% immediately and 0.56% at 5 years. This suggests that HPV 18-related CIN 3 or AIS may be difficult to diagnose and/or more apt to rapidly progress from precancer to cancer. The elevated cancer prevalence with HPV 18 positivity has been previously noted, and HPV 18 is one of the most common HPV types found in invasive cervical cancers. Given the elevated cancer risk, referral to colposcopy is recommended.

Guideline: Colposcopy should be performed after 2 consecutive unsatisfactory screening tests (CIII).

Rationale: No new evidence was found, so the 2012 guideline was carried forward.

### Enduring consensus guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management: introduction to the scope and process [^3e886ebe]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer screening aims at reducing cervical cancer risk by detecting cancer precursors; successfully treating these lesions prevents cervical cancer. For decades, cervical cancer screening was based on cervical cytology. Recently, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been integrated into screening and management approaches due to its high sensitivity and the strong, long-term reassurance of a low cancer risk provided by a negative test. Human papillomavirus-based screening has been proven to be superior to cytology screening for detection of cervical precancer and the reduction of cancer incidence in large international trials and observational studies. However, to achieve successful cervical cancer prevention, completion of multiple steps including triage, colposcopy, and treatment are necessary. The goal of this multistep process is to provide reassurance to most individuals that the risk of cancer is low while identifying the small proportion of individuals at high risk who need treatment.

In the United States, screening and management recommendations are developed by various organizations (Figure 1). Screening guidelines have been developed independently by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) and have been widely adopted. After a positive screening result, the most current management recommendations are covered by the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines (referred to hereafter as 2019 consensus guidelines)and the ASCCP colposcopy standards. Previously, major guidelines were updated every 7–10 years through a consensus process. However, the field of cervical cancer prevention is changing rapidly, creating a need to quickly integrate new approaches into clinical guidelines. For example, since publication of the 2019 consensus management guidelines, 2 new tests that may have a role in managing positive screening result have received regulatory approval. To address this need, the Enduring Consensus Cervical Cancer Screening and Management Guidelines (referred to hereafter as Enduring Guidelines) effort was created as a standing committee to continuously evolve the risk-based process established for the 2019 consensus management guidelines and, after this process, assess new technologies and studies for potential incorporation into the management guidelines.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1503ac56]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

§ Negative HPV test or cotest (HPV plus Pap test) results only reduce risk sufficiently to defer colposcopy if performed for screening purposes within the last 5 years. Colposcopy is still warranted if negative HPV test or cotest results occurred in the context of surveillance for a previous abnormal result.

¶ Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years. Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared decision-making.

The following are highlights of the new management guidelines:

Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk. º If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e. negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV positive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or cotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results would not similarly reduce risk). º Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients. º If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result (i.e. HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years (i.e. rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.
When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management. º Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone. º HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal. º HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy. º If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test is normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.
HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result. º Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.
After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or severe dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least 25 years. º Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, and 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. º After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance includes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or cotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone. º Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after the initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age 65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the surveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.

Even after accounting for extra ASC-US in the CDC NBCCEDP well-screened population (from including HPV triage of ASC-US results), the CDC NBCCEDP well-screened population was substantially more likely to be HPV positive (10% of all patients after excluding ASC-US) and cytology positive (4.5% of all patients after excluding ASC-US) than KPNC (6.4% HPV positive and 2.6% cytology positive after excluding ASC-US). As a result, the overall immediate CIN 3+ risk in the CDC NBCCEDP well-screened population was greater than that of KPNC (0.78% vs 0.46%, p < .001). However, once stratified by HPV and cytology results, risks for the well-screened population of the CDC NBCCEDP were largely similar to that of KPNC (O/Es 0.91–1.44) and fell within the bounds of the recommended management. The lone exception was HPV negative/AGC (O/E = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.74–4.28) for which the risks implied a 1-year return (KPNC risks also imply a 1-year return but colposcopy/biopsy was recommended because of elevated cancer risks).

Atypical endocervical, endometrial, or glandular cells not otherwise specified (NOS) — postcolposcopy follow-up when HPV status is known: For women without CIN 2,3 or glandular neoplasia identified histologically, the recommended management is to repeat cytological testing combined with HPV DNA testing at 6 months if HPV DNA positive and at 12 months if HPV DNA negative (CII). Referral to colposcopy is recommended for women who subsequently test positive for high-risk (oncogenic) HPV DNA or who are found to have atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or greater on repeat cytology; if both tests are negative, women can return to routine cytological testing (BII).

ASC-US triage approach — reflex HPV testing preference and postcolposcopy follow-up performance: Although all 3 management approaches are considered acceptable for managing women with ASC-US, "reflex" HPV testing is preferred, with reflex testing defined as testing either the original liquid-based cytology residual specimen or a separate sample co-collected at the initial screening visit; this approach spares 40% to 60% of women from undergoing colposcopy and cost-effectiveness analyses have shown that reflex HPV testing is less expensive and more effective at detecting CIN 2,3 than other strategies. Because a single colposcopic examination can miss significant lesions, ALTS found that HPV testing performed 12 months after the initial colposcopy detected 27% of women with CIN 2,3 and resulted in 55% undergoing a second colposcopy, whereas two repeat cytology examinations at 6-month intervals detected 88% of missed cases and required that 64% undergo a second colposcopy; combining cytology with HPV testing did not increase sensitivity and reduced specificity.

New 2019 principles — testing and risk foundation — HPV-based testing is the basis for risk estimation and refers to use of either primary HPV testing alone or HPV testing in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting). Characteristics of HPV infections, including HPV type and the duration of infection, determine a patient's risk of CIN 3+. Although cytology has high specificity, it has lower sensitivity and lower negative predictive value than HPV testing and reduced utility for long-term risk prediction, and risk estimates underlying the 2019 management guidelines are based on HPV DNA testing.

For HPV-positive cytology negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), colposcopy is recommended. If genotyping is positive for HPV 16, HPV 18, or both with ASC-US or LSIL, colposcopy is recommended. For HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL with negative screening results within the previous 5 yrs, repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology that is HPV 16 positive, expedited treatment is recommended; if HPV is untyped, positive for a genotype other than HPV 16, or negative with HSIL, colposcopy or expedited treatment is acceptable. Footnotes specify that negative HPV test or cotest results only defer colposcopy if from screening within the last 5 years and that expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening triage: When primary HPV screening is used, performance of an additional reflex triage test for all positive HPV tests regardless of genotype is preferred (CIII). If genotyping results are HPV 16 or HPV 18 positive and reflex triage testing from the same laboratory specimen is not feasible, referral for colposcopy before obtaining additional testing is acceptable (CIII), and if triage is not performed before colposcopy, collection of an additional triage test at the colposcopy visit is recommended (CIII). The US FDA approved the cobas HPV test in March 2014 and the Onclarity HPV test in April 2018 for primary HPV testing for screening for patients 25 years and older, and both these tests offer and are approved for partial HPV genotyping.

We considered genotyping results as a categorical variable with the following hierarchical levels: type 16 positive, else type 18 positive, and else positive for other high-risk types. An alternative grouping of genotyping that we explored used the following levels: type 16 positive; else type 18 positive; else type 45 positive; else positive for 31, 33, 52, or 58; and else positive for 35, 39, 51, 56, 59, 66, or 68. We calculated survey weights (i.e. as the inverse of sampling fractions) for each patient in the PaP cohort with genotyping results to reconstitute the larger KPNC first and second rounds of testing in the precolposcopy clinical scenario. We then estimated genotype-specific CIN 3+ risks by applying extensions of the prevalence-incidence model for survey data.

We did not use variables outside of current HPV and cytology results, current genotyping results, and history of screening/histopathology results in risk estimation. Other cofactors, including age, race, hormonal contraceptives use, smoking, and income, had minimal or no clinically important effects on CIN 3+ risk in the KPNC.

Defining Risk Thresholds for Clinical Management

Representatives from 19 organizations attended the initial guidelines meeting and convened 7 working groups (including treatment, colposcopy, and surveillance working groups) to determine the consensus clinical action thresholds used to define risk-based clinical management. The 6 clinical management options considered include 3 levels of immediate intervention as follows: (a) expedited treatment (i.e. without preceding colposcopy/biopsy) is preferred, (b) either treatment or colposcopy/biopsy is acceptable, (c) colposcopy/biopsy is recommended; 2 levels of shortened testing intervals as followed: (d) retest in 1 year, (e) retest in 3 years; or (f) continue with/return to routine testing in 5 years as per US Preventive Services Task Forceand American Cancer Society screening guidelines. The treatment working group defined 2 risk levels in which expedited treatment without colposcopy could be used. The surveillance working group limited the options of shortened testing intervals to the 1- and 3-year testing intervals used in the 2012 guidelines.

Colposcopy and histology

Women with screening results of ⩾LSIL, ASC-US/hrHPV positive or with persistent hrHPV positive were referred to colposcopy. All colposcopy examinations and management were performed using standard provincial guidelines at two study colposcopy clinics (Vancouver and Victoria). For the purposes of the trial, biopsies are required on all colpscopic procedures. Colposcopists were aware of cytology and hrHPV results to mirror the real-world management of lesions, and each participant referred to colposcopy received either a directed biopsy for lesions or endocervical curettage for histological analysis if no lesion seen. Histopathological interpretation of biopsies is conducted at two laboratories by study pathologists who are blinded to the screening results that led the patient to colposcopy.

Ethical issues

This study is being conducted in accordance with the Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans Tri-Council Policy Statement. Ethics approval has been obtained from appropriate local research ethics boards. International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register is ISRCTN79347302.

Statistical analysis

The analysis was based upon women recruited before January 2011 and reports results on the first round of screening. The data from the safety and intervention arms have been combined, because the first-round testing in the two arms is identical. 'Baseline screen' relates to the results of the first testing, including triage (Figures 2 and 3). 'Subsequent screen' relates to the testing and results for women who were recommended for subsequent testing at 12 months. 'Overall screen' relates to combined baseline screen and subsequent screen results. Detection rates were calculated from the number of screen-detected cervical lesions divided by the total number of women tested. Overall detection rates were calculated from the number of screen-detected cervical lesions per woman at both baseline and subsequent testing. Colposcopy referral rates were calculated in the same manner as detection rates. Not all women included in this analysis had received recommended colposcopy or 12-month subsequent testing, as the trial is still proceeding. In these cases, data were treated as being missing-at-random and rates were based upon available results. A Jack Knife approach was used to calculate rates and confidence intervals for the binomial count data and bootstrap simulation was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for the detection rate ratios and the number needed to treat. Chi-square testing was used to compare categorical demographic data and proportions are tested using a Z -test for proportions.

### European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening. second edition – summary document [^2f82694d]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

guidelines for management of screen-positive women

A woman with a high-grade cytological lesion, a repeated low-grade lesion or an equivocal cytology result and a positive HPV test should be referred for colposcopy. The role of colposcopy is to identify the location of the abnormal cells, to target taking of biopsies and to decide whether any treatment is required. Colposcopy should only be carried out by adequately trained health professionals.
Guidelines are provided for the management of ASC-US and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Guidelines for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are difficult to delineate because current evidence does not indicate that any method of management is optimal. Repeat cytology or colposcopy are acceptable options, but HPV testing as an initial management option is not sufficiently selective for all women with LSIL. However, HPV testing in older women with LSIL can be considered.
Quality assurance and collection of data on patient management are important elements of the management and follow-up of women referred with an abnormal cervical smear.
Colposcopy is sometimes proposed as an alternative screening method, but its specificity (and probably also its sensitivity) in primary screening is too low for this purpose.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^70f7c3fc]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

2006 consensus guidelines — HPV DNA testing and colposcopy safeguards — Triage using either human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or repeat cytology is generally not considered an acceptable option if 75% or more would be referred to colposcopy after testing. Laboratories should use only HPV tests that have been analytically and clinically validated with proven acceptable reproducibility, clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for cervical cancer and verified precancer (CIN 2,3). Testing should be restricted to high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types (i.e., 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 66), and testing for low-risk (nononcogenic) HPV types has no role; whenever "HPV testing" is referred to, it applies only to high-risk types. The document notes that a single colposcopic examination misses approximately one third of women with CIN 2,3.

Validation — ATHENA study comparisons similarly show higher baseline risks but mostly aligned management, with a noted HPV-positive/NILM exception: ATHENA had "greater overall immediate CIN 3+ risks (0.79% vs 0.46%, p < .001) and greater proportions of patients who tested HPV positive/NILM (7.7% vs 4.1%, p < .001) at the initial screen", and for HPV-positive NILM, risks "remained significantly higher than that of KPNC (O/Es from 1.3–2.2)". Management "largely agreed, with the exception of HPV positive/NILM (immediate CIN 3+ risk: 4.6%; O/E: 2.2 [95% CI 1.8–2.6])", and with genotyping, examples included "colposcopy referral for types 16 and 18 and a 1-year return for non-16/18 HPV-positive NILM results".

HPV-based testing: this term is used in this document to describe the use of either cotesting or primary HPV screening for surveillance after abnormalities. It does not apply to reflex HPV testing for triage of ASC-US cytology in this document. The HPV testing and positive HPV results discussed throughout this document refer to high-risk HPV types only.

Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST): this term refers to 2-tiered pathology criteria for evaluating histologic specimens obtained via colposcopic biopsy

Primary HPV testing: testing with HPV testing alone as a screening or surveillance test.

Reflex testing: this means that laboratories should perform a specific additional triage test in the setting of a positive screening test to inform the next steps in management. For example, an ASC-US cytology should trigger a reflex HPV test. New for these guidelines, a positive a positive primary HPV screening test should trigger both a reflex genotyping test (to determine the presence/absence of HPV 16/18 if that information is not included in the initial primary test result) and also a reflex cytology test to determine whether the patient would be a candidate for expedited management.

### Cervical colposcopy: indications and risk assessment… [^e289655b]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Long-term follow-up in a Swedish study of women older than 30 years uncovered no patients with CIN 2 or worse who cleared their high-risk HPV infections and a 100% progression to CIN 2 or worse over 13 years when high-risk HPV persisted. A high-quality study of 47, 000 women undergoing colposcopy found that a random biopsy in the setting of a normal colposcopic impression diagnosed 21% of the total CIN 2 and 19% of CIN 3 or worse, primarily in patients with HPV-16 and HPV-18. In 2012 the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology published guidelines for managing abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors that introduced a new concept: using patient risk for progression to cancer and chance of HPV clearance based on age and HPV subtype to guide clinical decision-making when referring for colposcopy and planning follow-up.

22 In the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health system database of 22, 625 patients with a history of HPV-positive/normal cytology results followed by subsequent HPV-negative/normal cytology results, the immediate risk of CIN 3 or worse was 0. 01%. Conversely, of 11, 990 patients with initial HPV-positive/normal cytology followed by subsequent HPV-positive/normal cytology results, 4. 1% had CIN 3 or worse on biopsy. 23 In the United States, 56% of cervical cancer diagnoses are made in inadequately screened patients. Another 13% of patients with cervical cancer diagnoses have had errors of follow-up, 24 suggesting unchecked gradual disease progression. Clearance of HPV leads to the regression of CIN, with 60% of CIN 2 resolving in patients younger than 30 who clear the virus. 25 A 2019 systematic review found that persistence of the same genotype of HPV after treatment for high-grade CIN has a positive predictive value of 44% for posttreatment high-grade CIN.

26 Risk factors for persistence include increasing age, 5 smoking, 27 and immunocompromise.
28. Treatment and Follow-up Treatment options for precancerous lesions of the cervix include cryotherapy, LEEP, and cold knife conization. Excisional treatment is recommended over ablative treatment for CIN 2 and 3.

### Comparison of three management strategies for patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: baseline results from a randomized trial [^12d8f9e3]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2001). Low credibility.

Background

More than 2 million U.S. women receive an equivocal cervical cytologic diagnosis (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS]) each year. Effective colposcopy triage strategies are needed to identify the minority of women who have clinically significant disease while avoiding excessive follow-up evaluation for others.

Methods

The ASCUS/LSIL (i.e., low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) Triage Study (ALTS) is a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the following three management strategies to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3): 1) immediate colposcopy (considered to be the reference standard), 2) triage to colposcopy based on human papillomavirus (HPV) results from Hybrid Capture 2(TM) (HC 2) and thin-layer cytology results, or 3) triage based on cytology results alone. This article summarizes the cross-sectional enrollment results for 3488 women with a referral diagnosis of ASCUS. All statistical tests are two-sided.

Results

Among participants with ASCUS, the underlying prevalence of histologically confirmed CIN3 was 5.1%. Sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above by testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.6% to 98.8%), with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy. Sensitivity of a single repeat cytology specimen with a triage threshold of HSIL or above was 44.1% (95% CI = 35.6% to 52.9%), with 6.9% referred. Sensitivity of a lower cytology triage threshold of ASCUS or above was 85.3% (95% CI = 78.2% to 90.8%), with 58.6% referred.

Conclusions

HC 2 testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA is a viable option in the management of women with ASCUS. It has greater sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above and specificity comparable to a single additional cytologic test indicating ASCUS or above.

Recommendation #5: In a Screening Setting Using Cotesting, for Patients Who Test Positive for HPV Types 56/59/66 and No Other Carcinogenic Types, 1-Year Return Is Recommended for NILM, ASC-US, and LSIL, and Colposcopy Is Recommended for ASC-H, AGC, HSIL, or Carcinoma. (AII) At the 1-Year Follow-Up, Colposcopy Is Recommended if HPV Results Are Positive for Any HPV Type or if Cytology Results Are ASC-H, AGC, HSIL, or Carcinoma. (CIII)

Rationale

Risks were < 4% for those testing positive for HPV types 56/59/66 with NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL cytology (Tables 2 and 4). Risk data were limited for individuals undergoing cotesting with cytology results of ASC-H, AGC, HSIL, and HPV56/59/66. Therefore, 2019 Guidelines apply, and colposcopy is recommended for individuals with ASC-H, AGC, or HSIL results.

Recommendation #6: During Surveillance, When Patients Are Being Followed Who Had No Preceding High-Grade Cytology (ASC-H, AGC, HSIL, or Carcinoma) or Histology (CIN2, CIN3, or AIS), Use of Extended Genotyping Results According to the Guidelines Outlined for Screening Is Acceptable. (CIII) When High-Grade Cytology or Histology Results Are Present and in the Posttreatment Setting, Management Using the 2019 Guidelines Is Recommended. (CIII)

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ [^413a62b0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2,3 — posttreatment follow-up: Acceptable options include human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing at 6 to 12 months (BII) and follow-up with either cytology alone or combined cytology and colposcopy at 6 months intervals (BII). Colposcopy with endocervical sampling is recommended for women who are HPV DNA positive or have repeat cytology of ASC-US or greater (BII). If HPV DNA is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytology tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", routine screening for at least 20 years commencing at 12 months is recommended (AI). Repeat treatment or hysterectomy based on a positive HPV DNA test is unacceptable (EII). If CIN 2,3 is identified at the margins of a diagnostic excisional procedure or in an endocervical sample obtained immediately after, reassessment with cytology and endocervical sampling at 4 to 6 months posttreatment is preferred (BII); performing a repeat diagnostic excisional procedure is acceptable (CIII) and hysterectomy is acceptable if a repeat diagnostic excisional procedure is not feasible (CIII). If a repeat diagnostic excision demonstrates a negative result, "routine screening is recommended". (BII), and hysterectomy is acceptable for women with recurrent or persistent CIN 2,3 (BII).

### Applying results of extended genotyping to management of positive cervicovaginal human papillomavirus test results: enduring guidelines [^ea18b7bf]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Enduring Consensus Cervical Cancer Screening and Management Guidelines Committee developed recommendations for the use of extended genotyping results in cervical cancer prevention programs.

Methods

Risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse were calculated using data obtained with the Onclarity HPV Assay from large cohorts. Management recommendations were based on clinical action thresholds developed for the 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines. Risk estimates were reviewed in relation to clinical action thresholds and used as the basis for draft recommendations. After an open comment period, recommendations were finalized and ratified through a vote by the Consensus Stakeholder Group.

Results

Colposcopy is recommended after positive tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. For those positive for HPV 45, 33/58, 31, 52, 35/39/68, or 51 but negative for 16 or 18, triage with cytology or dual stain testing is recommended. When screening with primary HPV testing, for patients who test positive for HPV types 56/59/66 and no other carcinogenic types, repeat HPV testing in 1 year is recommended. When screening with cotesting, for those who test positive for HPV types 56/59/66 and no other carcinogenic types, 1-year return is recommended for negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and colposcopy is recommended for atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or carcinoma. When patients without prior high-grade cytology (atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical glandular cells, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or carcinoma) or histology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN]2, CIN3, or adenocarcinoma in situ) are being followed, use of extended genotyping results is acceptable. When high-grade cytology or histology results are present, or when patients are being followed after treatment of CIN2+, management using the 2019 guidelines is recommended.

Conclusions

Human papillomavirus extended genotyping can guide clinical management in the setting of a positive HPV test result.

K.3 Managing Patients With Immunosuppression

Immunocompromised patients include those with HIV, solid organ transplant, or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as well as those with systemic lupus erythematous, and those with inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatologic disease requiring current immunosuppressive treatments. The cervical cancer screening guidelines for persons living with HIV have been supported by an increasing number of publications, including prospective studies. Although the literature for other immunosuppressed populations remains limited, these other conditions that suppress cell-mediated immunity have also been associated with virally induced cancers, including cervical cancer. Therefore, cervical cancer screening and abnormal result management recommendations for immunocompromised individuals without HIV use the guidelines developed for people living with HIV: screening should begin within 1 year of first insertional sexual activity and continue throughout a patient's lifetime: annually for 3 years, then every 3 years (cytology only) until the age of 30 years, and then either continuing with cytology alone or cotesting every 3 years after the age of 30 years.

Guideline: In immunocompromised patients of any age, colposcopy referral is recommended for all results cytology results of HPV-positive ASC-US or higher. If HPV testing is not performed on ASC-US results, then repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months is recommended, with colposcopy referral for ASC-US or higher. For any result of ASC-US or higher on repeat cytology or if HPV positive, referral to colposcopy is recommended. For all cytology results of LSIL or worse (including ASC-H, AGC, AIS, and HSIL), referral to colposcopy is recommended regardless of HPV test result if done.

Rationale: Because of higher risk of CIN 3+ with low-grade cytologic abnormalities among HIV+ individuals, colposcopic referral is recommended for HPV-positive ASC-US. Lack of data at KPNC precludes risk estimation for immunosuppressed patients. Sexually active patients with HIV infection who are younger than 21 years may have a high rate of progression to precancer. No similar prospective data are available for adolescents who acquired HIV during the perinatal period, but as many as 30% of adolescents perinatally infected had ASC-US or greater on their first cervical cytology. Because of the relatively high HPV prevalence before age 30 years, HPV cotesting is not recommended for patients younger than 30 years of age with HIV.

Recommendation #4: In a Screening Setting Using Primary HPV Testing, for Patients Who Test Positive for HPV Types 56/59/66 and No Other Carcinogenic Types, Repeat HPV Testing in 1 Year Is Recommended. (AII) If HPV-Positive for Any HPV Type at the 1-Year Follow-Up, Colposcopy Is Recommended. (CIII)

Rationale

In the IARC worldwide survey data (Table 1), HPV 56, 59, and 66 together were responsible for 2% of cancers. In the IRIS cohort including 3,757 HPV-positive patients, 514 (11%) tested positive for HPV56/59/66 (Table 2). Among those, only 6 CIN3+ cases were diagnosed over 3 years (4 prevalent and 2 incident cases). The immediate CIN3+ risk was 0.8% and 3-year risk was 1.4%, leading to a recommendation of a 1-year return. Adding a triage test with dual stain (positive or negative) or cytology (dichotomized as NILM or ASC-US+) did not change management, as risks remained below the colposcopy threshold for individuals with dual stain-positive or ASC-US+ results (Tables 2 and 3). Findings were similar in the STRIDES cohort (Tables 4 and 5). Data on CIN3+ risk after repeated positivity for HPV56/59/66 were limited; therefore, the 2019 Guidelines for colposcopy after 2 consecutive HPV-positive results were applied.

Estimates for HPV type-specific downstream CIN3+ risks either are not available or are insufficient to allow derivation of risk-based recommendations for persons undergoing multiple rounds of testing. In the screening setting, extended genotyping provides greater risk stratification than pooled HPV testing (Tables 2–5). It follows that extended genotyping can be used like limited genotyping in follow-up after colposcopy without high-grade cytology or histology. Data are insufficient to change management following high-grade cytology or histology or in the posttreatment setting, and therefore the 2019 Guidelines were retained. The 2019 posttreatment guidelines recommend colposcopy for all HPV-positive results (regardless of cytology or dual stain result), for HPV-negative results if cytology is ASC-H or higher, and for cytology results of LSIL or worse absent HPV testing.

Type-switching versus type-specific persistence

In theory, individuals who clear one HPV type and acquire a different type have a new incident infection, which would be expected to confer lower CIN3+ risk than a persistent infection. We had insufficient data on the impact of type-specific persistence or switching on CIN3+ risk to change the 2019 recommendation. Type persistence is more common than type switching. In addition, although CIN3+ risks are highest with type persistence, type switching confers a higher CIN3+ risk than reversion to HPV-negative. Because data on CIN3+ risk after repeated positivity for HPV 45, 33/58, 31, 52, 35/39/68, and 51 are limited and distinguishing type-switch from type-persistent within a single channel with multiple types (eg, 33/58) is not possible, the 2019 guidelines for colposcopy after 2 consecutive HPV-positive results were applied. Of note, because triage testing is recommended for these HPV types, guidelines are the same in the primary HPV and cotesting settings.

In situations not covered by the recommendations above, clinical judgment and shared decision-making should consider the 2019 Guidelines and 2017 Colposcopy Standards. In general, patients with prior abnormal HPV, cytology, dual stain, or biopsy results are at higher risk of CIN3+ and may benefit from additional testing, whereas those with prior negative HPV test results are at lower risk and so are less likely to benefit from additional testing. Additional guidelines may follow as new data allow more robust risk estimation.

### Self-collected vaginal specimens for HPV testing: recommendations from the enduring consensus cervical cancer screening and management guidelines committee [^c29d54d5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Evidence supports concordance of self- and clinician-collected samples for partial and extended HPV genotyping (Table 3). The extended genotyping guidelines are recommended for management of HPV types 56/59/66 when no other carcinogenic types are present. To summarize briefly, the CIN3+ risk for HPV 56/59/66 is below the colposcopy threshold for dual-stain–positive or cytology of ASC-US or higher, therefore triage testing (i.e. cytology or dual stain) does not change management and a visit to obtain a triage test is not needed. Therefore, repeat testing in 1 year is recommended. If the patient remains HPV-positive at the 1-year follow-up, colposcopy is recommended (See Figures 1 and 2).

RECOMMENDATION #6: In the surveillance setting, clinician-collected cervical specimens are preferred. If a clinician-collected cervical specimen cannot be obtained, a self-collected vaginal specimen is acceptable following shared decision-making. If a self-collected vaginal specimen is obtained, management per 2019 guidelines is recommended (CIII).

Abbreviations: CIN indicates cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; HPV, human papillomavirus; < CIN2, CIN1 or less; CIN2+, CIN2, CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ, cancer; NILM, negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancyIf cytology is performed in a cotesting setting and a dual-stain result is negative, repeat HPV testing in 1 year is recommended for NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL results. Colposcopy is recommended for ASC-H, AGC, or HSIL cytology results. Normal screening history documented in medical record, and/or patient is in the general screening population and has no known history of CIN2+If cytology is performed in a cotesting setting, colposcopy is recommended for all results including NILM Note: For patients with a history of high-grade histology, high-grade cytology (HSIL or persistent ASC-H), following surveillance of CIN2 or treatment of CIN2+, 2019 guidelines should be followed.
