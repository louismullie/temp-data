## Question

Antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify pediatric UTI by site and severity. Then, I should verify the diagnostic standards and specimen collection requirements. Next, I will review empiric antibiotic choices and stewardship, followed by definitive therapy adjustments. After that, I need to examine duration of therapy by syndrome and reconcile conflicting evidence. I will then consider special populations and prophylaxis, and finally integrate imaging and follow-up, summarizing a practical algorithm with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because treatment hinges on distinguishing lower from upper tract disease and identifying complicating features. Uncomplicated cystitis is lower-tract disease without systemic features, febrile UTI implies upper involvement and warrants longer therapy, and complicated UTI includes severe illness, obstructive uropathy, vesicoureteral reflux, immunocompromise, or atypical pathogens, which often require broader empiric coverage and closer monitoring [^5e41b2a9] [^e8c912dd].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic standards before discussing antibiotics. Diagnosis requires both pyuria and at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen; in infants and young children, this means catheterization or suprapubic aspiration, and bagged specimens are unreliable for diagnosis even if convenient for screening, so I should not jump to conclusions based on bagged cultures alone [^ce643685] [^16a9593f]. I should double-check that urinalysis alone is insufficient; culture confirmation is necessary to guide therapy and distinguish contamination from true infection [^42244369].

> Next, I should review empiric therapy and stewardship. Hold on, I should verify that oral therapy is generally as effective as parenteral therapy in non-severe cases; yes, AAP and contemporary reviews support oral or parenteral initiation with similar outcomes, so route should be driven by severity, age, reliability, and comorbidities rather than a blanket preference for IV therapy [^996fc75a] [^723dca33]. I need to ensure empiric choices reflect local resistance patterns; given high resistance rates to ampicillin and TMP-SMX in many regions, first-line oral options often include cefalexin, nitrofurantoin for lower-tract disease, and amoxicillin-clavulanate or a cephalosporin when upper involvement is suspected, with IV ceftriaxone or gentamicin reserved for sepsis, young infants, or inability to tolerate oral therapy [^60df4b65] [^8b7f31a1] [^f970fe5c].

> I will now examine definitive therapy adjustments once culture returns. Let me think about narrowing and de-escalation; I should confirm that therapy should be tailored to the identified organism and susceptibilities, switching to the narrowest effective agent and stopping if the diagnosis is not supported by culture, which is a core stewardship principle in pediatric UTI care [^f021b1d9] [^d49b6f40]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across settings; yes, both inpatient and outpatient pathways emphasize timely de-escalation and discontinuation when cultures are negative or alternative diagnoses emerge [^f021b1d9].

> Now, duration of therapy is where evidence conflicts, so I need to reconcile this carefully. Traditional guidance for febrile UTI supports 7 to 14 days, and AAP explicitly states that 1 to 3 day courses are inferior for febrile UTIs, which anchors a conservative default in young children with suspected pyelonephritis [^3389b020] [^aa79cd55]. But wait, what if shorter courses suffice in selected children? The SCOUT randomized trial showed higher treatment failure with 5 total days versus 10 total days when stopping at 5 days after clinical improvement, suggesting that 10 days remains preferable in many children, though the absolute failure rate with 5 days was still low and some clinicians may accept that trade-off in closely monitored patients [^84cfd348]. Conversely, comparative effectiveness studies in pyelonephritis suggest no difference between about 8 days and 11 days, and a Danish individualised strategy stopping 3 days after defervescence reduced antibiotic exposure but increased recurrence by about 5 percentage points, so I should be cautious about extrapolating shorter durations broadly, especially outside research settings [^bab0eecb] [^3de602e7]. For uncomplicated cystitis, some guidelines and meta-analyses support 2 to 4 days as effective, but heterogeneity and older trial quality limit certainty, so I should align with local policy and patient-specific risk while avoiding single-dose regimens, which are consistently inferior [^356073e6] [^9509caf3] [^00006251].

> Let me consider special populations and prophylaxis, and I should confirm where the evidence is strongest. For infants under 3 months, I need to ensure a low threshold for admission, parenteral therapy, and sepsis evaluation, given the risk of bacteremia and subtle presentations, and this remains standard across guidelines [^723dca33]. For children with recurrent UTI or high-grade VUR, long-term prophylaxis can modestly reduce recurrence but does not clearly reduce renal scarring and increases resistance; thus, I should reserve prophylaxis for those at highest risk and reassess periodically, with nitrofurantoin favored when tolerated due to lower resistance selection, while also addressing bowel and bladder dysfunction to reduce recurrence risk [^81acdbfa] [^181ca32d] [^b5ea81e2]. Hold on, I should verify that routine VCUG after a first febrile UTI is not recommended; AAP advises against routine VCUG unless ultrasound is abnormal or there is recurrence, which helps avoid unnecessary radiation and procedures [^7344a090].

> Next, I should review imaging and follow-up, and I need to ensure I do not over-order tests. Renal and bladder ultrasound is generally recommended after a first febrile UTI in young children to detect obstructive anomalies, whereas routine VCUG is not indicated after a first UTI unless ultrasound is abnormal or there is recurrence, which balances detection of actionable pathology against overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^7344a090] [^d62767be]. I should double-check that follow-up includes educating caregivers to seek prompt evaluation for future febrile illnesses to catch recurrences early, and that repeat urine cultures are not routinely needed in asymptomatic children after adequate treatment, aligning with AAP follow-up guidance [^f3c48e4c] [^15a8f0c0].

> But wait, what if the child does not improve as expected? I need to ensure a structured reassessment at 48 to 72 hours, including repeat exam, urine culture if symptoms persist, and imaging such as ultrasound if there is no response, to evaluate for obstruction, abscess, or resistant organisms, rather than reflexively escalating antibiotics without new data [^d49b6f40]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach is emphasized in complicated UTI guidance; yes, early reassessment and targeted diagnostics are core elements when response is atypical [^d49b6f40].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I should confirm it aligns with major guidelines. For a child with suspected UTI, obtain a catheterized or suprapubic specimen for urinalysis and culture before antibiotics when feasible, start empiric therapy based on age, severity, and local resistance, choose oral therapy when stable, tailor to culture results within 48 to 72 hours, treat febrile UTI for 7 to 14 days in most young children while recognizing emerging evidence that 8 to 10 days may suffice in selected cases, treat uncomplicated cystitis for 7 to 10 days in many settings though some guidelines allow 3 to 5 days in older children, arrange ultrasound after a first febrile UTI in young children, avoid routine VCUG after a first UTI, and consider prophylaxis only for select high-risk recurrent cases with shared decision-making about benefits and resistance risks [^ce643685] [^3389b020] [^92ad9eee] [^7344a090] [^81acdbfa].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that this reflects the totality of evidence: antibiotics are effective and necessary for pediatric UTI, but duration should be individualized by syndrome and severity, with 7 to 14 days remaining the conservative standard for febrile UTI in young children, shorter validated courses acceptable for selected older children with uncomplicated cystitis, and stewardship principles of narrow-spectrum therapy, culture-guided de-escalation, and judicious prophylaxis applied throughout to minimize resistance and adverse effects while protecting renal outcomes [^3389b020] [^84cfd348] [^bab0eecb] [^f021b1d9].

---

Antibiotic therapy for pediatric UTI should be **guided by culture results** [^1cf32f4d] and local resistance patterns [^60df4b65], with **7–10 days** for febrile UTI [^3389b020] and **3–5 days** for uncomplicated cystitis in children older than 3 months [^723dca33]. Oral therapy is effective for most children [^996fc75a], but **parenteral therapy** is indicated for severe illness, vomiting, or poor absorption [^723dca33]. Empiric choices should avoid high-resistance agents (e.g. amoxicillin, TMP-SMX) [^60df4b65] unless local susceptibility is favorable; first-line options include cefalexin, nitrofurantoin (for lower UTI only), or amoxicillin-clavulanate [^notfound]. Adjust therapy to culture and reassess at 48–72 hours [^d49b6f40]; avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides unless no alternatives exist [^f970fe5c]. Prophylaxis is reserved for select high-risk patients [^e2094b6d] and should be reviewed regularly [^e8c912dd].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is indicated for **symptomatic UTI** confirmed by urinalysis and culture [^42244369] [^ce643685]. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated [^dc65cf14]. Therapy should be initiated promptly in febrile infants and young children to prevent renal damage [^dc6e3b21].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide therapy. The diagnosis of UTI in children requires:

- **Urine culture**: Gold standard; ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen in a properly collected specimen [^ce643685] [^42244369].
- **Urine analysis**: Pyuria and/or bacteriuria support the diagnosis [^ce643685].
- **Specimen collection**: Catheterization or suprapubic aspiration in infants; midstream clean-catch in toilet-trained children [^16a9593f] [^d7b1c68e].

---

## Empiric antibiotic selection

Empiric antibiotic selection should be based on **local resistance patterns** [^60df4b65], patient age, and clinical severity [^notfound]. Common empiric choices include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Cefalexin | First-line oral agent | Effective against most E. coli; avoid if severe allergy |
| Nitrofurantoin | Lower UTI only | Not for febrile UTI or pyelonephritis |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Alternative oral agent | Useful for resistant organisms |
| Ceftriaxone | Severe illness, vomiting, or hospitalization | IV therapy; broad-spectrum |
| Gentamicin | Severe illness or resistant organisms | IV therapy; monitor renal function |

---

Fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides are generally avoided due to **toxicity and resistance concerns** [^f970fe5c] unless no alternatives exist.

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Duration of therapy depends on **clinical presentation** and patient age:

- **Febrile UTI (pyelonephritis)**: 7–10 days [^notfound]; shorter courses (4–7 days) may be considered in select cases [^92ad9eee] [^3de602e7].
- **Uncomplicated lower UTI (cystitis)**: 3–5 days for children older than 3 months [^723dca33].
- **Infants under 3 months**: 7–10 days, often with initial IV therapy [^notfound].

---

## Route of administration

Oral therapy is effective for most children [^996fc75a] and is preferred when feasible [^723dca33]. Parenteral therapy is indicated for **severe illness**, vomiting, or poor absorption [^723dca33].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Children should be reassessed within 48–72 hours to confirm clinical response and culture results [^d49b6f40]. If there is no improvement, **repeat culture** and imaging (renal ultrasound) should be considered [^d49b6f40].

---

## Antibiotic prophylaxis

Prophylactic antibiotics are **not routinely recommended** [^7344a090] but may be considered for children with recurrent UTIs, vesicoureteral reflux, or other high-risk conditions [^e2094b6d]. Regular reassessment of the need for prophylaxis is essential [^e8c912dd].

---

## Emerging evidence and controversies

Recent studies suggest that shorter courses (4–7 days) may be effective for febrile UTI in select patients [^92ad9eee] [^3de602e7], but **further research is needed** [^3de602e7]. Individualized treatment based on clinical response and patient factors is gaining support [^3de602e7].

---

## Antibiotic therapy for pediatric UTI

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Route** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Febrile UTI (pyelonephritis) | 7–10 days | Oral or IV | Adjust based on culture |
| Uncomplicated lower UTI | 3–5 days | Oral | Children > 3 months |
| Infants < 3 months | 7–10 days | IV initially | Consider prophylaxis |
| Severe illness/vomiting | IV therapy initially | IV | Switch to oral when stable |

---

Antibiotic therapy for pediatric UTI should be **individualized** based on clinical presentation, patient age, and local resistance patterns [^1cf32f4d]. Oral therapy is effective for most children, but parenteral therapy is indicated for severe cases [^996fc75a]. Regular reassessment and adherence to culture results are essential for optimal outcomes [^d49b6f40].

### Urinary tract infections in children [^4f15c1f3]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^00006251]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

### Antibiotics for treating lower urinary tract infection in children [^9509caf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however is it unclear what are the specific benefits and harms of such treatments.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the benefits and harms of antibiotics for treating lower UTI in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Renal Group's Specialised Register (April 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE OVID SP (from 1966), and EMBASE OVID SP (from 1988) without language restriction. Date of last search: May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which antibiotic therapy was used to treat bacteriologically proven, symptomatic, lower UTI in children aged zero to 18 years in primary and community healthcare settings were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^60373424]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^f3ef8554]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^3acd3848]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^81acdbfa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Urinary tract infection in children: when to worry [^914d7df5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Although most infections will resolve without complication after appropriate treatment, a wide array of potential complicating factors exists, which can make difficult the rapid resolution of a UTI. Clinical scenarios involving these factors require a high index of suspicion and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy.

### Antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infection in children: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^21a07948]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.

Design

This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis.

Participants

Five trials involving 463 children were performed.

Results

Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal. Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45, P < .01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02).

Conclusions

Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children. Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e8c912dd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^3389b020]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^3de602e7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7·5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5·3 days [IQR 4·8 to 6·5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10·0 days [10·0 to 10·0]). Median age was 1·5 years (IQR 0·7 to 5·4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5·3 percentage points, one-sided 97·5% CI -∞ to 11·1, p non_inferiority = 0·24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6·0 (IQR 5·3 to 7·5) in the individualised group and 10·0 (10·0 to 10·0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4·0 days [97·5% CI -4·5 to -3·7], p < 0·0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6·8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11·1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0·61 [95% CI 0·47 to 0·80], p = 0·0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0·9 percentage points [95% CI -4·6 to 6·5], p = 0·79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5·3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^bab0eecb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of a short-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis in children vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness research study of 791 children (aged 6 months to 18 years) with pyelonephritis, no difference was found in the odds of treatment failure for children prescribed a short-course of antibiotics (median 8 days) vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (median 11 days).

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that short-courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for the treatment of pyelonephritis in children.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^1ec80859]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^fce7a0e7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety in clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist. In national guidelines, management recommendations for cUTI are often neglected. We aimed to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

Methods:

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was done using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. Four controversies were defined from experience and available evidence. Children with cUTI were categorized into 5 subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, nonurological underlying conditions and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

Results:

The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions:

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^efae707b]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Update of the EAU / ESPU guidelines on urinary tract infections in children [^5e41b2a9]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and require appropriate diagnostic evaluation, management and follow-up.

Objective

To provide a summary of the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on Pediatric Urology, which were first published in 2015 in European Urology.

Study Design

A structured literature review was performed of new publications between 2015 and 2020 for UTIs in children. The guideline was updated accordingly with relevant new literature.

Results

The occurrence of a UTI can be the first indication of anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract, especially in patients with a febrile UTI. The basic diagnostic evaluation should include sufficient investigations to exclude urinary tract abnormalities, but should also be as minimally invasive as possible. In recent years, more risk factors have been identified to predict the presence of these anatomical anomalies, such as a non-E. Coli infection, high grade fever and ultrasound abnormalities. When these risk factors are factored into the diagnostic work-up, some invasive investigations can be omitted in a larger group of children. In addition to the treatment of active UTIs, it is also essential to prevent recurrent UTIs and consequent renal scarring. With the increase of antimicrobial resistance good antibiotic stewardship is needed. In addition, alternative preventative measures such as dietary supplements, bladder and bowel management and antibiotic prophylaxis could decrease the incidence of recurrent UTI.

Conclusion

This paper is a summary of the updated 2021 EAU guidelines on Pediatric Urology. It provides practical considerations and flowcharts for the management and diagnostic evaluation of UTIs in children.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^356073e6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

Pediatric urinary tract infections are common. These infections have been recognized as a source of acute morbidity and long-term medical consequences in adulthood. There are various risk factors and clinical presentations in children with urinary tract infections. The main objectives in management include prompt diagnosis, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, identification of anatomic anomalies, and, in select patients, long-term follow-up.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^03e88d61]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^6367ad96]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^a0a5a82c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts. Date of most recent search: January 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight studies (618 children) were identified, five (406) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00; RD -30%, 95% CI -56% to -4%) No side effects were reported. One study reported that nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%). The other study found cefixime was more effective in preventing recurrent UTI than nitrofurantoin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.10; RD -3%, 95% CI -17% to -12%). However, 62% of patients receiving cefixime experienced an adverse reaction during the first six months of treatment (18/29) while only 26% (8/31) of patients receiving nitrofurantoin reported an adverse reaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Large, properly randomised, double blinded studies are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^d389c060]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

The World Health Organization's 2014 global action plan on antimicrobial resistance outlines a strategy to deal with the effects of these multiple individual actions. The plan asks nations to adopt "whole of society" approaches to prevention (through public health and infection control measures), to enhance and better disseminate knowledge on antimicrobial resistance, and to develop an economic case for new investments in drugs, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

Bryce and colleagues' systematic review joins a host of recent studies, reports, and calls to action on this issue. Each adds evidence to justify change in how we protect a precious global resource. While I have no doubt that clinical practice guidelines will quickly be able to accommodate the findings, I am less confident that there is the will and commitment to deal with what the WHO has called "the post-antibiotic era".

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^1bcc970e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Summary

UTI is a common bacterial infection of childhood. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable, and a urine sample is required for diagnosis, but collection is not straightforward in precontinent children. Dipstick leucocyte and nitrite screening can inform initial management while awaiting culture confirmation. Prompt management aims to prevent short-term morbidity such as urosepsis and long-term morbidity such as renal scarring. Recent evidence supports less aggressive imaging following uncomplicated UTI. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge. International guidelines have conflicting recommendations regarding sample collection methods, antibiotic duration and imaging indications. Targeted research is required to inform knowledge gaps and inform cost-effective care for paediatric UTI.

### Issues in febrile urinary tract infection management [^2269f9fc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on prevention of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

### Urinary tract infection antibiotic trial design: a systematic review [^1701f7c0]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent common bacterial infections in children. No guidance on the conduct of pediatric febrile UTI clinical trials (CTs) exist.

Objective

To assess the criteria used for patient selection and the efficacy end points in febrile pediatric UTI CTs.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane central databases, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched between January 1, 1990, and November 24, 2016.

Study Selection

We combined Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text terms for "urinary tract infections" and "therapeutics" and "clinical trials" in children (0–18 years), identifying 3086 articles.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results

We included 40 CTs in which a total of 4381 cases of pediatric UTIs were investigated. Positive urine culture results and fever were the most common inclusion criteria (93% and 78%, respectively). Urine sampling method, pyuria, and colony thresholds were highly variable. Clinical and microbiological end points were assessed in 88% and 93% of the studies, respectively. Timing for end point assessment was highly variable, and only 3 studies (17%) out of the 18 performed after the Food and Drug Administration 1998 guidance publication assessed primary and secondary end points consistently with this guidance.

Limitations

Our limitations included a mixed population of healthy children and children with an underlying condition. In 6 trials, researchers studied a subgroup of patients with afebrile UTI.

Conclusions

We observed a wide variability in the microbiological inclusion criteria and the timing for end point assessment. The available guidance for adults appear not to be used by pediatricians and do not seem applicable to the childhood UTI. A harmonized design for pediatric UTIs CT is necessary.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common occurrence in children. The management and laboratory diagnosis of these infections pose unique challenges that are not encountered in adults. Important factors, such as specimen collection, urinalysis interpretation, culture thresholds, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, require special consideration in children and will be discussed in detail in the following review.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

### Different imaging strategies in febrile urinary tract infection in childhood. what, when, why? [^cf994d21]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem in childhood. During the last decade, published papers led to a deep revision in the use and usefulness of imaging tools in children with febrile UTIs. This new body of knowledge was partially endorsed by the guidelines published in 2007 by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and in 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nevertheless, new data continuously arise and the scientific debate always revives. Recommendations of published guidelines and strengths and weaknesses of the available biochemical and imaging tools are here critically analysed for giving to the reader a complete, up-to-date and flexible overview on this hot topic.

### Antibiotic appropriateness for urinary tract infections in children [^4b7f53be]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We examined local prescribing patterns across the entire treatment course for children treated for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) to determine opportunities for antibiotic stewardship initiatives.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of emergency department and inpatient encounters for febrile and afebrile UTI in a children's hospital from 2021 to 2022. An antibiotic spectrum ranking was established, and providers' choices were assessed for appropriateness on the basis of the individuals' urine culture (UCx). Groups were stratified by fever presence and compared using χ2, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests.

Results

Of 172 encounters (83% emergency department), 99 (58%) had a positive UCx. Eighty (80%) grew Escherichia coli, with 67 (84%) being susceptible to cefazolin (minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 16 mg/L). There were 229 antibiotic regimens and 39 (17%) were appropriate. Inappropriate antibiotic choices included unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and misdiagnosed UTI. Grouping by encounter, at least 1 dose of a third cephalosporin was given in 51% of encounters, and 80% of these received it unnecessarily because of UTI misdiagnosis or suitability of a narrower-spectrum antibiotic. The median prescribed antibiotic duration was 7 days (interquartile range 7–10). Of 73 encounters with UCx growing mixed flora or a nonuropathogen, only 29 (40%) had antibiotics discontinued. Confirmed UTI was associated with fever and nitrite positivity.

Conclusions

Our study revealed high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotics, particularly unnecessary prescribing of third cephalosporin, prescriptions not supported by laboratory data, and prolonged treatment courses. Our results identify factors that can be used to support UTI treatment pathways and ensure antibiotic stewardship.

### Abstract… [^b5ea81e2]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY The diagnosis of UTI requires findings of both pyuria and significant bacterial growth on urine culture. The recommended techniques for urine collection and the minimum uropathogen count required for diagnosis vary by guideline. What Is the Role of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Children with UTIs. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been used to prevent recurrent UTIs and renal scarring. However, its benefit is unclear, and it promotes antimicrobial resistance. Patients most likely to benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis include children with a high risk of recurrent UTIs and those most likely to have adverse effects from recurrent UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is the preferred antibiotic for prophylaxis unless adverse effects limit its use.

Bowel and bladder dysfunction is associated with UTIs, and treatment of this condition can reduce UTI recurrence. Evidence does not support the use of probiotics or cranberries for UTI prophylaxis. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Evidence is mixed on the role of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTIs. A Cochrane review and a systematic review suggest that long-term use of prophylactic antibiotics may reduce UTI recurrence; however, the benefit is small at best. 6, 7 The Randomized Intervention for Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux trial showed that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced recurrent UTIs in children with grades I to IV reflux. 8 However, a Cochrane review showed little to no effect on rates of recurrent UTIs.
9. There is also conflicting evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces renal scarring in children with recurrent UTIs.

A Cochrane review found that antibiotic prophylaxis has little to no effect on the risk of new or progressive renal damage. 9 The RIVUR trial also found no difference in renal scarring when antibiotic prophylaxis was used 8; however, a systematic review and subanalysis of the RIVUR trial showed that antibiotic prophylaxis prevented scarring. 7, 28. All of these studies show increased antimicrobial resistance when antibiotic prophylaxis is used to prevent recurrent UTIs. 6–9 Compared with other prophylactic antibiotics, nitrofurantoin results in less resistance and is more effective, but it has more adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and stomachache. 6, 7.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^9e9d0d58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infection in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent renal damage. Published guidelines recommend treatment of acute pyelonephritis initially with intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy for seven to 14 days though there is no consensus on the duration of either IV or oral therapy.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: June 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or weight mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eighteen trials (2612 children) were eligible for inclusion. No significant differences were found in persistent renal damage at six months (one trial, 306 infants: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.03) or in duration of fever (WMD 0.80, 95% CI -4.41 to - 6.01) between oral cefixime therapy (14 days) and IV therapy (three days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly no significant differences in persistent renal damage (three trials, 315 children: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.37) were found between IV therapy (3–4 days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7–14 days. In addition no significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (one trial, 179 children, persistent symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53).

Authors' Conclusions

These results suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral cefixime or with short courses (2–4 days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective. Trials are required to determine the optimal total duration of therapy and if other oral antibiotics can be used in the initial treatment of acute pyelonephritis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^fe5223d0]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^0e808fc1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in young infants, with more than 20 000 infants (< 1 year of age) hospitalized annually in the United States. In children aged 2 to 24 months, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines from 2011 (reaffirmed in 2016) state that "initiating treatment orally or parenterally is equally efficacious". Infants younger than 60 days often initially receive parenteral antibiotics as part of an evaluation for invasive bacterial infection. The optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy when a UTI is diagnosed in these younger infants is not known. As a result, significant practice heterogeneity exists both within and between institutions. -

Prescribing patterns and the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy are a priority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospital systems, and individual care providers alike as it has a big impact on antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, a short-course IV therapy could provide additional potential benefits compared with a long-course therapy. Shorter hospitalizations would mean lower medical costs and increased hospital bed availability and may be less disruptive to parent-infant bonding. In addition, shorter hospitalization could reduce the risk of nosocomial infectionand adverse events, such as IV infiltrates. This approach is also in keeping with value-based health care delivery.

The goal of this study was to determine the association between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (> 3 days) IV antibiotic therapies and treatment failure, defined as readmission from date of discharge within 30 days. We hypothesized that a short-course IV antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics is safe, with no difference in treatment failure between short-course and long-course IV antibiotic therapy.

### Short-course therapy for urinary tract infections in children: the SCOUT randomized clinical trial [^84cfd348]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

There is a paucity of pediatric-specific comparative data to guide duration of therapy recommendations in children with urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objective

To compare the efficacy of standard-course and short-course therapy for children with UTI.

Design, Setting, Participants

The Short Course Therapy for Urinary Tract Infections (SCOUT) randomized clinical noninferiority trial took place at outpatient clinics and emergency departments at 2 children's hospitals from May 2012, through, August 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2020, through, February 2023. Participants included children aged 2 months to 10 years with UTI exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobials.

Intervention

Another 5 days of antimicrobials (standard-course therapy) or 5 days of placebo (short-course therapy).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome, treatment failure, was defined as symptomatic UTI at or before the first follow-up visit (day 11 to 14). Secondary outcomes included UTI after the first follow-up visit, asymptomatic bacteriuria, positive urine culture, and gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Results

Analysis for the primary outcome included 664 randomized children (639 female [96%]; median age, 4 years). Among children evaluable for the primary outcome, 2 of 328 assigned to standard-course (0.6%) and 14 of 336 assigned to short-course (4.2%) had a treatment failure (absolute difference of 3.6% with upper bound 95% CI of 5.5.%). Children receiving short-course therapy were more likely to have asymptomatic bacteriuria or a positive urine culture at or by the first follow-up visit. There were no differences between groups in rates of UTI after the first follow-up visit, incidence of adverse events, or incidence of gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, children assigned to standard-course therapy had lower rates of treatment failure than children assigned to short-course therapy. However, the low failure rate of short-course therapy suggests that it could be considered as a reasonable option for children exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^ce643685]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

### Urinary tract infection in children [^b04c4cae]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Up to 7 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys will have a symptomatic, culture-confirmed urinary tract infection by six years of age. Urinary tract infection may be suspected because of urinary symptoms in older children or because of fever, nonspecific symptoms, or failure to thrive in infants. Urine dipstick analysis is useful for ruling out urinary tract infections in cases with low clinical suspicion. However, urine culture is necessary for diagnosis of urinary tract infections in children if there is high clinical suspicion, cloudy urine, or if urine dipstick testing shows positive leukocyte esterase or nitrite activity. Despite current recommendations, routine imaging studies (e.g., renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, renal scans) do not appear to improve clinical outcomes in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral therapy in randomized trials. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established, but one-day therapies have been shown to be inferior to longer treatment courses.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^60df4b65]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^9f3b9489]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that children receiving a short course (median 8 days) vs a prolonged course (median 11 days) of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of pyelonephritis experience similar clinical outcomes. Although results did not achieve statistical significance, children who received a short course of antibiotic therapy may be less likely to have subsequent infections within the following 30 days with a more resistant strain of the same uropathogen (40% vs 64%). This finding adds to the growing body of evidence supporting shorter durations of therapy than traditionally prescribed for the treatment of common bacterial infections.

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative effectiveness research study evaluating the optimal duration of therapy for pyelonephritis in children. Our data provide evidence that may help guide treatment recommendations for a common pediatric infection, particularly when combined with the high-quality randomized clinical trial data supporting shorter (5–7 days) durations of therapy for adults with pyelonephritis. Furthermore, our study included populations frequently excluded from traditional comparative effectiveness UTI studies, including those with immunocompromised systems, structural urologic abnormalities, and previous UTIs, increasing the generalizability of our findings to the pediatric population at highest risk for the development of pyelonephritis.

We found that children aged 4 to 13 years had a significantly higher odds of treatment failure (regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed) than children aged less than 4 years or greater than 14 years. We hypothesize that this finding was likely due to differences in risk factors in the aged 4 to 13 years group compared with younger and older children. A possible explanation for the development of UTIs in healthy children less than aged 4 years is evolving elimination and hygiene practices during infancy and toilet training periods; whereas children older than 14 years are more likely to experience UTIs related to sexual activity. Children between these ages, however, are less likely to develop UTIs unless there are anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, neurological abnormalities, or functional bowel control conditions. The presence of underlying urologic abnormalities was independently associated with treatment failure, regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed.

### Contemporary management of urinary tract infection in children [^dc6e3b21]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, and girls are at a significantly higher risk, as compared to boys, except in early infancy. Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli Collection of an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. Oral antibiotic therapy for 7 to 10 days is adequate for uncomplicated cases that respond well to the treatment. A renal ultrasound examination is advised in all young children with first febrile UTI and in older children with recurrent UTI. Most children with first febrile UTI do not need a voiding cystourethrogram; it may be considered after the first UTI in children with abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound examination or a UTI caused by atypical pathogen, complex clinical course, or known renal scarring. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively in high-risk patients. Few patients diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux after a UTI need surgical correction. The most consequential long-term complication of acute pyelonephritis is renal scarring, which may increase the risk of hypertension or chronic kidney disease later in life. Treatment of acute pyelonephritis with an appropriate antibiotic within 48 hours of fever onset and prevention of recurrent UTI lowers the risk of renal scarring. Pathogens causing UTI are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics, and their indiscriminate use in doubtful cases of UTI must be discouraged.

### Association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in pediatric patients [^647e4593]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Gaps and inconsistencies in published information about optimal antibiotic treatment duration for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in pediatric patients pose a dilemma for antibiotic stewardship. Objective: Evaluate the association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence rates in children with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 2 to 17 years with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis and without renal/anatomical abnormality was conducted using Truven Health MarketScan Database for 2013–2015. Results: Of 7698 patients, 85.5% had cystitis, 14.3% pyelonephritis. Duration of antibiotic treatment was as follows: 3 to 5 days for cystitis (20.4%) or 7 (33.6%), 10 (44.2%), or 14 (1.8%) days for any UTI. Recurrence occurred in 5.5% of patients. Covariates associated with increased recurrence risk included pretreatment antibiotic exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.06–1.57), pyelonephritis on diagnosis date (OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.03–2.00), follow-up visit during antibiotic treatment (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 2.20–4.68), parenteral antibiotic (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.33–2.69), and interaction of pyelonephritis diagnosis with nitrofurantoin monotherapy (OR = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.20–11.29). After adjustment for covariates, the association between duration of antibiotic treatment and recurrence was not significant (compared with 7 days: 10 days: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.85–1.33; 14 days: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45–1.78). Conclusions and Relevance: Antibiotic treatment duration was not significantly associated with recurrence of uncomplicated UTI in a national pediatric cohort. Results provide support for shorter-course treatment, consistent with antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^f970fe5c]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children — empiric therapy and limited fluoroquinolone role — emphasizes cephalosporins for uncomplicated cases and restricts fluoroquinolones to severe presentations. Standard empiric therapy for uncomplicated UTI in the pediatric population continues to be a cephalosporin antibiotic agent, because TMP-SMX– and amoxicillin-resistant E coli are increasingly common. The fluoroquinolones remain potential first-line agents only in the setting of pyelonephritis or complicated UTI.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^9f7deb4f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Urinary tract infection in children: diagnosis, treatment, imaging-comparison of current guidelines [^7769d547]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent disorder of childhood, yet the proper approach for a child with UTI is still a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to critically compare current guidelines for the diagnosis and management of UTI in children, in light of new scientific data.

Methods

An analysis was performed of the guidelines from: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Polish Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU). Separate aspects of the approach for a child with UTI, including diagnosis, treatment and further imaging studies, were compared, with allowance for recent research in each field.

Conclusions

The analyzed guidelines tried to reconcile recent reports about diagnosis, treatment, and further diagnostics in pediatric UTI with prior practices and opinions, and economic capabilities. There was still a lack of sufficient data to formulate coherent, unequivocal guidelines on UTI management in children, with imaging tests remaining the main area of controversy. As a result, the authors formulated their own proposal for UTI management in children.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^bede43db]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that short courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged courses for children with pyelonephritis. Given the high incidence of UTIs in children and the increasing concern for antibiotic resistance and other negative sequelae associated with antibiotic overuse, a shorter duration of therapy for pyelonephritis could have implications for public health.

### Children with recurrent urinary tract infections: who are they and why do we need better prevention options? [^29467d3a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections in children, and those with congenital malformations of the urinary tract are at risk of recurrent UTIs (rUTIs), which can lead to renal scarring, chronic renal failure, reduced renal perfusion, and hypertension. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is present in 30% to 40% of children with UTIs, has been associated with rUTI. Other risk factors include the absence of circumcision, bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD), and fecal retention.

The standard of care for children at risk of rUTIs includes antimicrobial prophylaxis, whose effectiveness in preventing rUTIs and renal scarring remains controversial. Prolonged antibiotics use can lead to adverse events, and some studies suggested that prophylaxis does not reduce renal scarring and may increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Moreover, UTIs are often treated empirically, with treatment adjusted once the uropathogen's susceptibility profile is available.

Interventions aimed at reducing the occurrence of rUTIs without the reliance on antibiotics are imperative, but the populations that would most benefit from this intervention remain uncertain. This study aimed to identify the pediatric population most susceptible to rUTIs in a urology clinic, evaluate antibiotic use and assess the risk of AMR.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children [^4e6bb0e5]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^181ca32d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely administered to children with the intention of preventing urinary tract infection, but adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials regarding efficacy are lacking. This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.

Methods

We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.

Results

From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P ≥ 0.20 for all interactions).

Conclusions

Long-term, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a decreased number of urinary tract infections in predisposed children. The treatment effect appeared to be consistent but modest across subgroups. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12608000470392.)

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^a301ace9]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

### Urinary tract infection in children… [^b43d5baa]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

What are the effects of treatment of acute urinary tract infection in children. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Antibiotics. There is consensus that antibiotics are likely to be beneficial compared with placebo. Placebo-controlled trials of antibiotics for treating children with symptomatic acute urinary tract infection are considered unethical. UNLIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Longer Courses of Oral Antibiotics. One systematic review found no significant difference in cure rates between longer courses and shorter courses of the same oral antibiotic seven days after treatment in children with no history of renal tract abnormality and with no acute pyelonephritis diagnosis. Another systematic review also found no significant difference in cure rates between longer and shorter courses of any antibiotic. However, longer courses may be associated with more adverse effects.

Longer Courses of Initial Intravenous Antibiotics. One systematic review found no significant difference between long and short courses of initial intravenous antibiotics in persistence of bacteriuria after treatment, recurrent UTI at six to 12 months, or renal scarring at three to six months in children with acute pyelonephritis. Single Dose of Oral Antibiotics. One systematic review found that single-dose oral amoxicillin decreased cure rates at three to 30 days compared with a longer course of oral amoxicillin. Another systematic review found that single-day or single-dose regimens increased treatment failure compared with seven- to 14-day courses of any antibiotic. What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Prophylactic Antibiotics.

One systematic review found limited evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduced UTI recurrence in children compared with placebo or no treatment. One RCT found that nitrofurantoin reduced recurrence of UTI over six months compared with trimethoprim. However, more children discontinued nitrofurantoin treatment because of adverse effects. We found no RCTs evaluating the optimal duration of prophylactic antibiotics.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^75ae50f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^15a8f0c0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^6031a15d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Empiric use of cefepime in the treatment of serious urinary tract infections in children [^1fb80c4b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in childhood. They represent a significant proportion (10%) of hospital-acquired infections in children. Bacteria causing UTIs in children vary, depending on the setting (community-acquired vs. nosocomial), underlying anatomic anomalies and concurrent medical conditions.

Objective

To review published and unpublished clinical studies that have used cefepime for the treatment of UTIs in children.

Methods and Results

In two recent multicenter, randomized trials, cefepime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h and every 12 h) was compared with ceftazidime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h) for the treatment of serious urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis in children less than 12 years of age. In these studies a favorable clinical and microbiologic response was observed in > 95% of cefepime-treated and ceftazidime-treated children assessed at the end of treatment.

Conclusions

These results indicate that cefepime represents an important therapeutic option for the treatment of serious UTIs in children.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^33930ff9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Urinary tract infections in children: EAU / ESPU guidelines [^d7b1c68e]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

In 30% of children with urinary tract anomalies, urinary tract infection (UTI) can be the first sign. Failure to identify patients at risk can result in damage to the upper urinary tract.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and imaging of children presenting with UTI.

Evidence Acquisition

The recommendations were developed after a review of the literature and a search of PubMed and Embase. A consensus decision was adopted when evidence was low.

Evidence Synthesis

UTIs are classified according to site, episode, symptoms, and complicating factors. For acute treatment, site and severity are the most important. Urine sampling by suprapubic aspiration or catheterisation has a low contamination rate and confirms UTI. Using a plastic bag to collect urine, a UTI can only be excluded if the dipstick is negative for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite or microscopic analysis is negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria. A clean voided midstream urine sample after cleaning the external genitalia has good diagnostic accuracy in toilet-trained children. In children with febrile UTI, antibiotic treatment should be initiated as soon as possible to eradicate infection, prevent bacteraemia, improve outcome, and reduce the likelihood of renal involvement. Ultrasound of the urinary tract is advised to exclude obstructive uropathy. Depending on sex, age, and clinical presentation, vesicoureteral reflux should be excluded. Antibacterial prophylaxis is beneficial. In toilet-trained children, bladder and bowel dysfunction needs to be excluded.

Conclusions

The level of evidence is high for the diagnosis of UTI and treatment in children but not for imaging to identify patients at risk for upper urinary tract damage.

Patient Summary

In these guidelines, we looked at the diagnosis, treatment, and imaging of children with urinary tract infection. There are strong recommendations on diagnosis and treatment; we also advise exclusion of obstructive uropathy within 24h and later vesicoureteral reflux, if indicated.

### Short-course versus conventional length antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in children: a meta-analysis of 1279 patients [^1c1f19b5]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to compare the efficacies of single-dose, short-course (4 days or less), and standard course (5 days or greater) antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated childhood cystitis.

Methods

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing 4 days or less of therapy (short courses) with 5 days or more of therapy (conventional therapy) were included if all of the subjects were < 18 years of age, the initial infection was documented by urine culture, at least 1 subsequent culture was obtained between 3 and 30 days of enrollment, and some attempt was made to separate upper tract from lower tract infection. Composite differences among treatment groups were compared with a fixed or random effects model, depending on the test for heterogeneity.

Results

Of the 517 citations identified by literature search, 37 were selected for detailed review, and 22 were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall difference in cure rates between short and conventional courses of therapy was significant (6.38%; 95% CI: 1.88% to 10.89%), favoring the conventional course. Similar results were obtained when only studies comparing the same agents in the short and conventional courses were included (7.92%; 95% CI: 2.09% to 13.8%). Short-course amoxicillin was inferior to conventional length course (difference in cure rate, 13%; 95% CI: 4% to 24%); no difference was found between short-course and conventional length courses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (difference in cure rate, 6.24%; 95% CI = -3.74% to 16.2%).

Conclusions

We conclude that single-dose amoxicillin is inadequate therapy for uncomplicated cystitis of childhood. Three days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy appears to be as effective as conventional length courses of the drug.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^7344a090]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the American Academy of Pediatrics practice parameter regarding the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline was supplemented by analysis of data provided by authors of recent publications. The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.

Results

Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.

### Antibiotic stewardship and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and adolescents in the emergency department of a community hospital [^d9541a6f]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A retrospective, cross-sectional study of children with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) 3 months to 18 years of age who had a urinalysis and urine culture (UC) during an emergency department (ED) visit between 2019 and 2020 was performed. Chi-square, Fisher exact, and independent samples T tests were used as appropriate. Median age was 6.6 years (interquartile range = 3.3–12.4). Urinalysis positivity was 92.8%, of which 81.9% of children were prescribed a first-line antibiotic. First-line antibiotic use was 82.7%. Positive UC rate was 84.7%, with 84% receiving a first-line antibiotic (P = 0.025). The correlation between a positive urinalysis and a positive UC was 80.8% (P < .001). Change of antibiotics based on the uropathogen of positive UCs was 6.3% (P < .001). The urinalysis and UC guided the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs. First-line antibiotics can be safely administered in the ED and prescribed for positive urinalyses. Studies are needed to evaluate the discontinuation of antibiotics with negative UCs as part of antibiotic stewardship initiatives.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^a24a48ff]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognised threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare is particularly important as this is where almost 80% of all antibiotics used within the health service are prescribed. Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can limit the availability of effective treatment options, rendering some commonly encountered bacterial infections difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. Antibiotic resistant infections are also twice as likely to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. In low income countries, affordability of second line drugs and reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer broad spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing concerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibiotic resistant infections in these countries.

Children receive a lot of primary healthcare services and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number of antibiotics compared with middle aged populations. Children are also key drivers of infection within communities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from person to person. Despite this, little research has been published describing the prevalence of bacterial resistance in children or the risk factors of importance in this group. In 2010, Costelloe and colleagues conducted a systematic review that reported strong associations between previous exposure to routinely prescribed antibiotics in primary care and antimicrobial resistance persisting for up to 12 months. Most of the contributing studies, however, were conducted in adults.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections seen in primary care. In children with a suspected urinary tract infection, the most common management strategy is to treat empirically with an antibiotic while results of culture and sensitivity testing are awaited. Young children are more vulnerable to immediate and long term complications, including renal scarring and renal failure, and therefore require prompt appropriate treatment. Escherichia coli is responsible for over 80% of all urinary tract infectionsand is also the most common cause of bacteraemia and foodborne infections and a cause of meningitis in neonates.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence of resistance in community acquired E coli urinary tract infection to the most commonly prescribed antibiotics given to children in primary care and to quantify the relation between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and bacterial resistance. We stratified results by OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study countries as antibiotics tend to be used differently in these groups. In the more developed OECD countries antibiotics are obtained mostly only by prescription, whereas in "developing" non-OECD countries many antibiotics, including those commonly used to treat urinary tract infection, can be obtained over the counter, without the need for a prescription.

### Assessment of antibiotic prescription in acute urinary tract infections in adults [^2bc8401b]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescription for urinary tract infections in several hospital emergency services and to evaluate the variability of antibiotic prescription among these services.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was carried out in the emergency services of 10 hospitals from different Spanish regions. The sample was composed of patients diagnosed with acute urinary infection, aged ≥ 14 years. A Consensus Conference, held by a panel of experts, established first-choice, second-choice and inappropriate antibiotic treatments for each type of urinary tract infection, based on the available scientific evidence. All the observed prescriptions in our study were classified according to this pattern. The main variables were: type of urinary infection, antibiotic prescription, urine culture request, comorbidity and hospital admission.

Results

A sample of 3797 acute urinary tract infections was studied. Eighty-one percent were lower urinary tract infections. The most commonly used antibiotics were ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The global percentages of first-choice, alternative-choice and inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions were: 42.4% (95% CI: 40.8–43.9), 44.1 (95% CI: 42.5–45.7) and 13.6% (95% CI: 12.5–14.7), respectively. We observed a significant variability in appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions among the participating centres (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Physicians at Spanish emergency rooms prescribe an excessive number of second-choice antibiotics for urinary tract infection treatment. There exists a high variability in antibiotic prescription among hospitals from different regions.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^f03525f1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To gain new insights into the epidemiology, imaging and conservative management of urinary tract infections based on the peer-reviewed literature of the last year.

Recent Findings

It has been estimated that 3% of prepubertal girls and 1% of prepubertal boys are diagnosed with urinary tract infections. Breastfeeding has been shown to offer significant protection against urinary tract infection in infants. Any young child with an acute pyelonephritis should be evaluated by dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan to confirm or rule out renal scarring. The voiding cystourethrogram can be performed within the first 7 days of diagnosis. Amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalosporin are the first-line antibiotics to treat children with uncomplicated urinary tract infection.

Summary

The incidence of urinary tract infections during infancy and childhood is high and influenced by the age and sex of the patient. Voiding cystourethrogram and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan are required for imaging. Short-course treatment is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^f021b1d9]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Stewardship strategies in the inpatient setting — local guidelines — The development and dissemination of institutional guidelines for diagnosing and treating common infectious syndromes is a key function of stewardship programs, and guidelines provide evidence-based and standardized diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on local data and promote adherence to the use of formulary drugs. Antibiotic guidelines can be developed to target common indications for antibiotic use, such as community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, hospital- and ventilator-associated pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, intraabdominal infections, and neonatal and pediatric sepsis, and these indications represent the majority of antibiotic use in most institutions. Inpatient guidelines can discuss appropriate clinical criteria suggestive of bacterial infections, diagnostic testing (including imaging studies when needed), specific empirical and targeted therapy (including dosing and options for severe drug allergies), and appropriate durations of therapy.

Key Points

Question

Are treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) recommended in national guidelines published in 2011 still optimal?

Findings

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### Impact of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment on outcome of non-critically ill children with bacterial infections [^565300bb]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Empiric antimicrobial therapy is the initial choice of antimicrobials pending microbiological results, and should cover the pathogens that are likely to cause the infection, taking into account the patient's age, the site of infection, medical history and other factors. Adequate antibiotic use is commonly defined as the use of an antimicrobial agent that is correct based on all available clinical, pharmacological, and microbiological data. Broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for initial empiric therapy of critically ill children with sepsis. There are guidelines for the empirical antibiotic treatment in several common pediatric situations, including the management of young infants < 60 days with fever, management of fever without source in infants and children < 3 years before and after the engagement of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine into the routine immunization program, and management of urinary tract infections in children < 24 months. However, selecting adequate empirical antibiotic therapy for children with suspected bacterial infections in other circumstances can be challenging and requires a number of considerations, including past medical history and comorbidities, site of infection and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.

Inadequate therapy can influence patient outcomes, while broad-spectrum treatment can lead to antibiotic resistance and can influence gut microbiome. One of the consequences of the rise in antibiotic resistance is the growing rate of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment of bacterial infections. Adequate empirical antibiotic therapy improves the outcomes for patients with severe sepsis, pediatric patients with severe pneumonia, children with nosocomial bloodstream infection, neonates with gram positive and gram negative bacteremia and more. However, the significance of adequate empirical antibiotic treatment in children with milder infections is debatable and may be influenced by many factors, such as infection severity, the source of infection, the patient's immune status, and the pathogenicity of the causative organism. Little is known about the implications of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections in not critically ill children.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaUrinary tract Infection-child [^d62767be]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in young children and may cause pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Long-term complications from renal scarring are low. The role of imaging is to evaluate for underlying urologic abnormalities and guide treatment. In neonates there is increased risk for underlying urologic abnormalities. Evaluation for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) may be appropriate especially in boys because of higher prevalence of VUR and to exclude posterior urethral valve. In children older than 2 months with first episode of uncomplicated UTI, there is no clear benefit of prophylactic antibiotic. Ultrasound is the only study that is usually appropriate. After the age of 6 years, UTIs are infrequent. There is no need for routine imaging as VUR is less common. In children with recurrent or complicated UTI, in addition to ultrasound, imaging of VUR is usually appropriate. Renal cortical scintigraphy may be appropriate in children with VUR, as renal scarring may support surgical intervention. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^16a9593f]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP urinary tract infection guideline — febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age: Action Statement 1 states that if a clinician decides that a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever requires antimicrobial therapy to be administered because of ill appearance or another pressing reason, the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA), because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation).

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^f56c04c2]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) oral antibiotics — dose for patients with normal renal function includes the following regimens: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg-125mg every 8 to 12 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Cefpodoxime 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours; Ceftibuten 9mg/kg daily (children) and 400mg daily or 200mg every 12 hours (adults); Cefuroxime 500mg every 12 hours; Cephalexin 500mg to 1000mg every 6 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Ciprofloxacin 500mg to 750mg every 12 hours; Levofloxacin 500mg to 750mg daily; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800mg-160mg every 12 hours. For other oral beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefdinir), comparative clinical outcomes data vs highly bioavailable oral alternatives are more limited and/or discouraging; consider use with infectious disease pharmacist consultation if alternatives are not available.
