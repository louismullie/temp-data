## Question

How much prednisone taken each day would prevent type two diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much prednisone taken each day would prevent type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the premise is even biologically plausible or supported by clinical guidelines. Then, I should verify prednisone's metabolic effects and whether any dose confers protection rather than risk. Next, I will review dose–response data for diabetes and hyperglycemia risk. After that, I should examine what "prevention" actually refers to in the steroid literature and distinguish it from prevention of type 2 diabetes per se. I will then consider high‑risk populations and contextual clinical settings. Finally, I will cross-check regulatory labeling and major guidelines to ensure no preventive role exists for prednisone and synthesize a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the core premise, because if this is wrong everything downstream will be misleading. Prednisone is a glucocorticoid that consistently raises glucose and increases the risk of hyperglycemia and new-onset diabetes; a large meta-analysis in people without preexisting diabetes reported glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia in 32.3% and diabetes in 18.6% of exposed individuals, which points in the opposite direction of "prevention" rather than toward it [^113tXkYF].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanisms to ensure I'm not missing a theoretical protective pathway. Glucocorticoids increase hepatic gluconeogenesis, induce peripheral insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue, impair beta-cell function, and blunt the incretin effect; these mechanisms coherently predict higher, not lower, glycemia with prednisone exposure and are demonstrated in both clinical and experimental studies [^113tXkYF] [^113dbCSh] [^111RCK6w] [^115Vq1vu].

> Wait, let me reconsider whether "very low doses" might be neutral or protective; I should double-check dose thresholds. Evidence from rheumatoid arthritis cohorts shows even 5 mg/day prednisone for recent months increases incident diabetes risk, with adjusted hazard ratios around 1.2–1.5, and modeling suggests 1 additional diabetes case per 133 patients treated over 6 months at 5 mg/day, while 30 mg/day raises risk approximately 3–10 fold with 1 additional case per 7 patients treated, indicating a dose–response without a protective window; moreover, endocrine guidelines define doses above roughly 4–6 mg/day prednisone as supraphysiologic, reinforcing that ≥ 5 mg/day sits in a risk-adding range rather than a protective one [^1151aVUp] [^111x4qVe].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could short-course moderate dosing behave differently? I will now examine short-term metabolic clamp and incretin physiology data. In healthy volunteers, 1 week of prednisone impaired insulin sensitivity in a clear dose-dependent fashion: about 13–15% reduction at 10 mg/day and roughly 33–35% at 25 mg/day, while 12 days of prednisolone 37.5 mg/day in healthy subjects markedly worsened glucose tolerance and reduced the incretin effect by about 40–50%, again arguing against any preventive impact on diabetes pathophysiology even over days to weeks [^111bipE8] [^113dbCSh].

> I should also review clinical settings with heavy steroid use to ensure we're not missing a context-specific exception. In hospitalized populations receiving high-dose glucocorticoids, over half of patients without diabetes develop hyperglycemia, and in respiratory disease and COPD cohorts, pooled prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia is around 39%, with exposure associated with roughly a 2.4-fold increase in new-onset hyperglycemia, underscoring a broadly diabetogenic effect across settings [^113tXkYF] [^112Pz8r5] [^111J8kA6].

> But wait, what if the literature about "prevention" refers not to preventing type 2 diabetes but to preventing steroid-induced hyperglycemia? I need to check the preventive strategies section. Indeed, prevention and mitigation efforts target glucocorticoid-induced dysglycemia using non-steroid interventions: lifestyle measures, metformin (with small RCTs showing attenuation of prednisone-induced glycemic rise), pioglitazone in select cases, inpatient NPH insulin protocols timed to steroid kinetics, and adjunctive SGLT2 inhibitors in hospitalized patients — these strategies counteract, not harness, prednisone's effects, confirming prednisone is the causative agent to be mitigated rather than a preventive therapy itself [^111mYqn8] [^112CLD14] [^111dyFcb] [^1131nTJ9].

> Next, I should review population-specific susceptibility to ensure no subgroup benefits from prednisone as prevention. Higher baseline risk — older age, obesity, HbA1c ≥ 6.0%, insulin resistance, renal impairment, and a higher type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score — amplifies the probability of steroid-induced hyperglycemia; additionally, a meaningful fraction of steroid-induced diabetes persists or unmasks underlying dysglycemia after steroid cessation, again contradicting any protective narrative [^113P5coh] [^1171fF7m] [^1144S446].

> Hold on, I should verify regulatory labeling and contemporary guidelines to ensure I'm not overlooking an approved or recommended preventive role. FDA labeling for prednisone emphasizes profound metabolic effects including hyperglycemia but does not cite diabetes prevention as an indication, and ADA Standards of Care for diabetes prevention focus on lifestyle, weight management, and agents like metformin and, in selected individuals, anti-obesity pharmacotherapy — not glucocorticoids; endocrinology society guidance further classifies doses above 4–6 mg/day prednisone as supraphysiologic, aligning with increased metabolic risk rather than prevention [^116sxzd7] [^11186NV8] [^112uHobf] [^1171fF7m].

> I initially wondered whether anti-inflammatory effects could theoretically improve insulin sensitivity in some inflammatory diseases, but let me double-check the net clinical signal; the clamp and epidemiologic data consistently show net worsening of insulin sensitivity and increased diabetes risk with prednisone exposure, making that hypothesis unsupported in practice, particularly beyond very short exposure windows and when doses exceed physiologic replacement levels [^111bipE8] [^1151aVUp] [^116dvsHw].

> Putting this all together, I need to ensure the final guidance is explicit and clinically actionable: no dose of prednisone prevents type 2 diabetes; instead, prednisone increases glycemia via multiple mechanisms in a dose- and duration-dependent fashion, with risk evident even at 5–10 mg/day, so prevention efforts should focus on minimizing steroid exposure when possible and using evidence-based diabetes prevention and steroid-induced hyperglycemia mitigation strategies, not glucocorticoids themselves [^113tXkYF] [^1151aVUp] [^11186NV8] [^111mYqn8].

There is **no safe daily prednisone dose** that prevents type 2 diabetes; even low doses (≤ 5 mg/day) increase risk, particularly with prolonged use or in high-risk patients [^1151aVUp]. Risk increases with both dose and duration, and individual susceptibility varies [^111x4qVe]; therefore, use the **lowest effective dose for the shortest duration** [^117CF1AN], monitor glucose closely [^113P5coh], and implement lifestyle measures to mitigate risk [^11186NV8] [^112uHobf].

## Dose-response relationship between prednisone and type 2 diabetes risk

- **Dose-dependent risk**: Higher prednisone doses and longer duration increase diabetes risk [^1151aVUp] [^113tXkYF].
- **Low-dose risk**: Even ≤ 5 mg/day raises risk, particularly with prolonged use [^1151aVUp] [^116z6o7Q].
- **High-dose risk**: ≥ 30 mg/day markedly increases risk, with 3–10-fold higher risk over 1–6 months [^1151aVUp] [^115q96rW].

| **Prednisone dose** | **Duration** | **Relative risk of diabetes** |
|-|-|-|
| 5 mg/day | 1 month | 1.20 (20% increase) [^1151aVUp] |
| 5 mg/day | 3 months | 1.43 (43% increase) [^1151aVUp] |
| 5 mg/day | 6 months | 1.48 (48% increase) [^1151aVUp] |
| 30 mg/day | 1 month | 3–10-fold increase [^1151aVUp] |
| 30 mg/day | 3 months | 3–10-fold increase [^1151aVUp] |
| 30 mg/day | 6 months | 3–10-fold increase [^1151aVUp] |

## Mechanisms of prednisone-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes

Prednisone promotes **hyperglycemia and diabetes** through multiple mechanisms [^113tXkYF]:

- **Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis**: Elevated hepatic glucose production [^113tXkYF] [^113X6nrz].
- **Reduced peripheral glucose uptake**: Insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue [^115Vq1vu].
- **Impaired insulin secretion**: β-cell dysfunction and reduced insulin output [^113tXkYF] [^113dbCSh].
- **Increased lipolysis and proteolysis**: More gluconeogenic substrates fueling hyperglycemia [^113tXkYF] [^113X6nrz].

---

## Individual patient factors influencing risk

Risk varies with **patient characteristics**:

- **Age**: Older adults have higher risk [^113p4szb] [^113P5coh].
- **BMI**: Overweight/obesity increases risk [^111GR21x] [^113P5coh].
- **Family history**: Genetic predisposition elevates risk [^111GR21x] [^111x4qVe].
- **Pre-existing glucose intolerance**: Higher baseline HbA1c or impaired fasting glucose increases risk [^113P5coh].
- **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome add risk [^113P5coh] [^115PwQSX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

There is **no safe daily prednisone dose** that eliminates diabetes risk; even low doses [^1151aVUp] can increase risk, particularly with prolonged use or in susceptible patients [^113P5coh]. Guidelines emphasize using the **lowest effective dose for the shortest duration** [^113P5coh] [^117CF1AN], with regular fasting and postprandial glucose monitoring during therapy [^113P5coh] [^111GR21x]. Lifestyle interventions — diet, exercise, and weight control — are recommended to reduce risk [^112uHobf] [^11186NV8].

---

## Preventive strategies and adjunctive therapies

To mitigate prednisone-induced diabetes risk, **lifestyle modifications** — diet, exercise, and weight loss — can reduce risk [^112uHobf] [^11186NV8]. In high-risk patients, **pharmacologic interventions** such as metformin or other agents may be considered [^112uHobf] [^111mYqn8]. Regular glucose monitoring enables early detection and management of hyperglycemia [^113P5coh] [^111GR21x].

---

## Long-term metabolic consequences of chronic prednisone use

Chronic prednisone use can cause **persistent hyperglycemia** from sustained insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction [^113P5coh] [^1144S446]. It also contributes to metabolic syndrome — central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension — and increases cardiovascular event risk [^113P5coh] [^115PwQSX] [^113E3ocm].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

There is **no safe daily prednisone dose** that prevents type 2 diabetes; even low doses can increase risk, particularly with prolonged use or in susceptible patients [^1151aVUp] [^113P5coh]. Clinicians should use the **lowest effective dose for the shortest duration**, monitor glucose closely, and implement lifestyle and pharmacologic measures to reduce risk [^117CF1AN] [^11186NV8] [^111mYqn8] [^111GR21x].

### Type 2 diabetes polygenic score predicts the risk of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes [^111x4qVe]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

To assess whether an increased genetic risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with the development of hyperglycemia after glucocorticoid treatment, a retrospective analysis was performed. The study involved individuals with no diagnosis of diabetes who received a glucocorticoid dose of ≥ 10 mg prednisone. The association between hyperglycemia and a T2D global extended polygenic score, constructed through a meta-analysis of two published genome-wide association studies, was analyzed.

Of the 546 individuals who received glucocorticoids, 210 developed hyperglycemia and 336 did not. The T2D polygenic score was significantly associated with glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, with an odds ratio of 1.4 per standard deviation of the polygenic score (P = 0.038).

Individuals with an increased genetic risk of T2D have a higher risk of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia. This finding offers a mechanism for risk stratification as part of a precision approach to medical treatment.

### Risk of incident diabetes mellitus associated with the dosage and duration of oral glucocorticoid therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^1151aVUp]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The estimated weight function (solid curve) from the best‐fitting weighted cumulative dose model, along with 95% confidence limits (dashed curves), was analyzed using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases (NDB). Weight functions are reported as 1/1,000 of the stated values (e.g. a weight of 10 equals 0.0010). It was observed that a higher weight function in the most recent time period suggests that recent treatment has a greater impact on the risk of diabetes mellitus, whereas the absence of a weight function beyond 6 months indicates that exposures more than 6 months ago have no impact on the risk of diabetes mellitus.

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for diabetes mellitus (DM) associated with different clinically plausible patterns of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy are shown in Table 4, estimated using the best‐fitting 12‐month CPRD weighted cumulative dose model. Compared to nonuse, taking 5 mg prednisone (PED) for the last 1, 3, and 6 months was significantly associated with 20%, 43%, and 48% increases, respectively, in risk. The extension of the duration of past exposure beyond 3 months had a minimal impact on the estimated hazard of DM occurrence, which is reflective of the very low weights estimated for GC exposures that occurred more than 3–4 months ago. On the other hand, risks associated with cumulative exposure to a high daily dose of 30 mg PED were notably higher, with past use for 1, 3, and 6 months associated with 3–10-fold increases in the risk of DM. In practical terms, these findings suggest that 5 mg or 30 mg PED for 6 months should contribute to 1 case of DM for every 133 or 7 patients treated, respectively. However, past users who discontinued GC therapy at least 6 months ago exhibited a risk of DM.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^11186NV8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically in the context of primary prevention with metformin, the ADA 2025 guidelines suggest offering pharmacotherapy for weight management, minimizing the progression of hyperglycemia, and reducing cardiovascular risk, to support person-centered care goals.

### Concurrent SGLT2 inhibitor use in patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised for high-dose corticosteroid therapy: Mitigated iatrogenic hyperglycaemia [^1131nTJ9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

**Background**: High-dose corticosteroid therapy is vital for anti-inflammation or immunosuppression in certain diseases but often causes hyperglycaemia, which is treated with insulin injections. Steroid-induced hyperglycaemia can result from both high-dose and consistent low- to intermediate-dose corticosteroids. Approximately 10%–15% of hospitalised patients consistently use corticosteroids, leading to hyperglycaemia in 56%–86% of individuals, regardless of preexisting diabetes. Insulin is the recommended treatment for this hyperglycaemia. Given that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) added to insulin therapy typically lower glycaemia and reduce insulin requirements in patients with diabetes, we hypothesised that SGLT2i could mitigate hyperglycaemia induced by high-dose corticosteroid therapy in individuals with diabetes. Consequently, we investigated the effects of SGLT2i on hyperglycaemia caused by high-dose intravenous corticosteroid pulse treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Learning from past failures of oral insulin trials [^115eyzxW]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Very recently, one of the largest type 1 diabetes prevention trials using daily administration of oral insulin or placebo was completed. After 9 years of study enrollment and follow-up, the randomized controlled trial failed to delay the onset of clinical type 1 diabetes, which was the primary endpoint. This unfortunate outcome follows the previous large-scale trial, the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1), which again failed to delay diabetes onset with oral insulin or low-dose subcutaneous insulin injections in a randomized controlled trial with relatives at risk for type 1 diabetes. These sobering results raise the important question, "Where does the type 1 diabetes prevention field move next?".

In this Perspective, we advocate for a paradigm shift in which smaller mechanistic trials are conducted to define immune mechanisms and potentially identify treatment responders. The stage is set for these interventions in individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes as Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet has identified thousands of relatives with islet autoantibodies, and general population screening for type 1 diabetes risk is underway. Mechanistic trials will allow for better trial design and patient selection based upon molecular markers prior to large randomized controlled trials, moving toward a personalized medicine approach for the prevention of type 1 diabetes.

### Glycemic control in hospitalized patients with diabetes receiving corticosteroids using a neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin protocol: A randomized clinical trial [^112CLD14]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Hospitalized patients with diabetes receiving corticosteroids are at risk of developing hyperglycemia and related complications. This study evaluated a neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin-based protocol in improving glycemic control in hospitalized patients receiving corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, prospective, non-blinded study in an inpatient setting involving patients with diabetes who were hospitalized and receiving prednisone ≥ 10 mg per day or equivalent. The high-dose corticosteroids group (prednisone > 40 mg/day or equivalent) received NPH insulin 0.3 U/kg between 0600 and 2000 hours if eating, or 0.2 U/kg between 2000 and 0600 hours if not eating. The low-dose corticosteroids group (prednisone 10–40 mg/day or equivalent) received 0.15 U/kg between 0600 and 2000 hours if eating, or 0.1 U/kg between 2000 and 0600 hours if not eating. The primary outcome measure was the mean blood glucose level measured pre-meal and at bedtime for days 1–5.

- **Results**: Mean blood glucose level was lower in the intervention group (n = 29) than in the usual care group (n = 31) [226.12 vs. 268.57 mg/dL, respectively, (95% CI for difference − 63.195 to − 21.695), p < 0.0001]. Significant differences in mean glucose levels were noted at fasting [170.96 vs. 221.13 mg/dL, respectively, (95% CI for difference − 72.70 to − 27.63), p < 0.0001] and pre-lunch [208 vs. 266.48 mg/dL, respectively, (95% CI for difference − 86.61 to − 30.36), p < 0.0001].

- **Conclusion**: In hospitalized patients with diabetes receiving corticosteroids, an NPH insulin-based protocol improves glycemic control.

### How do we identify people at high risk of type 2 diabetes and help prevent the condition from developing [^115v4eGs]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The review aims to evaluate the evidence regarding the identification of individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes, the conceptual and clinical criteria defining high risk, the prevention or delay of onset through lifestyle interventions, and the development of evidence from efficacy trials to effectiveness trials in real-world settings and implementation programs at scale.

The broad scope of this review prevented a systematic approach. Instead, a narrative review is presented, highlighting key themes and contemporary developments, based on landmark studies, systematic reviews, expert reviews, and meta-analyses.

While diagnostic thresholds for type 2 diabetes are well established, there remains no international consensus on the categorization of individuals at high risk. Debates persist over which laboratory tests to use, corresponding inclusion thresholds, the balance of clinical benefits and harms in defining thresholds, and how the cost of preventative interventions influences these thresholds in various populations. A remarkable international effort has evolved interventions for those at high risk from efficacy trials, through effectiveness trials, to large-scale implementation, with evidence reviewed for each stage.

Many countries are now emphasizing disease prevention to maintain healthcare system sustainability. To complement population-level interventions that add…

### Pathways to quality inpatient management of hyperglycemia and diabetes: A call to action [^115rkxQx]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

- **Patients receiving glucocorticoids**: Administration of glucocorticoids has a detrimental effect on glycemic control in patients with diabetes, presenting a significant challenge for both outpatient and inpatient management. The dose and frequency of steroid administration vary widely, and steroids may be tapered or stopped abruptly. Acute or short-term administration of methylprednisolone causes predominantly postprandial hyperglycemia that lasts 6 to 12 hours. Prednisone and dexamethasone have even longer durations of action. Because NPH insulin has a duration of action of approximately 8–12 hours, it has been used at the time of methylprednisolone administration to counteract the hyperglycemic effect of this glucocorticoid. NPH insulin may be stopped as soon as methylprednisolone is discontinued, providing a safer option than having residual insulin action from high doses of long-acting insulin lasting for hours after discontinuation of steroids. However, no systematic research has been published in patients receiving either multiple daily doses of steroids or in those receiving dexamethasone.

- **Suggested future directions**: Comparative effectiveness RCTs of approaches to insulin management on glycemic, clinical, and economic outcomes in patients with steroid-induced hyperglycemia receiving various types of glucocorticoids are needed. Recently published communications suggest that either GLP-1 agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors may be useful in treating steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Thus, comparative effectiveness RCTs comparing the effect of insulin-based to incretin-based therapies are suggested.

### Reduced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance induced by steroid treatment, relative physical inactivity, and high-calorie diet impairs the incretin effect in healthy subjects [^113dbCSh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

The loss of the incretin effect in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may be secondary to impaired glucose homeostasis. We investigated whether reduced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, induced by steroid treatment, relative physical inactivity, and a high-calorie diet in healthy young males, would impair the incretin effect.

The incretin effect was measured using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and isoglycemic IV glucose infusion (IIGI) in 10 healthy Caucasian normal glucose-tolerant male subjects without any family history of diabetes [age 24 ± 3 years (mean ± SD); body mass index 23 ± 2 kg/m²; glycosylated hemoglobin 5.4 ± 0.1%] before and at the end of a 12-day period with oral administration of prednisolone (37.5 mg once daily), high-calorie diet, and relative physical inactivity.

The 12-day intervention period resulted in significant increases in body weight [79 ± 5 vs. 80 ± 6 kg (mean ± SD), P = 0.03] and fasting plasma glucose (5.1 ± 0.1 vs. 5.6 ± 0.2 mmol, P = 0.016), whereas insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index 17.6 ± 1.7 vs. 9.2 ± 1.0, P = 0.0001) decreased. Glucose tolerance, as assessed by the 120-min plasma glucose value after OGTT (4.9 ± 1.1 vs. 7.8 ± 2.5 mmol, P < 0.0001) and area under curve (AUC) (152 ± 45 vs. 384 ± 53 mmol·4h, P = 0.002) during the OGTT, deteriorated. Additionally, the incretin effect [incretin effect (percent) = 100% × [(AUC(insulin, OGTT) − AUC(insulin, IIGI))/AUC(insulin, OGTT)]] also deteriorated (72 ± 5 vs. 43 ± 7%, P = 0.002).

### Glucocorticoid treatment and new-onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes in people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115m5wnZ]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat a range of conditions, including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, hematological diseases, malignancies, and COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. They are associated with hyperglycemia and new-onset diabetes, which in turn can lead to an increased risk of mortality and prolonged hospital stays.

While the relationship between glucocorticoid treatment and hyperglycemia is well-recognized, it remains relatively understudied. Previous systematic reviews of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia (GIH) have often included retrospective studies without comparing glucocorticoid-exposed individuals to those unexposed. Another systematic review focused solely on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) pertaining to respiratory diseases. These studies have demonstrated that exposure to exogenous systemic glucocorticoids increases the risk of new-onset diabetes in individuals without known diabetes and raises the risk of hyperglycemia in those with existing diabetes.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is acknowledged as a major public health issue. According to the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study, it accounted for 212.3 million cases and 3.3 million deaths, positioning it as the third leading cause of death globally. COPD also entails significant economic losses due to disability, with 74.4 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) recorded in 2019. Acute exacerbations of COPD are frequently treated with systemic glucocorticoids among other therapeutic options.

### Glucocorticoid treatment and new-onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes in people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115JFKuE]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

We used a pre-defined data extraction form to extract data. This details variable type, description, classification, and study details, population characteristics, and exposure and outcome.

We extracted data on the first author's name, year of publication, study location, sample size, population age, sex distribution, body mass index (BMI), baseline diabetes status, and details about COPD exacerbation and maintenance therapy if available. We collected data on the duration of follow-up, study design, and for RCTs, details about randomisation, blinding, and interventions in each arm. We extracted exposure data including glucocorticoid name, dose, frequency, route of administration, duration of treatment, whether or not the reference category from that study contained only participants not exposed to glucocorticoids, and description of tapering regimen if available.

Outcomes of interest were hyperglycaemia (defined as new-onset hyperglycaemia in people with or without diabetes before starting glucocorticoid treatment) and diabetes (defined as new-onset diabetes in people without a prior diagnosis of diabetes). Outcome-related data included the following: number and percentage of participants with new hyperglycaemia or diabetes in each study; method of diagnosing new-onset hyperglycaemia or diabetes; new glucose-lowering therapy in response to hyperglycaemia; and type of glucose-lowering treatment. If the prevalence or effect measures were not reported, we calculated prevalence based on the number of people who developed new-onset hyperglycaemia or diabetes.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1171fF7m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, which likely affects the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses a risk for adrenal insufficiency is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

- **Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose a risk for adrenal insufficiency**: 3–4 weeks or greater.
- **Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose a risk for adrenal insufficiency**: Any dose greater than the daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone).

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

- **Physiologic daily dose equivalent**: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above-mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability.
- **Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy**: Any dose greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above).
- **Short-term glucocorticoid therapy**: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration.

### Fresh insights into glucocorticoid-induced diabetes mellitus and new therapeutic directions [^113X6nrz]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid hormones were discovered to be potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapeutics in the 1940s, and their continued use and development have successfully revolutionized the management of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. However, long-term use of glucocorticoids is severely hampered by undesirable metabolic complications, including the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These effects occur due to glucocorticoid receptor activation within multiple tissues, resulting in inter-organ crosstalk that increases hepatic glucose production and inhibits peripheral glucose uptake. Despite the high prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia associated with their routine clinical use, treatment protocols for optimal management of the metabolic adverse effects are lacking or underutilized.

The type, dose, and potency of the glucocorticoid administered dictate the choice of hypoglycemic intervention (non-insulin or insulin therapy) that should be provided to patients. The longstanding quest to identify dissociated glucocorticoid receptor agonists that can separate the hyperglycemic complications of glucocorticoids from their therapeutically beneficial anti-inflammatory effects is ongoing, with selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators in clinical testing. Promising areas of preclinical research include new mechanisms to disrupt glucocorticoid signaling in a tissue-selective manner and the identification of novel targets that can selectively dissociate the effects of glucocorticoids.

### Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia in respiratory disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143r5Q4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

- **Research design and methods**: We conducted a literature search using electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane. For MEDLINE, we employed standard medical subject heading (MeSH) terms such as "glucocorticoids", "pneumonia", "pulmonary disease", "diabetes mellitus", and "community-acquired infection". Additionally, we utilized free text terms like "respiratory", "hyperglycaemia", "steroid", and "prednisolone". In EMBASE, we applied the "map term to subject heading" feature in Advanced Ovid Search. Reference lists from relevant articles were also scanned to supplement our search. We did not impose any restrictions on the publication dates of the studies.

- **Study selection**: Our search identified 262 citations in MEDLINE, 1475 in EMBASE, 138 in the Cochrane Database, and 112 through other means, plus an additional 48 citations from scanning reference lists. We included studies involving patients aged 18 years or older who were not treated with systemic (including inhaled) glucocorticoids at baseline for underlying conditions such as COPD, pneumonia, or interstitial lung disease. Trials were eligible if participants received glucocorticoids (≥ 5 mg prednisolone equivalent) or placebo, and/or additional therapies for underlying pulmonary disease, for at least 72 hours. We selected studies that documented glycaemia throughout, including diabetic status at baseline, and specified when therapy for hyperglycaemia commenced. Our primary outcome was hyperglycaemia as per each study-specific protocol, while the secondary outcome involved hyperglycaemia requiring therapy. Eight studies, comprising 2121 participants, met our inclusion criteria.

### Prednisone [^117CF1AN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The initial dosage of prednisone tablets, USP, may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients, higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If following a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued, and the patient should be transferred to other appropriate therapy.

It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by gradually decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Constant monitoring of the drug dosage is necessary.

Dosage adjustments may be required due to changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In such cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's needs.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^111mYqn8]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Lifestyle modifications, such as a hypocaloric diet and adequate low-to-moderate physical activity, are currently recommended for high-risk subjects predisposed to diabetes mellitus (DM) and should be recommended for all patients undergoing treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs). Some oral antidiabetic drugs have demonstrated the potential to improve glycemic control and prevent or delay the development of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia (GIH).

First-line treatment should potentially include drugs that increase insulin sensitivity, targeting postprandial hyperglycemia as well as the other adverse effects of GCs, such as weight gain, increased fracture risk, and cardiovascular events. Medications like metformin and pioglitazone can be continued in patients with pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D), unless there are contraindications.

Two small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that in patients initiated on a mean daily dose of 30 mg of prednisone equivalent, metformin therapy prevented the rise in plasma glucose after four weeks of treatment, as well as improving HbA1c levels, pancreatic beta cell function, and insulin sensitivity after twelve weeks.

- **Thiazolidinediones**: These act on both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, targeting two of the major metabolic undesired effects of GCs. However, the evidence base for the use of pioglitazone over other treatments is relatively weak. Pioglitazone improved glycemic control in prednisone-treated patients in a small study. However, it takes several weeks to achieve its maximal effect, and the treatment-related adverse effects — such as weight gain, increased fracture risk, fluid retention, and importantly, heart failure — may potentially exacerbate these issues.

### Dexamethasone in the era of COVID-19: Friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^116YSvLq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

The critical functions of glucocorticoids for survival involve the presence of receptors for these molecules in the regulation of gene transcription processes. The glucocorticoid receptor can function at least at three levels:

- **Recruitment of the general transcription machinery**: Modulation of transcription factor action through direct protein-protein interactions.
- **Modulation of chromatin structure**: This allows for the assembly of other gene regulatory proteins and the general transcription machinery on the DNA. Interactions between corticosteroid receptors and target genes, especially those related to the immune system, seem to be among the mechanisms responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects observed with pharmacological doses of these medications.

In addition to the genomic effects, glucocorticoids have non-genomic actions of significant therapeutic relevance. These effects are mediated by three different mechanisms:

- **Physicochemical interactions with cellular membranes**
- **Membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects**
- **Cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects**

Although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood, the non-genomic actions of glucocorticoids may play a role in the management of inflammatory diseases.

Since 1950, when cortisol was first synthesized, several studies have been carried out with the aim of synthesizing a steroid with a specific anti-inflammatory action. It quickly became clear that it was possible to alter the steroid molecule so that the glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid acti.

### Hyperglycemia related to high-dose glucocorticoid use in noncritically ill patients [^115q96rW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids commonly cause drug-induced diabetes. This association is well recognized, but available evidence does not answer clinically relevant issues in subjects without diabetes.

- **Methods**: Thirty-five individuals without diabetes, with a recent diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, were studied. Close systematic monitoring of fasting and postprandial glycemia and fasting insulin determinations, HOMA-insulin resistance, and HOMA β-cell function were performed. The primary objective was to define the incidence of secondary diabetes in patients treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. Secondary objectives were to specify the intensity, the moment it appears, and the evolution of hyperglycemia. Additional goals included examining the risk factors, mechanisms, and impact of continuous and cyclical glucocorticoids on the development of hyperglycemia.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients was 38.4 ± 18.7 years. The incidence of diabetes was 40.6% and was found after the first week; half the time, it occurred between the second and fourth weeks. Two-thirds spontaneously normalized by eight weeks. Continuous glucocorticoid administration had a higher incidence of fasting hyperglycemia (P = 0.003). Mean peak insulin levels were significantly higher in cases of diabetes.

- **Conclusions**: High-dose prednisone for 2 to 3 months produced an elevated incidence of diabetes, usually with mild hyperglycemia occurring between the second and fourth weeks, normalizing spontaneously in all cases. Hyperglycemia was more frequent with continuous doses.

### Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia [^116pCGeT]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To review the literature on glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia and provide a strategy for its treatment, an electronic MEDLINE and a library review of the relevant literature published from 1950 to March 2009 were conducted.

Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia is common in patients with and without diabetes. The odds ratio for new-onset diabetes mellitus in patients treated with glucocorticoids ranges from approximately 1.5 to 2.5. Total glucocorticoid dose and duration of therapy are strong predictors of diabetes induction. Other risk factors include age and body mass index. Failure to treat glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia is related to the presumed short duration of glucocorticoid treatment administration and the emphasis on fasting plasma glucose only. Understanding the pharmacodynamics of glucocorticoids can lead to increased recognition and improved treatment of the condition. Recent demonstrations that even short-term elevations in blood glucose levels may be associated with adverse sequelae argue for greater attention to this condition.

Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia is an important clinical finding that, if recognized, can be effectively treated. A relatively simple schema for the proactive management of corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia, which has been effective and easily adaptable to both inpatient and outpatient settings, is proposed.

### Management of hyperglycaemia and steroid (glucocorticoid) therapy: a guideline from the Joint British Diabetes Societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^111GR21x]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids (steroids) are widely used across many medical specialties for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. However, one of their major side effects is the development of hyperglycaemia. It is well recognized that high glucose levels in people with diabetes in hospitals are associated with harm and increased lengths of hospital stay. The use of glucocorticoid (steroid) treatment in people with pre-existing diabetes will undoubtedly result in worsening glucose control, which may be termed 'steroid-induced hyperglycaemia', and will warrant temporary additional and more active glycaemic management.

A rise in glucose may occur in people without a known diagnosis of diabetes, which may be termed 'steroid-induced diabetes'. There is a lack of evidence to guide how people with hyperglycaemia should be managed, and much of the guidance given here is a consensus based on best practice collated from around the United Kingdom. Where evidence is available, this is referenced. These guidelines on the management of people with diabetes treated with steroids have been adapted specifically for Diabetic Medicine.

**Effect on concomitant corticosteroid use**: The total actual cumulative corticosteroid dose included all corticosteroids taken during the study. This included the prednisone taper regimen per protocol, add-on prednisone prior to Week 12, corticosteroid use due to rescue, or corticosteroid use during the treatment period to manage an adverse reaction not related to PMR. The total actual cumulative prednisone equivalent corticosteroid dose was lower in the Kevzara arm (mean [SD] 1039.5 [612.2] mg and median 777 mg) relative to the placebo arm (mean [SD] 2235.8 [839.4] mg and median 2044 mg).

### Risk of diabetes and the impact on preexisting diabetes in patients with lymphoma treated with steroid-containing immunochemotherapy [^114vh8Gk]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment with high-dose steroids can lead to a risk of steroid-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) or dysregulation of preexisting DM due to increased resistance to insulin in muscle, liver, and fat tissue, and increased glucose production in the liver. To our knowledge, no studies have shown β-cell toxicity following R-CHOP treatment. In our study, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients did not have a statistically significant higher cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes following immunochemotherapy treatment compared with comparators, suggesting no increased risk of β-cell toxicity after treatment (P = 0.69; see supplemental Figure 4).

A previous retrospective study of 80 lymphoma patients investigated the risk of DM following R-CHOP treatment and found that 32.5% developed DM during chemotherapy treatment. The study defined DM by the American Diabetes Association's criteria based on blood glucose values: fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL, random plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL along with symptoms of hyperglycemia, or HbA1c level of ≥ 6.5%. Even though temporary hyperglycemia is a good measurement for steroid-induced DM, it may not predict whether DM persists in the long term. Only three patients were treated with insulin for hyperglycemia in that study, and the treatment was only short-term during the first or second cycle of chemotherapy.

### Medication-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus: A review of current literature and practical management strategies [^113tXkYF]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

- **Glucocorticoids**: Perhaps the most well-known class of medication that leads to hyperglycemia and diabetes is glucocorticoids. A meta-analysis (N = 34,907) by Liu et al. reports that glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes occur at a rate of 32.3% (p = 0.003) and 18.6% (p = 0.002), respectively, in patients without pre-existing diabetes. On a global level, glucocorticoid use is linked to 2% of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Another study found that in a hospitalized population receiving high-dose glucocorticoids, 56% of patients without diabetes developed hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L or 200 mg/dL). Furthermore, the incidence of glucocorticoid-induced diabetes mellitus is likely underreported as a result of the use of fasting blood glucose instead of postprandial/random blood glucose, as glucocorticoids typically cause elevated postprandial blood glucose values.

- **Mechanism of action**: Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia is mediated via binding of glucocorticoid receptors within hepatic, adipose, skeletal, and pancreatic tissue. Within the liver, glucocorticoids upregulate the enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenic precursors such as amino acids from protein catabolism and fatty acids from lipolysis are delivered to the liver to further accelerate gluconeogenesis. Hepatic insulin resistance is another critical mechanism. Normally, insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis, but in the presence of glucocorticoids, gluconeogenesis is allowed to continue despite the presence of insulin.

### Practical guide to glucocorticoid induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes [^114vgzQL]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Despite the widespread clinical usage of glucocorticoid therapy and well-documented evidence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes, these complications remain under-diagnosed and under-monitored. Although consensus guidelines strongly focus on hospital inpatient management, comprehensive clinical evidence offers pragmatic solutions for monitoring and usage in community settings. The lack of early diagnosis and appropriate management proves costly to patients in both the short and long term, as well as to the healthcare system as a whole.

### Glycemic control in hospitalized patients with diabetes receiving corticosteroids using a neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin protocol: A randomized clinical trial [^111dyFcb]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). High credibility.

Hospitalized patients with diabetes who receive corticosteroids are at risk of developing hyperglycemia and related complications. This study evaluated a neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin-based protocol for improving glycemic control in hospitalized patients receiving corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, prospective, non-blinded study conducted in an inpatient setting. It involved patients with diabetes who were hospitalized and receiving prednisone ≥ 10 mg per day or an equivalent dosage. The high-dose corticosteroids group (prednisone > 40 mg/day or equivalent) received NPH insulin at 0.3 U/kg between 0600 and 2000 hours if eating, or 0.2 U/kg between 2000 and 0600 hours if not eating. The low-dose corticosteroids group (prednisone 10–40 mg/day or equivalent) received 0.15 U/kg between 0600 and 2000 hours if eating, or 0.1 U/kg between 2000 and 0600 hours if not eating. The primary outcome measure was the mean blood glucose level, measured pre-meal and at bedtime over days 1–5.

- **Results**: The mean blood glucose level was lower in the intervention group (n = 29) compared to the usual care group (n = 31) [226.12 vs. 268.57 mg/dL, respectively, (95% CI for difference -63.195 to -21.695), p < 0.0001]. Significant differences in mean glucose level were noted at fasting [170.96 vs. 221.13 mg/dL, respectively, (95% CI for difference -72.70 to -27.63), p < 0.0001] and pre-lunch [208 vs. 266.48 mg/dL, respectively, (95% CI for difference -86.61 to -30.36), p < 0.0001].

In conclusion, for hospitalized patients with diabetes receiving corticosteroids, an NPH insulin-based protocol improves glycemic control.

Managing steroid-induced hyperglycemia

Glucocorticoids (GCs) cause hyperglycemia through several mechanisms, including a decrease in pancreatic insulin secretion, an increase in hepatic gluconeogenesis, a decrease in insulin sensitivity, and an impairment of the incretin effect. The hyperglycemic effect is influenced by GC potency, duration of action, route of administration, and duration of use. Factors to consider when managing steroid-induced hyperglycemia include history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, eating status, and steroid factors, such as the type of GC, dose, and dosing schedule.

Hyperglycemia can often occur in patients receiving GCs, regardless of whether or not they have a history of diabetes. Glucocorticoids can cause hyperglycemia through a decrease in pancreatic insulin secretion, an increase in hepatic gluconeogenesis, a decrease in insulin sensitivity, or an impairment of the incretin effect. The correlation between GC usage and the degree of blood glucose elevation is unclear, as patients have different diabetes histories and often receive different GC formulations, doses, and dosing schedules, leading to varying hyperglycemic effects. All of these factors must be considered when managing steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Glucose monitoring is recommended for patients on GCs, especially those with diabetes or a history.

### Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes: Call for action [^1122kiev]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There is no generally accepted treatment strategy for managing glucocorticoid‐induced diabetes and hyperglycaemia, and British recommendations are based on consensus. Recent narrative reviews summarized the strategies used to manage glucocorticoid‐induced diabetes and hyperglycaemia in various settings. Differences in pharmacokinetics between glucocorticoids complicate the management of glucocorticoid‐induced diabetes and hyperglycaemia according to existing guidance. For example, in people without prior diabetes on once daily glucocorticoid therapy, guidance from the Joint British Diabetes Societies recommends sulphonylureas initially if capillary blood glucose is above 12 mmol/L on two occasions in 24 hours. Metformin may be used due to its favorable effects on insulin sensitivity while dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors can be effective in mild hyperglycaemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. However, none of the non‐insulin agents, except sulphonylurea, including metformin, pioglitazone, DPP‐4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists, are recommended as they have not demonstrated efficacy in acute glucocorticoid‐induced hyperglycaemia. If hyperglycaemia cannot be controlled on sulphonylureas, the guidance recommends starting insulin. Insulin is also recommended in the setting of glucocorticoid‐induced diabetes and multiple daily doses of glucocorticoids. Evidence from trials assessing the effectiveness of different insulin regimens is limited.

### Glucocorticoid treatment and new-onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes in people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Pz8r5]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we aimed to estimate:

- **The prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia (GIH)**: Whether the prevalence of GIH varies by age, baseline diabetes status, treatment duration, ascertainment of glycaemia, definition of hyperglycaemia, study design, and year of publication.
- **The relative risk (RR) of new-onset hyperglycaemia**: In individuals exposed versus those not exposed to systemic glucocorticoids.

- **Methods**: We searched electronic databases until 9 November 2023 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies. These studies included adults diagnosed with COPD, with or without diabetes at baseline, using systemic glucocorticoids equivalent to prednisolone ≥ 5mg/day for ≥ 3 days if exposed. Hyperglycaemia was defined as a blood glucose level above a study-specific cut-off. We extracted data on study and participant characteristics, exposure, and outcome. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence estimate of GIH. Prevalence was expressed as the proportion of people who developed hyperglycaemia among all exposed to systemic glucocorticoids during follow-up. We calculated RR of new-onset hyperglycaemia in those exposed versus non-exposed to systemic glucocorticoids from eight studies.

- **Results**: Of 25,806 citations, we included 18 studies comprising 3,642 people, of whom 3,125 received systemic glucocorticoids and 1,189 developed hyperglycaemia. The pooled prevalence of GIH was 38.6% (95%CI 29.9%-47.9%) with significant heterogeneity (I² = 96%, p < 0.010), which was partially explained by differences in study design.

### Dexamethasone in the era of COVID-19: Friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^116LAn6q]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

The disclosure in the media of a benefit with the use of dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 infection sets precedents for self-medication and inappropriate use of corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: This is a critical interpretive synthesis of the data available in the literature on the effects of the use of corticosteroids and the impact that their indiscriminate use may have on patients with diabetes. Reviews and observational and experimental studies published until June 18, 2020, were selected.

- **Results**: Corticosteroids are substances derived from cholesterol metabolism that interfere with multiple aspects of glucose homeostasis. Interactions between corticoid receptors and target genes seem to be among the mechanisms responsible for the critical functions of glucocorticoids for survival and anti-inflammatory effects observed with these medications. Corticosteroids increase hepatic gluconeogenesis, reduce peripheral use of glucose, and increase insulin levels. Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids have a pro-adipogenic function, increasing the deposition of abdominal fat, and lead to glucose intolerance and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, these drugs play a role in controlling liver metabolism and can lead to the development of hepatic steatosis. Glucocorticoids reduce the recruitment of osteoblasts and increase the number of osteoclasts, which results in increased bone resorption and greater bone fragility. Moreover, these medications cause water and sodium retention and increase the response to circulating vasoconstrictors.

### Effects of low-dose prednisolone on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and abdominal adiposity in patients with inflammatory rheumatologic disease [^116z6o7Q]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

There is emerging support for targeting diabetes therapy at its specific underlying pathophysiology. The paradigm for this is monogenic diabetes, in which an understanding of the derangements of carbohydrate metabolism has led to the use of directed therapies and improved glycemic control. It is hoped that targeting therapy at the metabolic perturbations underlying hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes will have a similar benefit. Although low-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) are associated with an increased odds ratio of developing new-onset diabetes, there remains a dearth of evidence regarding optimal treatment for GC-induced hyperglycemia. We have thus sought to define the changes in carbohydrate metabolism induced by low-dose prednisolone in older patients to enable a specific therapeutic approach in this setting.

- **Basal EGP findings**: In this study, basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) was 8% higher after short-term low-dose prednisolone administration (P = 0.050). Previous reports of GC-mediated effects on basal EGP have been inconsistent, with van Raalte et al. finding no change in basal EGP after low-dose prednisolone. However, withdrawal of a low GC dose in patients with Addison's disease markedly reduced basal EGP. It is likely that differing patient characteristics alter their susceptibility to the metabolic effects of low-dose GCs and underlie the variability in the literature. In subjects using long-term low-dose prednisolone, basal EGP was 14% higher, although this result did not reach statistical significance. The lack of statistical significance may represent the variability inherent in a cross-sectional study.

### Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia in respiratory disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VdUzv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are used to treat several diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. In the UK, the prevalence of glucocorticoid use at any one time is approximately 1%. Among hospital inpatients, prevalence exceeds 10%, with most patients receiving glucocorticoids to treat underlying respiratory illness. Glucocorticoids are associated with well-recognized metabolic complications, including hyperglycaemia. In patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and community-acquired pneumonia, hyperglycaemia is associated with prolonged hospital admissions and mortality.

Data regarding glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia are derived from retrospective prescription databases or prospective studies, which vary in glucocorticoid type, dose, treatment regime, administration route, and underlying disease. These studies indicate that glucocorticoids worsen hyperglycaemia in people with known diabetes; however, the magnitude of this risk, and the risk of developing hyperglycaemia after glucocorticoid exposure in people without diabetes, is not clear.

Using meta-analytical techniques, the present study estimates the relative risk of glucocorticoid treatment and hyperglycaemia in individuals with and without diabetes and underlying respiratory disease. It also estimates the association between glucocorticoid use and initiation of hypoglycaemic therapy.

### Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes: Call for action [^113c7Rci]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Despite being common, glucocorticoid-induced diabetes and hyperglycaemia remain neglected clinical issues, necessitating action to generate more evidence to underpin clinical guidance. Significant gaps in our understanding of the natural history, prediction, and management of glucocorticoid-induced diabetes exist. These gaps persist despite its negative consequences, including emergency department attendances, increased length of hospital stay, and diabetes-related complications. These challenges hinder efforts to strengthen guidance for detecting, monitoring, and managing glucocorticoid-induced diabetes. High-quality data from rigorously designed studies, both randomised controlled trials and large-scale studies using data from routine healthcare, are urgently needed to address these gaps.

### Effects of low-dose prednisone on bone metabolism [^116rCQcV]. Journal of bone and mineral research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Prednisone 5 mg/day suppresses multiple indices of bone formation in a randomized placebo-controlled trial in healthy postmenopausal females. This suggests that even low doses of prednisone may reduce bone repair or renewal and may have adverse effects on bone mass and/or bone strength.

Introduction

High doses of chronic glucocorticoids are known to have adverse effects on bone, and measures to prevent bone loss are well established for doses > 7.5 mg daily, because these doses can cause premature or exaggerated osteoporosis. However, it is unclear if chronic prednisone doses of 5 mg daily have the same effects on bone. There are no established recommendations for preventing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in people taking prednisone 5 mg daily, a dose used frequently in medical practice to treat diseases of the lungs, joints, skin, muscles, eyes, nerves, etc. Our primary objective was to test whether prednisone 5 mg daily affects serum and urine indices of bone metabolism in healthy postmenopausal women. Our secondary objectives were to determine if prednisone 5 mg affected systolic or diastolic blood pressure or causes side effects.

Materials and Methods

A double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled 8-week trial in 50 healthy postmenopausal women was conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital Outpatient General Clinical Research Center. Patients were randomly assigned to prednisone 5 mg daily or matching placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week recovery phase. Markers of bone formation and resorption were determined at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. In

Use of supraphysiologic glucocorticoids, defined as a prednisone equivalent dose greater than 5 mg daily, has been associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients, showing an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.81–2.15), with increasing risk corresponding to higher daily and cumulative doses. This association was not observed with daily glucocorticoid doses below 5 mg prednisone equivalent. Estimates from these studies need to be interpreted cautiously due to potential underlying confounding factors, such as the underlying disease and disease severity.

### Glucocorticoid treatment and new-onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes in people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mVP8o]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Detection bias in this systematic review cannot be excluded. It is possible that the individuals who received systemic glucocorticoids were more likely to seek medical attention compared to those who did not receive systemic glucocorticoids. Consequently, these individuals were more likely to have blood glucose concentration measured and hyperglycaemia documented.

Conversely, it is also possible that people who did not receive systemic glucocorticoids sought medical attention more frequently for the underlying COPD compared to those who received systemic glucocorticoids. However, this is less likely to have occurred because the severity of COPD was comparable in exposed and non‐exposed individuals in randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, in seven of the ten observational studies reviewed, all participants were exposed to the treatment.

New‐onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes may have been associated with pre‐existing metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance, reduced glucose utilization by peripheral tissues, increased hepatic glucose output, and beta‐cell dysfunction related to previous courses of systemic glucocorticoids. However, an assessment based on the reported data could not be conducted.

### Hyperglycemia related to high-dose glucocorticoid use in noncritically ill patients [^1142WedM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Another question that has not been carefully evaluated in previous studies is the course of hyperglycemia. In this study, two-thirds of subjects with prediabetes or DM normalized spontaneously by the eighth week. The rest, at 12 weeks, showed normal glycemia or were in the range of prediabetes. This spontaneous remission in the majority of the participants could be attributed to the absence of other comorbidities, which might impair insulin secretion or action. Many cases of severe hyperglycemia related to GC use occurred in subjects with an aggregated acute disease.

Some authors have proposed that in individuals with a prediabetes state, GC could precipitate the onset of DM. In our study, mean basal serum insulin and HOMA-IR were not different between participants with CGC or CyGC or when comparing subjects with and without DM. These findings suggest that at the beginning, there was no difference in insulin resistance between the groups. However, in participants on CGC and CyGC who developed DM, there was a significant increase in insulin secretion compared with those who did not. This finding suggests that the primary mechanism involved in the onset of DM is most likely increased insulin resistance, associated with a limited compensatory ability of the pancreas.

### Risk of diabetes mellitus in systemic lupus erythematosus: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113p4szb]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Medications used for SLE management, including glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors, have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Glucocorticoids are commonly administered to SLE patients and cause hyperglycemia through several mechanisms, such as inducing or worsening preexisting insulin resistance, increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis, causing islet cell dysfunction, and stimulating appetite and weight gain in the long term.

Although an increased diabetes risk with glucocorticoids is well recognized, the effect sizes vary greatly. Our meta-analysis of SLE patients from moderate-quality evidence revealed that glucocorticoids are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Despite its potent anti-inflammatory effects, it could lead to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, increase the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic key genes, enhance gluconeogenesis in the liver, and antagonize insulin-mediated glucose disposal in a dose-dependent manner. The clinical implications of systemic glucocorticoids have been explored in previous studies, in which glucocorticoid users were approximately twice as likely to develop acute and chronic adverse clinical outcomes than non-users. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines recommend minimizing the daily dose or, where possible, discontinuing glucocorticoids due to associated risks. In addition, glucocorticoid exposure is also related to a high economic burden on patients and the healthcare system. Therefore, effective glucocorticoid-sparing strategies may reduce the burden.

### Practical guide to glucocorticoid induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes [^115PwQSX]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as increased healthcare costs. Hyperglycaemia can result in osmotic symptoms and lead to acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS). It is associated with poorer outcomes, including longer or more frequent hospitalisations, increased infection risk, and a greater burden of morbidity and mortality. Long-term microvascular and macrovascular risks may be exacerbated in patients who receive glucocorticoid treatment, especially when coupled with inflammatory diseases, thereby increasing cardiovascular risk.

Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes are often underdiagnosed and under-monitored. A study involving adult patients in the UK who were prescribed systemic glucocorticoids for over three months revealed variations in glucose monitoring across the country. It was found that less than one-third of these patients received glucose monitoring before commencing glucocorticoid therapy, and fewer than 60% of those prescribed glucocorticoids for more than a year received any glucose monitoring after exposure. This may partly be due to a lack of consensus guidance on community- and outpatient-based recommendations regarding diagnosis and monitoring.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the clinical relevance of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia. The pandemic resulted in an increase in hospital admissions for viral-induced acute illness, as well as a rise in the use of glucocorticoids. COVID-19 has highlighted these challenges.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116Enp9S]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Empowering patients with knowledge of the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid therapy is critical. Patients require information in an age, education level, and learning style-appropriate format, along with access to supportive social resources such as family members, care providers, and disease-oriented support groups. Inclusion of at least one family member or primary caregiver in all education sessions is recommended.

Patient education and empowerment to adjust glucocorticoid doses according to stressors are essential in preventing severe symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis. A large study surveying patients with adrenal insufficiency, including those with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, demonstrated low confidence in self-management to prevent adrenal crisis. Poor disease knowledge and lack of awareness of adrenal insufficiency subtype diagnosis were associated with higher rates of adrenal crisis. Standardized patient education programs for patients and their relatives have been useful for sustainably improving knowledge regarding the prevention of adrenal crisis, as well as self-confidence in managing the disease.

The risk for developing adrenal insufficiency and the potential for adrenal crisis during glucocorticoid treatment and taper is low but increases with the cumulative number of risk factors, including glucocorticoid potency, administration route, dose, and treatment duration.

### Dexamethasone in the era of COVID-19: Friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^111TYdVQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

According to Axelrod et al, for patients who used corticosteroids for a period of less than or equal to 7 days, medication withdrawal can be done abruptly without risk of adrenal suppression. More recent references suggest that, when used for less than 14 days, there is a low risk of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression. We suggest that the time for abrupt suspension should be assessed individually and can be considered for patients who used low doses of corticosteroids for a period of less than or equal to 14 days. For those who used higher doses (greater than or equal to the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisone per day) for more than 7 days, we suggest a gradual dose reduction. When treatment is carried out for a longer period than 14 days, a gradual reduction according to the total dose administered is usually recommended.

- **Dosage recommendations**: We suggest, for patients using a daily dose greater than 40 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), to start with a reduction of 5 to 10 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is between 20 and 40 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest a reduction of 5 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is between 10 and 20 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest a reduction of 2.5 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is less than 10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest reducing 2.5 mg every 2 to 4 weeks and then administering 2.5 mg of prednisone on alternate days for 2 to 4 weeks until complete suspension.

It is important to remember that, for patients using insulin, dose adjustment should be performed during the cortico.

### Practical guide to glucocorticoid induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes [^115UCd7a]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids, also known as steroids, are a class of anti-inflammatory drugs widely utilized in clinical practice for various conditions. They are associated with a range of side effects, including abnormalities of glucose metabolism. Multiple guidelines have been published to illustrate the best management of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes in a variety of settings. This article discusses best clinical practices, including diagnosis, investigations, and ongoing management of glucocorticoid-induced dysglycaemia in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

- **Pharmacological management**:

	- **T1DM**: It is recommended to titrate regular insulin by 10–20% as required to achieve glucose targets. In basal-bolus regimens, the evening basal insulin can be transferred to the morning and basal doses increased by 10–20% daily until targets are met. If hyperglycaemia remains persistent despite insulin titration, specialist input may be required to consider adjustment of insulin therapy.

	- **T2DM**: Recommendations suggest commencing once daily morning gliclazide 40 mg and titrating as required until glycaemic control is achieved. If at maximal dose of morning gliclazide, it is recommended to commence an additional evening dose or consider commencing insulin therapy. Once daily intermediate-acting insulin in the morning is recommended initially, but twice daily or basal bolus regimens can be considered to achieve glucose targets. In those already on insulin therapy, doses can be titrated up by 10–20% to achieve targets and evening basal doses can be transferred to the morning.

- **Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia**:

	- Gliclazide 40 mg once daily in the morning is recommended and can be titrated up to a maximum dose of 240 mg once daily in the morning as per BG targets. If glycaemic control is not achieved, an evening dose of gliclazide can be added and intermediate-acting insulin considered.

### High dose prednisolone lowers plasma glycated albumin levels compared to actual glycemic control: A retrospective observational study [^114mKj7p]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widely used for the treatment of diseases such as autoimmune disease and chronic kidney disease. However, such treatment predisposes patients to diabetes, with odds ratios for new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients treated with glucocorticoids shown to be between 1.5 and 2.5. Steroid-induced DM is associated with marked postprandial hyperglycemia due to peripheral insulin resistance and islet cell dysfunction.

Insulin sensitizers, such as thiazolidinediones and metformin, are often used as first-line therapies. However, because insulin secretory capacity is also reduced, insulin therapy and oral hypoglycemic drugs may also be employed. If glycemic control remains insufficient, intensive insulin therapy may be required following steroid therapy. It is crucial to detect steroid-induced DM early to prevent the need for insulin therapy.

- **Glycemic control indices**: Several indices are now used to evaluate glycemic control, but glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) is the most frequently used. However, in specific conditions such as hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinopathies, discrepancies between actual glycemic control and A1c concentration occur. In such cases, measurement of glycated albumin (GA) is recommended. Since albumin (Alb) has a shorter half-life than hemoglobin, GA reflects the efficacy of glycemic control over a shorter period of time than A1c and more accurately reflects postprandial than fasting hyperglycemia. Because early-stage steroid-induced DM exhibits postprandial hyperglycemia with normal fasting glucose levels, GA is an appropriate indicator.

### Practical guide to glucocorticoid induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes [^115Vq1vu]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids contribute to hyperglycaemia by disrupting various physiological metabolic mechanisms, increasing insulin resistance and decreasing insulin secretion. Insulin production is reduced due to decreased expression of glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2) and glucokinase receptors on pancreatic beta cells.

- **Pathophysiology**: Reduced insulin sensitivity results from the effects of glucocorticoids on the liver, skeletal muscle, and fat cells. The liver plays an important role in maintaining glycaemic control through glucose production (gluconeogenesis) and glycogen store breakdown (glycogenolysis). Glucocorticoids induce enzymes that promote gluconeogenesis and increase lipolysis and proteolysis.

	- Skeletal muscle represents the largest reserve of glycogen in the body, storing 80% of postprandial glucose. Glucocorticoids interfere with signalling cascades via glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), responsible for the clearance of glucose postprandially in response to insulin. This interference results in reduced glucose uptake in muscle cells and reduced glycogen synthesis.

	- Additionally, glucocorticoids promote lipolysis, leading to an increase in serum-free fatty acids and triglycerides. They also cause fat deposition in organs while reducing peripheral fat reserves.

This understanding of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids impact glycaemic control is critical for managing glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes effectively.

### Glucocorticoid treatment and new-onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes in people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111J8kA6]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia in people with COPD and the risk of new-onset hyperglycaemia associated with glucocorticoid treatment has not been comprehensively quantified. Using data from 18 studies, we found that the prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia was 38.6%. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids for COPD was associated with 2.4 times higher risk of new-onset hyperglycaemia versus no glucocorticoid treatment.

Healthcare providers looking after people with COPD who are treated with systemic glucocorticoids should consider measuring blood glucose before starting systemic glucocorticoid therapy and throughout the treatment course to enable timely detection and management of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia.

### Hyperglycemia related to high-dose glucocorticoid use in noncritically ill patients [^112nwqnM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Drug-induced hyperglycemia is a clinical condition that can occur as a result of impaired insulin secretion or action, or the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. The administration of glucocorticoids (GC) is a common cause. Gulliford et al. found that 2% of newly diagnosed cases of diabetes mellitus (DM) were due to orally administered GC. Its use is associated with multiple side effects, with DM being one of the most important. In cases of DM prior to the use of GC, worsening of glycemic control is typical; however, in patients without DM, glucocorticoids may transiently or permanently induce hyperglycemia.

Two mechanisms are predominantly responsible for hyperglycemia secondary to GC: a decrease in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Although the link between GC and hyperglycemia was identified more than 50 years ago, clinically relevant questions remain unanswered. The incidence of DM secondary to the use of GC, the profile of subjects in whom it occurs, the consequences of comorbidities, the moment it becomes apparent, its intensity, and its evolution in the short and medium term are not well defined. An incidence of 2% to 50% has been reported. Published studies have used methodologies accountable for this broad range. Most are retrospective, with a very large GC dose range, different DM diagnostic criteria, comorbid conditions that affect insulin sensitivity, and no description of the course of hyperglycemia. It is important to find answers to clinical scenarios in which GC are used. A common setting is the administration of high dose (> 1 mg/kg).

### Diabetes mellitus, energy metabolism, and COVID-19 [^112XnqXk]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Early administration of dexamethasone improves outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe non-COVID-19 ARDS and in those with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support. However, steroid-induced hyperglycemia is a common downside of steroid treatment in hospitalized individuals that needs to be taken into account.

Glucocorticoids have several detrimental effects on glucose metabolism, including reduced insulin-stimulated activity of the insulin receptor substrate 1-associated phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phosphorylation of insulin-signaling proteins, translocation of the glucose transporter type 4, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase, and increased glucose production. Steroid use is a predictor of in-hospital and persistent diabetes at 3 months but not 5 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. In analyses that excluded people who received steroid treatment, the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes within 6 months of COVID-19 or influenza was still significantly increased in COVID-19 vs. influenza, with steroid treatment apparently contributing to diabetes risk only in people with mild disease.

Importantly, in people with less severe COVID-19 (i.e. receiving no oxygen or simple oxygen), higher doses of corticosteroids were shown to have detrimental consequences and should be avoided. The benefits of steroid therapy in people with severe COVID-19 have been clearly demonstrated, and the fear of steroid-induced hyperglycemia should not hold one back from using it.

### Glucocorticoid treatment and new-onset hyperglycaemia and diabetes in people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132CPRS]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Several analyses considered in our protocol were not conducted due to a lack of relevant data. Of the 18 selected studies, 13 included both people with and without diabetes at baseline. However, the numbers of people with new-onset hyperglycaemia were not reported by diabetes status but rather for all exposed and non-exposed individuals. Five studies included only participants without diabetes. Consequently, we were unable to calculate the prevalence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia (GIH) by diabetes status, but we did so for individuals with or without diabetes versus those without diabetes. As expected, a higher prevalence of GIH was observed in studies including both populations.

New-onset hyperglycaemia was reported exclusively among exposed individuals in 10 of the 18 studies. In contrast, eight studies provided data for both exposed and unexposed participants, enabling us to calculate the relative risk (RR) of new-onset hyperglycaemia associated with glucocorticoids. However, we could not stratify the RR analysis by baseline diabetes status because only one of these eight studies was conducted on participants without diabetes at baseline. The remaining seven studies included individuals both with and without diabetes, not reporting new-onset hyperglycaemia numbers by diabetes status. Additionally, among studies incorporating both diabetic and non-diabetic baseline participants, baseline glucose control details were absent.

### Short-term metabolic effects of prednisone administration in healthy subjects [^111bipE8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid activity is well established to cause impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, yet no study has evaluated dose-dependent effects of low-dose prednisone during short-term oral administration.

- **Methods**: The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of daily 10 or 25 mg prednisone administration for one week on insulin sensitivity. This was achieved by employing a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp (Step 1: insulin infusion = 20 mU/m²/min; Step 2: insulin infusion = 80 mU/m²/min) in healthy, lean males. The amount of glucose infused at steady-state to maintain stable blood glucose [90 mg/dl (4.95 mmol/l)] was used to calculate several indices of insulin sensitivity.

- **Results**: During Step 1 of the clamp, whole body glucose disposal (M) was reduced by 35% (p = 0.003) and M/I was reduced by 29% (p = 0.025) for 25 mg prednisone compared to placebo. No appreciable effect of 10 mg prednisone was observed. During Step 2, M was reduced by 33% (p = 0.001) and 15% (p = 0.006) for 25 and 10 mg prednisone compared to placebo; and the M/I ratio was reduced by 31% (p < 0.001) and 13% (p = 0.026) respectively. The insulin sensitivity index, Si, calculated as the quotient of augmentation of M/I between Step 1 and Step 2, was reduced by 35.3% (p < 0.01) and 23.5% (p < 0.05) for 25 and 10 mg prednisone, respectively.

Administration of relatively low pharmacological doses of prednisone for one week impaired insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner in healthy males. These observed changes in insulin sensitivity are likely to be clinically significant.

### Practical guide to glucocorticoid induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes [^1144S446]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

After stopping glucocorticoid therapy, up to a third of people with glucocorticoid-induced diabetes may go on to develop persistent diabetes. There is a degree of diagnostic uncertainty in cases of steroid-induced diabetes where baseline glucose levels and/or HbA1c have not been checked prior to exposure to glucocorticoids. Some data suggest that glucocorticoids unmask pre-existing glucose metabolism disorders, thus leading to persistent diabetes. Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids can lead to metabolic and cardiovascular adverse events, with the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular events increased two- to three-fold. Over 50% of individuals taking chronic glucocorticoid treatment develop features of metabolic syndrome, further contributing to cardiovascular risk. The prognosis of glucocorticoid complications in the context of COVID-19 is not yet known, and further prospective studies into this are required.

### The metabolic responses induced by acute dexamethasone predict glucose tolerance and insulin secretion over 10 years in relatives of type 2 diabetic subjects [^113dM21e]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the metabolic and insulin secretory responses to dexamethasone with the metabolic responses observed at 10 years in normoglycaemic relatives of type 2 diabetic and healthy control subjects.

- **Methods**: Twenty relatives and 20 matched control subjects were studied twice at 0 year (pre- and post-dexamethasone) and at 10 years, employing a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with serial measurements of glucose and insulin, for determination of glucose tolerance and calculations of acute insulin release (ΔI₃₀/ΔG₃₀; insulinogenic index) and insulin sensitivity (SIHOMA).

- **Results**: Following dexamethasone, the relatives group developed varying degrees of glucose intolerance, associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and insulinogenic index. By 10 years, fasting glucose and 2-h OGTT glucose were raised in the relatives group, especially in the relatives most metabolically affected by dexamethasone, including a reduced insulinogenic index. Multiple regression analysis of the data in relatives demonstrated that the 2-h OGTT glucose and fasting glucose values at 10 years depended on the 0-year post-dexamethasone 2-h OGTT glucose, post-dexamethasone fasting glucose, and post-dexamethasone insulin sensitivity, r² adj = 56% (p < 0.001) and r² adj = 60% (p < 0.0001), respectively. No pre-dexamethasone metabolic or insulin secretory responses entered these models.

- **Conclusions**: In relatives, fasting and 2-h OGTT glucose concentrations and β-cell responses to acute dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance are similar to those observed at 10.

### Dexamethasone in the era of Covid-19: Friend or foe? An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes [^114cYkQP]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

This study provides a critical interpretive synthesis of literature data regarding corticosteroid use, highlighting their effects, potential risks, and benefits, particularly in patients with diabetes. It addresses practical issues related to glucocorticoid use and withdrawal in diabetes. An iterative search strategy was utilized, reviewing articles indexed on the PUBMED platform and manually exploring reference lists when necessary. The search utilized keywords such as "corticosteroids AND mechanism of action", "corticosteroids AND pharmacology", "corticosteroids AND diabetes", "corticosteroids AND COVID-19", "corticosteroids AND hyperglycemic AND treatment", and "corticosteroids AND withdrawal". The selection included reviews, observational and experimental studies in vitro and in vivo involving animals and humans, published until June 18, 2020, relevant to corticosteroid effects. Titles and abstracts underwent screening to select articles for analysis, followed by a full-text review. Conducted by two independent researchers, J. A. and G.B.O., they reviewed specific content and synthesized relevant information to provide an overview and discuss the subject's context. All authors reviewed and agreed with the final synthesis content.

### Actos [^11541pLL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, with durations ranging from 16 to 26 weeks, were conducted to evaluate the use of Actos as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. These trials examined Actos at doses of up to 45 mg or placebo once daily in a total of 865 patients.

- **26-week dose-ranging monotherapy trial**: In this trial, 408 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg of Actos, or placebo once daily. Therapy with any previous antidiabetic agent was discontinued eight weeks prior to the double-blind period. Treatment with 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of Actos produced statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at the endpoint compared to placebo [see Figure 1, Table 17].

- **24-week placebo-controlled monotherapy trial**: In this trial, 260 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to one of two forced-titration Actos treatment groups or a mock-titration placebo group. Therapy with any previous antidiabetic agent was discontinued six weeks prior to the double-blind period. In one Actos treatment group, patients received an initial dose of 7.5 mg once daily. After four weeks, the dose was increased to 15 mg once daily, and after another four weeks, the dose was increased to 30 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial (16 weeks).

Figure 1 shows the time course for changes in HbA1c in this 26-week study.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112uHobf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically with respect to primary prevention, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend offering more intensive preventive approaches to individuals at particularly high risk of progression to diabetes. This includes patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², higher glucose levels such as fasting plasma glucose of 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L), 2-hour post-challenge glucose of 173–199 mg/dL (9.6–11.0 mmol/L), HbA1c ≥ 6.0% (≥ 42 mmol/mol), or a history of gestational diabetes mellitus.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad [^113P5coh]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Several studies have attempted to dissect the risk factors that underpin the susceptibility to developing glucocorticoid-induced diabetes mellitus (GC-induced DM). Age (greater than 60 years), prior glucose intolerance, impaired fasting levels of glucose, insulin resistance, being overweight, and elevated hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1C) greater than 6% all appear to drive increased risk. A recent meta-analysis identified that the risk of GC-induced DM was greatest in subjects with abdominal adiposity and in those taking higher doses of glucocorticoids for longer periods. In a further study of patients with rheumatic or renal diseases receiving 40 mg of prednisolone daily, 66% developed GC-DM over a 4-week period. Higher HbA1c levels (> 6.0%, OR 3.05) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (< 40 mL/min/1.73 m², OR 3.42) were both identified as independent risk factors for developing GC-DM.

In general, the effects of steroids are usually transient and reversible. Glucocorticoids are likely to cause the greatest effects during the second and fourth week, but effects can be seen just a few hours after administration during high-dose treatment. Thereafter, as the glucocorticoid dose is reduced, glucose metabolism often returns to pretreatment levels and GC-induced hyperglycemia is expected to resolve. However, this is not the case for all individuals; hyperglycemia can persist up to two years after discontinuation, suggesting long-lasting detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity and β-cell dysfunction or unmasking of a pre-existing glucose metabolism disorder.
