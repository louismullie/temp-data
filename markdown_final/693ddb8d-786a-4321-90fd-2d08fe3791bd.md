## Question

latuda equivalent for vraylar 3mg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what dose of lurasidone (Latuda) would be approximately equivalent in therapeutic effect to cariprazine (Vraylar) 3 mg daily for antipsychotic purposes, recognizing no head-to-head trials exist to define this directly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication underlying the 3 mg cariprazine dose, because dose–response differs for schizophrenia, mania, and bipolar depression. Then, I should verify the minimum effective doses (MEDs) from fixed‑dose trials and labels to apply a dose‑equivalence method. Next, I should check pharmacokinetic and switching considerations that can influence cross‑titration. Finally, I will integrate tolerability and special population adjustments to produce a practical, safety‑aware recommendation with monitoring points [^113TbtdA] [^112tT5G5] [^112ytG7T] [^1133D2L5].

> Let me first confirm the anchor doses by indication. For cariprazine, 3 mg per day is within the recommended effective range for schizophrenia and for bipolar I mania, with clear efficacy signals in fixed‑dose trials, whereas in bipolar depression the most robust signal is at 1.5 mg and 3 mg often does not separate from placebo at the primary endpoint, so "3 mg" implies a schizophrenia/mania anchor unless otherwise specified [^113TbtdA] [^115thqrv] [^1151q8Co] [^115PdKQM] [^1136KKoA] [^112nQRvy]. For lurasidone, the labeled adult starting dose for schizophrenia is 40 mg daily with an effective range of 40–160 mg, while for bipolar I depression the labeled starting dose is 20 mg daily with an effective range of 20–120 mg, which establishes different MED anchors by indication [^112tT5G5] [^116zWZzS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what equivalence framework should I use. My first instinct is to map cariprazine 3 mg to lurasidone 60 mg because both agents can require mid‑range dosing in acutely ill schizophrenia, but wait, let me verify with an evidence‑based equivalence approach. Using the minimum effective dose method based on fixed‑dose RCTs and labels, the MED for lurasidone in schizophrenia is 40 mg, and the effective anchor for cariprazine in schizophrenia is 3 mg, suggesting that cariprazine 3 mg roughly corresponds to lurasidone 40 mg rather than 60 mg — so I should correct that initial estimate to 40 mg as the closest single‑step equivalent, recognizing inherent uncertainty without head‑to‑head data [^112ytG7T] [^112tT5G5] [^113TbtdA] [^115thqrv].

> But wait, what if the underlying indication is bipolar depression rather than schizophrenia. I need to ensure I do not misapply a schizophrenia‑based equivalence to bipolar depression. In bipolar depression, cariprazine 1.5 mg carries the stronger and more consistent efficacy signal than 3 mg, whereas lurasidone is effective from 20 mg with no clear average advantage for 80–120 mg over 20–60 mg, so if the intent is antidepressant efficacy, an approximate cross‑indication mapping would be cariprazine 1.5 mg to lurasidone 20–40 mg, and cariprazine 3 mg does not provide extra antidepressant benefit to anchor a higher lurasidone target, reinforcing a 20–40 mg lurasidone zone for bipolar depression use cases [^115PdKQM] [^1136KKoA] [^112nQRvy] [^112tT5G5].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics and practical switching details because these can modify how an "equivalent" dose is realized clinically. Cariprazine has very long effective half‑lives due to active metabolites, so dose effects accrue and wash out over weeks; therefore, when switching, I need to cross‑titrate cautiously and recognize that residual cariprazine activity can transiently "overlap" with lurasidone, potentially reducing the immediate lurasidone requirement for a brief period, whereas lurasidone itself reaches steady state within about 7 days and must be taken with food of at least ~350 calories to ensure adequate exposure, or the effective dose will be underdelivered if taken fasting [^113TbtdA] [^1133D2L5]. Let me double‑check feasibility of a direct switch: short open‑label switching data suggest starting lurasidone at 40 mg or 40→80 mg over one week is generally tolerated when tapering the prior antipsychotic over 1–2 weeks, which can guide a cross‑taper from cariprazine while monitoring for relapse or akathisia during the overlap period [^113qKT3o].

> I will now examine tolerability constraints that might pull the "equivalent" dose up or down. Both agents can cause akathisia and other EPS, and for lurasidone specifically, akathisia is dose‑related, rising from roughly 10–12% at 40–80 mg to approximately 22% at 120 mg in schizophrenia trials, so if akathisia emerges at 40 mg, I should not reflexively escalate, and conversely, if underresponding without adverse effects, a move to 60–80 mg may be reasonable for schizophrenia targets, while keeping bipolar depression targets lower on average [^113KG8Lo] [^116C7P1h] [^112tT5G5]. Hmm, wait a minute — do consensus dose‑equivalence tables change this. The classical mean‑dose method does not provide lurasidone data, limiting its utility here, which supports sticking with the MED‑based approach and clinical trial ranges rather than over‑extrapolating from other frameworks [^113GNHz5].

> I need to ensure special populations are accounted for because these can alter the "equivalent" ceiling. For lurasidone, in moderate renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum recommended dose is reduced to 80 mg, and in severe hepatic impairment it is capped at 40 mg, so if I am targeting a schizophrenia equivalent of 40 mg, that remains feasible across renal and hepatic impairment but escalation above 40–80 mg may be constrained by organ function, whereas cariprazine is not recommended in severe renal or hepatic impairment, which also affects switch decisions and follow‑up [^1144JdKu] [^114RJger] [^1138ep3g] [^1117nPj8] [^111KjyK2].

> Pulling this together, I should confirm the practical, indication‑specific equivalence and a monitoring plan. For schizophrenia or bipolar I mania, cariprazine 3 mg maps most closely to lurasidone 40 mg daily taken with food, with the option to titrate to 60–80 mg based on response and tolerability after 1–2 weeks, recognizing residual cariprazine during cross‑taper could transiently augment effect, and that lurasidone exposure is food‑sensitive and reaches steady state within a week [^112ytG7T] [^112tT5G5] [^1133D2L5] [^113TbtdA]. For bipolar depression, because cariprazine 1.5 mg is the more reliable antidepressant dose and 3 mg does not consistently add benefit, the lurasidone target is typically 20–40 mg, with escalation above 60 mg rarely required for antidepressant effect on average, aligning dose with clinical response and tolerability rather than forcing a "3 mg cariprazine" anchor that is not pharmacodynamically meaningful for this indication [^115PdKQM] [^1136KKoA] [^112tT5G5].

> Final recommendation with self‑check: Start lurasidone 40 mg nightly with food if you are replacing cariprazine 3 mg for schizophrenia or mania, reassess in 7–14 days at lurasidone steady state, and titrate by 20 mg to 60–80 mg if needed and tolerated, watching carefully for akathisia and EPS, orthostatic effects, and overall efficacy, while tapering cariprazine over 1–2 weeks given its long half‑life; if the clinical target is bipolar depression, initiate lurasidone 20–40 mg and avoid assuming that "3 mg cariprazine" necessitates a higher antidepressant dose, then adjust within 20–60 mg by response and side effects, applying renal/hepatic caps as indicated [^112tT5G5] [^1133D2L5] [^113KG8Lo] [^113TbtdA] [^1144JdKu] [^114RJger]. Hold on, I should verify one more nuance: any lack of response at week 2 on lurasidone 80 mg in schizophrenia may justify escalation to 160 mg, but that pertains to nonresponders already at 80 mg, so it does not alter the initial 40 mg equivalence anchor for cariprazine 3 mg, it just informs later step‑up if clinically necessary and permissible by comorbidity [^1142QuhP].

---

Bottom line: there is **no direct 1:1 dose conversion** between Vraylar 3 mg and Latuda because they have different mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and clinical uses [^113TbtdA] [^116YphAD]. For schizophrenia, **Vraylar 3 mg roughly aligns with Latuda 40–80 mg**; for bipolar depression, **Vraylar 1.5–3 mg corresponds to Latuda 20–60 mg**. Always **titrate to clinical response and tolerability**, and monitor for akathisia, metabolic effects, and EPS [^113KG8Lo] [^116C7P1h].

---

## Pharmacological profiles

### Mechanism of action

Mechanistically, **Vraylar (cariprazine)** is a partial agonist at D2/D3 (D3-preferring) and 5-HT1A, and an antagonist at 5-HT2B/2A, while **Latuda (lurasidone)** is an antagonist at D2, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7, with partial agonist activity at 5-HT1A and minimal H1/M1 affinity [^116YphAD].

---

### Pharmacokinetics

| **Parameter** | **Vraylar (cariprazine)** | **Latuda (lurasidone)** |
|-|-|-|
| Half-life | ~2–4 days (parent); ~1–3 weeks (DDCAR) | ~18 hours [^1133D2L5] |
| Time to steady-state | ~3–4 weeks | ~7 days [^1133D2L5] |
| Metabolism | CYP3A4 (major), CYP2D6 (minor) | CYP3A4 |
| Food effect | None significant [^113TbtdA] | Take with ≥ 350 kcal meal [^1133D2L5] |

---

## Clinical indications and dosing

### Schizophrenia

For schizophrenia, **Vraylar** is dosed at 1.5–6 mg/day, with 3 mg a common effective dose [^113TbtdA], while **Latuda** is dosed at 40–160 mg/day, typically 40–80 mg [^112tT5G5] [^114nV8xL].

---

### Bipolar disorder

For bipolar disorder, **Vraylar** is given at 3–6 mg/day for mania/mixed and 1.5–3 mg/day for bipolar depression [^113TbtdA], while **Latuda** is dosed at 20–120 mg/day for bipolar depression and is not approved for mania/mixed [^112tT5G5].

---

## Dose equivalence considerations

There is **no validated 1:1 conversion**; use clinical judgment and titrate to effect [^115YndGG]. In schizophrenia, **Vraylar 3 mg is approximately equivalent to Latuda 40–80 mg**, and in bipolar depression, **Vraylar 1.5–3 mg corresponds to Latuda 20–60 mg**.

---

## Clinical efficacy and safety

### Efficacy

Vraylar is effective for **schizophrenia (including negative symptoms), mania/mixed, and bipolar depression** [^116coFTo] [^113TbtdA], while Latuda is effective for **schizophrenia and bipolar depression** but **not for mania/mixed** [^114nV8xL] [^111ypiWQ] [^112tT5G5].

---

### Safety and tolerability

| **Adverse effects** | **Vraylar (cariprazine)** | **Latuda (lurasidone)** |
|-|-|-|
| Akathisia | Common (dose-related) [^116C7P1h] | Common (dose-related) [^113KG8Lo] |
| Metabolic effects | Moderate risk | Lower risk [^113KG8Lo] |
| EPS | Moderate risk | Lower risk [^113KG8Lo] |
| Sedation | Moderate | Lower [^113KG8Lo] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Switching entails tapering Vraylar over **1–2 weeks** and starting Latuda at **40 mg/day**, titrating by 40 mg every 3–5 days based on response and tolerability, while monitoring should focus on **akathisia, metabolic changes, and EPS** during transition [^112tT5G5] [^113qKT3o].

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Age**: Start low and go slow in older adults [^111KjyK2].
- **Comorbidities**: Consider metabolic, cardiovascular, and hepatic/renal status [^1144JdKu].
- **Concomitant medications**: Review for CYP3A4 interactions [^1133D2L5].

### Vraylar [^113TbtdA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Vraylar is administered orally once daily and can be taken with or without food. Due to the long half-life of cariprazine and its active metabolites, dose changes will not be fully reflected in plasma for several weeks. Prescribers should monitor patients for adverse reactions and treatment response for several weeks after initiating Vraylar and after each dosage change [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Recommended dosage in schizophrenia**: The starting dosage of Vraylar is 1.5 mg orally once daily. The recommended dosage range is 1.5 mg to 6 mg orally once daily. The dosage can be increased to 3 mg on Day 2. Depending on clinical response and tolerability, further dose adjustments can be made in 1.5 mg or 3 mg increments. The maximum recommended dosage is 6 mg orally once daily. In short-term controlled trials, dosages above 6 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Recommended dosage in manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder**: The starting dosage of Vraylar is 1.5 mg orally once daily. The dosage should be increased to 3 mg orally once daily on Day 2. The recommended dosage range is 3 mg to 6 mg orally once daily. Depending on clinical response and tolerability, further dose adjustments can be made in 1.5 mg or 3 mg increments. The maximum recommended dosage is 6 mg orally once daily. In short-term controlled trials, dosages above 6 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness that outweighs dose-related adverse reactions.

- **Schizophrenia**:

	- **Adults**: The recommended starting dose of LATUDA is 40 mg once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. LATUDA has been shown to be effective in a dose range of 40 mg per day to 160 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The maximum recommended dose is 160 mg per day.

	- **Adolescents (13–17 years)**: The recommended starting dose of LATUDA is 40 mg once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. LATUDA has been shown to be effective in a dose range of 40 mg per day to 80 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The maximum recommended dose is 80 mg per day.

- **Depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder**:

	- **Adults**: The recommended starting dose of LATUDA is 20 mg given once daily as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Initial dose titration is not required. LATUDA has been shown to be effective in a dose range of 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The maximum recommended dose, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, is 120 mg per day. In the monotherapy study, the higher dose range (80 mg to 120 mg per day) did not provide additional efficacy, on average, compared to the lower dose range (20 to 60 mg per day) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Effectiveness of lurasidone in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder switched from other antipsychotics: a randomized, 6-week, open-label study [^113qKT3o]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of switching patients to lurasidone using three different dosing strategies.

- **Method**: Adults with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a nonacute phase of illness were randomized to one of three lurasidone dosing regimens for the initial two weeks of the study: (1) 40 mg/day for two weeks, (2) 40 mg/day for one week, increased to 80 mg/day on day 8 for week 2 (up-titration group), and (3) 80 mg/day for two weeks. Lurasidone was then flexibly dosed (40–120 mg/day) for the subsequent four weeks. The preswitch antipsychotic agent was tapered by day 7 to 50% of the original dose and discontinued by the end of week 2. Subjects were stratified based on whether the primary preswitch antipsychotic medication was classified as "sedating" (olanzapine or quetiapine) or "nonsedating" (all other antipsychotics). The primary outcome measure was time to treatment failure, defined as any occurrence of insufficient clinical response, exacerbation of underlying disease, or discontinuation due to an adverse event. The study was conducted from June 2010 to May 2011.

- **Results**: Of 240 subjects treated in this study, 86 (35.8%) were treated with an antecedent sedating antipsychotic, and 154 (64.2%) were treated with an antecedent nonsedating antipsychotic. Nineteen (7.9%) of the 240 patients experienced treatment failure. No clinically relevant differences were observed when the three randomized switch groups were compared. Treatment failure rates were 10/86 (11.6%) among subjects who had been receiving a preswitch sedating antipsychotic versus 9/154 (5.8%) among subjects who had been receiving a preswitch nonsedating antipsychotic.

### Cariprazine versus risperidone monotherapy for treatment of predominant negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: A randomised, double-blind, controlled trial [^116coFTo]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

Although predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia can be severe enough to cause persistent impairment, effective treatment options are lacking. We aimed to assess the new generation antipsychotic cariprazine in adult patients with predominant negative symptoms.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3b trial, we enrolled adults aged 18–65 years with long-term (> 2 years), stable schizophrenia and predominant negative symptoms (> 6 months) at 66 study centres (mainly hospitals and university clinics, with a small number of private practices) in 11 European countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web response system to 26 weeks of monotherapy with fixed-dose oral cariprazine (3 mg, 4.5 mg [target dose], or 6 mg per day) or risperidone (3 mg, 4 mg [target dose], or 6 mg per day). Previous medication was discontinued over 2 weeks. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 26 or end of treatment on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factor score for negative symptoms (PANSS-FSNS). It was analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population of patients who had follow-up assessments within 5 days after last receipt of study drugs with a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

- **Findings**: Between May 27, 2013, and Nov 17, 2014, 533 patients were screened and 461 (86%) patients were randomised to treatment (230 for cariprazine and 231 for risperidone).

### Dose equivalents for second-generation antipsychotics: The minimum effective dose method [^112ytG7T]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians need to know the right antipsychotic dose for optimized treatment, and the concept of dose equivalence is important for many clinical and scientific purposes.

- **Methods**: We refined a method presented in 2003, which was based on the minimum effective doses found in fixed-dose studies. We operationalized the selection process, updated the original findings, and expanded them by systematically searching more recent literature and by including 13 second-generation antipsychotics. To qualify for the minimum effective dose, a dose had to be significantly more efficacious than placebo in the primary outcome of at least one randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose trial. In a sensitivity analysis, two positive trials were required. The minimum effective doses identified were subsequently used to derive olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine equivalents.

- **Results**: We reviewed 73 included studies. The minimum effective daily doses/olanzapine equivalents based on our primary approach were: aripiprazole 10 mg/1.33, asenapine 10 mg/1.33, clozapine 300 mg/40, haloperidol 4 mg/0.53, iloperidone 8 mg/1.07, lurasidone 40 mg/5.33, olanzapine 7.5 mg/1, paliperidone 3 mg/0.4, quetiapine 150 mg/20, risperidone 2 mg/0.27, sertindole 12 mg/1.60, and ziprasidone 40 mg/5.33. For amisulpride and zotepine, reliable estimates could not be derived.

- **Conclusions**: This method for determining antipsychotic dose equivalence entails an operationalized and evidence-based approach that can be applied to various antipsychotic drugs. As a limitation, the results are not app.

### Efficacy and acceptability of lurasidone for bipolar depression: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^111ypiWQ]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Our study aimed to identify RCTs that investigated the efficacy and acceptability of lurasidone for treating bipolar depression. The inclusion criteria were as follows:

1. Only RCTs comparing lurasidone with placebo or different doses of lurasidone (at least two arms, with or without co-administration) were eligible. In this study, placebo was defined as zero dose of lurasidone.
2. Participants were required to have a diagnosis of bipolar depression based on established criteria (e.g. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).
3. RCTs were required to quantify the severity of depression, using a validated scale, before and after lurasidone administration (e.g. the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)).

The following studies were excluded:

- **Studies comparing lurasidone to other active treatments**: Where there was no placebo control group, as these could not provide data on the equivalent dose of lurasidone.
- **Participants with a diagnosis other than bipolar disorder**: Such as schizophrenia.
- **Studies that did not report outcomes related to depressive symptoms**.
- **Duplicated data from a research protocol**: If multiple publications had the same research origin, only the most comprehensive report with the largest sample size was included.

Two independent reviewers (Y-WL and C-WH) initially screened titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant studies. Both reviewers conducted full-text reviews of the selected articles independently (inter-rater reliability = 0.83). A third reviewer (P-TT) resolved any disagreements that arose.

### Latuda [^1133D2L5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The activity of LATUDA is primarily due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetics of LATUDA is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 20 mg to 160 mg. Steady-state concentrations of LATUDA are reached within 7 days of starting LATUDA.

Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) elimination half-life was 18 (7) hours.

- **Absorption and distribution**: LATUDA is absorbed and reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1–3 hours. It is estimated that 9–19% of an administered dose is absorbed. Following administration of 40 mg of LATUDA, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution was 6173 (17.2) L. LATUDA is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins.

In a food effect study, LATUDA mean Cmax and AUC were about 3-times and 2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting conditions. LATUDA exposure was not affected as meal size was increased from 350 to 1000 calories and was independent of meal fat content [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

In clinical studies establishing the safety and efficacy of LATUDA, patients were instructed to take their daily dose with food [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Vraylar [^111KjyK2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical trials of Vraylar did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This caution reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as the prevalence of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Vraylar is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: No dosage adjustment for Vraylar is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 5 and 9) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Usage of Vraylar is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 10 and 15). Vraylar has not been evaluated in this patient population.

- **Renal impairment**: No dosage adjustment for Vraylar is required in patients with mild to moderate (CrCL ≥ 30 mL/minute) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Usage of Vraylar is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/minute). Vraylar has not been evaluated in this patient population.

- **Smoking**: No dosage adjustment for Vraylar is needed for patients who smoke. Vraylar is not a substrate for CYP1A2; smoking is not expected to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of Vraylar.

### Latuda [^1144JdKu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies with Latuda did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In elderly patients with psychosis (ages 65 to 85), Latuda concentrations (20 mg/day) were similar to those in young subjects. It is unknown whether dose adjustment is necessary on the basis of age alone. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with Latuda are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Latuda is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

- **Renal impairment**: Reduce the maximum recommended dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CLcr < 50 mL/minute). Patients with impaired renal function (CLcr < 50 mL/minute) had higher exposure to lurasidone than patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Greater exposure may increase the risk of Latuda-associated adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Reduce the maximum recommended dosage in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 7). Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 7) generally had higher exposure to lurasidone than patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Greater exposure may increase the risk of Latuda-associated adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

- **Other specific populations**: No dosage adjustment for Latuda is specified for other populations.

### Latuda [^113KG8Lo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The findings presented are based on short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing adult studies for schizophrenia in which Latuda was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 160 mg (n = 1508 patients).

- **Commonly observed adverse reactions**: The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with Latuda included somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea.

- **Adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment**: A total of 9.5% (143/1508) Latuda-treated patients and 9.3% (66/708) of placebo-treated patients discontinued the study due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with Latuda that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate.

- **Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of 2% or more in Latuda-treated patients**: Adverse reactions associated with the use of Latuda (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and Latuda incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are summarized in the study data.

- **Dose-related adverse reactions in the schizophrenia studies**: Akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were found to be dose-related. The frequency of akathisia increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for Latuda 20 mg, 10.7% for Latuda 40 mg, 12.3% for Latuda 80 mg, and 22.0% for Latuda 120 mg). Akathisia was reported by 7.4% (9/121) of patients receiving 160 mg/day. In the placebo group, akathisia occurred in 3.0% of subjects. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms was similarly reported to increase with dosage.

### Short-term efficacy and tolerability of lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114nV8xL]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). High credibility.

Lurasidone, an azapirone derivative, is a novel second-generation antipsychotic with potent binding affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 7, 5-HT 1A, and noradrenaline alpha 2C receptors. This updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the short-term efficacy and tolerability of lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: Double-blinded RCTs reporting on the short-term effects of lurasidone were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) and number needed to harm (NNH) were computed.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs with 16 active arms that involved 2,373 patients with acute schizophrenia, who were randomized to either lurasidone (20–160 mg/day; n = 1,570) or placebo (n = 803) groups. Lurasidone was superior to placebo with regard to change in total psychopathology [SMD: -0.34, (95% CI: -0.48, -0.20), P < 0.00001], positive symptoms [SMD: -0.47, (95% CI: -0.57, -0.36), P < 0.00001], negative symptoms [SMD: -0.34, (95% CI: -0.45, -0.22), P < 0.00001], and general psychopathology [SMD: -0.36, (95% CI: -0.48, -0.24), P < 0.00001]. Results were consistent for total psychopathology in 11 out of the 13 subgroups. Lurasidone led to higher weight gain [SMD: 0.15, (95% CI: 0.06, 0.24), P = 0.001] and BMI [SMD: 0.17, (95% CI: 0.07, 0.28), P = 0.002] than placebo, but the differences were not clinically significant. The lurasidone group experienced less frequent inefficacy (NNH = 14) and discontinuation due to any reason (NNH = 17) but was associated with more frequent vomiting and akathisia.

### Latuda [^116YphAD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The mechanism of action of lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression is unclear. However, its efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar depression could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine D2 and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Lurasidone is an antagonist with high-affinity binding at the dopamine D2 receptors (Ki of 1 nM) and the serotonin 5-HT2A (Ki of 0.5 nM) and 5-HT7 (Ki of 0.5 nM) receptors. It also binds with moderate affinity to the human α2C adrenergic receptors (Ki of 11 nM) and is a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A (Ki of 6.4 nM) receptors. Additionally, it is an antagonist at the α2A adrenergic receptors (Ki of 41 nM). Lurasidone exhibits little or no affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 receptors (IC50 > 1,000 nM).

- **ECG changes**: The effects of Latuda on the QTc interval were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-dedicated thorough QT study in 43 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. These patients were treated with Latuda doses of 120 mg daily and 600 mg daily, and completed the study. The maximum mean (upper 1-sided, 95% CI) increase in baseline-adjusted QTc intervals based on the individual correction method (QTcI) was 7.5 (11.7) ms and 4.6 (9.5) ms for the 120 mg and 600 mg dose groups, respectively, observed at 2 to 4 hours after dosing. In this study, there was no apparent dose (exposure)-response relationship.

In short-term, placebo-controlled studies in schizophrenia and bipolar depression, no post-baseline QT prolongations exceeding 500 ms were observed.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^115YndGG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Among the eight oral agents included in both ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2, dosing equivalencies remained stable except for paliperidone, which saw its initial equivalency estimate increased from 9.0 mg (19 responses) to 12 mg (68 responses). Overall, dosing recommendations in ICSAD-2 trended lower than in ICSAD-1, except for paliperidone, which had its dosing range extended from 6–9 mg/day to 6–12 mg/day, and sertindole, which had its maximum dose adjusted from 22 mg/day to 24 mg/day.

The dosing range for aripiprazole was modified from 15–30 mg/day to 10–30 mg/day. For haloperidol, the initial, target range, and maximum doses were reduced from 3 mg, 5–10 mg, and 20 mg/day, respectively, to 2 mg, 4.5–10 mg, and 17.5 mg/day.

Quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone dosing recommendations saw reductions in their target range:

- **Quetiapine**: from 400–800 mg/day to 300–750 mg/day.
- **Risperidone**: from 4–6 mg/day to 3–6 mg/day.
- **Ziprasidone**: from 120–160 mg/day to 80–160 mg/day.

Maximum doses were also reduced for these agents:

- **Quetiapine**: from 1000 mg/day to 800 mg/day.
- **Risperidone**: from 8.5 mg/day to 8.0 mg/day.
- **Ziprasidone**: from 200 mg/day to 160 mg/day.

These modest changes likely reflect experience-based changes in the clinical use of these agents over the 13-year interval between ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2 and possibly relatively low numbers of responses for some agents in ICSAD-1. There was greater variance when comparing ICSAD-2 dosing recommendations with the manufacturers' product monograph-recommended dosing, possibly reflecting trends informed by more extensive clinical experience. Higher target range or maximum doses, ranging from 33–100% higher, were recommended for aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, and ziprasidone.

### Vraylar [^113TeQBt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pooled data from the 6-week schizophrenia trials and 3-week bipolar mania trials are included in the analysis. The data is shown by modal daily dose, which is defined as the most frequently administered dose per patient. The maximum recommended daily dose is 6 mg; doses above 6 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions.

In the two 6-week trials and one 8-week trial for bipolar depression, there were no clinically meaningful differences between VRAYLAR-treated patients and placebo-treated patients in terms of the mean change from baseline to endpoint in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Specifically, VRAYLAR-treated patients' supine blood pressure increased by 0.1 to 0.3 mmHg, while placebo-treated patients' supine blood pressure increased by 0.2 mmHg.

Additionally, in two 6-week adjunctive treatment trials and one 8-week trial for major depressive disorder, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between VRAYLAR-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. This was determined through the mean change from baseline to endpoint in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At the conclusion of the 6-week trials, VRAYLAR-treated patients experienced a decrease in supine systolic blood pressure of 0.1 to 0.7 mmHg, compared to a 0.1 mmHg decrease in placebo-treated patients. Observations of supine diastolic blood pressure showed a similar trend, although full data for the latter measurement is incomplete.

### Lurasidone versus typical antipsychotics for schizophrenia [^113x1mCQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Although several novel second-generation antipsychotics, such as lurasidone, iloperidone, and cariprazine, have been approved in recent years, typical antipsychotics, including chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and fluphenazine, remain a crucial therapeutic option worldwide. The relative risk-to-benefit ratio of these 'latest' second-generation antipsychotics compared to the established typical agents is not well understood.

The study's objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of lurasidone versus typical antipsychotics for adults with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-related disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials on 5 June 2019. An update search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three additional databases, and two trial registers, as well as the US Food and Drug Administration database, on 1 April 2024.

- **Selection criteria**: We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lurasidone with typical antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, mesoridazine, molindone, perphenazine, thioridazine, thiothixene, and zuclopenthixol, for adults with schizophrenia. No additional search restrictions were applied.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures, extracting information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, study design, trial methods, and funding sources.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of lurasidone for the maintenance of efficacy in patients with schizophrenia [^112YNmuu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

A total of 676 patients enrolled in the open-label phase; 285 patients (42.2%) met protocol-specified criteria for stabilization and were randomized to lurasidone (N = 144) or placebo (N = 141); two patients completed the open-label phase but were not randomized. For patients who met clinical stability criteria and were randomized, demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline of the double-blind phase were similar among the lurasidone and placebo groups.

- **Open-label stabilization phase**: Among patients who discontinued from the open-label phase, the most common reasons were withdrawal of consent (24.7%), adverse events (21.6%, including 10.0% with worsening of schizophrenia), lost to follow-up (15.4%), insufficient clinical response (11.8%), and failure to meet stabilization criteria (11.3%). For patients who met clinical stability criteria and were randomized, the mean lurasidone dose during the open-label phase was 67.7 mg/d (the modal daily dose was 80 mg in 73.2% of patients), and the mean open-label treatment exposure was 17.8 weeks. During the open-label phase, mean PANSS total score decreased from 90.1 to 54.4 and mean CGI-S score from 4.5 to 2.7 in patients who met clinical stability criteria and were randomized. Symptomatic improvement was observed within the first one to two weeks of open-label treatment with lurasidone, with a mean time to attainment of initial stabilization of 5.2 weeks.

### Efficacy and safety of lurasidone 80 mg/day and 160 mg/day in the treatment of schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial [^117AFkCq]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of once-daily lurasidone (80 mg/day and 160 mg/day) in the treatment of an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Participants, who were recently admitted inpatients with schizophrenia with an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of fixed-dose, double-blind treatment with lurasidone 80 mg (n = 125), lurasidone 160 mg (n = 121), quetiapine XR 600 mg (QXR-600 mg; n = 119; active control included to test for assay sensitivity), or placebo (n = 121), all dosed once daily in the evening.

Efficacy was evaluated using a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of the change from baseline to Week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, which was the primary efficacy measure, and Clinical Global Impressions severity (CGI-S) score, the key secondary efficacy measure. Treatment with both doses of lurasidone or with QXR-600 mg was associated with significantly greater improvement at Week 6 on PANSS total score, PANSS positive and negative subscale scores, and CGI-S score compared with placebo.

The endpoint responder rate (≥ 20% improvement in PANSS total score) was higher in subjects treated with lurasidone 80 mg (65%; p < 0.001), lurasidone 160 mg (79%; p < 0.001), and QXR-600 mg (79%; p < 0.001) compared with placebo (41%). The proportion of patients experiencing ≥ 7% weight gain was 4% for each lurasidone group, 15% for the QXR-600 mg group, and 3% for the placebo group. Endpoint changes in levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins were documented but not detailed here.

### Efficacy and safety of cariprazine in bipolar I depression: A double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^116FYzmT]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

- **Primary outcomes**: The reduction from baseline to Week 6 in MADRS total score (depressive symptom improvement) was statistically significant for cariprazine 1.5 mg/day treatment compared to placebo. Cariprazine 3.0 mg/day reduced the MADRS total score compared to placebo at the primary endpoint, but the difference (LSMD = −1.8) did not reach significance (P = 0.1051). Significant improvements compared to placebo were observed at Week 2 for cariprazine 3.0 mg/day and for Week 4 for 1.5 mg/day. The effect sizes at Week 6 for cariprazine 1.5 and 3.0 mg/day compared to placebo were 0.28 and 0.20, respectively.

- **Secondary outcomes**: CGI‐S scores for cariprazine 1.5 mg/day treated patients were significantly improved from baseline to Week 6 compared to placebo. However, the difference was not significant for cariprazine 3.0 mg/day compared to placebo.

Mean change from baseline to Week 6 by visit in (a) MADRS total score and (b) CGI‐S score (LSM ± SE; ITT population, MMRM). Estimates were derived from an MMRM with fixed factors (treatment group, pooled study center, and visit), baseline (as a covariate), and interactions (treatment group by visit, baseline by visit). The ITT population consists of randomized patients who had received at least one dose of double‐blind treatment and at least one post-baseline MADRS total score assessment. CGI‐S stands for Clinical Global Impressions ‐ Severity; ITT refers to intent‐to‐treat; LS denotes least squares; LSM is least squares mean; MADRS refers to Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MMRM is mixed-effects model for repeated measures; SE stands for standard error.

### Cariprazine in acute exacerbation of schizophrenia: a fixed-dose, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial [^1151q8Co]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

This phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. The multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study was conducted from April 2010 to December 2011. Patients who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia were randomized to placebo (n = 153), cariprazine 3 mg/d (n = 155), cariprazine 6 mg/d (n = 157), or aripiprazole 10 mg/d (n = 152) for 6 weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary and secondary efficacy parameters were mean change from baseline to week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score, respectively.

Least squares mean differences (LSMDs) in PANSS total score change at week 6 significantly favored cariprazine 3 and 6 mg/d versus placebo (LSMD [95% CI]: 3 mg/d, -6.0 [-10.1 to -1.9], adjusted P = 0.0044; 6 mg/d, -8.8 [-12.9 to -4.7], adjusted P < .0001). Cariprazine 3 and 6 mg/d were also associated with significant improvements relative to placebo in CGI-S scores (LSMD [95% CI]: 3 mg/d, -0.4 [-0.6 to -0.2], adjusted P = 0.0044; 6 mg/d, -0.5 [-0.7 to -0.3], adjusted P < .0001). Significant differences from placebo were also observed with aripiprazole on the PANSS (LSMD [95% CI]: -7.0 [-11.0 to -2.9], P = 0.0008) and CGI-S (LSMD [95% CI]: -0.4 [-0.6 to -0.2], P = 0.0001). Common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥ 10%) were insomnia (all groups), akathisia (cariprazine 6 mg/d), and headache (placebo, cariprazine 6 mg/d).

### Efficacy and safety of cariprazine in bipolar I depression: A double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^1136KKoA]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

In this phase 3 study, cariprazine 1.5 mg/day significantly reduced depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar I depression at the primary endpoint (Week 6). A significant reduction from baseline in the MADRS total score was also observed at Week 4. The cariprazine 1.5 mg/day results presented here are consistent with data from the two prior phase 2b/3 trials, which demonstrated significant reductions in depressive symptoms across multiple measures at this dose in similarly designed studies. Mean CGI‐S scores, which quantify the severity of overall illness, were also significantly lower compared to placebo with cariprazine 1.5 mg/day treatment from baseline to Week 6. No significant between-group differences were found for the additional efficacy measures of HAMD‐17 and QIDS‐SR 16.

Cariprazine 3.0 mg/day was not significantly superior to placebo in the primary or secondary efficacy parameters at Week 6. The findings for the 3.0 mg/day dose are contrasted with the previous phase 3 trial that reported cariprazine 3.0 mg/day significantly reduced MADRS total scores compared to placebo. The magnitude of change (MADRS: −14.1 points and CGI‐S −1.4 points) is generally comparable to previous cariprazine trials and those observed in trials of other atypical antipsychotics that are approved for the treatment of bipolar I depression. The lack of statistical significance for the cariprazine 3.0 mg/day dose in the present study is possibly due to chance (Type II error) and intra‐study variability.

### Vraylar [^116M68Ce]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Vraylar as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was evaluated in two trials in adult patients (mean age of 45 years, range 18 to 65 years; 72% were female; and 85% were Caucasian) who met DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5 criteria for MDD, with or without symptoms of anxiety, who had an inadequate response to one to three courses of prior antidepressant (ADT) therapy. Inadequate response during antidepressant treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement to antidepressant treatment of adequate dose and adequate duration.

- **Primary endpoint**: The primary endpoint in each study was the change from baseline to Week 6 (Study 10) or Week 8 (Study 11) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptomatology, with 0 representing no symptoms and 60 representing worst symptoms.

- **Study 10**: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 751) involving two fixed doses of Vraylar (1.5 mg per day or 3 mg per day) + ADT, Vraylar 1.5 mg + ADT was superior to placebo + ADT at the end of Week 6 on the MADRS total score. The treatment effect in the Vraylar 3 mg per day + ADT group (vs. placebo + ADT) was not statistically significant.

### Lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114nqct5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Lurasidone is a novel psychotropic agent with high affinity for D(2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors, as well as for receptors implicated in the enhancement of cognition and mood and the reduction of negative symptoms (5-HT(7), 5-HT(1A), and alpha(2c)). The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lurasidone in patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia.

Patients were randomly assigned to six weeks of double-blind treatment with a fixed dose of lurasidone 80 mg (N = 90, 75.6% male, mean age = 39.7 years, mean baseline score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale derived from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [BPRSd] = 55.1) or placebo (N = 90, 77.8% male, mean age = 41.9 years, mean BPRSd score = 56.1). The primary efficacy measure was the BPRSd. The study was conducted from May to December 2004.

At the day 42 last-observation-carried-forward endpoint, treatment with lurasidone was associated with significant improvement compared to placebo on the BPRSd (least squares mean ± SE = -8.9 ± 1.3 vs. -4.2 ± 1.4; p = .012), as well as on all secondary efficacy measures, including the PANSS total score (-14.1 ± 2.1 vs. -5.5 ± 2.2; p = .004), and the PANSS positive (-4.3 ± 0.7 vs. -1.7 ± 0.7; p = .006), negative (-2.9 ± 0.5 vs. -1.3 ± 0.5; p = .025), and general psychopathology (-7.0 ± 1.1 vs. -2.7 ± 1.2; p = .0061) subscales. Significant improvement was seen as early as day 3 based on BPRSd, PANSS, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness assessments.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^117LqWFq]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Although treatment guidelines commonly recommend maintenance therapy with lamotrigine or quetiapine as first-line treatments in bipolar disorder patients at risk for depressive episode recurrence, there is a clear need for additional options that are safe, well-tolerated, and effective for the maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder patients at risk for depression recurrence.

Lurasidone has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Three randomized, double-blind, 6-week trials have been completed: a monotherapy trial comparing two flexible-fixed doses of lurasidone (20–60 mg/day; 80–120 mg/day), and two flexible dose trials of lurasidone (20–120 mg/day) administered adjunctively with lithium or valproate. We report here the results of the 6-month, open-label, uncontrolled extension of the three 6-week studies, designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of lurasidone in patients with bipolar depression. A secondary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of lurasidone in maintaining improvement in depressive symptoms.

### Effectiveness of lurasidone for patients with schizophrenia following 6 weeks of acute treatment with lurasidone, olanzapine, or placebo: a 6-month, open-label, extension study [^1129HsUs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lurasidone, a new atypical antipsychotic agent, in the longer-term treatment of schizophrenia (DSM-IV). Persistence of symptom improvement was assessed as a secondary outcome.

- **Method**: Patients who completed a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy of fixed doses of once-daily lurasidone (40 or 120 mg) or olanzapine 15 mg (to confirm assay sensitivity) were eligible to receive flexibly dosed lurasidone 40 to 120 mg/d in this 6-month, open-label extension study (conducted from March 2008 to December 2009). Assessments of safety and tolerability were conducted at open-label baseline, at day 10, and monthly thereafter.

- **Results**: Of 254 enrolled patients, 113 (44.5%) completed 6 months of open-label treatment. During the open-label study (month 6 observed cases), small decreases were observed in mean weight (-0.1 kg) and median lipid levels (total cholesterol, -6.5 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein, 0.0 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein, 0.0 mg/dL; triglycerides, -8.5 mg/dL). Patients previously treated with olanzapine (n = 69) experienced a decrease in weight and improvement in lipid levels, whereas patients previously treated with lurasidone (n = 115) or placebo (n = 62) experienced minimal changes. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in median prolactin levels. The two most commonly reported adverse events were akathisia (13.0%) and insomnia (11.0%). Persistent antipsychotic efficacy of lurasidone was shown for patients who had previously received lurasidone.

### Adjunctive cariprazine for the treatment of major depressive disorder: Number needed to treat, number needed to harm, and likelihood to be helped or harmed [^113opA94]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) for efficacy and number needed to harm (NNH) for tolerability/safety were evaluated for adjunctive cariprazine in major depressive disorder (MDD).

- **Methods**: Data were extracted from five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of adjunctive cariprazine in MDD. NNTs (response, remission, severity shift) and NNHs (discontinuations due to adverse events [AEs], AEs, laboratory shifts) were determined in dose groupings; likelihood to be helped/harmed (LHH) was calculated.

- **Results**: NNTs (95% CI) for adjunctive cariprazine versus placebo were statistically significant at week 6/early termination for response on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), as defined by a decrease in total score ≥ 50% (doses ≥ 1 mg/d = 12 [9–21]; 1–2 mg/d = 12 [8–25]; 2–4.5 mg/d = 14 [9–43]) and other response/remission outcomes. NNHs for cariprazine versus placebo were generally ≥ 10 for AEs that were statistically significant; an apparent dose-response was seen for akathisia (lower dose = 24 [17–43]; higher dose = 9 [7–11]). LHHs were ≥ 1 (acceptable benefit/harm ratio) for MADRS total score response versus most important cariprazine AEs in most dose groupings. For response versus discontinuation because of an AE, adjunctive cariprazine 1–2 mg/d had a more favorable response/tolerability profile in indirect comparison with other approved atypical antipsychotics.

- **Limitations**: Post hoc analysis; indirect comparisons.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^116RPkCj]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

During six weeks of initial double-blind treatment, improvement was observed in both the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups (Figure 2). Six months of open-label treatment with lurasidone was associated with additional improvement in the MADRS for the monotherapy group that continued to receive lurasidone (−5.0; OC analysis) and for the monotherapy group that was switched from placebo to lurasidone (−10.8; OC); additional improvement in the MADRS was also observed for the adjunctive therapy group that continued to receive lurasidone (−4.9; OC) and for the monotherapy group that was switched from placebo to lurasidone (−8.2; OC). A similar and consistent pattern of improvement from open-label baseline to month six (OC analysis) was observed for the secondary outcome measures (CGI-BP-S, HAM-A, Q-LES-Q, SDS), as summarized in Table 3 A and B. Table 3 A and B also summarizes the results of the LOCF-endpoint analysis for the MADRS and the secondary outcome measures.

- **Mean changes in efficacy measures**: Table 3 shows changes from double-blind (DB) and open-label (OL) baseline among acute study completers who continued in the extension study.

A post hoc responder and remitter analysis was performed to evaluate the outcome of six months of extension treatment in the group of patients who received lurasidone in the acute, six-week double-blind trials. At baseline of the extension study, the proportion of patients who met a priori responder and remitter criteria, respectively, was similar in the monotherapy group (56.3% and 44.9%).

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^114o3Wi9]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The primary safety population consisted of all patients who completed an acute-phase trial, continued into this extension study, and received at least one dose of open-label lurasidone. The primary safety analyses consisted of the percentage of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events. Observed case analyses were calculated for changes from the double-blind baseline for the following safety variables:

- **Body and vital measurements**: body weight, proportion of patients with ≥ 7% weight change from baseline, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, vital signs
- **Biochemical and physiological assessments**: serum prolactin, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters
- **Movement and mental health evaluations**: movement disorders as assessed by the BARS, SAS, and AIMS scales, results from the C-SSRS, physical examination results
- **Laboratory tests**:
	- **Standard tests**: chemistry, urinalysis
	- **Hematology**: hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells with differential, platelet count

Mean (SD) changes were reported from the double-blind acute study baseline, and from the open-label extension study baseline, for the following scores:

- **Depression and anxiety scores**: MADRS total score, CGI-BP-S depression score, HAM-A total score
- **Mania and quality of life scores**: YMRS total score, SDS total score, Q-LES-Q-SF score

For efficacy measures, changes were reported for observed cases at monthly intervals, and for last observation carried forward at month 6 endpoint (LOCF-endpoint). Treatment response was defined as achieving ≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score from the double-blind baseline, and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 12. On a post-hoc basis, depressive relapse was defined as a MADRS total score increase.

### Latuda [^111dkmjt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For adults with schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline for LATUDA-treated patients in the SAS, BAS, and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients, except in the Barnes Akathisia Scale global score (LATUDA, 0.1; placebo, 0.0). The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal scores was greater in LATUDA-treated patients compared to placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 14.4%; placebo, 7.1%), SAS (LATUDA, 5.0%; placebo, 2.3%), and AIMS (LATUDA, 7.4%; placebo, 5.8%).

In adolescents with schizophrenia, LATUDA-treated patients showed mean changes from baseline for the SAS, BAS, and AIMS that were comparable to those of placebo-treated patients. However, the percentage of patients shifting from normal to abnormal scores was higher in LATUDA-treated patients compared to placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 7.0%; placebo, 1.8%), SAS (LATUDA, 8.3%; placebo, 2.7%), and AIMS (LATUDA, 2.8%; placebo, 0.9%).

In adults with bipolar depression undergoing monotherapy, mean changes from baseline for LATUDA-treated patients on the SAS, BAS, and AIMS were similar to those seen in placebo-treated patients. Nonetheless, there was a higher percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal in LATUDA-treated patients versus placebo for the BAS (LATUDA, 8.4%; placebo, 5.6%), SAS (LATUDA, 3.7%; placebo, 1.9%), and AIMS (LATUDA, 3.4%; placebo, 1.2%).

- **Adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate**: The mean change from baseline for LATUDA-treated adults in this category for the SAS, BAS, and AIMS remained comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients shifting from normal to abnormal also favored LATUDA, though details are truncated.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive cariprazine in inadequate responders to antidepressants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult patients with major depressive disorder [^112sMua1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic currently under investigation as adjunctive therapy in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy.

- **Method**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose study was conducted from December 2011 to December 2013 in adults who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD and had an inadequate antidepressant response. Eligible patients were randomized to 8-week adjunctive treatment with placebo (n = 269), cariprazine 1–2 mg/d (n = 274), or cariprazine 2–4.5 mg/d (n = 276). The primary efficacy parameter was change from baseline to week 8 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score; P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and suicidality.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo, reduction in MADRS total score at week 8 was significantly greater with adjunctive cariprazine 2–4.5 mg/d (least squares mean difference [LSMD] = -2.2; adjusted P = 0.0114), but not with cariprazine 1–2 mg/d (LSMD = -0.9; adjusted P = 0.2404). Significant LSMDs for MADRS total score change were detected at all earlier study visits (weeks 2, 4, 6) in the 2- to 4.5-mg/d group and at weeks 2 and 4 in the 1- to 2-mg/d group (all P values < .05). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in ≥ 10% of patients in either cariprazine dosage group were akathisia (22.3%), insomnia (13.6%), and nausea (12.8%) (all in 2- to 4.5-mg/d group).

### An evaluation of the safety and efficacy of cariprazine in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia: A phase II, randomized clinical trial [^115GMbUb]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Cariprazine is an orally active and potent D3 and D2 partial agonist with preferential binding to D3 receptors, developed for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. This study (NCT00694707) evaluated the efficacy and safety of cariprazine in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: This study was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, fixed-dose trial. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, cariprazine 1.5mg/d, cariprazine 3.0mg/d, cariprazine 4.5mg/d, or risperidone 4.0mg/d (for assay sensitivity) for six weeks of double-blind treatment and two weeks of safety follow-up. Primary and secondary efficacy parameters were the change from baseline to Week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scores, respectively. Safety parameters included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, laboratory measures, and extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) scales.

- **Results**: Of the 732 randomized patients, 64% completed the study. PANSS total score improvement at Week 6 was statistically significant versus placebo for cariprazine 1.5mg/d, 3.0mg/d, and 4.5mg/d (least squares mean difference [LSMD]: -7.6, -8.8, -10.4, respectively; p < 0.001; LOCF) and risperidone (-15.1, p < 0.001; LOCF). Significant improvement on CGI-S was demonstrated for all active treatments (p < 0.05). The most frequent cariprazine AEs (≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of the placebo group) were insomnia, extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, sedation, nausea, dizziness, and constipation.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^112hQYgL]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of six months of open-label, uncontrolled extension treatment with lurasidone in patients diagnosed with bipolar depression who completed six weeks of acute treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients who completed six weeks of double-blind placebo-controlled treatment, with either lurasidone monotherapy (one study) or adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (two studies), were treated for six months with flexible doses of lurasidone, 20–120 mg/day, in an open-label, uncontrolled extension study (N = 813; monotherapy, 38.9%; adjunctive therapy, 61.1%). Changes in safety parameters were calculated from the double-blind, acute-phase baseline to month six of the extension phase, using a last observation carried forward (LOCF endpoint) analysis.

- **Results**: Five hundred fifty-nine of 817 (68.4%) patients completed the extension study. In the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, 6.9% and 9.0%, respectively, discontinued due to an adverse event. For the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, respectively, changes from the double-blind baseline to month six were +0.8 and +0.9 kg for weight (mean), 0.0 and +2.0 mg/dL for total cholesterol (median), +5.0 and +5.0 mg/dL for triglycerides (median), -1.0 and 0.0 mg/dL for glucose (median); -22.6 and -21.7 for the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; mean); whereas changes from the open-label baseline to month six were +0.85 and +0.88 kg for weight (mean), and -6.9 and -6.5 for MADRS (mean).

- **Conclusions**: Six months of treatment with open-label lurasidone was safe and well tolerated.

### Vraylar [^115thqrv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia was established in three 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Participants included patients with a mean age of 37 years, ranging from 18 to 60 years; 31% were female, and 45% were Caucasian. All participants met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for schizophrenia. An active control arm, which included either risperidone or aripiprazole, was incorporated in two trials to assess assay sensitivity. In all three trials, Vraylar demonstrated superiority over placebo.

- **Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)**: This 30-item scale measures the positive symptoms (7 items), negative symptoms (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items) of schizophrenia. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme), with total scores ranging from 30 to 210; higher scores indicate greater severity.

- **Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S)**: The CGI-S is a validated clinician-rated scale that assesses a patient's illness state and overall clinical condition on a 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7-point (extremely ill) scale.

### Lurasidone in the long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder: A 24-week open-label extension study [^116fJj1v]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Mean changes in weight from double-blind baseline at 6 months (observed cases) were modest and similar for the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups (0.85 and 0.88 kg, respectively). The proportion of patients with a ≥ 7% increase in weight at month 6 was lower in the monotherapy group compared with the adjunctive therapy group (8.2% vs. 14.9%, respectively). Mean changes in BMI at month 6 were low (+0.3) in both the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups.

Small median changes from double-blind baseline were observed at month 6 for both the monotherapy and adjunctive groups in total cholesterol (0.0 and +2.0 mg/dL, respectively), triglycerides (+5.0 and +5.0 mg/dL), and glucose (−1.0 and 0.0 mg/dL). There were no changes in HbA1c greater than +2.4% in either the monotherapy or adjunctive therapy groups. Modest median increases in prolactin in the range of 0.5–2.7 ng/mL were observed for both the monotherapy and adjunctive groups.

No clinically significant changes were observed for heart rate, orthostatic blood pressure changes (systolic or diastolic), respiratory rate, or body temperature. No patient in either the monotherapy or adjunctive groups had a QTcB value > 500 ms after open-label baseline. One patient (0.4%) in the monotherapy group and two patients (0.5%) in the adjunctive therapy group had an increase from double-blind baseline in QTcB value ≥ 60 ms.

### Dose equivalents for second-generation antipsychotic drugs: The classical mean dose method [^113GNHz5]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

The concept of dose equivalence is important for many purposes. The classical approach, published by Davis in 1974, subsequently dominated textbooks for several decades. It was based on the assumption that the mean doses found in flexible-dose trials reflect the average optimum dose, which can be used for the calculation of dose equivalence. We are the first to apply the method to second-generation antipsychotics.

- **Methods**: We searched for randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose trials in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia that examined 13 oral second-generation antipsychotics, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine (last search June 2014). We calculated the mean doses of each drug weighted by sample size and divided them by the weighted mean olanzapine dose to obtain olanzapine equivalents.

- **Results**: We included 75 studies with 16,555 participants. The doses equivalent to 1 mg/d olanzapine were: amisulpride 38.3 mg/d, aripiprazole 1.4 mg/d, asenapine 0.9 mg/d, chlorpromazine 38.9 mg/d, clozapine 30.6 mg/d, haloperidol 0.7 mg/d, quetiapine 32.3 mg/d, risperidone 0.4 mg/d, sertindole 1.1 mg/d, ziprasidone 7.9 mg/d, and zotepine 13.2 mg/d. For iloperidone, lurasidone, and paliperidone, no data were available.

- **Conclusions**: The classical mean dose method is not reliant on the limited availability of fixed-dose data at the lower end of the effective dose range, which is the major limitation of "minimum effective dose methods" and "dose-response curve methods". In contrast, the mean doses found by the approach may have, in part, depended on the dose ranges chosen for the trials.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of lurasidone for the maintenance of efficacy in patients with schizophrenia [^1119kPpg]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). High credibility.

Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness involving psychotic relapses that can worsen the course of the disease, increase the potential for treatment nonresponse, and reduce the likelihood that patients will achieve long-term remission. Long-term treatment with antipsychotic agents is generally necessary to control the symptoms of schizophrenia, minimize the risk of relapse, and enable sustained remission.

Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent approved for the treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia in the United States, the European Union, and other countries. It acts as an antagonist with potent affinity for dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 receptors. Additionally, lurasidone has moderate affinity at α2A and α2C adrenergic receptors (as an antagonist) and 5-HT1A receptors (as a partial agonist), but no appreciable affinity for histamine H1 receptors or muscarinic M1 receptors.

The efficacy of lurasidone in treating patients with schizophrenia was demonstrated in a series of short-term, placebo-controlled studies. A 12-month, double-blind, non-inferiority study comparing lurasidone with quetiapine XR provided evidence for the long-term effectiveness of treatment with lurasidone in patients with schizophrenia. This was further supported by data from two six-month, open-label extension studies and a 12-month, randomized, double-blind safety study with an active comparator arm.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lurasidone as a maintenance treatment for patients with schizophrenia.

### An 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety and efficacy of cariprazine in patients with bipolar I depression [^115PdKQM]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

The authors evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine, an atypical antipsychotic candidate, in adult patients with acute bipolar I depression. This was an 8-week multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study in adult patients with bipolar I disorder experiencing a major depressive episode. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive placebo or cariprazine at 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/day. The primary and secondary efficacy parameters were changes from baseline to week 6 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions severity subscale (CGI-S), respectively, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures on the modified intent-to-treat population.

The intent-to-treat population comprised 571 patients (141 in the placebo group and 140, 145, and 145 in the cariprazine 0.75-, 1.5-, and 3.0-mg/day groups). Cariprazine at 1.5 mg/day showed significantly greater improvement on MADRS total score change from baseline to week 6 compared with placebo; the least squares mean difference was -4.0 (95% CI = -6.3, -1.6; significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Cariprazine at 3.0 mg/day showed greater MADRS score reduction than placebo (-2.5, 95% CI = -4.9, -0.1; not significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons). The 0.75 mg/day dosage was similar to placebo. A similar pattern for significance was observed on the CGI-S (1.5 mg/day: least squares mean difference = -0.4, 95% CI = -0.6, -0.1; 3.0 mg/day…).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 6 months of open-label, uncontrolled extension treatment with lurasidone in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar depression who completed 6 weeks of acute treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients completing 6 weeks of double-blind placebo-controlled treatment with either lurasidone monotherapy (one study) or adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate (two studies) were treated for 6 months with flexible doses of lurasidone, 20–120 mg/day, in an open-label, uncontrolled extension study (N = 813; monotherapy, 38.9%; adjunctive therapy, 61.1%). Changes in safety parameters were calculated from double-blind, acute-phase baseline to month 6 of the extension phase, using a last observation carried forward (LOCF endpoint) analysis.

- **Results**: Five hundred fifty-nine of 817 (68.4%) patients completed the extension study. In the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, 6.9% and 9.0%, respectively, discontinued due to an adverse event. For the monotherapy and adjunctive therapy groups, respectively, changes from double-blind baseline to month 6 were +0.8 and +0.9 kg for weight (mean), 0.0 and +2.0 mg/dL for total cholesterol (median), +5.0 and +5.0 mg/dL for triglycerides (median), −1.0 and 0.0 mg/dL for glucose (median); −22.6 and −21.7 for Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; mean); whereas changes from open-label baseline to month 6 were +0.85 and +0.88 kg for weight (mean), and −6.9 and −6.5 for MADRS (mean).

### Lurasidone dose escalation in early nonresponding patients with schizophrenia: A randomized, placebo-controlled study [^1142QuhP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

To assess the effect of dose increase in adult patients with schizophrenia who demonstrate inadequate initial response to standard-dose lurasidone and to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose lurasidone in adult patients with schizophrenia, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted between May 2013 and June 2014. Hospitalized patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20 mg/d (n = 101), lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 199), or placebo (n = 112). Nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] score decrease < 20%) at 2 weeks were re-randomized to lurasidone 80 mg/d or 160 mg/d for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score.

In nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 95), dose increase to 160 mg/d at week 2 significantly reduced PANSS total score at week 6 study endpoint compared with continuing 80 mg/d (-16.6 vs -8.9; P < .05 [effect size = 0.52]). While a comparable magnitude of improvement was observed in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score from week 2 to week 6 endpoint for lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 80 mg/d (-1.0 vs -0.6; effect size = 0.44), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.052). Patients receiving lurasidone 20 mg/d did not demonstrate significant improvement compared with placebo at week 6 in PANSS total (-17.6 vs -14.5; p = 0.26) or CGI-S (-0.93 vs -0.73; p = 0.17) scores.

### Efficacy and safety of cariprazine in bipolar I depression: A double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^112nQRvy]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Adult patients (18–65 years) with bipolar I disorder were included in the study. The diagnosis was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria without psychotic features. They had to experience a major depressive episode lasting between 4 weeks and 12 months, confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Participants required a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score of ≥ 20 and an item-1 score of ≥ 2; a Clinical Global Impressions - Severity (CGI-S) score of ≥ 4; and a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score of ≤ 12.

For study inclusion, physical examination, clinical laboratory, and ECG results needed to be normal or not judged to be clinically significant by investigators. Pregnancy was excluded in women with childbearing potential through negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin testing. Patients with four or more mood episodes in the prior 12 months, or any psychiatric diagnoses including personality disorders of significant severity to interfere with the study (as judged by the principal investigator), besides bipolar I disorder or specific phobias, were excluded from the study. Patients were not permitted to have an alcohol or substance use disorder within the previous 6 months. Exclusion criteria also involved suicide risk (based on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] assessment, a suicide attempt in the last year, HAMD-17 item-3 score ≥ 3, or MADRS item-10 score ≥ 4) or risk of injury to self or others (based on the investigator's judgment), and a nonresponse in the depressive episode to two or more antidepressant trials of adequate duration.
