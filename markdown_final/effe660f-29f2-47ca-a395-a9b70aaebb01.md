## Question

weaning down from 50 mg BID coreg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to safely wean down from carvedilol (Coreg) 50 mg twice daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and why we are weaning. Then, I should verify the risks of abrupt withdrawal and the principle of gradual taper. Next, I will determine a safe taper schedule and monitoring cadence. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities that could modify the plan. Finally, I will outline patient education, documentation, and contingency steps if symptoms flare during the taper, ensuring each step aligns with guideline and label guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication for carvedilol at 50 mg BID, because the weaning strategy hinges on why the patient is on this dose and whether there is an alternative beta-blocker or condition-specific target dose to aim for. Carvedilol is used for HFrEF with a target of 25 mg BID (or 50 mg BID if ≥ 85 kg), for hypertension with a typical maximum of 50 mg/day, for post-MI LV dysfunction with a target of 25 mg BID, and for AF rate control with a usual range of 3.125–25 mg BID, so a 50 mg BID regimen most commonly reflects HFrEF therapy or, less often, a high-dose hypertension regimen, and that distinction matters for taper pacing and safety monitoring [^111WJHYY] [^114nMJX1] [^114XWFe1] [^114254su].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping abruptly; I need to check the withdrawal risk. Abrupt cessation of beta-blockers in patients with coronary disease or heart failure can precipitate rebound sympathetic activity, worsening angina, arrhythmias, MI, or decompensated HF, so the label advises tapering over 1–2 weeks whenever possible and observing closely during dose reductions, with prompt reinstitution if angina or instability emerges [^113N7AgJ].

> Wait, let me verify the taper cadence and step-down magnitudes. A practical, conservative approach is to reduce the total daily dose by about 50% initially, then by 25–50% every 1–2 weeks as tolerated, mirroring the up-titration intervals used in HF trials and labeling; for carvedilol 50 mg BID (100 mg/day), that suggests 25 mg BID for 1–2 weeks, then 12.5 mg BID for 1–2 weeks, then 6.25 mg BID for 1–2 weeks before discontinuation, with longer intervals if symptoms occur, which aligns with the 2-week titration intervals used in COPERNICUS and contemporary guidance to individualize and slow if needed [^113roJAv] [^117J6HyZ].

> I should double-check monitoring during the taper. Let me consider vitals, symptoms, and labs: check resting heart rate and blood pressure at each step. Watch for orthostatic symptoms, dyspnea, edema, chest discomfort, and dizziness. In patients with HF or LV dysfunction, monitor for fluid retention and consider BNP or weight trends. In those with CAD, be vigilant for angina. And if renal function is borderline or blood pressure low, track creatinine during down-titration given rare reports of renal deterioration with carvedilol in vulnerable patients, adjusting the plan if eGFR declines or bradycardia (< 55 bpm) emerges [^1162S18P] [^111JweKK] [^113N7AgJ].

> But wait, what if the patient is on the 50 mg BID dose for HFrEF and we are merely trying to reach a more tolerable target rather than stop therapy entirely. I need to ensure we distinguish dose reduction from complete withdrawal; guidelines emphasize achieving and maintaining target doses for mortality benefit, yet allow individualized adjustments if not tolerated, so if the goal is dose optimization rather than cessation, a slower taper to 25 mg BID (or 50 mg BID if ≥ 85 kg and tolerated) with reassessment of symptoms, BP, HR, and EF is reasonable, recognizing that subtarget dosing may attenuate — but not negate — benefit [^111WJHYY] [^113eDiob].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidities that could alter the taper. In diabetes, I should confirm we are not masking hypoglycemia and plan closer glucose checks during dose changes. In asthma/COPD, I should use the lowest effective dose and monitor for bronchospasm. In hepatic impairment, carvedilol is contraindicated in Child-Pugh C and used cautiously in Child-Pugh A/B, which may necessitate slower tapers. In older adults, orthostatic symptoms are more common, so I should verify safety with standing vitals and consider a more gradual reduction. In renal dysfunction, no routine dose adjustment is needed, but I should monitor renal function during changes [^111JweKK] [^1162S18P] [^1173xr8T] [^113SXcAJ] [^114XGRaC].

> I will now examine patient education and activity precautions. Patients should be counseled to take carvedilol with food to mitigate orthostatic effects, rise slowly from supine or seated positions during the taper, avoid hazardous tasks if dizzy, and report promptly any chest pain, palpitations, worsening dyspnea, rapid weight gain, or syncope. If angina worsens or acute coronary symptoms occur, we should consider temporarily increasing the dose or reinstituting the prior dose while reassessing the plan [^117J6HyZ] [^113N7AgJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the documentation and follow-up cadence. Each taper step should be recorded with date, dose, vitals, symptoms, and any lab assessments; given the 1–2 week taper intervals, scheduling phone or in-person checks every 1–2 weeks during the wean is prudent, with a lower threshold for earlier contact if symptoms emerge, consistent with the close monitoring emphasized in HF labeling and performance measures for GDMT titration [^117J6HyZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the maximum labeled daily dose for hypertension was 50 mg and therefore assumed 50 mg BID would be off-label. Let me reconsider and verify the exact wording. The immediate-release carvedilol label for hypertension lists a recommended starting dose of 6.25 mg BID with titration to 12.5 mg then 25 mg BID as needed, and it states the total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg, so 50 mg BID (100 mg/day) would indeed exceed the labeled maximum for hypertension, reinforcing that a 50 mg BID regimen is more consistent with HFrEF dosing where targets of 25–50 mg BID are guideline-supported, especially for patients ≥ 85 kg, rather than hypertension [^114nMJX1] [^111WJHYY] [^113eDiob].

> Next, I should review contingency planning if the patient destabilizes during the taper. If there is evidence of worsening HF or fluid retention, I should pause the taper, optimize diuretics, and consider temporarily returning to the prior carvedilol dose. If angina or ischemic symptoms occur, I should promptly increase the beta-blocker dose and reassess coronary status. If bradycardia or hypotension limit further reductions, I should extend the interval between steps or accept a higher maintenance dose if clinically necessary, documenting rationale and monitoring closely [^1162S18P] [^113N7AgJ] [^113roJAv].

> Putting this together, my final, safety-first taper recommendation is as follows, with the explicit caveat to individualize and slow if symptoms arise: reduce from 50 mg BID to 25 mg BID for 1–2 weeks, then to 12.5 mg BID for 1–2 weeks, then to 6.25 mg BID for 1–2 weeks before discontinuation, monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, weight, edema, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and renal function as indicated at each step, and if the indication is HFrEF and the goal is dose optimization rather than cessation, consider stabilizing at 25 mg BID (or 50 mg BID if ≥ 85 kg and tolerated) with ongoing GDMT surveillance, avoiding abrupt withdrawal and promptly reverting to the prior dose if instability occurs [^117J6HyZ] [^111WJHYY] [^113N7AgJ] [^113roJAv].

---

Weaning from Coreg (carvedilol) 50 mg twice daily should be **gradual over 2–4 weeks** to avoid rebound hypertension, angina, or heart failure exacerbation. Reduce to 25 mg twice daily for 1–2 weeks, then 12.5 mg twice daily for 1–2 weeks, then stop if stable. Monitor **blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms** at each step; if adverse effects occur, slow the taper or return to the prior dose. Avoid abrupt cessation, especially in patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure [^113N7AgJ] [^113roJAv].

---

## Clinical rationale for gradual weaning

Gradual weaning is essential to prevent **rebound hypertension**, angina, or heart failure exacerbation. Abrupt cessation can cause increased sympathetic activity, leading to adverse cardiovascular events [^113N7AgJ].

---

## Recommended weaning schedule

The following schedule is **recommended** for weaning from Coreg 50 mg twice daily:

| **Week** | **Dose (mg)** | **Frequency** | **Total daily dose (mg)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1–2 | 25 | Twice daily | 50 |
| 3–4 | 12.5 | Twice daily | 25 |
| 5 | Discontinue | ∅ | ∅ |

---

This schedule allows for a **gradual reduction** in dose, minimizing the risk of rebound hypertension, angina, or heart failure exacerbation.

---

## Monitoring during weaning

During the weaning process, the following parameters should be **closely monitored**:

- **Blood pressure**: Monitor at each visit or at home if feasible.
- **Heart rate**: Monitor for bradycardia or tachycardia.
- **Symptoms**: Watch for dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, or worsening heart failure symptoms.
- **Renal function**: Monitor for deterioration, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment [^111JweKK].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

Several clinical considerations should be **taken into account** during the weaning process:

- **Coronary artery disease**: Patients with coronary artery disease are at increased risk of rebound angina or myocardial infarction if beta-blocker therapy is abruptly discontinued. Gradual weaning is essential in these patients [^113N7AgJ].
- **Heart failure**: Patients with heart failure may experience exacerbation of symptoms if beta-blocker therapy is withdrawn too quickly. Close monitoring and adjustment of other heart failure medications may be necessary [^113roJAv].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Beta-blockers can mask hypoglycemia symptoms. Patients with diabetes should be monitored closely during the weaning process [^111JweKK].
- **Peripheral vascular disease**: Beta-blockers can exacerbate symptoms of peripheral vascular disease. Patients should be monitored for worsening symptoms during weaning [^111JweKK].

---

## Management of withdrawal symptoms

If withdrawal symptoms occur during the weaning process, the following steps should be **taken**:

- **Return to previous dose**: If significant rebound hypertension, angina, or heart failure symptoms occur, return to the previous dose and stabilize the patient.
- **Slower taper**: Consider a slower taper with smaller dose reductions and longer intervals between reductions.
- **Alternative medications**: Consider alternative antihypertensive or antianginal medications if symptoms persist despite slower tapering.

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be **educated** about the following:

- **Importance of adherence**: Emphasize the importance of adhering to the weaning schedule and not discontinuing medication abruptly.
- **Recognition of symptoms**: Educate patients on recognizing symptoms of rebound hypertension, angina, or heart failure exacerbation.
- **Regular monitoring**: Encourage regular monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate at home if feasible.
- **Reporting symptoms**: Instruct patients to report any significant symptoms or side effects promptly to their healthcare provider.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Gradual weaning**: Wean gradually over 2–4 weeks, reducing the dose by half at each step.
- **Monitor closely**: Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms throughout the weaning process.
- **Adjust as needed**: Adjust the weaning schedule based on patient response and clinical judgment.
- **Educate patients**: Provide patient education and counseling to ensure adherence and recognition of withdrawal symptoms.

---

Weaning from Coreg 50 mg twice daily should be **done gradually over 2–4 weeks** to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension, angina, or heart failure exacerbation. Close monitoring and patient education are essential to ensure a safe and successful weaning process.

Background

beta-blockers (BB) in the treatment of heart failure (HF) are frequently underprescribed and underdosed, perhaps because of recommendations for office visits at each dose change. In previous work, we demonstrated the feasibility of remote telephonically assisted BB titration and found favorable effects on morbidity, time to target dose, and low withdrawal rates. In the current expanded evaluation, we reasoned that a structured remote telephonic titration protocol would achieve outcomes comparable to US Carvedilol Trials in regard to optimal dose, titration time, and morbidity.

Methods

Seventy HF patients were initiated on BB therapy (carvedilol). Before therapy, patients were instructed on BB side effects, pulse taking, and weight monitoring. Patients reported weights, vital signs, and symptoms 3 times per week by phone. Advanced practice nurses counseled, educated, and reminded patients to increase their dose every 2 weeks until target doses were reached.

Results

A total of 96% reached a therapeutic dose (6.25 mg twice daily). Moreover, 71% of patients reached target doses of 25 mg twice weekly in approximately 8 weeks. No HF hospitalizations occurred during remote titration.

Conclusions

The use of advanced practice nurses, titration protocols, and telemanagement technologies may improve the number of HF patients initiated and treated with appropriate doses of BB.

The COMET Trial

In this double-blind trial, 3,029 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) were randomized to receive either carvedilol (target dose: 25 mg twice daily) or immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose: 50 mg twice daily). The mean age of the subjects was approximately 62 years, 80% were males, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 26%. Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure.

Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and "statin" lipid-lowering agents (21%). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. The mean dose of carvedilol was 42 mg per day.

The trial had 2 primary end points: all-cause mortality and the composite of death plus hospitalization for any reason. The results of COMET are presented in Table 3 below. All- cause mortality carried most of the statistical weight and was the primary determinant of the trial size. All-cause mortality was 34% in the subjects treated with carvedilol and was 40% in the immediate-release metoprolol group (P = 0.0017; hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.93). The effect on mortality was primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular death. The difference between the 2 groups with respect to the composite end point was not significant (P = 0.122). The estimated mean survival was 8.0 years with carvedilol and 6.6 years with immediate-release metoprolol.

It is not known whether this formulation of metoprolol at any dose or this low dose of metoprolol in any formulation has any effect on survival or hospitalization in patients with heart failure. Thus, this trial extends the time over which carvedilol manifests benefits on survival in heart failure, but it is not evidence that carvedilol improves outcome over the formulation of metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) with benefits in heart failure.

Severe Heart Failure (COPERNICUS)

In a double-blind trial, 2,289 subjects with heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% (mean 20%), despite digitalis (66%), diuretics (99%), and ACE inhibitors (89%), were randomized to placebo or carvedilol. Carvedilol was titrated from a starting dose of 3.125 mg twice daily to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 25 mg twice daily over a minimum of 6 weeks. Most subjects achieved the target dose of 25 mg. The trial was conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Israel, and Canada. Similar numbers of subjects per group (about 100) withdrew during the titration period.

2.1 Heart Failure

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP‑TITRATION. Prior to initiation of COREG CR, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of COREG CR is 10 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Patients who tolerate a dose of 10 mg once daily may have their dose increased to 20, 40, and 80 mg over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated.

Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. Thus, during these periods, they should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of COREG CR from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of COREG CR should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.

Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.

The dose of COREG CR should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).

Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of COREG CR can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, COREG CR.

2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP‑TITRATION. Treatment with COREG CR may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that COREG CR be started at 20 mg once daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 40 mg once daily, then again to the target dose of 80 mg once daily. A lower starting dose may be used (10 mg once daily) and/or the rate of up‑titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β‑blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

### Rationale and design of the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial in patients with chronic heart failure: COMET [^111tyzfT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2002). Low credibility.

In large clinical trials both carvedilol and metoprolol have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol is an adrenoceptor antagonist, which inhibits beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol has additional metabolic and antioxidant properties. Metoprolol is a selective antagonist of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. The carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) is the first study to investigate whether beta-blocking agents with differing pharmacological profiles exert different effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. 3029 patients from 15 different European countries were enrolled into COMET and will be followed until 1020 fatal events have been observed, unless the data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) recommends early termination. The target dose for carvedilol is 25 mg bid and for metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid. This manuscript outlines the rationale, design and possible outcomes of COMET.

Cardiovascular = CV; Heart failure = HF.

Figure 1. Survival Analysis for COPERNICUS (Intent-to-Treat)

The effect on mortality was principally the result of a reduction in the rate of sudden death among subjects without worsening heart failure.

Patients' global assessments, in which carvedilol‑treated subjects were compared with placebo, were based on pre-specified, periodic patient self-assessments regarding whether clinical status post-treatment showed improvement, worsening, or no change compared with baseline. Subjects treated with carvedilol showed significant improvements in global assessments compared with those treated with placebo in COPERNICUS.

The protocol also specified that hospitalizations would be assessed. Fewer subjects on immediate‑release carvedilol than on placebo were hospitalized for any reason (372 versus 432, P = 0.0029), for cardiovascular reasons (246 versus 314, P = 0.0003), or for worsening heart failure (198 versus 268, P = 0.0001).

Immediate‑release carvedilol had a consistent and beneficial effect on all‑cause mortality as well as the combined end points of all‑cause mortality plus hospitalization (total, CV, or for heart failure) in the overall trial population and in all subgroups examined, including men and women, elderly and non‑elderly, blacks and non‑blacks, and diabetics and non-diabetics (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in COPERNICUS

Although the clinical trials used twice-daily dosing, clinical pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data provide a reasonable basis for concluding that once-daily dosing with COREG CR should be adequate in the treatment of heart failure.

Although the clinical trials used twice-daily dosing, clinical pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data provide a reasonable basis for concluding that once-daily dosing with COREG CR should be adequate in the treatment of heart failure.

### Association of treatment with carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate and mortality in patients with heart failure [^116KbMuU]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The β-blockers carvedilol and metoprolol succinate both reduce mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), but the comparative clinical effectiveness of these drugs is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether carvedilol is associated with improved survival compared with metoprolol succinate.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study of patients with incident HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (≤ 40%) who received carvedilol (n = 6026) or metoprolol succinate (n = 5638) using data from a Danish national HF registry linked with health care and administrative databases.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality (primary outcome) and cardiovascular mortality (secondary outcome) were analyzed using Cox regression with adjustment for a propensity score, derived from a range of clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the patients was 69.3 (9.1) years, 71% were men, and 51% were hospitalized at index HF diagnosis. During a median (interquartile range) 2.4 (1.0–3.0) years of follow-up, 875 carvedilol users and 754 metoprolol users died; the cumulative incidence of mortality was 18.3% and 18.8%, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for carvedilol users vs metoprolol users was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.11), corresponding to an absolute risk difference of -0.07 (95% CI, -0.84 to 0.77) deaths per 100 person-years. Estimates were consistent across subgroup analyses by sex, age, levels of LVEF, New York Heart Association classification, and history of ischemic heart disease. A higher proportion of carvedilol users achieved the recommended daily target dose (50 mg; 3124 [52%]) than did metoprolol users (200 mg; 689 [12%]); among patients who reached the target dose, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72–1.30). A robustness analysis with 1:1 propensity score matching confirmed the primary findings (hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.84–1.13]). The adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.88–1.26).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings from real-world clinical practice indicate that the effectiveness of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in patients with HF is similar.

2.2	 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION.

Treatment with COREG may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that COREG be started at 6.25 mg twice daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 12.5 mg twice daily, then again to the target dose of 25 mg twice daily. A lower starting dose may be used (3.125 mg twice daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

2.3	Hypertension

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of COREG is 6.25 mg twice daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 12.5 mg twice daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 25 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed. The full antihypertensive effect of COREG is seen within 7 to 14 days. Total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg.

Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.

2.4	Hepatic Impairment

COREG should not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

### Carvedilol [^111QiQBF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

All-cause mortality was 15% in the placebo group and 12% in the carvedilol group, indicating a 23% risk reduction in subjects treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 2% to 40%, P = 0.03), as shown in Figure 3. The effects on mortality in various subgroups are shown in Figure 4. Nearly all deaths were cardiovascular (which were reduced by 25% by carvedilol), and most of these deaths were sudden or related to pump failure (both types of death were reduced by carvedilol). Another trial end point, total mortality and all-cause hospitalization, did not show a significant improvement.

There was also a significant 40% reduction in fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction observed in the group treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 11% to 60%, P = 0.01). A similar reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction was also observed in a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials of carvedilol in heart failure.

14.3 Hypertension

Carvedilol tablets were studied in 2 placebo-controlled trials that utilized twice-daily dosing at total daily doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In these and other trials, the starting dose did not exceed 12.5 mg. At 50 mg per day, carvedilol tablets reduced sitting trough (12-hour) blood pressure by about 9/5.5 mm Hg; at 25 mg per day the effect was about 7.5/3.5 mm Hg. Comparisons of trough-to-peak blood pressure showed a trough-to-peak ratio for blood pressure response of about 65%. Heart rate fell by about 7.5 beats per minute at 50 mg per day. In general, as is true for other β-blockers, responses were smaller in black than non-black subjects. There were no age- or gender- related differences in response.

The peak antihypertensive effect occurred 1 to 2 hours after a dose. The dose-related blood pressure response was accompanied by a dose-related increase in adverse effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

2.1 Heart Failure

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP-TITRATION. Prior to initiation of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules is 10 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Patients who tolerate a dose of 10 mg once daily may have their dose increased to 20, 40, and 80 mg over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated.

Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. Thus, during these periods, they should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.

Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.

The dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).

Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules.

The COMET Trial

In this double-blind trial, 3,029 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) were randomized to receive either carvedilol (target dose: 25 mg twice daily) or immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose: 50 mg twice daily). The mean age of the subjects was approximately 62 years, 80% were males, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 26%. Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure. Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and "statin" lipid-lowering agents (21%). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. The mean dose of carvedilol was 42 mg per day.

The trial had 2 primary end points: all-cause mortality and the composite of death plus hospitalization for any reason. The results of COMET are presented in Table 5 below. All-cause mortality carried most of the statistical weight and was the primary determinant of the trial size. All-cause mortality was 34% in the subjects treated with carvedilol and was 40% in the immediate-release metoprolol group (P = 0.0017; hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.93). The effect on mortality was primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular death. The difference between the 2 groups with respect to the composite end point was not significant (P = 0.122). The estimated mean survival was 8.0 years with carvedilol and 6.6 years with immediate-release metoprolol.

Table 5. Results of COMET

It is not known whether this formulation of metoprolol at any dose or this low dose of metoprolol in any formulation has any effect on survival or hospitalization in patients with heart failure. Thus, this trial extends the time over which carvedilol manifests benefits on survival in heart failure, but it is not evidence that carvedilol improves outcome over the formulation of metoprolol (TOPROL-XL®) with benefits in heart failure.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

In clinical trials of COREG CR in subjects with hypertension (338 subjects) and in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following a myocardial infarction or heart failure (187 subjects), the profile of adverse events observed with carvedilol phosphate was generally similar to that observed with the administration of immediate‑release carvedilol. Therefore, the information included within this section is based on data from controlled clinical trials with COREG CR as well as immediate‑release carvedilol.

5.1 Cessation of Therapy

Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with COREG CR, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in angina patients following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with β ‑ blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other β ‑ blockers, when discontinuation of COREG CR is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. COREG CR should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that COREG CR be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with COREG CR abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure.

5.2 Bradycardia

In clinical trials with immediate‑release carvedilol, bradycardia was reported in about 2% of hypertensive subjects, 9% of heart failure subjects, and 6.5% of myocardial infarction subjects with left ventricular dysfunction. Bradycardia was reported in 0.5% of subjects receiving COREG CR in a trial of heart failure subjects and myocardial infarction subjects with left ventricular dysfunction. There were no reports of bradycardia in the clinical trial of COREG CR in hypertension. However, if pulse rate drops below 55 beats per minute, the dosage of COREG CR should be reduced.

### Should β-blocker therapy be reduced or withdrawn after an episode of decompensated heart failure? Results from COMET [^115UZBFh]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether beta-blocker therapy should be reduced or withdrawn in patients who develop acute decompensated heart failure (HF). We studied the relationship between changes in beta-blocker dose and outcome in patients surviving a HF hospitalisation in COMET.

Methods

Patients hospitalised for HF were subdivided on the basis of the beta-blocker dose administered at the visit following hospitalisation, compared to that administered before.

Results

In COMET, 752/3029 patients (25%, 361 carvedilol and 391 metoprolol) had a non-fatal HF hospitalisation while on study treatment. Of these, 61 patients (8%) had beta-blocker treatment withdrawn, 162 (22%) had a dose reduction and 529 (70%) were maintained on the same dose. One-and two-year cumulative mortality rates were 28.7% and 44.6% for patients withdrawn from study medication, 37.4% and 51.4% for those with a reduced dosage (n.s.) and 19.1% and 32.5% for those maintained on the same dose (HR,1.59; 95%CI, 1.28–1.98; p < 0.001, compared to the others). The result remained significant in a multivariable model: (HR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.02–1.66; p = 0.0318). No interaction with the beneficial effects of carvedilol, compared to metoprolol, on outcome was observed (p = 0.8436).

Conclusions

HF hospitalisations are associated with a high subsequent mortality. The risk of death is higher in patients who discontinue beta-blocker therapy or have their dose reduced. The increase in mortality is only partially explained by the worse prognostic profile of these patients.

### Left ventricular assist device as a bridge to recovery for patients with advanced heart failure [^1113TGbX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Study participants

The study population consisted of 58 male patients — 16 LVAD explanted (recovered) patients, 18 LVAD implanted, and 24 heart transplant candidates (HTx) — and 97 healthy controls with no known cardiovascular diseases. Exclusion criteria included inability to perform treadmill exercise tests, inability to exercise beyond anaerobic threshold, symptomatic angina limiting exercise, and unwillingness to provide a consent form.

The majority of LVAD explanted patients (87%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I, and 13% were in NYHA functional class II. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ranged from 50% to 72%. The mean period of LVAD support was 396 days, with a range of 22 to 638 days. The explantation was considered if the following criteria were met while the LVAD was off for 15 min: a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of < 60 mm; a left ventricular end-systolic diameter of < 50 mm and a LVEF of > 45%; a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (or pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure) of < 12 mm Hg; a resting cardiac index of > 2.8 l/min/m 2 of body surface area; and a maximal oxygen consumption with exercise of > 16 ml/kg/min and an increase in minute ventilation relative to the carbon dioxide production (ventilatory response) of < 34. Patients in the present study were tested at an average of 3.3 ± 1.1 years (range 0.3 to 5.8 years) following device explantation. All explanted LVAD patients completed 2 stages of a pharmacological regimen suggested by Birks et al. In the first stage (intended to enhance reverse remodeling), treatment with 4 drugs was initiated immediately after the patient had been weaned from inotropic therapy with adequate end-organ recovery. The 4 drugs and the maximum titrated doses were as follows: lisinopril 40 mg daily; carvedilol 50 mg twice daily; spironolactone 25 mg daily; and losartan 100 mg daily. The second stage of pharmacological therapy was instituted after maximal regression in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter had been achieved while the LVAD was in place. When a constant left ventricular size had been maintained for at least 2 weeks, according to echocardiographic assessment, clenbuterol was administered at an initial dose of 40 μg twice daily, then at a dose of 40 μg 3 times daily, and finally at a dose of 700 μg 3 times daily. The dose was adjusted to maintain the resting heart rate at a level below 100 beats/min. Before clenbuterol was started, carvedilol was replaced by the selective β 1 -blocker bisoprolol. In addition patients were advised to increase their physical activity by walking > 30 min per day.

Figure 5. Changes from Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure and Diastolic Blood Pressure Measured by 24-Hour ABPM

Immediate‑release carvedilol was studied in 2 placebo‑controlled trials that utilized twice‑daily dosing, at total daily doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In these and other trials, the starting dose did not exceed 12.5 mg. At 50 mg per day, COREG reduced sitting trough (12‑hour) blood pressure by about 9/5.5 mm Hg; at 25 mg per day the effect was about 7.5/3.5 mm Hg. Comparisons of trough‑to‑peak blood pressure showed a trough‑to‑peak ratio for blood pressure response of about 65%. Heart rate fell by about 7.5 beats per minute at 50 mg per day. In general, as is true for other β‑blockers, responses were smaller in black than non‑black subjects. There were no age‑ or gender‑related differences in response. The dose‑related blood pressure response was accompanied by a dose‑related increase in adverse effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

14.4 Hypertension with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In a double-blind trial (GEMINI), carvedilol, added to an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, was evaluated in a population with mild‑to‑moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.2%. COREG was titrated to a mean dose of 17.5 mg twice daily and maintained for 5 months. COREG had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements (mean change from baseline of 0.02%, 95% CI: ‑0.06 to 0.10, P = NS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

COREG is a racemic mixture in which nonselective β-adrenoreceptor blocking activity is present in the S(-) enantiomer and α1-adrenergic blocking activity is present in both R(+) and S(-) enantiomers at equal potency. COREG has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.

Heart Failure

The basis for the beneficial effects of COREG in heart failure is not established.

Two placebo‑controlled trials compared the acute hemodynamic effects of COREG with baseline measurements in 59 and 49 subjects with NYHA class II‑IV heart failure receiving diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digitalis. There were significant reductions in systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and heart rate. Initial effects on cardiac output, stroke volume index, and systemic vascular resistance were small and variable.

These trials measured hemodynamic effects again at 12 to 14 weeks. COREG significantly reduced systemic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and heart rate, while stroke volume index was increased.

Among 839 subjects with NYHA class II‑III heart failure treated for 26 to 52 weeks in 4 U.S. placebo‑controlled trials, average left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) measured by radionuclide ventriculography increased by 9 EF units (%) in subjects receiving COREG and by 2 EF units in placebo subjects at a target dose of 25 to 50 mg twice daily. The effects of carvedilol on ejection fraction were related to dose. Doses of 6.25 mg twice daily, 12.5 mg twice daily, and 25 mg twice daily were associated with placebo‑corrected increases in EF of 5 EF units, 6 EF units, and 8 EF units, respectively; each of these effects were nominally statistically significant.

### Adherence with once daily versus twice daily carvedilol in patients with heart failure: the compliance and quality of life study comparing once-daily controlled-release carvedilol CR and twice-daily immediate-release carvedilol IR in patients with heart failure (CASPER) trial [^114bf4GS]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Suboptimal compliance in taking guideline-based pharmacotherapy in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) potentially increases the burden of hospitalizations and diminishes quality of life. By simplifying the medical regimen, once-daily dosing can potentially improve compliance. The Compliance And Quality of Life Study Comparing Once-Daily Controlled-Release Carvedilol CR and Twice-Daily Immediate-Release Carvedilol IR in Patients with Heart Failure (CASPER) Trial was designed to measure differential compliance, satisfaction, and quality of life in chronic HF patients taking carvedilol immediate release (IR) twice daily versus the bioequivalent carvedilol controlled-release (CR) once daily.

Methods and Results

CASPER was a prospective multicenter, 3-arm, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial for a 5-month period. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and compare compliance with carvedilol IR twice daily (BID) and carvedilol phosphate CR once daily (QD) in patients with chronic HF who were taking carvedilol IR. Secondary objectives included comparisons of quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), satisfaction with medication, and brain natriuretic peptide levels between subjects taking the two formulations. A total of 405 patients with chronic HF and left ventricular dysfunction were randomized to: (A) carvedilol IR twice daily, given double blind; (B) carvedilol CR taken in the morning and placebo in the afternoon, given double blind; or (C) carvedilol CR once daily, open label. Compliance was measured using the medication event monitoring system that captures time of bottle opening. The primary end point was a comparison of taking compliance (doses taken divided by total number of prescribed doses over the actual duration of the study) between the double-blind carvedilol IR BID versus the open-label carvedilol CR QD groups. Sample size estimates were based on assumptions of 75% compliance with BID dosing and 90% compliance with QD dosing. Mean compliance with carvedilol IR BID was 89.3% compared with 88.2% for carvedilol CR QD, and differential mean compliance was 1.1% (95% CI -4.4%, 6.6%; ie, not significant). There were no statistically significant differences in compliance between any of the 3 groups, nor differences in quality of life, treatment satisfaction, or physiologic measures among the 3 study arms. There were also no significant differences in adverse events or side effects among patients switching from carvedilol IR to carvedilol CR in arms B or C over the 5-month study duration compared with patients remaining on carvedilol IR.

Conclusions

Compliance among chronic HF patients in the CASPER trial was high at baseline and unaffected by QD versus BID dosing. Over the 5-month follow-up period, there were no differences in adverse events among patients switching from carvedilol IR to CR.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^111FpTt4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic heart failure is a growing epidemic associated with high mortality, morbidity, and quality of life (QoL) impairment and is a substantial burden on health systems. Three key trials have randomized nearly 9000 patients with systolic heart failure to beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate controlled release) or placebo and demonstrated a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations. – Nevertheless, recent large international surveys have shown that only 20–40% of heart failure patients are taking beta-blockers and the mean dose is half the recommended target.

The underuse and underdosing of beta-blockers may reflect a reluctance to change practice stemming from their long-standing contraindication in heart failure. Conversely, it may reflect a true lack of tolerability of beta-blockers in patients who are typically relatively old, have co-morbidities, and are taking a range of other drugs. It is noteworthy that many previous beta-blocker trials included heart failure patients who were younger (mean age 61–64) than those encountered in routine practice (mean age 71–75). –,

Class effects may not be uniform and tolerability may differ between the commonly used beta-blockers, reflecting their distinct pharmacological profiles such as selectivity for the β 1 -adrenoceptor subtype (bisoprolol) or vasodilatory activity (carvedilol). However, differences in tolerability have not been systematically studied. If one proven beta-blocker were better tolerated than another it could be of considerable public health importance. Results of the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), suggested that overall tolerability of carvedilol vs. metoprolol tartrate does not differ, but it has been suggested that this interpretation is problematic because doses were not equivalent. The second Carvedilol Open-Label Assessment found good tolerability for carvedilol in older heart failure patients, but no previous double-blind randomized trial had tolerability as the primary endpoint.

Immediate-release carvedilol was studied in 2 placebo-controlled trials that utilized twice-daily dosing at total daily doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In these and other trials, the starting dose did not exceed 12.5 mg. At 50 mg per day, COREG reduced sittıng trough (12-hour) blood pressure by about 9/5.5 mm Hg, at 25 mg per day the effect was about 7.5/3.5 mm Hg. Comparisons of trough-to-peak blood pressure showed a trough-to-peak ratio for blood pressure response of about 65%. Heart rate fell by about 7.5 beats per minute at 50 mg per day. In general, as is true for other β-blockers, responses were smaller in black than non-black subjects. There were no age- or gender-related differences in response. The dose-related blood pressure response was accompanied by a dose-related increase in adverse effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Background

Carvedilol has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). There are limited data of carvedilol use in patients on inotrope therapy. We present our experience with carvedilol titration in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIb/IV patients stabilized on milrinone therapy, as a nonrandomized study with a parallel control group of patients never on inotropes. These patients achieved volume control and stabilization of their symptoms during the course of milrinone therapy.

Methods and Results

Seventeen patients in class IIIb/IV CHF (group 1) on intermittent intravenous milrinone therapy and 15 patients in class II/IIIa compensated CHF (group 2) on standard triple heart failure therapy were titrated on carvedilol. Success and adverse events during titration were compared between the 2 groups. Fifteen (88%) patients in group 1 and 14 (93%) patients in group 2 were successfully titrated on carvedilol over 8.1 ± 1.8 weeks and 6.7 ± 2.8 weeks, respectively. The target dose of carvedilol (25 or 50 mg twice daily) was achieved in 13 (87%) patients (group 1) and 14 (93%) patients (group 2). Seven (47%) patients in group 1 and 4 (28%) patients in group 2 had adverse events during carvedilol titration. Eight (53%) patients in group 1 were weaned off milrinone over a period of 8.4 weeks after carvedilol titration, whereas the rest of the patients had reduction in the frequency of infusion. Ten (63%) patients in group 1 improved by one or more functional classes.

Conclusions

Patients in NYHA class IIIb/IV who are treated with inotropic therapy can be titrated on carvedilol after reaching a stable state while on milrinone and standard oral drugs. Most of these patients can be successfully weaned off of milrinone or have decreased frequency of infusions and demonstrate improved functional status. Prospective randomized trials are required to evaluate these observations made in a limited number of patients in class IIIb and IV CHF because the combination of milrinone and beta-blockers has never been adequately evaluated.

### Effects of metoprolol and carvedilol on cause-specific mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure – COMET [^116nDQor]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers with different receptor bindings reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. We compared the effects of the beta1-blocker metoprolol tartrate and the beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-blocker carvedilol.

Methods

In a randomized double-blind design, 3029 patients with chronic congestive heart failure requiring diuretic therapy and with left ventricular dysfunction were randomized to treatment with carvedilol (n = 1511) or metoprolol tartrate (n = 1518) and titrated to target doses of 25 mg of carvedilol twice daily or 50 mg of metoprolol tartrate twice daily. The main outcome measures were total mortality and the combination of mortality or hospitalization for any cause. Secondary end points were cardiovascular death, combinations of morbidity and mortality, New York Heart Association class, worsening of heart failure, hospitalizations, and discontinuation of study therapy.

Results

A total of 512 and 600 patients in the carvedilol group and metoprolol group, respectively, died (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.93, P = 0.0017). Cardiovascular death was reduced by carvedilol (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.90, P = 0.0004). There were fewer sudden deaths and deaths caused by circulatory failure or by stroke in the carvedilol group. There was no difference in all-cause hospitalizations or in worsening heart failure between treatment groups. The incidence of fatal or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the carvedilol group (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52–0.97, P = 0.03). Discontinuations of study therapy were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Compared with metoprolol tartrate, carvedilol reduced cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, death caused by circulatory failure, death caused by stroke, as well as fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^113ALU8C]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations

A correlation between tolerability to the target doses or titration success and mortality cannot be established on the basis of our data due to the short follow-up. Another limitation might be that there is no recommended beta-blocker target dose for patients with preserved LVEF. However, despite a lack of proven reduction in mortality, there is an expert-based recommendation of heart rate lowering using beta-blockers in diastolic heart failure and for reasons of comparison, we used the same dose. In addition, recent data from SENIORS suggest that beta-blockers may possibly be effective in patients with LVEF > 35%. It may be considered a limitation that only 25% of patients reached the primary endpoint though a target of 50% was planned. However, this should first be seen as an unexpected outcome which deserves consideration when speaking about the meaning of target dose, and second, it is not a true limitation as the power of the study was not reduced. Further, it was not mandatory for CIBIS-ELD investigators to document reasons for titration failure. Therefore, a blinded endpoint committee assessed the patients' clinical data at the time of titration failure (for failures unrelated to adverse events) and potential reasons for titration failure were recorded where possible.

### Carvedilol alone or in combination with digoxin for the management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure? [^111xKrSX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study examined the relative merits of digoxin, carvedilol, and their combination for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF).

Background

In patients with AF and HF, both digoxin and beta-blockers reduce the ventricular rate, and both may improve symptoms, but only beta-blockers have been shown to improve prognosis. If combined therapy is not superior to beta-blockers alone, treatment of patients with HF and AF could be simplified by stopping digoxin.

Methods

We enrolled 47 patients (29 males; mean age 68 years) with persistent AF and HF (mean left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 24%) in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. In the first phase of the study, digoxin was compared with the combination of digoxin and carvedilol (four months). In the second phase, digoxin was withdrawn in a double-blinded manner in the carvedilol-treated arm, thus allowing a comparison between digoxin and carvedilol (six months). Investigations were undertaken at baseline and at the end of each phase.

Results

Compared with digoxin alone, combination therapy lowered the ventricular rate on 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (p < 0.0001) and during submaximal exercise (p < 0.05), whereas LVEF (p < 0.05) and symptom score (p < 0.05) improved. In phase 2, there was no significant difference between digoxin alone and carvedilol alone in any variable. The mean ventricular rate rose and LVEF fell when patients switched from combination therapy to carvedilol alone. Six-minute walk distance was not significantly influenced by any therapy.

Conclusions

The combination of carvedilol and digoxin appears generally superior to either carvedilol or digoxin alone in the management of AF in patients with HF.

### Betablockers in heart failure: carvedilol safety assessment (CASA 2-trial) [^116q7bE4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Betablockers are a cornerstone in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The purpose of the present study was to assess safety and tolerability of carvedilol in CHF-patients.

Methods

66 general practitioners, who were supervised by a local cardiologist, enrolled 151 CHF-patients. All patients were on standard therapy with ACE-inhibitors and diuretics. Carvedilol treatment was started with 3.125 mg twice daily and slowly uptitrated in 2-week intervals to 2x25 mg per day. Mean follow-up was 12 weeks.

Results

145 of the 151 patients (96%) finished the study according to protocol, six patients were lost to follow-up (4%). 59 patients (41%) experienced minor and nine (6%) serious adverse events. 68 were under maximal therapy with 50 mg daily, 33 received 25 mg, and 15 12.5 mg. Overall tolerability was good and NYHA-class fell significantly from 2.2 to 1.8 (P < 0.001). Mean heart rate decreased from 78 to 69 bpm (P < 0.001), mean systolic blood pressure from 137 to 132 mmHg (P < 0.001) and mean diastolic blood pressure from 80 to 76 mmHg (P < 0.001). Quality of life significantly improved under carvedilol with a reduction in the Minnesota living with heart failure score from 1.28 to 0.88 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Carvedilol is well tolerated in CHF-patients treated by general practitioners. Serious adverse events and hospitalisations are rare. Thus, carvedilol is a safe drug in the treatment of CHF-patients and can be easily initiated and managed by the general practitioner.

### Tolerability of carvedilol in heart failure: clinical trials experience [^112S1Cyh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

An extensive clinical trials database now exists to support the therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockers in systolic heart failure. However, concerns remain about the tolerability of these agents. These concerns relate to perceived complexity in initiation and uptitration, risk of worsening heart failure clinical status, and delay in beneficial effects on outcomes. All of the above concerns are thought especially relevant in patients with advanced disease. However, these perceptions are not borne out in the controlled clinical trial experience or in open-label studies and postmarketing surveillance programs with carvedilol. Specifically, in clinical studies, discontinuation rates (because of adverse events), serious adverse event rates, mean achieved dose, and percentage reaching target dose strongly suggest good tolerability. This is especially notable, considering that beta-blockade is used in addition to other background neurohormonal antagonists, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Furthermore, tolerability in the everyday community setting also appears to be high. Carvedilol, specifically, is also well tolerated during initiation of therapy, with fewer withdrawals for heart failure during the first 8 weeks of uptitration, and no delay in the accrual of beneficial clinical outcomes, as observed in the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) study. Thus, in contrast to widely held perceptions about tolerability of beta-blockade in heart failure, carvedilol appears to be an extremely well-tolerated agent, even during initiation and in the most advanced patients.

### Commentary on the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET) [^112zkaWw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

beta-Adrenergic blockade is commonly and successfully used to treat chronic heart failure. Until recently, few data were available on which to base selection of a particular beta-blocking agent. The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) provides evidence that beta-blockers are not interchangeable. The trial compared carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-adrenergic blocking and numerous ancillary activities, with metoprolol tartrate. In comparison to metoprolol tartrate, significant reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were observed with carvedilol. These data indicate that cardiovascular benefit may be obtained from switching patients from metoprolol tartrate to carvedilol.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

COREG should be taken with food to slow the rate of absorption and reduce the incidence of orthostatic effects.

2.1	Heart Failure

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP-TITRATION. Prior to initiation of COREG, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of COREG is 3.125 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. If tolerated, patients may have their dose increased to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg twice daily over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. A maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily has been administered to patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure weighing over 85 kg (187 lbs.).

Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. During these periods, patients should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of COREG from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of COREG should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.

Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.

The dose of COREG should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).

Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of COREG can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol.

### Exchange of β-blockers in heart failure patients. experiences from the poststudy phase of COMET (the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial) [^116dE1gQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) reported a significant survival benefit for carvedilol, a beta1-, beta2- and alpha1-blocker, vs. metoprolol tartrate, a beta1-selective blocker, in patients with mild-to-severe chronic heart failure (CHF). Patients on treatment with metoprolol might benefit from switching to carvedilol.

Aim

To investigate the safety and tolerability of switching beta-blockers in CHF.

Methods

At the end of COMET, the Steering Committee recommended that study medication was stopped without unblinding, and patients were commenced on open-label beta-blockade at a dose equivalent to half the dose of blinded therapy, with subsequent titration to target or maximum tolerated dose. Patients were followed for 30 days.

Results

1321 out of 1440 patients were transitioned to open-label treatment (76.8% to carvedilol). Serious adverse and CHF-related events were respectively 9.4% and 4.7% in those switching from carvedilol to metoprolol and 3.1% and 1.5% in patients switching from metoprolol to carvedilol. Patients who switched from carvedilol to metoprolol showed the highest mortality or hospitalisation rate (12.3%) in comparison with those who switched from metoprolol to carvedilol (3.1%, p < 0.001) or who stayed on the same drug (carvedilol: 2.5%, p < 0.001; metoprolol: 4.2%, p = 0.04). Reducing the initial dose of the second beta-blocker maximised the safety of this strategy. Event rate was higher in patients with more severe heart failure and in those withdrawing from beta-blockade.

Conclusion

Our data show that switching beta-blockers is a practical, safe and well-tolerated strategy to optimise treatment of CHF. Patients who switched to carvedilol showed the lowest rate of adverse events. A closer clinical monitoring is recommended during transition in high-risk patients.

### Effect of carvedilol on the morbidity of patients with severe chronic heart failure: results of the carvedilol prospective randomized cumulative survival (COPERNICUS) study [^113HNAWf]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

The study COPERNICUS was published by Packer M and colleagues in 2002 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the COPERNICUS study, the trial question was: what is the role of carvedilol on the morbidity of patients with severe chronic HF? In the COPERNICUS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the COPERNICUS study, the population was: 2289 patients (470 female, 1819 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with symptoms of HF at rest or on minimal exertion and with an ejection fraction < 25% (but not volume-overloaded). The key exclusion criteria were HF caused by uncorrected primary valvular disease or a reversible form of cardiomyopathy; severe primary pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease; or contraindication to β-blocker therapy. In the COPERNICUS study, the interventions were: n = 1156 carvedilol (target dose of 25 mg BID for an average of 10.4 months) n = 1133 placebo (matching placebo for an average of 10.4 months). In the COPERNICUS study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or hospitalization for a cardiovascular reason (30.2% vs. 41.6%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.84). In the COPERNICUS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death or hospitalization for HF (25.5% vs. 37.9%; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81). In the COPERNICUS study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in serious adverse event (39.0% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.002). In the COPERNICUS study, the conclusion was: in patients with symptoms of HF at rest or on minimal exertion and with an ejection fraction < 25% (but not volume-overloaded), carvedilol was superior to placebo with respect to death or hospitalization for a cardiovascular reason.

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

### Carvedilol (Coreg) [^111ZNv6C]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

All‑cause mortality was 15% in the placebo group and 12% in the carvedilol group, indicating a 23% risk reduction in subjects treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 2% to 40%, P = 0.03), as shown in Figure 3. The effects on mortality in various subgroups are shown in Figure 4. Nearly all deaths were cardiovascular (which were reduced by 25% by carvedilol), and most of these deaths were sudden or related to pump failure (both types of death were reduced by carvedilol). Another trial end point, total mortality and all-cause hospitalization, did not show a significant improvement.

There was also a significant 40% reduction in fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction observed in the group treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 11% to 60%, P = 0.01). A similar reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction was also observed in a meta-analysis of placebo- controlled trials of carvedilol in heart failure.

14.3 Hypertension

COREG was studied in 2 placebo‑controlled trials that utilized twice‑daily dosing at total daily doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In these and other trials, the starting dose did not exceed 12.5 mg. At 50 mg per day, COREG reduced sitting trough (12‑hour) blood pressure by about 9/5.5 mm Hg; at 25 mg per day the effect was about 7.5/3.5 mm Hg. Comparisons of trough-to-peak blood pressure showed a trough-to-peak ratio for blood pressure response of about 65%. Heart rate fell by about 7.5 beats per minute at 50 mg per day. In general, as is true for other β‑blockers, responses were smaller in black than non‑black subjects. There were no age‑ or gender‑related differences in response.

The peak antihypertensive effect occurred 1 to 2 hours after a dose. The dose‑related blood pressure response was accompanied by a dose‑related increase in adverse effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

2.3 Hypertension

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of COREG CR is 20 mg once daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 40 mg once daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 80 mg once daily if tolerated and needed. Although not specifically studied, it is anticipated the full antihypertensive effect of COREG CR would be seen within 7 to 14 days as had been demonstrated with immediate‑release carvedilol. Total daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.

Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.

2.4 Hepatic Impairment

COREG CR should not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

2.5 Geriatric Use

When switching elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) who are taking the higher doses of immediate-release carvedilol tablets (25 mg twice daily) to COREG CR, a lower starting dose (40 mg) of COREG CR is recommended to minimize the potential for dizziness, syncope, or hypotension [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Patients who have switched and who tolerate COREG CR should, as appropriate, have their dose increased after an interval of at least 2 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Comparison of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET): randomised controlled trial [^116icuNU]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Beta blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.

Methods

In a multicentre, double-blind, and randomised parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. Analysis was done by intention to treat.

Findings

The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07) and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74–0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The composite endpoint of mortality or all-cause admission occurred in 1116 (74%) of 1511 on carvedilol and in 1160 (76%) of 1518 on metoprolol (0.94 [0.86–1.02], p = 0.122). Incidence of side-effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.

Interpretation

Our results suggest that carvedilol extends survival compared with metoprolol.

### Β-blockers in hypertension: is carvedilol different? [^113YrYtp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Most studies assessing the effects of beta-blockers were carried out with traditional, beta(1)-selective beta-blockers, such as metoprolol and atenolol. Pathophysiologic and pharmacologic studies have documented that not all beta-blockers are created equal. In particular, the pharmacologic and clinical profiles of the newer, vasodilating beta-blockers, such as carvedilol, have been shown to differ from those of the traditional beta-blockers. These differences, although relevant in the younger patient with hypertension, are particularly important in elderly patients in whom traditional beta-blockers may not be as effective or as well tolerated as the newer vasodilating agents.

5.6 Effects on Blood Sugar

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery not eating regularly or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

In patients with heart failure and diabetes, carvedilol therapy may lead to worsening hyperglycemia, which responds to intensification of hypoglycemic therapy. It is recommended that blood glucose be monitored when carvedilol dosing is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. Trials designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on glycemic control in patients with diabetes and heart failure have not been conducted.

In a trial designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on glycemic control in a population with mild-to-moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, carvedilol had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements [(14.4)].

5.7 Peripheral Vascular Disease

β-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals.

5.8 Deterioration of Renal Function

Rarely, use of carvedilol in patients with heart failure has resulted in deterioration of renal function. Patients at risk appear to be those with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg), ischemic heart disease and diffuse vascular disease, and/or underlying renal insufficiency. Renal function has returned to baseline when carvedilol was stopped. In patients with these risk factors it is recommended that renal function be monitored during up-titration of carvedilol and the drug discontinued or dosage reduced if worsening of renal function occurs.

5.9 Major Surgery

Chronically administered β-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

5.10 Thyrotoxicosis

β-adrenergic blockade may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of β-blockade may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate thyroid storm.

The protocol also specified that hospitalizations would be assessed. Fewer subjects on immediate-release carvedilol than on placebo were hospitalized for any reason (372 versus 432, P = 0.0029), for cardiovascular reasons (246 versus 314, P = 0.0003), or for worsening heart failure (198 versus 268, P = 0.0001).

Immediate-release carvedilol had a consistent and beneficial effect on all-cause mortality as well as the combined end points of all-cause mortality plus hospitalization (total, CV, or for heart failure) in the overall trial population and in all subgroups examined, including men and women, elderly and non-elderly, blacks and non-blacks, and diabetics and non-diabetics (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in COPERNICUS

Although the clinical trials used twice-daily dosing, clinical pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data provide a reasonable basis for concluding that once-daily dosing with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be adequate in the treatment of heart failure.

14.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

CAPRICORN was a double-blind trial comparing carvedilol and placebo in 1,959 subjects with a recent myocardial infarction (within 21 days) and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40%, with (47%) or without symptoms of heart failure. Subjects given carvedilol received 6.25 mg twice daily, titrated as tolerated to 25 mg twice daily. Subjects had to have a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, a sitting heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute, and no contraindication to beta-blocker use. Treatment of the index infarction included aspirin (85%), IV or oral beta-blockers (37%), nitrates (73%), heparin (64%), thrombolytics (40%), and acute angioplasty (12%). Background treatment included ACE inhibitors or angiotensin ­receptor blockers (97%), anticoagulants (20%), lipid-lowering agents (23%), and diuretics (34%). Baseline population characteristics included an average age of 63 years, 74% male, 95% Caucasian, mean blood pressure 121/74 mm Hg, 22% with diabetes, and 54% with a history of hypertension. Mean dosage achieved of carvedilol was 20 mg twice daily; mean duration of follow-up was 15 months.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Support for the use of COREG CR extended-release capsules for the treatment of mild-to-severe heart failure and for patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction is based on the equivalence of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (β1-blockade) parameters between COREG CR and immediate-release carvedilol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

The clinical trials performed with immediate-release carvedilol in heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction are presented below.

14.1 Heart Failure

A total of 6,975 subjects with mild-to-severe heart failure were evaluated in placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials of immediate-release carvedilol.

Mild-to-Moderate Heart Failure

Carvedilol was studied in 5 multicenter, placebo-controlled trials, and in 1 active-controlled trial (COMET trial) involving subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure.

Four U.S. multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolled 1,094 subjects (696 randomized to carvedilol) with NYHA class II-III heart failure and ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.35. The vast majority were on digitalis, diuretics, and an ACE inhibitor at trial entry. Subjects were assigned to the trials based upon exercise ability. An Australia-New Zealand double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 415 subjects (half randomized to immediate-release carvedilol) with less severe heart failure. All protocols excluded subjects expected to undergo cardiac transplantation during the 7.5 to 15 months of double-blind follow-up. All randomized subjects had tolerated a 2-week course on immediate-release carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily.

In each trial, there was a primary end point, either progression of heart failure (1 U.S. trial) or exercise tolerance (2 U.S. trials meeting enrollment goals and the Australia-New Zealand trial). There were many secondary end points specified in these trials, including NYHA classification, patient and physician global assessments, and cardiovascular hospitalization. Other analyses not prospectively planned included the sum of deaths and total cardiovascular hospitalizations. In situations where the primary end points of a trial do not show a significant benefit of treatment, assignment of significance values to the other results is complex, and such values need to be interpreted cautiously.

The results of the U.S. and Australia-New Zealand trials were as follows:

### Tolerability of carvedilol and ACE-inhibition in mild heart failure. results of CARMEN (carvedilol ACE-inhibitor remodelling mild CHF evaluatioN) [^111ZC2cK]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Management guidelines for heart failure recommend ACE-I and beta-blockers. The perception of difficult up-titration might have added to the slow uptake of beta-blockers despite their mortality and morbidity benefits.

Aims

CARMEN offered a possibility to study safety and tolerability of enalapril against carvedilol and their combination.

Methods

Five hundred and seventy-two patients were blindly up-titrated on carvedilol (target 25 mg bid) and/or enalapril (target 10 mg bid), and continued for 18 months. In the combination arm, carvedilol was up-titrated before enalapril.

Results

There was no group related difference in adverse events during up-titration. Withdrawal rates were 31, 30 and 30%, and serious adverse events 28, 29 and 34% in the combination, carvedilol and enalapril arms. Mortality was similar in all groups (all-cause N = 14, 14 and 14; cardiovascular N = 9, 13 and 14). All-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations occurred in 26, 27 and 32%, and in 12, 16 and 22% in the combination, carvedilol and enalapril arms, respectively.

Conclusion

The safety profile was similar in all treatment arms. In contrast to common perception, there was no difference in tolerability between the ACE-I and carvedilol. This result is even more remarkable as the high prestudy use of ACE-I (65%) might have introduced a bias by selecting ACE-I tolerant patients, who were only switched from their former ACE-I to enalapril.

Severe Heart Failure (COPERNICUS)

In a double-blind trial (COPERNICUS), 2,289 subjects with heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% (mean 20%), despite digitalis (66%), diuretics (99%), and ACE inhibitors (89%), were randomized to placebo or carvedilol. Carvedilol was titrated from a starting dose of 3.125 mg twice daily to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 25 mg twice daily over a minimum of 6 weeks. Most subjects achieved the target dose of 25 mg. The trial was conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Israel, and Canada. Similar numbers of subjects per group (about 100) withdrew during the titration period.

The primary end point of the trial was all ‑cause mortality, but cause‑specific mortality and the risk of death or hospitalization (total, cardiovascular [CV], or heart failure [HF]) were also examined. The developing trial data were followed by a data monitoring committee, and mortality analyses were adjusted for these multiple looks. The trial was stopped after a median follow‑up of 10 months because of an observed 35% reduction in mortality (from 19.7% per patient-year on placebo to 12.8% on carvedilol; hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.81, P = 0.0014, adjusted) (see Figure 1). The results of COPERNICUS are shown in Table 4.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^113XGfkV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Procedures

Patients were recruited through primary care physicians, and secondary and tertiary care hospitals. Upon enrolment, they were randomly assigned to either bisoprolol or carvedilol. For each centre, a random sequence of permuted blocks of variable length was generated by the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig. Patients, investigators, and study personnel were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the trial.

During the initial titration phase of the study, patients were seen at fortnightly intervals. According to the titration scheme [based on the 2005 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines], the dose was scheduled to double at every visit to reach the target dose of 10 mg bisoprolol once daily or 25 mg carvedilol twice daily within 6 weeks (50 mg twice daily within 8 weeks for patients > 85 kg). Investigators were free to delay titration or reduce the dose if clinically indicated. The titration phase was followed by a maintenance period lasting 4 weeks and the final visit was at 10 weeks (12 weeks for patients > 85 kg).

Outcome measures

The primary endpoint of tolerability was defined as reaching the target dose through the process of fortnightly doubling with no more than one delayed increase and with the target dose maintained for at least 10 days. Titration failure was defined as failure to up-titrate more than once or as down-titration after receiving the target dose level. Predefined secondary endpoints were the percentage of target dose achieved at the end of the study, and the dose achieved prior to first titration failure. Occurrences of adverse events were recorded and their association with dose adjustment was assessed by odds ratios. For titration failures with no simultaneous adverse event, we implemented a blinded endpoint committee consisting of experts with sound clinical experience in heart failure therapy and research who evaluated the circumstances of titration failure based on data from all visits and additional investigator comments. Multiple reasons could be specified by the endpoint committee (Appendix).

Predefined clinical secondary endpoints were: NYHA functional class, heart rate, blood pressure (measured prior to dose titration at each visit) and LVEF, assessment of diastolic function, 6 min walk distance, 1 s forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) and the physical and psychosocial component scores on the short-form QoL health survey (SF36) at the end of the study, adjusted for baseline.

The COMET Trial

In this double-blind trial, 3,029 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) were randomized to receive either carvedilol (target dose: 25 mg twice daily) or immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose\. 50 mg twice daily). The mean age of the subjects was approximately 62 years, 80% were males, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 26%. Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure. Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and "statin" lipid-lowering agents (21%). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. The mean dose of carvedilol was 42 mg per day.

The trial had 2 primary end points: all-cause mortality and the composite of death plus hospitalization for any reason. The results of COMET are presented in Table 5 below. All-cause mortality carried most of the statistical weight and was the primary determinant of the trial size. All-cause mortality was 34% in the subjects treated with carvedilol and was 40% in the immediate-release metoprolol group (P = 0.0017, hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.93). The effect on mortality was primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular death. The difference between the 2 groups with respect to the composite end point was not significant (P = 0.122). The estimated mean survival was 8.0 years with carvedilol and 6.6 years with immediate-release metoprolol.

It is not known whether this formulation of metoprolol at any dose or this low dose of metoprolol in any formulation has any effect on survival or hospitalization in patients with heart failure. Thus, this trial extends the time over which carvedilol manifests benefits on survival in heart failure, but it is not evidence that carvedilol improves outcome over the formulation of metoprolol (TOPROL-XL) with benefits in heart failure.

### Effects of initiating carvedilol in patients with severe chronic heart failure: results from the COPERNICUS study [^111PWB3u]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Beta-blockers remain underused despite their established utility for improving outcome in heart failure. Concerns that initiation of treatment produces few immediate benefits and may have important risks may be deterring widespread use.

Objective

To evaluate the early effects of the beta-blocker carvedilol in patients with severe heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from October 28, 1997, to March 20, 2000, at 334 hospital centers in 21 countries among 2289 patients with symptoms of heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion who were clinically euvolemic and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 25%.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol, with start dosage of at 3.125 mg twice daily with uptitration to a target dosage of 25 mg twice daily (n = 1156), or placebo (n = 1133), in addition to their usual medications for heart failure.

Main Outcome Measures

Death, hospitalization, or permanent withdrawal from study drug, as well as adverse events during the first 8 weeks of treatment.

Results

The carvedilol group experienced no increase in cardiovascular risk but instead had fewer patients who died (19 vs 25; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–1.35); who died or were hospitalized (134 vs 153; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67–1.07); or who died, were hospitalized, or were permanently withdrawn from treatment (162 vs 188; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03). These effects were similar in direction and magnitude to those observed during the entire study, and were apparent particularly in the 624 patients with recent or recurrent decompensation or a very depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Differences in favor of carvedilol became apparent as early as 14 to 21 days following initiation of treatment. Worsening heart failure was the only serious adverse event with a frequency greater than 2% and was reported with similar frequency in the placebo and carvedilol groups (6.4% vs 5.1%).

Conclusions

These data suggest that, in clinically euvolemic patients, the relation of benefit to risk during initiation of treatment with carvedilol is similar to that seen during long-term therapy with the drug. Our findings should provide the reassurance needed to encourage the high levels of use that are warranted by the results of long-term clinical trials.

### Carvedilol [^1155JHSy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carvedilol should be taken with food to slow the rate of absorption and reduce the incidence of orthostatic effects.

2.1 Heart Failure

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP-TITRATION. Prior to initiation of Carvedilol tablets, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of Carvedilol tablets are 3.125 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. If tolerated, patients may have their dose increased to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg twice daily over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. A maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily has been administered to patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure weighing over 85 kg (187 lbs).

Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. During these periods, patients should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of Carvedilol tablets from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of Carvedilol tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.

Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.

The dose of Carvedilol tablets should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).

Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of Carvedilol tablets can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol.

2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION. Treatment with carvedilol tablets may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that carvedilol tablets be started at 6.25 mg twice daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 12.5 mg twice daily, then again to the target dose of 25 mg twice daily. A lower starting dose may be used (3.125 mg twice daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

2.3 Hypertension

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol tablets are 6.25 mg twice daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 12.5 mg twice daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 25 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed. The full antihypertensive effect of carvedilol tablets are seen within 7 to 14 days. Total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg.

Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.

2.4 Hepatic Impairment

HFrEF hospitalization — sequencing and dosing during GDMT initiation emphasize practical starting choices and available evidence. For patients with less robust blood pressure, "the first step may be a low dose of an ARB, with a potential switch to sacubitril/valsartan before discharge, once a low dose of beta-blocker has been tolerated (usually starting with metoprolol 6.25 mg twice per day or carvedilol 3.125 mg twice per day)". Evidence on sequence is limited; the historical CIBIS III "demonstrated no difference in overall outcomes… during the first 6 months", whereas "a small trial showed a higher achieved beta-blocker dose, lower heart rate, and greater increase in LVEF at 12 months when beta-blockers were started first". The document notes "The usual strategy aims for addition of all neurohormonal modulatory classes before any up-titration". In the European TRANSITION trial, "similar majorities of patients were on 49/51 mg to 97/103 mg twice-daily doses of sacubitril/valsartan at 10 weeks", regardless of timing relative to discharge, with higher doses in de novo HF, hypertension, and higher starting doses. It also states that U.S. experience shows discharge prescriptions increase maintenance and that "4-pillar GDMT has been shown to decrease recurrent HF events, reverse ventricular remodeling, and extend meaningful survival".

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

Table A — Target doses of guideline-directed medical therapies in heart failure lists angiotensin–converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with target dosing and 50% thresholds: captopril 50 mg, three times daily (total daily target dose 150 mg; 50% 75 mg); enalapril 10 mg, twice daily (20 mg; 10 mg); lisinopril 20 mg, once daily (20 mg; 10 mg); ramipril 10 mg, once daily (10 mg; 5 mg); and perindopril 8 mg, once daily (8 mg; 4 mg). For angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), examples include candesartan 32 mg, once daily (32 mg; 16 mg); losartan 100 mg, once daily (100 mg; 50 mg) with the note that "ACCF/AHA Guidelines recommend losartan 150 mg as target dose. However, because current FDA-approved labeling has 100 mg as the maximal dose, the 100-mg dose is used in the performance measure".; and valsartan 160 mg, twice daily (320 mg; 160 mg). For angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg, twice daily (194/206 mg; 98/102 mg†) is listed, with the footnote that "The sacubitril 98 mg and valsartan 102 mg total daily dosing (49/51 mg twice daily) is considered fulfilling the 50% of target dosing criteria". Evidence-based beta-blockers include bisoprolol 10 mg, once daily (10 mg; 5 mg), carvedilol 25 mg, twice daily (50 mg; 25 mg), carvedilol extended release 80 mg, once daily (80 mg; 40 mg), and metoprolol succinate sustained release 200 mg, once daily (200 mg; 100 mg).

### Beta-blocker dosing in community-based treatment of heart failure [^113P4d3w]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Community patients with heart failure (HF) are older, less often treated by HF specialists, and have more comorbidity than those in randomized clinical trials. These differences might affect beta-blocker prescribing in HF.

Methods

To explore patterns of beta-blocker prescribing for HF in the community and their association with outcomes, we determined carvedilol doses at end titration in 4113 patients from a community-based beta-blocker HF registry according to physician and patient characteristics, HF severity, and rates of hospitalization and death.

Results

Female sex, age ≥ 65 years, and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 35% were associated with lower beta-blocker doses. Average daily dose of beta-blocker was lower with worse baseline New York Heart Association class. More patients of cardiologists achieved carvedilol doses ≥ 25 mg twice daily, whereas in those of noncardiologists lower doses were more common. Relative risk of HF hospitalizations or all-cause death was significantly lower with higher doses of beta-blocker.

Conclusions

Beta-blocker dosing in community HF appears lower than in randomized clinical trials, especially when prescribed by noncardiologists. At all doses, patients taking the beta-blocker carvedilol have a lower incidence of death and HF hospitalization than those discontinuing it, regardless of physician type in the community setting.

### Do β-blockers prolong survival in heart failure only by inhibiting the beta1-receptor? A perspective on the results of the COMET trial [^114G5J9E]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical studies indicate that carvedilol exerts multiple antiadrenergic effects in addition to beta(1)-receptor blockade, but the prognostic importance of these actions has long been debated. This controversy has now been substantially advanced by the results of the recently completed Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), which showed that carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) reduced mortality by 17% when compared with metoprolol (50 mg twice daily), P = 0.0017 — a result that was consistent with the differences seen across earlier controlled trials with beta-blockers in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction and in patients with chronic heart failure. Questions have been raised about the interpretation of these findings in view of the fact that the trial did not use the dose or formulation of metoprolol that was shown to prolong life in a placebo-controlled trial (ie, Metoprolol CR/XL [Controlled Release] Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, however, indicate that the dosing regimen of metoprolol selected for use in the COMET trial produces a magnitude and time course of beta(1)-blockade during a 24-hour period that is similar to the dose of carvedilol targeted for use in the trial. These analyses suggest that the observed difference in the mortality effects of metoprolol and carvedilol is not related to a difference in the magnitude or time course of their beta(1)-blocking effects but instead reflect antiadrenergic effects of carvedilol in addition to beta(1)-blockade.

5.4 Heart Failure/Fluid Retention

Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased and the carvedilol dose should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Occasionally it is necessary to lower the carvedilol dose or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol. In a placebo-controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long-term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients' underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol.

5.5 Non-allergic Bronchospasm

Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive β-blockers. Carvedilol tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if carvedilol tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous β-agonists is minimized.

In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that carvedilol be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up-titration.
