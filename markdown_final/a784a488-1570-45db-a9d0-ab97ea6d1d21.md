## Question

Can pe present with RASH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pulmonary embolism (PE) can present with a rash, and if so, how to think about causality and what clinical pathways this should trigger. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "classic" PE symptoms and signs are and whether authoritative guidelines mention a rash at all. Then, I should verify if there are well-documented atypical or syndromic presentations of PE that include cutaneous findings. Next, I will examine non-thrombotic embolic entities that can mimic PE and present with rash. After that, I should consider scenarios where the rash is iatrogenic or reflects a shared pathophysiology rather than direct embolic disease. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic approach for clinicians when PE and rash coexist, including what to biopsy, what to image, and how to treat both the embolic and dermatologic processes safely and promptly.

> Let me first confirm the "classic" PE phenotype, because I need to ensure I'm not overlooking something basic. The core symptoms of acute PE are dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and occasionally hemoptysis or syncope, and the exam may reveal signs of right ventricular strain or even unilateral leg swelling if there is concomitant DVT; none of the major guideline summaries list rash as a characteristic or expected finding, which suggests that a rash, if present, is atypical for thrombotic PE itself [^114XnYyJ] [^112gUybD] [^113NNkM3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check for exceptions where a rash and PE travel together because of an underlying process rather than PE per se. A high-credibility case describes a 47-year-old man with dyspnea and shock from a saddle PE who also had a painful erythematous lower-extremity rash; the skin biopsy showed IgA vasculitis, indicating the rash reflected vasculitis and the PE was a complication of systemic inflammation rather than a direct cutaneous manifestation of embolic disease, so the coexistence is real but the etiologies are distinct and linked through a shared inflammatory milieu [^111GbPU8]. Let me also consider antiphospholipid syndrome, where livedo reticularis, purpura, or thrombotic skin changes can be the initial clue and venous and arterial thromboses, including PE, are common; here again, the rash signals an autoimmune thrombophilia rather than PE directly causing a rash [^111eYRrN] [^1153VDYQ].

> Next, I should review non-thrombotic embolic entities that can look like PE and often have skin findings. Fat embolism syndrome classically includes a petechial rash on the upper body alongside dyspnea and neurologic changes, with systemic embolization via right-to-left shunts or pulmonary microvascular leakage; the respiratory and cutaneous features can dominate the early course, which could be mistaken for PE in the right context, especially post-fracture or intramedullary procedures [^117L4jck]. Cholesterol embolization, often triggered by vascular manipulation or anticoagulation, can produce livedo reticularis, digital gangrene, and systemic ischemic complications; when respiratory symptoms occur, it is sometimes labeled nonthrombotic PE, and the rash here is a direct embolic cutaneous manifestation rather than a complication of thrombotic PE [^116UAK3r] [^111DrFDM].

> I will now examine tumor embolism and other malignancy-related hypercoagulable states. Pulmonary tumor embolism can mimic thrombotic PE clinically, and in patients with solid tumors, concomitant cutaneous metastases or chemotherapy-related rashes may coexist, making the skin findings attributable to the malignancy or its treatment rather than the embolic process itself; Trousseau syndrome likewise produces migratory thrombophlebitis and VTE, so erythematous tender nodules along veins can accompany PE, again reflecting a systemic hypercoagulable state rather than PE causing a rash de novo [^112pymJc] [^111FAGjY] [^116rrDQm].

> Wait, let me verify drug-induced scenarios, because that's a common pitfall. Several therapies carry both rash and PE risks, and co-occurrence can be coincidental or mechanistically linked through immunomodulation and thrombosis. For example, lenalidomide regimens are associated with both rash and clinically meaningful VTE rates, prompting guideline-endorsed thromboprophylaxis in higher-risk combinations; immune checkpoint inhibitors can provoke rash and, rarely, thrombotic vasculopathies; JAK inhibitors have both hypersensitivity rashes and increased VTE rates in certain populations; and some EGFR/MET bispecifics and related combinations list both rash and PE prominently in adverse event profiles, so temporality and attribution require careful adjudication before assuming a causal PE-rash relationship [^1134ZJQo] [^114KRADi] [^114pRj5e] [^1151BSbw] [^111xbkMJ] [^115Rq6PY] [^116TeDq2].

> But wait, what if the "rash" is actually a marker of end-organ embolic injury that clues us in to an embolic syndrome. I should consider that livedo reticularis, retiform purpura, or acral necrosis may reflect cholesterol or septic emboli, or even aPL-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, and their presence with respiratory symptoms should broaden the embolic differential beyond thrombotic PE and prompt targeted skin biopsy and appropriate vascular imaging, since recognizing these entities changes both prognosis and therapy, including anticoagulation strategies and source control [^116UAK3r] [^114TNix8] [^113D181r].

> I need to ensure I don't conflate infectious or reactive rashes with embolic ones. COVID-19 frequently produces rashes and can precipitate immunothrombosis with VTE. However, the rash is typically immunologic rather than embolic, and PE in that setting is thrombotic, not a manifestation of the rash itself, reinforcing the need to distinguish immunologic exanthems from thrombotic or occlusive vasculopathies when both rash and PE are present [^111TDkng] [^114XnYyJ].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing critical is missing. Direct answer: PE itself does not characteristically cause a rash, but a rash can coexist with PE in several valid clinical contexts, including systemic vasculitides such as IgA vasculitis or aPL syndrome, non-thrombotic embolic syndromes like fat or cholesterol embolism, malignancy-associated hypercoagulability, and drug-induced combinations where both rash and VTE are adverse effects. Rarely, the rash is an embolic skin manifestation from cholesterol or septic emboli, which should trigger biopsy and embolic workup rather than attribution to thrombotic PE alone [^111GbPU8] [^1153VDYQ] [^117L4jck] [^116UAK3r] [^1134ZJQo] [^111xbkMJ] [^113D181r].

> Clinically, I should confirm that when PE and rash coexist, I evaluate for a unifying systemic process and not assume causality from PE to rash. That means checking for vasculitis or aPL with history, serologies, and biopsy when indicated, considering non-thrombotic emboli in the right precipitating context, reviewing medications for dual toxicity, and imaging the venous system and right heart when embolic disease is suspected. If the presentation is high-risk, bedside echocardiography or emergent CTPA is appropriate per guideline-based pathways, while low-risk patients still warrant structured pretest probability assessment and D-dimer testing before imaging [^111eYRrN] [^111m2sux] [^1125X23z] [^113ShcWT].

> Therapeutically, I should treat both conditions on their own merits. That means full-dose anticoagulation for thrombotic PE or VTE unless contraindicated, consideration of systemic steroids or immunosuppression for vasculitis, supportive and source-control strategies for non-thrombotic emboli, and drug interruption or substitution for medication-related rashes or VTE. For massive or high-risk PE with hemodynamic compromise, guideline-supported thrombolysis is appropriate, whereas routine thrombolysis is not recommended for low- or intermediate-risk PE without deterioration [^116e6zPv] [^114prENX] [^115D4Jdg].

> Final check and bottom line: PE does not typically present with a rash, but a rash can accompany PE in meaningful, sometimes life-threatening syndromes. Therefore, the presence of a rash alongside suspected PE should broaden the differential, prompt targeted dermatologic and laboratory evaluation, and accelerate imaging and management rather than reassure against embolic disease, because the coexistence often signals a systemic process requiring specific therapy beyond anticoagulation alone [^114XnYyJ] [^111GbPU8] [^117L4jck] [^1153VDYQ].

Pulmonary embolism (PE) **does not typically cause a rash** [^112gUybD]; when a rash is present, it usually reflects an underlying condition or medication rather than PE itself. The most common skin finding is **purpura or petechiae** from thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, and livedo reticularis may suggest cholesterol embolization [^113D181r] [^116UAK3r]. Rashes are not listed among classic PE symptoms [^112gUybD], so any rash accompanying PE warrants evaluation for alternative causes such as drug reactions, vasculitis, infection, or embolic skin disease [^113D181r].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking PE and rash

While PE itself does not directly cause rash, several **indirect mechanisms** can produce skin findings:

- **Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy**: PE can be associated with thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to purpura or petechiae [^notfound].

- **Cholesterol embolization**: Embolization of cholesterol crystals from atherosclerotic plaques can cause livedo reticularis, digital ischemia, and ulceration [^116UAK3r].

- **Drug-induced rash**: Anticoagulants (e.g. heparin, warfarin) used in PE management can cause hypersensitivity reactions or skin necrosis [^114pRj5e].

---

## Clinical evidence of rash associated with PE

Although rare, documented cases describe skin manifestations in patients with PE:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rash description** | **Underlying mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Cholesterol embolization syndrome | - Livedo reticularis <br/> - Digital ischemia <br/> - Ulceration | Embolization of cholesterol crystals [^notfound] |
| Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) | - Purpura <br/> - Petechiae <br/> - Skin necrosis | Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis [^notfound] |
| Warfarin-induced skin necrosis | - Painful erythematous plaques <br/> - Skin necrosis | Protein C deficiency and hypercoagulability [^notfound] |
| Fat embolism syndrome | - Petechial rash <br/> - Confluent erythematous patches | Embolization of fat globules [^117L4jck] |

---

## Differential diagnosis of rash in patients with suspected PE

When evaluating a patient with suspected PE who presents with a rash, consider the following **differential diagnoses**:

- **Drug-induced rash**: Anticoagulants, antibiotics, or other medications may cause hypersensitivity reactions [^114z3tFH].

- **Vasculitis**: Systemic vasculitides (e.g. ANCA-associated vasculitis) can present with rash and thrombotic complications [^1148WPL8].

- **Infectious etiologies**: Sepsis, meningococcemia, or other infections can cause rash and mimic PE symptoms [^113D181r].

- **Embolic skin diseases**: Cholesterol embolization, fat embolism, or septic emboli can present with characteristic skin lesions [^117L4jck].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic diagnostic approach is essential. Begin with a **clinical history and examination** to characterize the rash and identify associated symptoms, risk factors, and medications [^113D181r]. Obtain laboratory tests — CBC, coagulation profile, renal and hepatic function, and autoimmune serologies — to assess for thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, vasculitis, or infection [^notfound]. Use imaging — CTPA for PE diagnosis and skin biopsy for suspected vasculitis, embolic disease, or drug reactions — to clarify etiology [^111m2sux] [^114TNix8].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The presence of a rash in a patient with suspected PE has important clinical implications:

- **Delayed diagnosis**: Atypical presentations with rash may delay recognition and treatment of PE [^notfound].

- **Alternative diagnoses**: Rash may indicate an alternative diagnosis (e.g. vasculitis, infection) that requires different management strategies [^113D181r].

- **Treatment considerations**: Management should address both PE and the underlying cause of the rash, including anticoagulation, supportive care, and discontinuation of offending medications [^114prENX].

---

## Conclusion

PE **does not typically cause a rash**; when a rash is present, it usually reflects an underlying condition or medication. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, perform a thorough evaluation, and manage both the embolic event and the rash appropriately.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (acquired thrombophilia)

The following list of risk factors for APS can be used to determine when a diagnosis should be considered and investigated (box 1).

Box 1
Risk factors for antiphospholipid syndrome

History of systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune disease.
Presence of livedo reticularis.
Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time prior to starting anticoagulation.
Recurrent thrombosis.
Venous thromboembolism at unusual sites.
History of arterial thrombosis without clear risk factors.
Thrombocytopaenia.
Recurrent miscarriages, stillbirth and/or severe pre-eclampsia.
Cardiac valve abnormalities in the absence of other explanations.

A diagnosis of APS is given if patients meet at least one clinical criteria and at least one laboratory criteria from the Sapporo classification of APS (box 2). Laboratory testing should only be conducted if the clinical criteria are met. It should be noted that, while all anticoagulants interfere with clotting assays, lupus anticoagulant testing is particularly prone to high rates of false positives in patients treated with VKAs and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)and also if tested at the time of the acute VTE.

Box 2
Clinical and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome

The 2023 American College of Rheumatology/EULAR (European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) classification criteria for APS were designed as highly specific criteria for use in observational studies and trials and, as such, have higher specificity (but lower sensitivity) than the Sapporo classification criteria.

Case Presentation

A 54-year-old Egyptian man with a 5-day history of worsening cough, high-grade fever, and progressive dyspnea was referred to our hospital. A 3-day course of ceftriaxone provided in an outpatient setting showed no clinical improvement. Medical history was unremarkable, except for bilateral pulmonary embolism diagnosed 3 years earlier. The patient actively smoked and denied the use of alcohol and illicit drugs. The patient worked as cook and had lived in Switzerland for the past 10 years. Five weeks before the actual presentation, he had traveled to Egypt. One of his children showed symptoms of a respiratory infection approximately 2 weeks before that. His only regular medication was rivaroxaban.

### Pulmonary embolism [^116C7PxD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure.

### Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome secondary to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^1153VDYQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) results from autoantibodies to cell surface phospholipids or phospholipid-binding proteins resulting in clotting anomalies and can have devastating sequelae, including stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and recurrent spontaneous abortions. However, cutaneous manifestations are the first sign of APS in up to 41% of patients. We present a case report of APS that developed several days after taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The clinical and pathological features of this unique presentation, differential diagnoses, and treatments are discussed.

### Trousseau syndrome presenting with penile gangrene [^111FAGjY]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This report discusses an unusual presentation of Trousseau syndrome resulting in penile gangrene in a patient with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. Historically, Trousseau syndrome referred to superficial migratory thrombophlebitis in the presence of malignancy. The term now describes a florid hypercoagulable state encompassing arterial or venous thrombosis, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Clinical manifestations range from uncomplicated superficial thrombophlebitis to superior vena cava obstruction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The most common cancers associated with Trousseau syndrome include pancreas, lung, prostate, and stomach cancers. Dermatologic findings may include erythematous, tender papules, or nodules along the course of a vein. Histologic examination of the lesion may find an inflammatory infiltrate involving all layers of the affected vein and a thrombus within the lumen. A variety of soluble factors, including mucins secreted by adenocarcinomas, cysteine protease (cancer procoagulant), and expression of tissue factor by cancer cells contribute to the pathogenesis of Trousseau syndrome.

### An unusual presentation of metastatic disease: cutaneous metastases from pulmonary adenocarcinoma manifesting as widespread plaques [^116rrDQm]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old man with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma presented with shortness of breath, weakness, and a 3-month history of a rash on his right chest. Prior positron emission/computed tomography scan demonstrated hilar, mediastinal, neck, and axillary adenopathy along with brain metastasis. He had received whole brain radiation and 6 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed. He recently had 2 episodes of pneumonia, and 10 days before this presentation, he had been found to have a pulmonary embolism and rivaroxaban was started.

On admission, a chest x-ray revealed a right-sided pleural effusion. A computed tomography scan showed a stable right upper lung mass, progressive metastatic disease, a growing malignant pleural effusion, and muscular and subcutaneous involvement. Involvement of the pectoralis major muscle and sternocleidomastoid muscle along with a 1.8- × 1.4-cm subcutaneous nodule in the right subareolar region was seen (Fig 1).

A right axillary node biopsy specimen demonstrated poorly differentiated carcinoma, which was negative for epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation, signifying the cells lacked this transmembrane protein that is typically present in over half of nonsmall-cell lung cancers, and negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangement, which is seen in roughly 4% of nonsmall-cell lung cancers, most frequently adenocarcinomas. Both epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangements, when present, are therapeutic targets. A therapeutic and diagnostic thoracentesis was conducted, and 2.1 L of pleural fluid were removed. The level of lactate dehydrogenase in the pleura fluid was 261, meeting Light criteria for classification as an exudative pleural effusion, which is seen in conditions such as infection, malignancy, or coronary artery bypass surgery. Given the patient's history, the exudative pleural effusion raised a high level of suspicion for a malignant cause, which was confirmed by cytologic studies that showed metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Dermatologic examination was notable for erythematous, indurated, papillomatous plaques extending from his right shoulder to his entire right trunk and flank (Fig 2). The rash was nonpainful, nonpruritic, and had initially been thought to be a drug rash.

A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was taken of the skin overlying the right side of his chest. There were atypical epithelial cells in infiltrative tubular formations associated with a fibromyxoid stroma (Fig 3). The diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma, compatible with the patient's known lung adenocarcinoma, was made.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111TDkng]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID‐19 is now known to have varied clinical manifestations and to target multiple organs, including the skin.COVID‐19 rashes may present in many forms and at different stages of the disease.

In our app‐based study, 8·8% of patients who were positive for COVID‐19 via swab tests also reported skin rashes (OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·42–1·97). Body rashes were more frequent than acral lesions (6·8% vs. 3·1%), although their predictive value was similar (OR 1·66, 95% CI 1·37–1·99 vs. 1·74, 95% CI 1·33–2·28, respectively). Interestingly, the OR for both types of rash was greater than for fever (OR 1·48), a widely used criterion to suggest testing. Reports of cases with both body rashes and acral lesions were rare (1·1%), suggesting different pathogenesis, with the former caused by immunological reactions to the virus, and the latter more likely explained by delayed small thrombotic occlusions or damage to vessel walls.

### Clinical treatment guidelines for tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^1134ZJQo]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Other AEs Associated with LEN

Severe cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported with LEN. In patients with follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma, LEN in combination with rituximab resulted in tumor lysis syndrome and tumor flare reactions (TFR) in 1.1% and 10.8% patients, respectively.

Other AEs related to LEN include thromboembolic events, allergic reactions/hypersensitivity, and rash. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (7.4%), pulmonary embolism (PE) (3.7%), and stroke (2.3%) have been reported in patients with multiple myeloma receiving LEN and dexamethasone; similarly, in L-MIND, grade ≥ 3 DVT (1%) and PE (4%) were observed in patients with R/R DLBCL.

Recommendation 1: In routine clinical practice, thromboprophylaxis is recommended; options include aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, or new oral anticoagulants such as apixaban and rivaroxaban (Table 5).

Table 5.
Dose modification during other adverse reactions.

Recommendation 2: LEN dose reduction due to AEs should follow a stepwise pattern; where a 5 mg dose is not tolerated, we recommend discontinuation of LEN and continuation with tafasitamab monotherapy.

Recommendation 3: LEN should be temporarily interrupted or discontinued for grades 2–3 skin rash and permanently discontinued for grade 4 rash and severe cutaneous reactions (Table 5). For TFR, LEN treatment may be continued with grade ≤ 2 TFR at the physician's discretion; however, for grade ≥ 3 AEs it is recommended to withhold LEN treatment until TFR resolves to grade ≤ 1.

### Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism [^111DrFDM]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this essay is to highlight the clinical features and imaging findings associated with different types of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism.

Conclusion

Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism is an infrequent condition with various causes that can be life-threatening pathologic conditions. The entity presents a diagnostic challenge because of the low specificity of clinical symptoms and imaging signs. Awareness of the imaging features of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism facilitates correct diagnosis and leads to appropriate patient care.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115xQJ3G]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy — key emergency department questions for suspected venous thromboembolism outlines five adult-focused topics: whether clinical prediction rules can identify very low–risk patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism for whom no additional diagnostic workup is required; whether a negative age-adjusted D-dimer in low to intermediate pretest probability identifies patients at very low risk for pulmonary embolism for whom no additional diagnostic workup is required; whether anticoagulation can be withheld for subsegmental pulmonary embolism; whether initiation of anticoagulation and discharge from the emergency department is safe for patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism; and, among patients with acute lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis discharged from the emergency department, whether treatment with a non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant is safe and effective compared with low-molecularweight heparin plus vitamin K antagonist.

### Frequency of thromboembolic events associated with thalidomide in the non-cancer setting: a case report and review of the literature [^1119EJhn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Thalidomide is increasingly being used due to its effectiveness in the treatment of a variety of dermatologic conditions refractory to other treatments. Although thalidomide's side effects have been well-documented in the literature since its entry in the 1950s, some of the risks associated with its use are still being discovered. Recently, increased incidence of venous thrombosis following thalidomide use has been reported in the treatment of diseases with disease-related thrombotic risks, such as malignancy and lupus with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, as well as concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and/or systemic corticosteroids. We report a case of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE) following thalidomide use in a patient with leprosy (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL) who was concurrently treated with prednisone, as well as a review of relevant literature. Our findings substantiate an increase in risk for thrombosis following thalidomide use in the dermatology and non-cancer clinical setting.

### Clinical manifestation of pulmonary embolism [^11363Sdr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Results of prospective studies have shown that physicians' estimate of clinical likelihoods of PE have predictive value. The ability of clinicians to assess the factors that determine the probability of disease based on clinical manifestations such as history and signs and symptoms at presentation, and to make bedside estimates of that probability, has not been systematically studied. Data suggest that that this would be a fruitful area of future investigation. Susec et al noted that there has been a total of three studies (including their own) which have examined the clinical features such as risk factors, signs, and symptoms associated with PE in ambulatory outpatients. Hence, the data collected thus far might not be generalizable to the ED patient population. As with other illnesses, the ED patients usually present later and more atypically. The prevalence of PE could be lower among this population compared with hospitalized patients, causing a lower positive predictive value, derivable from the clinical features and risk factors at presentation. Finally, the ED patient population is usually healthier and younger than the hospitalized patients, and it is well recognized that PE can be clinically silent in young patients and that 28% have no associated risk factors. Based on their finding, the authors argue that clinical pathways to risk stratify patients in an ambulatory setting could be less useful than anticipated. The validity of these findings needs further investigation, however.

### Chest pain mimicking pulmonary embolism may be a common presentation of COVID-19 in ambulant patients without other typical features of infection [^115tNPDY]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the strong link with immunothrombosis and the peripheral distribution of lung parenchymal changes associated with COVID‐19, we hypothesized that a proportion of mild COVID‐19 cases may present with chest pain secondary to localized pulmonary infarction and subsequent irritation of the adjacent lung pleura. Due to the focal nature of the infection, these patients would not necessarily present with classical COVID‐19 symptoms of breathlessness, dry cough, fever and loss of taste; instead, they may present to the emergency department with pleuritic‐type chest pain. Our aims were therefore to investigate outpatients presenting with suspected PE symptoms, but where PE was not confirmed by CTPA during a three month period in 2020 at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in the UK and also over the corresponding timeframe in 2019. The clinical and radiological features of these cases and later SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody serology in those who were tested are reviewed.

### Syncope: a rare presentation of massive pulmonary embolism in a previously healthy girl [^111896pK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a very infrequent event in previously healthy children, particularly in the outpatient scenario. This report involves a 7-year-old girl who presented to the emergency room after syncope. A prompt diagnostic workup showed a massive pulmonary embolism. A timely treatment initiation permitted a good and rapid response. She represented a diagnostic and treatment challenge, mainly because of the atypical presentation and the absence of known risk factors. Finally, a thorough study uncovered a nephrotic-range urine protein loss. At the beginning, the patient did not meet the whole nephrotic syndrome diagnostic requirements. The complete thombophilic study was normal. The clinical presentation, epidemiology, diagnostic tools and the treatment of pulmonary embolism are reviewed. We also discuss a recently described risk factor, present in our patient, as a potential role in the development of pulmonary embolism.

Physical examination findings in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific clues: Acute coronary syndrome may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and an MR murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism can include pain with inspiration. Aortic dissection features severe pain with abrupt onset with pulse differential and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Pericarditis can show fever, pleuritic chest pain increased in the supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may include fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumothorax may present with dyspnea and pain on inspiration with unilateral absence of breath sounds. Costochondritis presents with tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster presents with pain in a dermatomal distribution, triggered by touch, with a characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

Fig. 2
A skin biopsy revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis in small-sized vessels in the upper dermis. Perivascular infiltrates with neutrophils, nuclear dust, and red blood cells were identified, consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis

Five days after discharge, she was admitted to our hospital again due to 2-day-history of swollen right lower limb. There were no fever, hemoptysis, cough, pleuritic chest pain, cyanosis or dyspnea, however skin rash was noted on her right leg. Her blood pressure was 112/85 mmHg with a heart rate of 79/min with a regular rhythm and her respiratory rate was 18 per minute with a body temperature of 37.1 °C on admission. On physical examination, swelling with different calf diameters, warmth, erythema, and positive Homan's sign of right lower extremity, as well as multiple purpura over her right leg with local tenderness were noted. Chest, abdominal, and neurological examinations revealed no abnormal findings. The initial chest radiograph was normal without patch infiltrates, effusion, hemidiaphragm, Hampton hump or Westermark sign. The laboratory findings showed hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 390,000/uL, white blood cell count of 12,800/mm3, international normalized ratio of 0.9, and D-dimer level of 2048 FEU ng/mL, blood urea nitrogen 30.6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.76 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 2.41 mg/L, albumin 3.33 g/dL and mild to moderate proteinuria. A Doppler ultrasound scan of her lower limbs showed a thrombus at the right common femoral vein. There were no other classic risk factors for DVT, and investigations of hypercoagulable status including anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β-glycoprotein antibody, lupus anti-coagulant, anti-thrombin III, protein C, and protein S were all within normal ranges. Under the diagnosis of DVT, subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin; 30 mg twice daily), in addition to intravenous methylprednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil were delivered. Due to lack of associated clinical symptoms, PE was not considered. Her palpable purpura and leg swelling improved 2 days after admission.

### Clinical features in VEXAS syndrome: a systematic review [^112QFJ5c]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous manifestations

Our analysis confirms cutaneous involvement as the predominant feature of VEXAS syndrome of patients, in-keeping with previously reported prevalences (Fig. 3)].

Figure 3.
Diagram summarizing the major clinical manifestations (prevalence > 25%) of VEXAS syndrome. *Data for this feature was not used for the prevalence calculations of the assigned category. VTE: venous thromboembolism; DVT: deep vein thrombosis; PE: pulmonary embolism; MDS: myelodysplastic syndrome; AML: acute myeloid leukaemia

Cutaneous manifestations represent a common and often initial feature of VEXAS syndrome. Skin disease frequently appears early, presenting as the first manifestation in 45–61% of patients in separate case series. The pattern of cutaneous involvement demonstrates genotype-specific associations, with Tan et al. demonstrating an association between p. Met41Leu variants and neutrophilic dermatosis (82% [14/17] of cases), while p. Met41Val variants more commonly manifested with vasculitic lesions (55% [11/20] of cases) with a mixed leukocytic infiltrate (85% [17/20]). Treatment responses vary, with corticosteroids showing high initial efficacy (92% response rate) but limited long-term utility due to toxicity concerns.

Recent histopathological analyses suggest two distinct patterns of skin involvement: 'clonal' lesions containing UBA1 -mutated cells (neutrophilic dermatoses) and 'paraclonal' manifestations driven by inflammatory mediators (leukocytoclastic vasculitis), suggesting distinct pathophysiological drivers in manifesting cutaneous disease. The high expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 on dysfunctional monocytes, coupled with their localization near dermal blood vessels, provides mechanistic insight into the tissue-specific inflammatory response. Rarer cutaneous manifestations include pyoderma gangrenosum, granulomatous dermatitis and neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.

Given the high prevalence and early presentation of skin manifestations in VEXAS, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis in older male patients presenting with neutrophilic dermatoses or vasculitic lesions, particularly when accompanied by systemic inflammation or cytopenias. Early genetic testing is warranted, as the specific UBA1 variant may help predict the pattern of cutaneous involvement, guiding therapeutic decision-making.

### Pulmonary embolism can Be nauseous: a case report and review of D-dimer use in pediatric oncology patients [^1178gSyy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a very common presentation in the emergency department (ED). Despite being life-threatening, PE is preventable if diagnosed and managed early, especially in high-risk patients like pediatric oncology patients. A negative d-dimer has a high negative predictive value and can rule out PE in low-risk patients; however, it does not lower post-test probability enough and should be coupled with further diagnostics in high-risk patients.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 14-year-old girl known to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia and presented to the ED with persistent nausea and vomiting only, which was exacerbated by exertion. She had previously presented to the ED 1 week earlier for the same complaint, with a nonrevealing physical examination. At that time, the patient was worked up for nausea and vomiting and received symptomatic treatment. An electrocardiogram (ECG) during that presentation showed normal sinus rhythm. During this presentation, ECG showed new ST segment depressions from V1 to V6 in addition to an S1Q3T3 pattern. This, coupled with the exacerbation of her initial symptoms, triggered further investigations. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed and showed a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery embolus. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case highlights the importance of having a high level of suspicion for PE, especially in pediatric oncology patients and specifically in hematologic malignancies. Although our patient's presentation, examination, and laboratory results were not concerning initially, CTA of the chest showed a PE. We are addressing this particular topic to increase the awareness of emergency physicians of cases like this, as PE can have an unusual presentation and missing such a diagnosis can be fatal.

Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy — burden and diagnostic yield context are described as follows: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of pregnancy-related mortality in the developed world, accounting for 20% of maternal deaths in the United States. Accurate clinical diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy is notoriously difficult due to the overlap of signs and symptoms between physiologic changes of pregnancy and development of PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT). VTE is ultimately confirmed in less than 10% of pregnant women who present with concerning clinical features.

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^113D181r]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Pulmonary embolism [^114XnYyJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism:

- **Definition**: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- **Pathophysiology**: Most pulmonary emboli (70–80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- **Epidemiology**: PE occurs in approximately 60–120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000–100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.

### Vasculitic rash and cerebral emboli in an adolescent with left atrial myxoma [^115gwBhj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A previously healthy woman in late adolescence presented to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms following a two-month history of bilateral foot pain and oedema, accompanied by a macular rash and progressive lower extremity weakness. On further investigation, she was found to have multiple cerebral emboli and a left atrial myxoma fixed to the interatrial septum. The patient subsequently underwent urgent surgical excision of the myxoma. On follow-up, her cutaneous and neurological symptoms were significantly improved. This case suggests that, in the presence of a vasculitic rash without evident or obvious cause, cardiac myxoma should be included in the differential diagnosis.

### Microbiological and clinical profile of infective endocarditis patients: an observational study experience from tertiary care center karachi Pakistan [^1171Xq2g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Of the 18 S. aureus isolated, 77.7% were MRSA and were more frequent in the NVG. MRSA infections showed increase disease severity at time of presentation such as TE events, AKI, raised infectious markers, murmur splenomegaly, rash, sepsis and splinter hemorrhages. It was the commonest pathogen found amongst expired patients in both cohorts. A study in Turkey reported 18% of IE deaths due to endocarditis, a number higher than any other pathogen isolated. This could be due to the high prevalence of MRSA in the region. Asia has higher prevalence of both healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA).

Human brucellosis is common in Pakistan in patients with risk factors such as animal exposure, use of unpasteurized milk etc. Blood cultures positive for patients suffering from Brucella infections are often reported from this lab, however none of the cultures in this study yielded Brucella sp. as a cause of endocarditis. This could be because of selection bias of our patients as most of the samples recruited in the study were from patients under cardiac care. In addition, we had limitation of non-availability of methods such as PCR and serological analysis.

Embolism is not uncommon and risk is seen in 22–57% cases of IE: the risk progressively increased with the size of vegetation. Amongst our patients 12 presented with evidence of embolism or infarct. Of these 6 were cerebral, 5 pulmonary and 1 with peripheral involvement. A prospective multicenter European study presented 34.1% cases with true embolic events. Most were involving the CNS similar to our findings. Statistically significant difference was seen between the 2 cohorts with more embolic events in the NVG. A retrospective study in France presented embolism in 62% of PVE vs. 35% of NVE patients. Although this contradicts our findings, this could be due to delay in diagnosis as patients with prior invasive intervention or cardiac anomalies tend to access tertiary care earlier. Embolism is directly related to the size of vegetations, therefore late presentations are likely to have larger vegetations.

### Successful thrombolytic therapy for recurrent right ventricular thrombosis in Behçet's disease [^111ZUPxS]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disorder characterised by recurrent oral and genital aphtosis and ocular involvement. Thrombophlebitis and major vessel thrombosis are common manifestations of vascular involvement in BD patients, whereas intracardiac thrombosis is extremely rare. We describe a 22-year-old woman who presented with deep vein thrombosis and recurrent right ventricular thrombosis complicated by pulmonary embolism. At the time, she complained of fever, recurrent painful oral and genital aphtae and papulo-pustular skin rash so she was diagnosed with BD. She received intravenous streptokinase 50,000 units/hour for three days plus corticosteroids with complete recovery. A review of intracardiac thrombosis in BD is presented and the use of thrombolytic therapy in this rare condition is briefly discussed.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal condition. The case is presented of a young woman who presented to the emergency department with first-time seizures. On further investigation and corroborated by post-mortem findings, this was found to be a manifestation of PE. The purpose of this report is to highlight to the clinical community that PE can present in a varied fashion and that, because of this, its diagnosis can occasionally be delayed. Vigilance is advised and expert clinical acumen is needed in young non-smoking persons with previously normal respiratory physiology who present with signs and symptoms of respiratory compromise, irrespective of the predominant or masking presentation.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific findings: For acute coronary syndrome (ACS), findings include diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and MR murmur; examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. For pulmonary embolism (PE), tachycardia and dyspnea with pain with inspiration may be present. Pericarditis presents with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may show fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumonia may include fever, localized or pleuritic chest pain, friction rub, regional dullness to percussion, and egophony. Costochondritis/Tietze syndrome shows tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster produces pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch with a characteristic unilateral, dermatomal rash. Esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gall bladder disease are suggested by epigastric tenderness, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a Murphy sign.

C. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced vasculitis
D. ICI-induced thrombotic vasculopathy
E. Cryoglobulinemic vasculopathy

Answer:
A. Incorrect – Warfarin-induced necrosis typically occurs within 3 to 5 days of warfarin initiation with associated marked edema.
B. Incorrect – Noninflammatory dermal vascular thrombosis is common in APLS. Patients usually present before the age of 60 years, after multiple thrombotic events or miscarriages. Lupus anticoagulant may be falsely elevated in patients on direct anticoagulants, warfarin, and unfractionated heparin. Concomitant pneumonitis also makes APLS less likely.
C. Incorrect – The patient's biopsy does not show typical changes of vasculitis.
D. Correct – With recent ICI initiation, concomitant pneumonitis, diffuse vasculopathy, and negative infectious workup, the most likely diagnosis is ICI-induced thrombotic occlusive vasculopathy. Although the mechanisms for thrombotic vasculopathy associated with ICI are not fully elucidated, a pro-inflammatory state and elevated inflammatory cytokines likely play a role. To our knowledge, this is a novel case of durvalumab-induced retiform purpura. Other causes of thrombotic occlusive vasculopathy, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, are unlikely with normal fibrinogen and no hemolysis. ICI toxicities, or immune-related adverse events (irAEs), usually affect the integumentary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and pulmonary systems. Cardiovascular toxicities, including acute vascular events (AVEs) such as vasculopathy, are rare, but may occur months after ICI initiation. In a retrospective review of 1215 patients on ICIs, the overall AVE event rate was 2.6%. Among lung adenocarcinoma patients, this rate doubled. History of prior AVE, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were also risk factors. Median survival was worse in those who developed an AVE versus those who did not (3 months vs 14 months; P < .0001).
E. Incorrect – The patient had negative cryoglobulinemic studies.

### Septic vasculitis [^117MwQ4a]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 56-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism and stage IV breast cancer presented to the emergency department at Rhode Island Hospital with ecchymoses on her upper and lower extremities. Relevant home medications included warfarin and oral dexamethasone for brain metastases. Although she was not receiving chemotherapy, a port-o-cath was in place. Laboratory evaluation found pancytopenia (hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, white blood cell count of 0.9 × 10 9 /L, and platelets of 34 × 10 9 /L) and an elevated international normalized ratio of 2.3. After urine and blood cultures were drawn, she was started on empirical piperacillin/tazobactam. Warfarin was discontinued, and her coagulopathy was corrected with fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, platelets, and vitamin K.

Despite these interventions, her ecchymoses progressed to bullae on her second hospital day, and dermatology input was requested. Skin examination revealed 10- to 30-cm purpuric plaques with a livedo pattern and hemorrhagic bullae with central necrosis on her arms and legs (Fig 1). The bullae were mildly painful to touch. Extensive purpura were asymmetrically distributed on her arms, and few petechiae were scattered along her chest and back. At the time of examination, she was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Two punch biopsies of the right thigh were performed and specimens were sent for culture and routine hematoxylin-eosin staining.

### Fat embolism: a systematic review to facilitate the development of standardised procedures in pathology [^117L4jck]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fat embolism (FE) is a form of parenchymal embolism caused by the entry of fat globules into the bloodstream, potentially leading to vascular occlusions. The fat emboli that enter the venous circulation primarily reach the pulmonary circulation by passing through the right sections of the heart, presenting a condition known as pulmonary fat embolism (PFE) when confined to the lungs.

When fat globules transit from the pulmonary circulation into the systemic circulation and become lodged in systemic organs, particularly the brain, kidneys, skin, eyes or myocardium, they cause a complex clinical condition characterised by multisystem involvement. Fat emboli alone can be harmless or may induce a life‐threatening syndrome, known as fat embolism syndrome (FES), which is a clinical diagnosis based on specific symptoms and signs. As a systemic condition, the clinical presentation encompasses multiple organ systems. Therefore, the clinical presentation may include: (i) respiratory symptoms such as hypoxaemia, tachypnoea and dyspnoea, potentially progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); (ii) neurological symptoms including confusion, seizures or focal neurological deficits; and (iii) dermatological symptoms such as petechial rash, which is often non‐blanching and located on the upper body.

Concerning the aetiopathogenesis of FE, two not mutually exclusive theories have been historically described: the mechanical explanation by Gauss in 1924and the biochemical explanation by Lehman and Moore in 1927. The mechanical theory posits that fat embolisation is caused by the fracture of a long bone, which results in the laceration of intra‐osseous blood vessels and the venous aspiration of disrupted fat globules from the bone marrow (BM). By the same principle, during arthroplasty and intramedullary instrumentation, the increase in intramedullary pressure forces fat into the veins.

Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the systemic passage of fat emboli, including the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO), found in 20–25% of adults, or arteriovenous shunts in the subpleural regions of the lungs, which open during increased pulmonary pressure due to FE.

A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute onset of dyspnoea and a week history of painful erythematous rash on both of his legs. CT angiogram of the chest showed saddle pulmonary embolism resulting in right ventricular strain and obstructive shock. Due to the atypical nature of his skin rash, a skin biopsy from one of these lesions was done and came consistent with the diagnosis of IgA vasculitis.

### Masquerading pulmonary embolism: fever as an overlooked clinical manifestation illustrated by four mini case series and literature review [^114SZTAM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is often underrecognized when presenting with atypical symptoms, such as fever, which can occur either alongside classic symptoms or as the sole manifestation. This presentation may lead to misdiagnosis and delays in appropriate management. We present 4 cases of patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever as the primary symptom and no identifiable causes despite inconclusive initial laboratory evaluations. Further evaluation through computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of PE. Following diagnosis, anticoagulation therapy was initiated, leading to the rapid resolution of fever. It is imperative to consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients presenting with high-grade fever and unclear etiologies, as recognizing this linkage may facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment.

### A unique case of glucagonoma with atypical necrolytic migratory erythema [^117KHsnG]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NME, the characteristic rash of glucagonoma, appears in up to 90% of cases and presents as painful, erythematous plaques with vesicles, bullae, or crusting. It must be distinguished from conditions such as acrodermatitis enteropathica, essential fatty acid deficiency, and pellagra. Although its exact mechanism is unclear, nutritional deficiencies, particularly fatty acids, are implicated.

Glucagonoma diagnosis requires tumor detection, elevated glucagon levels, and characteristic systemic findings such as rash, diabetes, or hypoaminoacidemia. Due to its rarity, diagnosis is often delayed, as in this case, where the rash was misattributed to atopic dermatitis, cellulitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and UC-related dermatitis. The mass was not discovered on CT scan performed 4 months prior to her MRI either due to lower sensitivity compared to MRI or lack of significant mass size at the time.

Glucagonoma also induces a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism, as seen in this patient's deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Given that skin biopsy findings may be subtle or nonspecific, clinical-pathologic correlation is crucial. Recurring NME-like rashes despite treatment should prompt further investigation, including glucagon-level measurement. Early recognition and surgical resection improve outcomes, emphasizing the importance of considering glucagonoma in persistent, treatment-resistant dermatologic presentations.

### Acute pulmonary embolism in childhood [^111TFtnk]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is an uncommon, but potentially fatal disease in children. Most children with pulmonary embolism have underlying clinical conditions, of which the presence of a central venous catheter is the most frequent. The clinical presentation is often subtle, or masked by the underlying clinical condition. Diagnostic as well as therapeutic strategies for pulmonary embolism in children are mostly extrapolated from studies in adults. Pulmonary angiography is still the gold standard in diagnosing pulmonary embolism, but several other radiographic tests can be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism, including ventilation-perfusion lung scanning, helical computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography. The choice of treatment depends on the clinical presentation of the patient. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for children with pulmonary embolism. However, thrombolytic therapy can be considered for patients with hemodynamic instability. The outcome of pediatric pulmonary embolism is uncertain and needs to be studied.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism: the task force for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^113sTwtw]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

### Marantic endocarditis and paraneoplastic pulmonary embolism [^113EcEaA]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Cancer is frequently associated with a hypercoagulable state. Almost 15% of patients with cancer will suffer a thromboembolic event during their clinical course. The aetiology of this hypercoagulable state is multifactorial and includes procoagulant factors associated with malignancy as well as the host's inflammatory response. Cancer-associated thrombophilia can present as venous thromboembolism, migratory superficial thrombophlebitis, arterial thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic microangiopathy and rarely non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). In this paper, we will describe an uncommon presentation of lung cancer on a non-smoker middle-aged woman, with recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, who develops malignant recurrent pleural effusion, NBTE with cutaneous and neurological manifestations, with a rapid evolution into shock, culminating in death. Diagnosis of NBTE requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. The mainstay of treatment is systemic anticoagulation to prevent further embolisation and underlying cancer control whenever is possible.

### Diagnostic assessment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^112QVj5p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disorder that can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality through the clinical manifestations of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Although rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical in preventing PE, mortality and major morbidity due to conditions such as postthrombotic syndrome may complicate the differential diagnosis of VTE. The clinical symptoms associated with DVT are neither sensitive nor specific and can be indicative of a wide range of diagnoses. Because imaging studies can be expensive and are sometimes inconclusive, they should be used judiciously in patients with highly suspected VTE. This review offers a clinical perspective on the accurate, routine diagnosis of VTE, including an overview of common clinical signs and symptoms, as well as the advantages and drawbacks of available diagnostic strategies.

### Intravascular lymphoma presenting with hypoxaemia, platypnoea and lactic acidosis [^117V6KXq]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

This patient was a 70-year-old Caucasian woman without any relevant past medical history. She was on vacation abroad in Europe and had been travelling in Africa 2 months before admission. She presented herself at the emergency department with general malaise, epigastric and upper right abdominal pain, palpitations, dyspnoea, and a slight fever for the past few days. She had been prescribed levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia without any improvement. She had experienced a self-resolved episode of diarrhoea a few weeks before. Vital signs at admission were as follows: blood pressure 115/80 mm Hg, pulse oximetry 95%, cardiac pulse 95 per minute, temperature 36.3°C. Physical examination revealed slight dehydration, tachypnoea without respiratory distress, platypnoea and a painful abdomen with normal sounds, mostly epigastric and right hypochondrium without any tenderness. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation were normal. No neurological abnormalities, adenopathy or rash were detected. Initial blood analysis showed slight inflammation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level and altered hepatic function (details in the 'Investigations' section). Blood gases indicated lactic acidosis and hypoxaemia: pH 7.42, PaCO 2 28 mm Hg, PaO 2 68 mm Hg, lactate 4.5 mmol/L. Computed tomography (CT) of pulmonary arteries was negative for pulmonary embolism and the pulmonary parenchyma was normal. Research to identify potential infectious causes was conducted. After initial investigations, the patient was admitted to the department of internal medicine without any diagnosis.

### Emergency department diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^113NNkM3]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is challenging to even the most seasoned physician. Although dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia and haemoptysis are hallmark features, PE also presents with non‐specific symptoms like fever, syncope or cough. While hormone use, recent surgery or trauma, malignancy and prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) are well‐known predisposing factors, recent infection, autoimmune or inflammatory bowel disease and recent admission for heart failure or myocardial infarction are also risks. Pregnancy increases risk, particularly in the third trimester until 6 weeks post‐partum, though evidence for increased risk in the first two trimesters is less convincing. Advanced age, obesity and smoking amplify these risks.PE should be considered in any patient with common presenting symptoms and pervasive risk factors.

### Pulmonary tumor embolism: a review of the literature [^112pymJc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Dyspnea in a patient with cancer may have several causes, including infection, thromboembolism, metastases, and therapeutically induced cardiopulmonary disease. Pulmonary tumor embolism is an uncommon cause. Occlusion of the pulmonary microvasculature by tumor cells and associated thrombi can produce a subacute and progressive clinical picture that resembles thromboembolic disease. Unfortunately, microscopic tumor embolism is recognized rarely before death because of difficulty in establishing the diagnosis. We provide a review of the literature about the evaluation and diagnosis of this rare clinical entity.

### How I treat pediatric pulmonary embolism [^115i2sYc]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects approximately 1 in 200 hospitalized children. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), the most severe clinical presentation of VTE, has increased dramatically by ~200% over the past two decades, disproportionately affecting adolescents, and is associated with adverse long-term post-PE sequelae. Nevertheless, the management of pediatric PE remains highly variable. This review focuses on significant advances in pediatric PE with a focus on published studies within the past decade. Using a representative case, we: (1) summarize existing risk prediction tools for acute pediatric PE and a shift in clinical practice in the management of acute PE with the implementation of pediatric PE Response Teams and multidisciplinary decision-making for severe pediatric PE; (2) describe recently completed clinical trials of anticoagulation in children and adolescents and ongoing work to elucidate the appropriate duration of therapy for children and adolescents with PE; (3) review advances in understanding post-PE syndrome and the need for continued refinement of evaluation tools and management approaches. Many unanswered questions remain despite the significant advances in pediatric thrombosis over the past decade.

Cardiovascular diseases in adult atopic dermatitis (AD) — associations and gradients: Meta-analysis showed hypertension in adults with AD versus controls with an OR of 1.06 (95% CI, 1.00–1.13), and pooled cohort studies for congestive heart failure (CHF) yielded an HR of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.03–1.53). A UK cohort demonstrated severity gradients: myocardial infarction (mild AD: HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91–1.10; moderate AD: HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97–1.18; severe AD: HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12–1.68), stroke (mild AD: HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97–1.15; moderate AD: HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00–1.20; severe AD: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.99–1.46), CHF (mild AD: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.24; moderate AD: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09–1.33; severe AD: HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.36–2.05), and cardiovascular death (mild AD: HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89–0.98; moderate AD: HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93–1.10; severe AD: HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10–1.53). Treatment is frequently used as a proxy to define AD severity in epidemiologic studies. Clinically, the implications are unclear, and at this point there is no evidence that increased cardiovascular screening or treatment is needed for people with AD beyond what is recommended for the general population. AD is associated with modestly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.17–1.27) and pulmonary embolism (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.15), although trials in AD to date did not demonstrate an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.

In many cases, patients received concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Monitor patients treated with Activase during and for several hours after infusion for hypersensitivity. If signs of hypersensitivity occur, e.g. anaphylactoid reaction or angioedema develops, discontinue the Activase infusion and promptly institute appropriate therapy (e.g., antihistamines, intravenous corticosteroids, epinephrine).

5.3 Thromboembolism

The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with high likelihood of left heart thrombus, such as patients with mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation. Activase has not been shown to treat adequately underlying deep vein thrombosis in patients with PE. Consider the possible risk of re-embolization due to the lysis of underlying deep venous thrombi in this setting.

5.4 Cholesterol Embolization

Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with thrombolytic agents; the true incidence is unknown. Cholesterol embolism may present with livedo reticularis, "purple toe" syndrome, acute renal failure, gangrenous digits, hypertension, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, retinal artery occlusion, bowel infarction, or rhabdomyolysis and can be fatal. It is associated with invasive vascular procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, angiography, vascular surgery) and/or anticoagulant therapy.

5.5 Coagulation Tests May Be Unreliable during Activase Therapy

Coagulation tests and measures of fibrinolytic activity may be unreliable during Activase therapy, unless specific precautions are taken to prevent in vitro artifacts. When present in blood at pharmacologic concentrations, Activase remains active under in vitro conditions, which can result in degradation of fibrinogen in blood samples removed for analysis.

### Fibrinolytic therapy in pulmonary embolism: an evidence-based treatment algorithm [^116kAfbp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with pulmonary embolism (PE) have a wide spectrum of clinical severity. Although some patients may present with frank hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest, others may present with an asymptomatic PE that is discovered incidentally during workup of another condition. Fibrinolytic therapy is an option in the treatment of patients with PE due to its ability to rapidly dissolve thromboemboli clots. However, the use of fibrinolytics in the treatment of PE is a controversial topic that has left many practicing physicians confused on how to best treat these patients. A rational approach to deciding whether fibrinolytic therapy is indicated is based on an assessment of the benefit that each particular patient will derive from fibrinolytic therapy weighed against that patients risk for major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. There is a clear benefit/risk ratio for fibrinolytic therapy in patients with PE who present with cardiac arrest and in those who are hemodynamically unstable from a massive PE. With proper risk assessment, select patients with stable hemodynamics and right ventricular dysfunction may also benefit from fibrinolytic therapy. There is no benefit to fibrinolytic treatment in patients with stable hemodynamics and normal right ventricular function. This article sets out to review the literature on fibrinolytic therapy in the treatment of patients with PE and will propose an evidence based treatment algorithm.

### Baricitinib (Olumiant) [^1151BSbw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Thrombosis

Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with OLUMIANT compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers.

If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, patients should discontinue OLUMIANT and be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. Avoid OLUMIANT in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis.

5.6 Hypersensitivity

Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving OLUMIANT, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue OLUMIANT while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Gastrointestinal Perforations

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT.

Monitor OLUMIANT-treated patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Evaluate promptly patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.

Neutropenia – Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3) compared to placebo.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3.

In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with COVID-19 and an ANC less than 500 cells/mm3.

Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on ANC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Dirofilariasis presenting as pleural effusion: a rare case report with unusual manifestations and treatment modalities [^112bgFnT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We present an extremely rare manifestation of dirofilariasis in the pleural cavity. This is the first human pulmonary dirofilariasis reported in Lithuania; according to our knowledge, only two other patients were documented with this pathology in the world.

Case Presentation

A 72-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital complaining of dyspnea, left-side chest pain, and a dry cough. She was a retiree living alone in the countryside without domestic pets (sometimes stray dogs appear) or a travel history. A complete blood count was within normal limits, with a CRP level of 16.8 mg/l and D-dimer concentration of 900 µg/l, which raised suspicion of pulmonary embolism. In chest computed tomography angiography, pulmonary embolism was excluded, and only left pleural effusion without abnormal lesions was confirmed. Left thoracocentesis was performed, and the pleural fluid was evaluated as an exudate with a predominance of eosinophils (59%), along with the presence of parasites. These parasites exhibited the morphology of Dirofilaria repens. Oral doxycycline (100 mg, twice daily) and albendazole (400 mg, twice daily) were prescribed for a 14-day course. A month later, there were no pathological findings on the chest X-ray, and the patient no longer had respiratory symptoms. However, the patient presented with an emerged, painful palpable right breastmass, where the rash was previously observed. Ultrasound imaging revealed a 1.5×2 cm nodule, which was surgically removed. Parasites consistent with Dirofilaria repens were suspected but not definitively identified. Pharmacological treatment for dirofilariasis was not further prescribed.

Conclusions

This case encourages doctors to be more vigilant because the patient, who neither travelled nor kept any pets, contracted dirofilariasis. Diagnostic and treatment guidelines are lacking, necessitating further research. Treatment with doxycycline and albendazole yielded positive outcomes, suggesting potential efficacy for dirofilarial pleuritis.

### Cholesterol embolism: still an unrecognized entity with a high mortality rate [^114TNix8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cholesterol embolism (CE) is an increasingly common but often underdiagnosed medical problem. The recognition of clinical manifestations of CE is the first step toward a correct diagnosis.

Objective

Our aim was to characterize the features of CE and the risk factors for fatal outcome.

Methods

Clinical records of patients with clinical and histopathologic diagnoses of CE seen from January 1993 through March 2003 were reviewed.

Results

Twenty-six male patients were identified. Mean age was 64 years (range, 48–88 years). All patients had two or more risk factors for atherosclerosis. All but one patient had preexisting symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. At least one precipitating factor was identified in 23 patients (88%). Diagnosis of CE at admission was made in 9 patients only (35%). Cutaneous lesions (88%) and renal failure (73%) were the most common clinical findings. Complications (dialysis, acute pulmonary edema, amputation, or gastrointestinal surgery) were present in 21 patients (81%), and 15 patients died (58%). Previous chronic renal failure was the only variable associated with mortality (relative risk: 4.54, 95% confidence interval 1.26–16.6; p = 0.02).

Limitations

The results were obtained from patients admitted to a university hospital. This fact may have selected a higher proportion of severe cases.

Conclusions

CE was frequently misdiagnosed. Skin lesions were the most common clinical findings and skin biopsy provided histologic confirmation in most of the patients. Chronic renal failure was the only factor related to death.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, or a mitral regurgitation murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism is associated with tachycardia and dyspnea in > 90% of patients and pain with inspiration. In suspected aortic dissection, the frequency of syncope > 10% and aortic regurgitation (AR) 40%–75% (type A) are noted among findings. Esophageal rupture can present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax (20% patients) with unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Other causes include pericarditis with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and friction rub; myocarditis with fever, chest pain, heart failure, S3; pneumothorax with dyspnea and pain on inspiration and unilateral absence of breath sounds; costochondritis with tenderness of costochondral joints; and herpes zoster with pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch and a characteristic rash.

### Real-world use of ruxolitinib cream: safety analysis at 1 year [^116tNQpZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Serious AEs

In the time period analyzed, four serious AEs were reported: 'skin cancer' (as reported, n = 2), pericarditis (n = 1), and thrombocytopenia (n = 1). None of the serious AEs contained sufficient information for assessment of possible relatedness to ruxolitinib cream (i.e. key information was missing, such as date of therapy, timing of onset of the AE, medical history of the patient, or concomitant medications received by the patient). Only the report of pericarditis was medically confirmed and was reported as a serious AE, as it resulted in hospitalization. The skin cancer and thrombocytopenia events were initially reported as nonserious AEs but were upgraded to serious IMEs per EMA criteria by Incyte, for regulatory reporting purposes.

AEs of Special Interest

With the exception of two ICSRs of skin cancer, no AESIs were reported with ruxolitinib cream. As noted previously, these skin cancer reports were initially reported as nonserious but were upgraded to serious by Incyte based on EMA criteria (Table 3). The skin cancer events were not medically confirmed, medical history and/or concurrent conditions were not reported, diagnostic evaluation including skin biopsy results and final diagnosis were not provided, and despite repeated attempts at follow-up, reports did not contain sufficient information for medical assessment of relatedness to ruxolitinib cream.

In the FAERS database, seven ICSRs were found, of which three were serious and four were nonserious. The three serious ICSRs described the same events of pericarditis, thrombocytopenia, and skin cancer that were captured in the Incyte database. The four nonserious ICSRs described events of (1) diarrhea, asthenia, and vomiting; (2) drug hypersensitivity; (3) skin exfoliation (in the context of dry skin) and eczema; and (4) visual impairment, rash, rash erythematous, pruritus, product use in unapproved indication, ovarian disorder, skin burning sensation, and injection site urticaria (in a case describing concurrent use of both dupilumab and ruxolitinib cream).

Presentation of Cases

Key clinical features of the patients are summarized in Fig. 1 A. Seven of the eight patients (88%) were female. The age at time of presentation ranged from 7–17 years (avg. 13.6) and most of the patients (75%) were post-pubertal at the time of presentation. Patients were of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and most had a family history of autoimmunity in either a first- or second-degree relative (Fig. 1 A). Notable features at the time of NC-aPL testing included dermatologic, vascular, hematologic, and neurologic findings. Rashes were present in half of the patients, including livedoid rash in two patients and non-blanching purpura of the extremities in two others. Most patients had Raynaud's phenomenon — a common APS-associated manifestation caused by vasospasm of digital arteries. Neurologic findings included chronic headaches (n = 3), absence seizures (n = 1), and chorea and cerebellar stroke (n = 1; Fig. 1 A). Only one patient had a documented thrombotic event (the cerebellar stroke). This patient also had mitral valve thickening and regurgitation, but the stroke was not suspected to be embolic based on MRI appearance. Evaluation for inherited thrombophilia in the patient who had a stroke was negative. One patient with concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) developed alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary hypertension believed to be secondary to pulmonary capillaritis; however, it was unclear if these were manifestations of SLE, NC-aPL, or both.

Overall prevalence of clinical features in systematic review

Cutaneous involvement was the most prevalent manifestation, affecting 81.8% (95% CI: 78.8–84.5%) of patients. Neutrophilic dermatoses were most frequent (27.0% [23.2–31.3%]), followed by papules/plaques (20.8% [16.3–26.1%]) and vasculitic lesions (18.1%).

Constitutional symptoms were the second most common presentation (69.4% [66.0–72.7%]), dominated by fevers (62.1% [58.5–65.6%]), fatigue (52.7% [46.2–59.1%]) and weight loss (44.2% [39.0–49.5%]).

Respiratory involvement affected 61.3% (57.6–64.7%) of patients, most commonly manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates (46.2% [41.7–50.8%]) and dyspnoea (41.3% [35.6–47.3%]), while ground glass changes (17.6%) and pleural effusions (12.2%) occur less frequently. Rarer manifestations include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (6.9%) and pleurisy (3.5%).

### Pulmonary emboli: the differential diagnosis dilemma [^116NorQU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a rare but serious medical condition, with an estimated mortality of 5% to 20%. Many patients receiving physical therapy may be at risk for developing pulmonary embolism, especially after periods of immobilization or surgery. Patients presenting with dyspnea, chest pain, or tachypnea, particularly after trauma or surgery, have an increased likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Clinical prediction rules have been developed, which can aid the practitioners in assessing the risk a patient has for developing pulmonary embolism. The present clinical commentary discusses the existing evidence for screening patients for pulmonary embolism. To illustrate the importance of the screening examination, a patient is presented who was referred to physical therapy 5 days after cervical discectomy and fusion. This patient was subsequently referred for medical evaluation and a confirmatory diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
