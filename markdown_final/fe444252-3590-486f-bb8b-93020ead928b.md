## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Lou Gehrig's disease, which is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and historical context. Then, I should define the disease and its pathophysiology. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors, followed by clinical presentation and diagnostic approach. After that, I need to examine disease-modifying and symptomatic treatments, prognosis, and current research directions. Finally, I will synthesize a concise clinical summary and ensure all claims are supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and historical context. Lou Gehrig's disease is the eponym for ALS, named after the famous baseball player who died of ALS in 1941; ALS is the preferred medical term and is the most common motor neuron disease, with adult-onset progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons [^114mJwQe] [^116D8d1U] [^115QcFJP].

> I will now define the disease and its pathophysiology. ALS is characterized by selective death of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, producing progressive weakness, atrophy, spasticity, and ultimately respiratory failure; most cases are sporadic, while 5–10% are familial, and key pathogenic themes include protein aggregation (notably TDP-43 in ~97% of cases), oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation with glial involvement, reflecting a non–cell-autonomous process [^116D8d1U] [^115QcFJP] [^117W3Krn] [^1154bd77] [^1154hgWY].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. U.S. prevalence is approximately 5.0–5.2 per 100,000, with an incidence around 2 per 100,000 person-years; ALS is slightly more common in men and typically presents between ages 55–75, with lifetime risk roughly 1 in 350 for men and 1 in 472 for women; familial ALS accounts for 5–10% and is linked to mutations in SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, and FUS, while sporadic ALS likely reflects gene–environment interactions including military service, occupational exposures, and possibly microbiome alterations [^1124F7X8] [^115pgoEG] [^1142ecAJ] [^115bX9Yd] [^116Rkq7K].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach. ALS typically begins with insidious, asymmetric limb or bulbar weakness accompanied by upper motor neuron signs such as hyperreflexia and spasticity; bulbar onset occurs in about 19–25% and carries a faster progression; diagnosis remains clinical and is guided by revised El Escorial criteria, with ALSFRS-R used to track function and predict survival; notably, there are no validated blood or imaging biomarkers yet, contributing to delays averaging 9–12 months from symptom onset to diagnosis [^114mJwQe] [^1113ERSW] [^114r6aZw] [^113fq5Kg].

> Let me consider disease-modifying therapy. Riluzole remains a standard treatment and modestly prolongs survival by a few months; edaravone, approved in 2017, may slow functional decline in select patients; early initiation of riluzole appears to confer greater absolute survival benefit, reinforcing the need for timely diagnosis and treatment; I should double-check that both agents are FDA-approved for ALS, which they are [^1124F7X8] [^113Z87vn] [^112FgBFv] [^1124F7X8].

> Next, I should review symptomatic and supportive care. Multidisciplinary management addresses spasticity, cramps, dysphagia, dysarthria, respiratory insufficiency, and end-of-life planning; exercise programs tailored to function help maintain mobility, and sodium channel blockers or anticonvulsants can mitigate cramps; noninvasive ventilation improves survival and quality of life; advance care planning should begin early, with discussions of gastrostomy, NIV, and palliative sedation as appropriate, aligned with patient preferences and capacity [^116dPY27] [^114i3g2u].

> I need to ensure I accurately convey prognosis. Median survival is approximately 2–5 years from diagnosis, with about 10% surviving beyond 10 years; younger age at onset, limb-onset disease, and preserved respiratory function predict slower progression, whereas bulbar onset, older age, and cognitive impairment portend faster decline; familial ALS, particularly SOD1-related, often progresses more rapidly, though genotype-specific modifiers exist [^116D8d1U] [^1142ecAJ] [^116Rkq7K].

> But wait, what about current research directions and barriers. Major challenges include disease heterogeneity, late clinical presentation after substantial motor neuron loss, and the lack of reliable biomarkers; efforts focus on earlier detection, stratified trials by genotype and phenotype, and targeting convergent pathways such as TDP-43 aggregation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation; investigational strategies include BET bromodomain modulation of C9orf72, xanthine oxidoreductase inhibition, and microbiome–immune axis interventions, though translation to clinical benefit remains difficult [^116523HX] [^113fq5Kg] [^113pSisd] [^116FqCsn] [^1142ecAJ].

> Let me synthesize a concise clinical summary. ALS is a relentlessly progressive motor neuron disease with adult onset, asymmetric weakness, and mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs; most cases are sporadic, about 5–10% are familial, and median survival is 2–5 years, with respiratory failure as the usual cause of death; riluzole and edaravone offer modest disease-modifying benefit, and comprehensive multidisciplinary care with early advance planning is essential; significant unmet needs persist in early diagnosis, biomarker development, and disease-modifying therapies that halt or reverse neurodegeneration [^116D8d1U] [^115QcFJP] [^1124F7X8] [^114i3g2u].

Lou Gehrig's disease is **ALS** (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing motor neuron degeneration, muscle weakness, and paralysis, with a median survival of 2–5 years [^116D8d1U] [^115QcFJP]. Most cases are sporadic; 5–10% are familial, often due to mutations in SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, or FUS [^111GWnKL] [^1142ecAJ]. There is **no cure**, but riluzole and edaravone modestly slow progression [^1112ofk7] [^113Z87vn]; multidisciplinary care, respiratory support, and feeding strategies improve quality of life [^116dPY27] [^114i3g2u]. Ongoing research targets genetics, biomarkers, and novel therapies, including antisense and gene therapies [^115QcFJP].

---

## Clinical features and progression

- **Onset**: Typically mid-to-late adulthood (40–70 years), though juvenile and elderly cases occur [^11192LSw].
- **Initial symptoms**: Asymmetric limb weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, or respiratory difficulty [^113fq5Kg] [^114mJwQe].
- **Progression**: Relentless motor decline with eventual respiratory failure; median survival is 2–5 years, though ~10% survive beyond 10 years [^117W3Krn] [^1142ecAJ].
- **Cognitive**: Most patients have preserved cognition; a subset develop frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [^113fq5Kg] [^115QcFJP].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Motor neuron degeneration**: Loss of upper and lower motor neurons causes weakness, atrophy, spasticity, and fasciculations [^114mJwQe].
- **Protein aggregation**: TDP-43 pathology is present in ~97% of ALS; SOD1 aggregates in a subset [^117W3Krn].
- **Genetic factors**: Mutations in SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, FUS, and others contribute to familial and some sporadic cases [^116B3HMA] [^1142ecAJ].
- **Non-cell-autonomous mechanisms**: Glia and immune responses amplify motor neuron injury [^1142ecAJ] [^1154hgWY].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by electrophysiology and exclusion of mimics [^116D8d1U] [^1113ERSW]. The **revised El Escorial criteria** classify disease as definite, probable, probable laboratory-supported, or possible ALS. Electromyography (EMG) confirms widespread denervation and active reinnervation. MRI excludes structural lesions and mimics such as multifocal motor neuropathy or cervical myelopathy [^notfound].

---

## Treatment and management

- **Disease-modifying therapy**: Riluzole modestly prolongs survival; edaravone slows functional decline in select patients [^112FgBFv] [^111GWnKL].
- **Symptomatic care**: Multidisciplinary teams manage spasticity, cramps, dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency, and communication needs [^116dPY27] [^114i3g2u].
- **Respiratory support**: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) improves survival and quality of life; invasive ventilation is individualized [^notfound].
- **Nutritional support**: Early gastrostomy helps maintain nutrition and hydration [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Median survival is **2–5 years** from onset, with variability by age, site of onset, and genetics [^116Rkq7K] [^1142ecAJ]. Younger age at onset, limb onset, and longer diagnostic delay are associated with better outcomes, whereas bulbar onset, older age, and rapid progression predict poorer outcomes [^116Rkq7K] [^1142ecAJ].

---

## Current research and future directions

- **Genetics**: Expanded panels and whole-genome sequencing identify new risk loci [^notfound].
- **Biomarkers**: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and other fluid markers are under validation [^notfound].
- **Therapeutics**: Antisense oligonucleotides, gene therapy, and small molecules targeting TDP-43, SOD1, and C9orf72 are in trials [^notfound].
- **Clinical trials**: Adaptive designs and biomarker-driven enrollment aim to accelerate drug development [^notfound].

---

Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) is a **fatal motor neuron disease** with no cure, but riluzole and edaravone provide modest benefit, and multidisciplinary care improves quality of life. Research is rapidly advancing, with promising genetic and biomarker strategies aimed at earlier diagnosis and disease modification [^111Mnj83] [^115QcFJP].

### Prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-United States, 2014 [^116xmEPy]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease; the majority of ALS patients die within 2–5 years of receiving a diagnosis (1). Familial ALS, a hereditary form of the disease, accounts for 5%-10% of cases, whereas the remaining sporadic cases have no clearly defined etiology (1). ALS affects persons of all races and ethnicities; however, whites, males, non-Hispanics, persons aged > 60 years, and those with a family history of ALS are more likely to develop the disease (1–3). No cure for ALS has yet been identified, and the lack of proven and effective therapeutic interventions is an ongoing challenge. Current treatments available do not cure ALS but have been shown to slow disease progression. Until recently, only one drug (riluzole) was approved to treat ALS; however, in 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved a second drug, edaravone (4).

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease; the majority of ALS patients die within 2–5 years of receiving a diagnosis (1). Familial ALS, a hereditary form of the disease, accounts for 5%-10% of cases, whereas the remaining cases have no clearly defined etiology (1). ALS affects persons of all races and ethnicities; however, whites, males, non-Hispanics, persons aged ≥ 60 years, and those with a family history of ALS are more likely to develop the disease (2). No cure for ALS has yet been identified, and the lack of proven and effective therapeutic interventions is an ongoing challenge. Treatments currently available, Edaravone and Riluzole, do not cure ALS, but slow disease progression in certain patients (3,4). This report presents National ALS Registry findings regarding ALS prevalence in the United States for the period January 1-December 31, 2015. In 2015, the estimated prevalence of ALS cases was 5.2 per 100,000 population with a total of 16,583 cases identified. Overall, these findings are similar to the 2014 ALS prevalence and case count (5.0 per 100,000; 15,927 cases) (2). Prevalence rates by patient characteristics (most common in whites, males, and persons aged ≥ 60 years) and U.S. Census regions are consistent with ALS demographics and have not changed from 2014 to 2015 calendar years. The algorithm used to identify cases from national administrative databases was updated from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to the ICD-10 codes for claims starting on October 1, 2015, with no apparent effect on case ascertainment. Data collected by the National ALS Registry are being used to better describe the epidemiology of ALS in the United States and to facilitate research on the genetics, potential biomarkers, environmental pollutants, and etiology for ALS.

### Oxidative stress: a common denominator in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1154bd77]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of adult onset characterized by a loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and motor cortex. In the last several years, substantial progress has been made in defining the pathogenesis of motor neuron injury and relationships between disease mechanisms and the selective vulnerability of the motor neuron in both familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Recent Findings

Current theories have shifted from a neuron-centered pathology to a focus on the interaction between motor neurons and glia, and their respective contributions to pathways implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although multiple mechanisms clearly can contribute to the pathogenesis of motor neuron injury, recent advances suggest that oxidative stress may play a significant role in the amplification, and possibly the initiation, of disease.

Summary

This article reviews the clinical aspects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and potential mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in the context of recent data supporting a major role for oxidative stress throughout the disease course. Evidence suggesting an important role for intercellular signaling is emphasized.

### Lou gehrig, rawhide, and 1938 [^112tMj5J]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Lou Gehrig was one of the most talented baseball players of all time; yet he is also remembered for ALS, the disease that took his life and still bears his name as its eponym. There is speculation about when his symptoms began. Some authorities believe that Gehrig showed signs of ALS when he starred in the film Rawhide in January 1938, which would mean that he played the entire 1938 season with symptomatic ALS. Additionally, some photographs of Gehrig showing atrophy of hand muscles have been dated incorrectly because of misinterpreted logos on his uniform. We examined the film and photos taken of Gehrig from 1937 to 1939 to determine whether he showed signs of weakness in the film and when visible evidence of ALS could be documented. Specific scenes from Rawhide were chosen to grade Gehrig's motor function using the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS). Dates of photos and uniform logos were verified with the Baseball Hall of Fame. Examination of Rawhide showed that Gehrig functioned normally in January 1938. His ALSFRS score, modified to account for limitations of on-screen activities, was normal. The New York Yankees wore logos in 1938 that were labeled with the year 1939 to advertise the 1939 World's Fair; the uniforms displayed a centennial patch during the 1939 season. A photograph of Gehrig from October 1939 showed hand atrophy. Photos from the spring of 1938 showed normal hand muscles and leg function, implying that visible signs first appeared after May 1938.

This report presents National ALS Registry (Registry) findings regarding ALS prevalence for the period January 1–December 31, 2014, and, for the first time, includes Medicare hospice data and ALS prevalence rates by Census region. ALS prevalence did not change from 2013, remaining at 5.0 cases per 100,000 persons in 2014. Data collected by the Registry are being used to better describe the epidemiology of ALS in the United States and to facilitate research.

In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the ALS Registry Act, which authorized the creation and maintenance of the Registry by CDC; CDC delegated this responsibility to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The main goals of the Registry are to better describe the incidence and prevalence of ALS, characterize the demographics of persons living with ALS in the United States, and examine potential risk factors such as environmental and occupational influences. Because ALS is not a notifiable disease in the United States, the Registry employs a novel case-finding approach that uses administrative and self-reported data to identify cases, whereas usual noncommunicable disease registries (e.g. cancer) typically rely on data reported from health care providers to identify cases.

### CDC grand rounds: national amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) registry impact, challenges, and future directions [^116WTv5Z]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive fatal neurologic disease. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and the available treatments only extend life by an average of a few months. The majority of ALS patients die within 2–5 years of diagnosis, though survival time varies depending on disease progression (1,2). For approximately 10% of patients, ALS is familial, meaning it and has a genetic component; the remaining 90% have sporadic ALS, where etiology is unknown, but might be linked to environmental factors such as chemical exposures (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides) and occupational history (3).

### Gut microbiota immune cross-talk in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1142ecAJ]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive and often fatal neurodegenerative disorder of both upper and motor neurons. While genetic risk factors have been identified, recent studies indicate that the microbiome and immune system play an important role in disease penetrance and progression (Fig. 1). Typically, the age onset of this disease is late middle life, presenting as progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. The median survival time is 2–4 years for most patients. However, the survival of ALS may vary, and up to 10 ​% of ALS cases have a survival of ten years or more following initial symptom onset. ALS has an incidence rate of 2 per 100,000 patients and a prevalence of 5.4 per 100,000. It is estimated to affect some 18,000 people in the United States. This disorder is 20 ​% more common in men than in women, the rate of disease progression being more rapid in patients with older age at onset, a bulbar site of onset, cognitive impairment, and specific genotypes.

Fig. 1
ALS gut-microbiota-immunity- A three-way axis dictating ALS disease severity.

This three-way axis illustrates how gut microbiota dysbiosis can modulate the peripheral immune system and directly impact CNS resident macrophages and astrocyte activation via secretion of metabolites, thus affecting the disease pathogenesis.

Among all the cases of ALS, 90–95 ​% are sporadic, whereas 5%–10 ​% are familial. Of the familial forms, the most frequent mutations are hexanucleotide expansion of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene (most common), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), fused in sarcoma (FUS), TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP43). Since the discovery of SOD1 mutations as a cause of familial ALS (fALS) in 1993, our understanding of the genetic architecture of ALS has increased substantially.

### Microbiome and micronutrient in ALS: from novel mechanisms to new treatments [^115bX9Yd]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor neuron death and skeletal muscle atrophy and paralysis. Most patients die within 5 years of disease onset. The lifetime risk of ALS is about 1 in 472 in women and 1 in 350 in men. Because ALS is an age-dependent disease, an increase in the prevalence of ALS can be anticipated as the U.S. population increases and ages. The cause of ALS is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Approximately 90% cases are sporadic ALS (sALS), and 5–10% are familial ALS due to genetic mutations. More than 30 genes have been identified in fALS, including superoxide dismutase (SOD1), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), and TDP-43, the gene encoding 43 ​kDa transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein. Environmental factors include military service, deployments, exposures, lifestyle changes (e.g. cigarette smoke and dietary), and microbiome alteration. For reasons yet unknown, Veterans are t wice as likely to be diagnosed with ALS as the general population. The microbiome refers to the trillions of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, that live in human body and play crucial roles in maintaining the overall health of host and development of many diseases. Reduced bacterial diversity correlates with various human diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and ALS. Dysbiosis (e.g. loss of microbial diversity in the gut microbiota) is correlated with intestinal inflammation and change of intestinal integrity. Recent ALS studies from our lab and others have shown links of intestinal dysbiosis to ALS.

### Announcement: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) awareness month-may 2016 [^112EGth9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

May is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness Month. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder of upper and lower motor neurons. The cause of ALS is not known, and no cure exists. Persons with ALS usually die within 2–5 years of diagnosis.

### Glial cells in ALS: the missing link? [^11192LSw]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was initially known as Charcot's sclerosis, named after the French neurobiologist and physician Jean-Martin Charcot who first described this type of muscular atrophy in the early nineteenth century. In the United States, ALS became widely known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease in the late 1930s. Currently, ALS is the most common motor neuron disease, with a worldwide incidence of 8 cases per 100,000 population per year. Familial forms constitute approximately 5% to 10% of all cases. Onset increases with age, with a peak in the seventh decade and a slight preponderance (relative risk, 1.3–1.5) among men compared with women. Rapid progression of motor neuron loss leads to death an average of 3 to 5 years after symptom onset. The cause of ALS remains unknown and there is still no curative therapy.

### Fas (t) balls and lou gehrig disease. A clue to selective vulnerability of motor neurons? [^116e5cow]. Neuron (2002). Low credibility.

The molecular basis of the selective death of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been an enigma since its description by Charcot in 1869. In this issue of Neuron, demonstrate a motor neuron-specific death pathway which involves Fas and NO. Remarkably, motor neurons from mice carrying ALS-linked mutant forms of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) exhibit an increased sensitivity to death triggered by Fas but not other insults. These data suggest new insights into the mechanisms of, and potential therapeutic strategies for, death of motor neurons in ALS.

### The Cleveland clinic lou ruvo center for brain health: keeping memory alive [^116jPdnT]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health (LRCBH) is a unique clinical and translational research enterprise that stems from the passion of Larry Ruvo to honor his father, Lou, a victim of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To attract national attention to AD, Mr. Ruvo convinced architect Frank Gehry to construct the remarkable building complex of the LRCBH in Las Vegas, Nevada. Cleveland Clinic assumed responsibility for running the clinical and research aspects of the LRCBH. The care provided in this novel architectural setting is innovative and emphasizes patients first care with integration of caregiver programs and clinical research opportunities. Standardization of care, outcomes measures, and process metrics provide a platform for assessing, studying, and exporting best practices in cognitive care. Clinical trials empower patients to help solve the diseases that afflict them. The combination of a passionate founder, dramatic architecture, clinical excellence, integrated care partner programs, and commitment to development of next generation treatments makes the LRCBH a unique model of integrated care and research.

### The role of TDP-43 propagation in neurodegenerative diseases: integrating insights from clinical and experimental studies [^116B3HMA]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) is the most common motor neuron degenerative disease and is characterized by progressive degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons. Less than 10% of ALS cases are familial ALS (fALS), and ~4% of fALS cases are caused by mutations in the gene encoding TARDBP. Although a small proportion of sporadic ALS and fALS cases are associated with TDP-43 mutations, TDP-43 pathology can be observed in more than 90% of ALS patients.

The initial symptoms of ALS can be fairly diverse in different people and can be found in specific parts of the body. The symptoms also tend to be asymmetrical. As the disease progresses, the symptoms generally spread from one side to both sides of the body. In addition, the progression rate of ALS can be quite variable from one person to another. The severity of motor neuron loss is also related to the site of disease onset. Although not all people with ALS experience the same symptoms or the same sequence or progression pattern, progressive muscle weakness and paralysis are universally experienced –. These clinical features may evidence for the cell-to-cell propagation of TDP-43.

### CDC grand rounds: national amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) registry impact, challenges, and future directions [^111Mnj83]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive fatal neurologic disease. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and the available treatments only extend life by an average of a few months. The majority of ALS patients die within 2–5 years of diagnosis, though survival time varies depending on disease progression. For approximately 10% of patients, ALS is familial, meaning it and has a genetic component; the remaining 90% have sporadic ALS, where etiology is unknown, but might be linked to environmental factors such as chemical exposures (e.g. heavy metals, pesticides) and occupational history.

Like many other noncommunicable conditions, ALS is a nonnotifiable disease in the United States; therefore, the federal government lacks reliable incidence and prevalence estimates for the United States. During October 2008, Congress passed the ALS Registry Act, directing CDC and its sister agency, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, to create a population-based ALS registry for the United States. The main objectives of the National ALS Registry, which was launched in October 2010, are to describe the national incidence and prevalence of ALS; describe the demographics of persons living with ALS; and examine risk factors for the disease. During January 2017, the Registry launched the National ALS Biorepository, which aims to promote research in areas including biomarkers, genetics, and environmental exposures to heavy metals or organophosphates.

### Non-human primate model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43 [^115ZutNP]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy resulting from the combined loss of upper and lower motoneurons. Most cases of ALS are sporadic, and only 10% of ALS cases are of a familial form. Protein aggregates are one histopathological characteristic of ALS. A breakthrough in understanding ALS pathogenesis was the discovery of the 43-kDa transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), which was recently identified as the major component of the protein aggregates and of the insoluble fraction in the brains of patients with sporadic ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). TDP-43 is now expected to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS, possibly equivalent to that of tau and beta amyloid in Alzheimer's disease or α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease.

Human TDP-43 is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed 414 amino acid nuclear protein that binds to both DNA and RNA. In normal settings, TDP-43 is a primarily nuclear protein that functions in transcription regulation, alternative splicing and RNA stabilization, as well as in microRNA metabolism. Pathological TDP-43 can be abnormally truncated, phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, and most TDP-43 is mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or neurites. Of note, almost all neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulations show a dramatic depletion of normal nuclear TDP-43. Thus, both gain and loss of functions are potential disease mechanisms, either due to the loss of normal nuclear TDP-43 expression, or cytoplasmic mislocalization. Therefore, cytoplasmic TDP-43 mislocalization with loss of its nuclear staining is a key feature found in the majority of patients' brains and spinal cords.

### Transcriptome profiling following neuronal and glial expression of ALS-linked SOD1 in drosophila [^1154hgWY]. G3 (2013). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, involves the progressive degeneration of the cortical and spinal motoneurons (MN) that control voluntary skeletal muscle movement. Symptoms include muscle weakness, followed by paralysis as the disease progresses. Death results within 1–5 years after onset, usually due to respiratory failure. Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but approximately 10% are of familial origin, of which, approximately 20% have been linked to mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene.

SOD1 is ubiquitously expressed in all cells and functions to catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Over 150 mutations in the SOD1 gene have been linked to ALS. In mice, SOD1 loss-of-function does not result in neurodegeneration, whereas ubiquitous overexpression of mutant SOD1 leads to ALS-like symptoms, including those mutant SOD1 genes with a normal dismutase function. This indicates that mutations result in a toxic gain of function, rather than loss of function, that leads to the selective degeneration of motoneurons. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain SOD1 toxicity, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired axonal transport, glutamate excitotoxicity, protein aggregation, proteasome dysfunction, and others. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which mutant SOD1 induces neurodegeneration is still not fully understood.

Although motoneurons are the cells that are primarily affected, it is believed that SOD1-linked ALS is a non–cell-autonomous disease and that glia contribute to the pathology. Disease symptoms fail to manifest in transgenic mice and rats expressing mutant SOD1 exclusively in either motoneurons or astrocytes. However, cell type selective excision of mutant SOD1 from motoneurons of transgenic mice delayed disease onset, while excision of mutant SOD1 from microglia slowed disease progression. Hence, these in vivo studies underscore the importance of glia as well as neuron-glia interaction in ALS development.

Flies and humans share highly conserved genes and similar cellular organization and functions of the nervous system, making Drosophila flies highly relevant to understanding human biology and disease. Human neurological diseases successfully modeled in flies include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, polyglutamine-related diseases, adrenoleukodystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, and autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia. The use of flies to model these diseases has provided important insights into human neurological disorders, so flies may also make valuable contributions to understanding ALS.

### The ALSFRS-R: a revised ALS functional rating scale that incorporates assessments of respiratory function. BDNF ALS study group (phase III) [^114r6aZw]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (1999). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R)" for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

The Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. This scoring system is designed to quantify patient disability and monitor the progression of the degenerative disease over time. It assesses the patient's capability and independence in 12 functional activities, including speech, salivation, swallowing, handwriting, cutting food, dressing and hygiene, turning in bed, walking, climbing stairs, dyspnea, orthopnea, and respiratory insufficiency. Each activity is scored from 0 (cannot perform) to 4 (normal ability), with a total score ranging from 0 (most severe disability) to 48 (no disability). The ALSFRS-R is used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, predict survival, and plan for necessary care and resources. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may be less accurate in patients with cognitive impairment or other comorbidities that could affect their ability to perform the functional activities assessed.

The Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) calculator assesses the functional status of an individual based on their responses to 12 different criteria associated with ALS progression. Each criterion is evaluated using an enumerated list of options that describe varying levels of impairment. The user selects a response for each criterion, and a numerical score is assigned according to predefined scales.

The total score reflects the cumulative ALS functional status, ranging from 0 to 48, with lower scores indicating greater impairment. Each criterion's options are assigned specific scores that contribute to the total:

- **Speech**: Scores range from 4 (Normal) to 0 (Loss of useful speech).
- **Salivation**: Scores range from 4 (Normal) to 0 (Marked drooling; requires constant tissue or handkerchief).
- **Swallowing**: Scores range from 4 (Normal eating habits) to 0 (Nothing by mouth; exclusively parenteral or enteral feeding).
- **Handwriting**: Scores range from 4 (Normal) to 0 (Unable to grip pen).
- **Cutting food and handling utensils**: Scores vary for patients with/without gastrostomy, ranging from 4 (Normal) to 0 (Unable to perform any aspect of task).
- **Dressing and hygiene**: Scores range from 4 (Normal function) to 0 (Total dependence).
- **Turning in bed and adjusting bed clothes**: Scores range from 4 (Normal) to 0 (Helpless).
- **Walking**: Scores range from 4 (Normal) to 0 (No purposeful leg movement).
- **Climbing stairs**: Scores range from 4 (Normal) to 0 (Cannot do).
- **Dyspnea**: Scores range from 4 (None) to 0 (Significant difficulty, considering using mechanical respiratory support).
- **Orthopnea**: Scores range from 4 (None) to 0 (Unable to sleep).
- **Respiratory insufficiency**: Scores range from 4 (None) to 0 (Invasive mechanical ventilation by intubation or tracheostomy).

These individual scores are summed to generate a total score, which determines the patient's 9-month survival probability according to the following ranges:

- **Score ≤ 15**: 9-month survival is ≤ 25%
- **Score 16–20**: 9-month survival is 25–40%
- **Score 21–25**: 9-month survival is 40–60%
- **Score 26–30**: 9-month survival is 60–70%
- **Score 31–35**: 9-month survival is 70–80%
- **Score 36–40**: 9-month survival is 80–90%
- **Score ≥ 41**: 9-month survival is > 90%

### Genetic factors for survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: an integrated approach combining a systematic review, pairwise and network meta-analysis [^115abmtJ]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Different genetic variants are considered as different interventions in this study, so we employed a NMA following the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines and reported it using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for NMA. In addition, the report of the pairwise meta-analysis for other modified loci was followed by the recommendations of the PRISMA (2009) guidelines. The protocol for this study was registered with PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42022311646.

Search strategies and selection criteria

The published studies were systematically searched and obtained from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library without any language restrictions, by using the term: "(gene* OR geno* OR variant* OR mutation OR haplotyp* OR polymorphism* OR SNP OR Allel*) AND (prognosis* OR progress* OR survival OR outcome OR mortality OR death) AND ((amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) OR (motor neuron disease) OR (Lou Gehrig's disease) OR (Gehrig Disease))". Reference lists of full review articles were also reviewed to search for additional articles. All randomized clinical trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and observational studies were eligible, but no RCTs were identified. The articles were updated to October 27, 2021.

According to previous survival research in ALS, survival was defined as the time between the onset of symptoms and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for more than 23 hours per day, or tracheostomy or death. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) assessed the association between present or absence with different genetic loci and survival time from the onset in patients with ALS; (2) had reported a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidential intervals (CI) for patients with genetic mutations or Kaplan-Meier plots from which we can estimate the HR and 95%CI; (3) abstract, reviews, letters without original study, secondary studies and studies that HR or 95%CI was unavailable in papers, excluded from the analysis; and (4) full papers published in English.

### Mortality of 196, 826 men and women working in U.S.-Based petrochemical and refinery operations: update 1979 to 2010 [^111CU97i]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Motor Neuron Disease (MND) Including ALS and Other MNDs

We found the HWE to be less evident for the category of nervous system disease in the total cohort (SMR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96), primarily attributed to MND. MND mortality risks were significantly increased for both men and women in this study compared to the original study and SMRs remain significantly increased for the update period (2001 to 2010) for both genders (SDC Figure 11, SDC Figure 12).

However, for men working in upstream operations, a non-significantly increased mortality risk for MND-ALS was reported in the original study (SMR 1.47, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.51) based on 13 observed deaths. In this update, the SMR (1.28) for MND has decreased for this operating segment and continues to be non-statistically significant (95% CI 0.81 to 1.92).

In the absence of a unique ICD code for ALS, we used ICD-9 code 335.2 and ICD-10 code G12.2, which also include other MNDs. We found 82% (n = 125) of the death certificates (DCs) included the terms ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, which we considered predictive of ALS, albeit not neurologically confirmed. This proportion in the MND class of diseases is consistent with the literature. About 2% (n = 3) of DCs indicated other MNDs such as bulbar palsy, primary lateral sclerosis and progressive muscular atrophy. For 11% (n = 17) of the DCs, progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 17), also known as Steele-Richardson Oslzewski syndromewas indicated. This is not a MND sub-type, and has a separate ICD-10 code of G23.1. The remaining 5% (n = 7) of certificates indicated the nonspecific term of motor neuron disease. While some physicians may use this term interchangeably with ALS, we found it may not always translate into ALS. For example, the MND term was next to "Kennedy's syndrome", which is a lower motor neuron, X-linked recessive disease, not ALS. Accuracy of ALS coding is expected to improve with the implementation of ICD-11 codes, which provide unique codes for ALS and each of the other MNDs.

### Glycosylation and behavioral symptoms in neurological disorders [^116MLvLN]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative motor neuron disease. It is characterized by ubiquitinated aggregates, hyperphosphorylated neurofilament (NF) proteins, and the degeneration of motor neurons, brain stem nuclei, and the anterior horn of the spinal cord, resulting in focal limbic muscle weakness and progressive respiratory failure making it difficult for patients to speak, eat, breathe and move. In particular, NF is increasingly being considered part of the outcome measures of ALS, and impaired O-GlcNAcylation on NF due to eOGT mutations in the ALS model is critical for NF hyperphosphorylation. In SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1)-overexpressing mouse models, decreased O-GlcNAcylation of NF and deprived O-GlcNAc immunoreactivity was found in motor neurons of the spinal cord. The N PGPx (nonselenocysteine-containing phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase) knockout mouse model showed decreased O-GlcNAc levels and ROS accumulation, rescued by OGT inhibition. In addition to NF, TDP43, one of the genes known to be involved in ubiquitinated aggregates, was also found to be O-GlcNAcylated, and increased TDP43 O-GlcNAcylation upon coexpression of OGT and hTDP-43 in the Drosophila model suppressed its aggregation and hyperphosphorylation, further leading to improved locomotion and lifespan. Together, these studies indicate a crucial role for O-GlcNAcylation in regulating neurodegenerative disorders.

### Differences in Lyme disease diagnosis among medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, United States, 2016–2021 [^1131HgP6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior studies examining Lyme disease epidemiology by race and ethnicity have been too small to fully disaggregate results by group or have collected data that only enabled comparison of outcomes for White versus non-White persons. Given the heterogeneity of the non-White group, analyses using datasets sufficiently powered to generate incidence estimates and more fully describe disease characteristics and progression by race and ethnic group can improve the characterization of Lyme disease epidemiology.

Medicaid and Medicare are health insurance programs administered by the US Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Medicaid provides healthcare coverage to persons with lower income, and Medicare provides coverage for adults > 65 years of age and persons of any age with a qualifying disability, end-stage renal disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). Administrative claims data from those programs provide an opportunity to obtain a robust sample to further disaggregate disease outcomes by race and ethnicity. We used administrative claims data to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics, disease outcomes, and healthcare utilization for Lyme disease cases among Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries residing in US jurisdictions with high Lyme disease incidence rates.

### O-glcNAcylation in health and neurodegenerative diseases [^112AiyKe]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative motor neuron disease that causes the degeneration of both lower and upper motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem nuclei, and anterior horn of the spinal cord –. This loss of motor neurons results in focal limbic muscle weakness and progresses to respiratory failure, limiting survival to 2–4 years after disease onset. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of motor neuron degeneration remains incompletely understood. Several factors, such as genetic mutation, abnormal neurofilament function, oxidative stress, and inflammation, are considered the main causes of ALS. In ALS, 90% of cases are classified as sporadic ALS, and the remaining 10% of cases are familial ALS with dominantly inherited autosomal mutations in SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1), TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43), FUS (fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma), and C9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72). According to recent studies of ALS, O-GlcNAcylation can play a neuroprotective role against ALS pathology. It was reported that the abundance of O-GlcNAcylation in mutant SOD1-overexpressing mice was significantly reduced in the motor neurons of the spinal cord compared with that of wild-type mice. Interestingly, hyperphosphorylated neurofilaments (NFs) and their aggregation are observed in ALS pathology, and this neurofilament is modified by O-GlcNAc. Consistent with these findings, O-GlcNAcylation of neurofilaments remarkably decreased in the ALS rat model overexpressing mutant SOD1, potentially indicating the disruption of O-GlcNAcylation in ALS pathology. Considering the crosstalk with phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation may suppress excessive phosphorylation of neurofilaments and concomitantly alleviate ALS pathology.

### Prevalence of living alone with dementia and other progressive neurological conditions: findings from primary care data in england [^116tZF4M]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Living alone in older age is becoming increasingly common, and currently about half of people aged 65 and older in the United Kingdom (UK) live alone. As the population ages, the prevalence of conditions such as dementia and Parkinson's disease is also increasing. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are currently an estimated 982,000 people living with dementia in the UK, with projections indicating this will rise to 1.4 million by 2040. With dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions affecting a significant proportion of older people, a substantial number are expected to live alone.

The four most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions are Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and motor neurone disease (MND), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease. In the UK, studies have estimated between 18 and 42% of people with dementia live alone. Studies from other parts of the world vary widely, from 25 to 37% in the United States (US) and 23 to 62% in European countries. For Parkinson's disease, one global study found that just 12% lived alone, whereas some small studies in the UK indicate that 18–27% lived alone. Estimates for other progressive neurological conditions, including MND and Huntington's disease, are lacking.

Motor Neuron Disease (MND) Including ALS and Other MNDs

The SMR for MND among men was 1.21 and just reached statistical significance (95% CI 1.00 to 1.44) (Table 2). By time period, mortality risk increased for those hired before 1960, with the SMR of 1.39 just reaching significance (95% CI 1.06 to 1.79, 60 observed deaths) and for those with 30 or more years of latency (SMR 1.44, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.76, 92 observed deaths) (not shown in Table 2). About 75% of decedents were 60 years or older at death.

Examination of the death certificates showed that 81% (99/122) of the causes of death contained the terms ALS, bulbar ALS, progressive ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. Non-ALS disorders made-up 13% of the death certificate causes including progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 13), which is not considered a subtype of MND, bulgar palsy (n = 1), progressive muscular atrophy (n = 1) and primary lateral sclerosis (n = 1). The remaining seven certificates indicated the nonspecific terms of motor neuron disease, of which two specified familial MND and Kennedy's syndrome MND, which is a hereditary disorder. Military service was indicated on the death certificates for 67 of the 122 male decedents (55%).

Parkinson's Disease

Among non-white men, the SMR for Parkinson's disease (SMR 2.06) just reached statistical significance (95% CI 1.03 to 3.69), based on 11 observed deaths vs. 5.3 expected deaths (not shown in Table 2).

### When neuromuscular disorders become stars [^11399oNG]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This retrospective study identified 125 audio-visual works from cinema and television, including films, TV series, and documentaries, depicting neuromuscular disorders since 1910. Motor neuron disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), had the highest representation (69.3%), followed by myopathies (20%). The predominant genre was documentary (48%), which offered more factual representation than fictional works. ALS was overrepresented due to its dramatic nature and association with notable figures, including the American baseball player Lou Gehrig and British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking; other neuromuscular disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, were depicted less frequently. Despite inaccuracies in some portrayals, these works raise public awareness and contribute to a greater understanding of rare diseases, such as neuromuscular disorders, among the general public.

### Creating a transatlantic research enterprise for preventing Alzheimer's disease [^113dDvnW]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2009). Low credibility.

In recognition of the global problem posed by Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, an international think-tank meeting was convened by Biocat, the Pasqual Maragall Foundation, and the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute in February 2009. The meeting initiated the planning of a European Union-North American collaborative research enterprise to expedite the delay and ultimate prevention of dementing disorders. The key aim is to build parallel and complementary research infrastructure that will support international standardization and inter-operability among researchers in both continents. The meeting identified major challenges, opportunities for research resources and support, integration with ongoing efforts, and identification of key domains to influence the design and administration of the enterprise.

### BET bromodomain inhibitors PFI-1 and JQ1 are identified in an epigenetic compound screen to enhance C9ORF72 gene expression and shown to ameliorate C9ORF72-associated pathological and behavioral abnormalities in a C9ALS / FTD model [^113pSisd]. Clinical Epigenetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two devastating, progressive neurodegenerative diseases with clinically distinct entities. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a motoneuron disease affecting spinal cord, brainstem and cranial motoneurons, leading to death by respiratory failure within 3–5 years of diagnosis. The majority of ALS patients have the sporadic form of the disease (sALS), but about 10% of the cases have familial ALS (fALS), which is associated with pathogenic mutations in genes such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP encoding TDP43), and C9ORF72, which is characterized by an intronic hexanucleotide expansion. FTD, the second most common cause of early dementia (< 65 years) after Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by progressive deficits in behavior, language and executive functions due to a neuronal atrophy in the frontal and temporal cortices. Despite these distinct clinical entities, ALS and FTD patients also can present clinical and histopathological overlaps and share similar genetic signatures, including pathogenic mutations in TARDBP and C9ORF72. In fact, patients harboring mutations in C9ORF72 can suffer from ALS, FTD or a mixture of both, explaining the wide clinical diversity of both diseases. ALS and FTD have been classified as the extreme ends of the ALS/FTD spectrum; individuals carrying mutations in C9ORF72 are collectively referred to as C9ALS/FTD patients. Currently, there is no cure and no effective treatments to halt, or reverse, the progression C9ALS/FTD, or for non-C9ORF72 related ALS patients, partly because of an incomplete understanding of the causative pathomechanisms of these disorders.

### New strategy that delays progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in G1H-G93A transgenic mice: oral administration of xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitors that are not substrates for the purine salvage pathway [^116FqCsn]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease that involves both upper and lower motor neurons. We orally administered 4 xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitors to G1H-G93A mice carrying 25 transgene copy numbers of human mutant G93A superoxide dismutase 1, from 80 days of age. Three nonpurine-analogue inhibitors (TEI-6720: Febuxostat, Y-700 and FYX-051), but not allopurinol with a purine analogue ring (pyrazolo pyrimidine ring), significantly delayed disease onset, prolonged survival and the duration of disease stages, improved clinical signs, and alleviated weight loss. Exercise testing (extension reflex, inclined plane, footprint, rotarod, and beam balance tests) showed significantly improved motor function in the G1H-G93A mice treated with these 3 inhibitors. Significant amelioration of disease was seen even when TEI-6720 or Y-700 was administered after the appearance of early signs. Histopathological evaluation in the late stage revealed that G1H-G93A mice treated with TEI-6720 had well-preserved motor neurons and fewer inclusion bodies, compared with mice treated with placebo or with allopurinol. Our results indicate that these 3 nonpurine-analogue XOR inhibitors might increase the supply of high-energy compounds via the purine salvage pathway, thereby protecting motor neurons against death. This strategy may be applicable for oral therapy of ALS patients.

### Mitigation of TDP-43 toxic phenotype by an RGNEF fragment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis models [^117W3Krn]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of voluntary muscle function, typically leading to death from respiratory failure within 3 to 5 years of symptom onset. To date, despite multiple efforts, there is no effective therapy that arrests the progression of ALS because of the complex nature of its pathology. The hallmark of ALS is the presence of unique protein inclusions, the most common of which are composed of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)such as TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43), fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS), TATA-Box binding protein associated factor 15 (TAF 15), Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWS), RNA binding motif protein 45 (RBM45), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 and A2/B1 (hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1) and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RGNEF/p190RhoGEF). Of these proteins, TDP-43 is the most extensively studied ALS-associated RBP as its dysregulation has been directly associated with neuronal death in vitro and in vivo, and TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) are observed in 97% of ALS cases.TDP-43 is also the main pathological component of a group of diseases called TDP-43 proteinopathies, which include frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). Because of this, there is a special interest in targeting TDP-43 as a therapeutic approach.

### Lessons from the 1918 flu pandemic: a novel etiologic subtype of ADHD? [^116jYZgc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2009, Dr. Anthony Fauci stated, "The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was a defining event in the history of public health". 1 In 2020, a popular medical website suggested that the 1918 pandemic may offer "lasting lessons for the world in the grip of COVID-19". 2 One lesson from the 1918 pandemic relates to residual long-term effects. In his influential book published in 1971, Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children, Wender 3 reviewed historical accounts of the 1918 pandemic and suggested that viral infection had selective brain effects on catecholamine nuclei, and behavioral sequelae in some children emerged and overlapped with symptoms that now define attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavioral sequelae emerged in some adults that overlapped with symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Based on this and several excitotoxic models of behavioral disorders (ie, Volpe, Altman, Amsel, Benveniste, and Lou) related to arterial architecture and patterns of blood flow to the brain, previously our group 4 proposed etiologic subtypes of ADHD based on a dopamine-deficit hypothesis and assumption that dopamine neurons might be particularly sensitive to a variety of environmental insults. We speculate that residual effects of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may selectively affect brain regions underlying attention and motivation deficits associated with ADHD, as documented by positron emission tomography imaging studies of adults (see Volkow et al. 5), which could increase risk for an infection-triggered etiologic subtype of ADHD.

### Timing of cognitive decline in CLN3 disease [^111rdwQF]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

CLN3 disease (OMIM #204200), also known as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or Batten disease, is the most frequent of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). These genetically and clinically heterogeneous degenerative disorders of the brain and, in most forms, of the retina are unified by the intracellular accumulation of auto fluorescent storage material in most tissues. Collectively, they comprise a major cause of childhood neurodegeneration (Haltia; Kousi et al.).

Patients with CLN3 disease present with rapid visual decline around 6 years of age. It is generally believed that cognitive deterioration does not occur until several years after presentation (Kousi et al.). Indeed, cognitive decline may not be apparent until well into adulthood in the protracted form of CLN3 disease displayed by a minority of patients (Lauronen et al; Munroe et al.). Some casuistic reports, however, have suggested the presence of neuropsychological problems around, or even before, the onset of visual deterioration in the common classical phenotype (Kristensen and Lou; Lamminranta et al; Spalton et al.). It is presently unclear whether these problems should be attributed to the rapid vision loss or reflect early neurodegeneration.

To delineate timing of neurocognitive decline in CLN3 disease, we performed a systematic literature search and included the retrieved cases in a meta-analysis of case reports. Subsequently, we corroborated the data from the literature search with a cohort of patients diagnosed with CLN3 disease from the Dutch national NCL referral center and — to delineate the influence of rapid vision loss — we compared these to a cohort of patients with isolated retinal degeneration due to Stargardt disease.

### Danish heritable retinoblastoma survivors' perspectives on reproductive choices: "It's important for me, not to pass on this condition" [^1137YwfE]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study explored how guilt and responsibility were themes repetitively raised by the participants: the burden but also power in making active decisions regarding their future children's health; that it is difficult and acknowledged as such. Additionally, the associated guilt for negatively impacting pregnancy‐related happiness in their partners. This is exemplified by a participant's statement concerning how it was not fair that the partner must go through this because of the heritable disease. The same participant further described feelings of guilt and responsibility for the pregnancy not being as easy or as joyful an event as desired; expressing a natural, underlying expectation that pregnancies and having babies is an exciting and happy event. (Lou et al.).

This study explores, describes, and emphasizes the complex reproductive choices in survivors with heritable RB. Our findings confirm previous studies concerning the complexity of the process of reproductive decision‐making in genetic conditions (Boardman; Boardman & Hale; Carrieri et al; Decruyenaere et al; Downing; Genoff Garzon et al; Mendes et al.). Participants' reflections on guilt, responsibility, and ambivalence are discussed in late‐onset neurological diseases: genetic responsibility and ambivalence between the acceptance or rejection of the risk of disease in children (Mendes et al.). Family circumstances and subjective lived experience impact the "responsible decision", the value of life despite genetic risk, balancing the wish for children with the nature of disease, and attitudes toward prenatal diagnosis, PGT and moral concerns, are recognizable, previously reported, themes (Mendes et al.). In families with Huntington's disease, also a late‐onset neurological disease, the decision‐making process is complex and making the right decision for the individual is closely linked to acting as a morally responsible person who makes well‐grounded decisions; the process of decision‐making seems to be even more important than the decision itself (Downing). In our study, the report of a stressful and suboptimal process involving invasive prenatal testing and the need to decide quickly, emphasizes the importance of the decision‐making process.

Topics to discuss may include: What could happen at the end of life, for example, how death may occur Providing anticipatory medicines in the home Advance care planning, including Advance Decisions to Refuse Treatment, Do Not Attempt Resuscitation orders, and Lasting Power of Attorney (a legal authorisation for a designated person to make decisions about another person's property, finances, or medical care) How to ensure advance care plans will be available when needed, for example, including the information on the person's Summary Care Record When to involve specialist palliative care Areas that people might wish to plan for, such as: (i) What they want to happen (e.g. their preferred place of death)?; (ii) What they do not want to happen (e.g. being admitted to hospital)?; (iii) Who will represent their decisions, if necessary?; and (iv) What should happen if they develop an intercurrent illness? Invasive ventilation [new recommendation added by EAN] Palliative sedation, and withdrawal of treatment Be prepared to discuss euthanasia and assisted suicide. [new recommendation added by EAN].
Think about discussing advance care planning with people at an earlier opportunity if you expect their communication ability, cognitive status, or mental capacity to get worse.
Offer people the opportunity to talk about, and review any existing Avance Decisions to Refuse Treatment, Do Not Attempt Resuscitation orders, and Lasting Power of Attorney when interventions such as gastrostomy and NIV are planned.
Provide additional support as the end of life approaches, for example, additional psychological, social, or nursing care to enable informal carers and family to reduce their carer responsibilities and spend time with the person with ALS.
Towards the end of life, ensure there is prompt access to the following, if not already provided: A method of communication that meets the person's needs, such as an AAC system Specialist palliative care Equipment, if needed, such as syringe drivers, suction machines, riser–recliner chair, hospital bed, commode, and hoist Anticipatory medicines, including opioids and benzodiazepines to treat breathlessness, anxiety and antimuscarinic medicines to treat problematic saliva and respiratory secretions.
Offer bereavement support to family members and/or carers (as appropriate).
Take into account the spiritual support needs of the patient and their family and/or carers (as appropriate). [new recommendation added by EAN].

### A reappraisal of gaucher disease-diagnosis and disease management algorithms [^115KEhBH]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Type 1 (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher disease was the first lysosomal storage disorder for which an effective enzyme replacement therapy was developed and it has become a prototype for treatments for related orphan diseases. There are currently four treatment options available to patients with Gaucher disease, nevertheless, almost 25% of Type 1 Gaucher patients do not gain timely access to therapy because of delays in diagnosis after the onset of symptoms. Diagnosis of Gaucher disease by enzyme testing is unequivocal, but the rarity of the disease and nonspecific and heterogeneous nature of Gaucher disease symptoms may impede consideration of this disease in the differential diagnosis. To help promote timely diagnosis and optimal management of the protean presentations of Gaucher disease, a consensus meeting was convened to develop algorithms for diagnosis and disease management for Gaucher disease.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic, fatal neurodegenerative disease of the human motor system. In this Seminar, we summarise current concepts about the origin of the disease, what predisposes patients to develop the disorder, and discuss why all cases of ALS are not the same. In the 150 years since Charcot originally described ALS, painfully slow progress has been made towards answering these questions. We focus on what is known about ALS and where research is heading-from the small steps of extending longevity, improving therapies, undertaking clinical trials, and compiling population registries to the overarching goals of establishing the measures that guard against onset and finding the triggers for this neurodegenerative disorder.

### Gaucher disease, state of the art and perspectives [^111DotJE]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Knowledge about Gaucher disease (GD), considered a model for rare diseases, has considerably increased since its discovery. The pathophysiology of this lysosomal disorder is better known, and specific therapies that can control many aspects of the disease have been developed, particularly for the most common form, Type 1 GD. Yet, in part because of the rarity of GD, but also because of a lack of awareness by physicians, diagnostic delay too often leads to a belated management of patients having accumulated comorbidities. Gaucher cells, the most visible consequence of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, have been known for many years. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying some major lesions, such as bone disease, predisposition to Parkinson's disease in Type 1 GD, or neurological involvement in Type 2 and Type 3 GD, remain poorly understood. Diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up issues associated with these symptoms remain critical to optimize the care of these patients. In this review, clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of GD are successively considered, highlighting for each of them the remaining challenges. Continued efforts to better understand pathophysiological mechanisms, use of the most modern methods such as artificial intelligence, international collaboration, and development of new therapeutic strategies seem essential for the future of this rare disease.

### What has changed with riluzole? [^112ZAtq1]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Riluzole, after two significant trials, was introduced as the first standard treatment of amyotrophic lateral clerosis (ALS) in the early 95'. After 5 years what has changed in the field of ALS? In the field of basic science, riluzole as an active drug has largely contributed to stimulate the research of the possible role of glutamate in the genesis of ALS. However, the apparent simplicity of the relation between the drug and its mechanisms has to modulated in the light of the negativity of other trials (gabapentin) and the display of other mechanisms of the disease and of the compound. Possible relation with other putative mechanisms of ALS, as oxydative stress or growth factors, could be (and probably are) also involved. In the field of its activity, riluzole has an impact on the survival rate which has been largely debated. Comparison with historical databases are supporting the results of the two initial trials. Other information have been published supporting the probable activity of the drug on the muscle strength decline, a controversial matter. They strengthen the initial data and give additional reasons to use riluzole as a standard treatment of patients. In the field of the daily care, riluzole provided a real and unique hope for ALS sufferers. Even if its activity is not as complete as patients would have expected, it provides a hope for slowing down the rate of evolution and abolishes the myth of "no hope, no cure" which was the leitmotiv of patients care until recently. We have to better define the mode of administration with regard to the clinical status of the patients (respiratory disorders, fatigue, stiffness). In the field of care givers, riluzole was one major factor which provided the basis for national and international collaborations either for therapeutic trials or for standard of care. It made possible large collaborative programs in and among many countries. We do hope that this impulse will continue and be stimulated by additional results both in the field of basic science and clinical research.

6a. Muscle weakness*

*Adapted from NICE guideline.

General
Discuss the available treatment options for muscle problems. Take into account the person's needs and preferences, and whether they have any difficulties taking medicine (e.g. if they have problems swallowing).
Review the treatments for muscle problems during MDT assessments, ask about how the person is finding the treatment, whether it is working, and whether they have any adverse side effects.

Non‐pharmacological interventions: exercise programmes
Consider an exercise programme for people with ALS to: Maintain joint range of movement Prevent contractures Reduce stiffness and discomfort Optimise function and quality of life.
Choose a programme that is appropriate to the person's level of function and tailored to their needs, abilities, and preferences. Take into account factors such as postural needs and fatigue. The programme might be a resistance programme, an active‐assisted programme, or a passive programme.
Check that family members and/or carers (as appropriate) are willing and able to help with exercise programmes.
Give advice to the person and their family members and/or carers (as appropriate) about safe manual handling.
If a person needs orthoses to help with muscle problems, they should be referred to orthotics services without delay, and the orthoses should be provided without delay.

6b. Muscle cramps

Consider sodium blockers (ranolazine, quinine sulfate, mexiletine, carbamazepine), gabapentine, pregabalin, and baclofen for the management of cramps as symptomatic treatment.
Start quinine sulfate at low doses (100 to 200 mg per day) and monitor for cardiac adverse events before and after prescription.

Remarks:
When choosing a treatment, take into account other comorbidities (e.g. if people also experience spasticity consider trying baclofen as first‐line treatment).

6c. Spasticity

Non‐pharmacological interventions
Consider non‐pharmacological approaches, such as physical therapy, to treat spasticity.

Pharmacological interventions
Consider cannabinoids, baclofen, tizanidine, or gabapentin to treat muscle stiffness, spasticity, or increased tone.
In patients with focal spasticity, consider botulinum toxin if these treatments are not effective, not tolerated, or contraindicated.

An IgM monoclonal antibody, OL-2, was produced by immunizing Lou rats with crude cerebellar membrane fraction. Splenocytes from the rats were fused with a rat myeloma cell line. An antibody secreted by one hybridoma was found to bind to sulfated glycolipids, i.e. sulfatide, seminolipid, sulfolactosylceramide, lysosulfatide and evidenced no binding to neutral sphingoglycolipids such as galactosylceramide, and lactosylceramide, as shown by immunodetection by thin-layer chromatography. In tissue sections, cerebellar white matter and oligodendrocytes were strongly labeled while live; immunocytofluorescence detected both immature and fully mature oligodendrocyte in tissue cultures. The antibody was successfully used to detect urinary sulfatides in metachromatic leukodystrophy and distinguish them from closely migrating other lipids from patients with other neurological diseases.

Key challenges

Over the last two decades, there have been significant advancements in therapeutic approaches for CNS diseases, moving beyond conventional symptom-targeting treatments toward therapies that can modify the course of the disease itself. Despite these strides, the effectiveness of various treatments remains constrained by specific and shared challenges. For n-GSDs, specific challenges involve gaps in our understanding of disease-specific mechanisms as highlighted below.
- Which brain/CNS regions are primarily affected in different n-GSDs?
- Which cell types are involved in glycogen/PGB accumulation?
- How do glycogen/PGBs compartmentalize at the subcellular level?
- How does glycogen distribution change in brain regions in n-GSDs?
- How does glycogen structure, architecture, and composition change in n-GSDs?
- What is the region- and/or cell type-specific molecular/metabolic signatures linked to perturbed glycogen metabolism in n-GSDs?
- What molecular mechanism determines whether glycogenolysis occurs through lysosomal hydrolysis or cytoplasmic phosphorolysis?
- Developing molecules or therapeutic approaches capable of targeting both the CNS and peripheral components.

### Gaucher disease in bone: from pathophysiology to practice [^1156AM4q]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Recommendations for monitoring presented here are based on an understanding and interpretation of the pathology as well as a retrospective review of the utility of the modalities.
Bone disease in patients with GD is prevalent, disabling, and heterogeneous in pathology and clinical manifestations, in both the individual and the community.
Evidence suggests that although the pathology of BM disease and mineral compartment are etiologically linked, separate consideration should be given to monitoring by MRI and DXA. Both yield useful information on the current state of disease and the likelihood of future events such as infarction, fractures, etc.
Therapy should address GD‐specific challenges to bone, as well as conventional ones, and include, as for all bone diseases, generally appropriate attention to dietary (calcium and vitamin D) and lifestyle factors (suitable weight‐bearing exercises and avoidance of smoking and excess alcohol consumption).
BM disease is rapidly responsive to GD‐specific therapy. Further work is required to understand the relation between an improvement in the bone disease score and a change in risk of bone events. Reduced BMD is associated with increased fracture risk, and we need to understand whether improvement translates into clinical effect.
Careful and agreed definitions of terminology are needed to guide the interpretation of existing evidence and to guide the planning of future studies.

Dementia due to frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders — presentation, criteria, imaging, and epidemiology: Frontotemporal dementia is characterized in its early stages by changes in personality, significant apathy, executive dysfunction, deterioration of social skills, emotional blunting, behavioral disinhibition, and prominent language abnormalities, with difficulties with memory, apraxia, and other features of dementia usually following later; as the dementia progresses, it may be accompanied by extreme agitation, and early prominent personality/behavior change, severe apathy, and/or early language deficits help to distinguish it from Alzheimer's disease. Two sets of diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders have been proposed, and the criteria of McKhann et al. include progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia, and hippocampal sclerosis; argyrophilic grain disease may also be included. Structural brain imaging typically reveals prominent frontal and/or temporal atrophy with relative sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes. The formal diagnosis of Pick's disease depends on the neuropathological finding of Pick inclusion bodies. About one-third of cases are familial, the disorder most commonly manifests in patients ages 50–60 years, and the course is progressive and can be more rapid than that of Alzheimer's disease.

### How can we improve clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis? [^116523HX]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Since the approval of riluzole for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 17 years ago, more than 30 large clinical trials have been conducted, but none has proved successful. The failure to translate positive preclinical results into the clinical setting raises questions about the validity of the rodent model that is used to study ALS, and about the quality of both preclinical and clinical studies. However, the greatest challenge is the disease itself as, with rare exceptions, the causes are unknown. In this Perspectives article, we highlight key issues related to the pathophysiology, preclinical studies and clinical trials that should be addressed in the future. These areas include the relationships between different disease mechanisms, the challenges presented by the heterogeneity of the disease, and the need for early intervention, optimal dose selection and effective biomarkers.

### Gaucher disease: an unusual cause of knee pain [^1111QDjz]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

GD is a hereditary lysosomal storage disorder resulting in β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency. It usually presents with visceral and skeletal abnormalities. Bone manifestations are frequently expressed as acute disabling pain, usually near the joint. This is the main symptom of patients with GD who visit orthopaedic surgeons for investigation and adequate treatment. In the event of nontraumatic pain with acute onset, except for osteomyelitis and malignancy, it is important to also look for more unusual diseases, when the clinical and laboratory findings are controversial. GD is such a rare disease, and it is important to be successfully diagnosed because early therapeutic agent introduction is crucial for the final outcome and life expectancy.

Paget's disease — selected complications: The most common neurological complication of Paget's disease is hearing loss associated with disease involving the skull, and paralysis is often reversible and may be due to vascular steal rather than direct neurological compression. Cardiac output can increase with widespread and active skeletal lesions, but heart failure is unusual. Hypercalcemia is an unusual complication resulting when patients with more generalized skeletal disease are immobilized, but more frequently, hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism may be a concurrent problem in patients with Paget's disease, and other causes should also be considered. Nephrolithiasis is reported but rare.

### Recent advances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^117W7eVW]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

ALS remains a relentlessly progressive and fatal disease and the only approved disease-modifying drug has a modest effect in slowing disease progression. Symptomatic and palliative care, provided in a multidisciplinarycontext, still remains the cornstone of ALS management. However, significant progress has been accomplished in the identification of new genetic factors underlying this disease. Although currently known ALS-related genes still explain a minority of cases, they have helped to unravel the molecular mechanisms of motorneuron degeneration and to identify converging pathways underlying ALS pathogenesis, such as disturbed RNA metabolism or pathological protein aggregation, giving new hope for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

### Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: why so many negative trials and how can trials be improved? [^114Ut16N]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most rapidly progressive neurodegenerative diseases of unknown cause. Riluzole is the only drug that slows disease progression. More than 50 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of proposed disease-modifying drugs have failed to show positive results in the past half-century. In the past decade, at least 18 drugs have been tested in large phase 2 or 3 RCTs, including lithium, which was tested in several RCTs. Potential reasons for the negative results can be classified into three categories: first, issues regarding trial rationale and preclinical study results; second, pharmacological issues; and third, clinical trial design and methodology issues. Clinical trials for stem cell therapy and RCTs targeting pharmacological or non-pharmacological symptomatic treatment in ALS are examples of areas that need novel design strategies. Only through critical analyses of the failed trials can new and important suggestions be identified for the future success of clinical trials in ALS.

### Early initiation of riluzole may improve absolute survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112FgBFv]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

It could be suggested that inferences of this analysis are trivial and do not change practice. We argue that they are meaningful. First, our observations provide a useful estimate of the magnitude of survival gain from early treatment. More importantly, a strong argument for early treatment, and therefore, for urgent diagnosis of ALS is made. This argument applies to riluzole, and potentially also to other treatments.

Fatigue

Data on the effects of psychotherapeutic approaches for fatigue management have not been convincing. In their meta-analysis, Luo et al. included two studies on CBT compared to active control groups with N = 32 PwPD and were unable to identify a significant effect on fatigue symptoms. Jiang et al. included only one RCT with N = 12 PwPD in their meta-analysis, which investigated a combination of CBT and light therapy compared to a placebo group, but found no positive effects on fatigue symptoms. A recent RCT that Bogosian et al. conducted also did not demonstrate any significant effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on the fatigue symptoms of PwPD compared to a passive control group. Therefore, no recommendation for psychotherapy as a treatment for fatigue was given.

Only two RCTs with N = 57 PwPD participating in physical interventions could be included in the 2015 Cochrane review, whereby no positive effect on fatigue symptoms could be determined. Two meta-analyses on specific physical intervention approaches (i.e. mind–body interventions and dance therapy) only included three (N = 74 PwPD) and two (N = 58 PwPD) RCTs, respectively, and could not show the superiority of physical interventions over control groups. A recent meta-analysis with four RCTs and N = 100 PwPD participating in different physical intervention approaches showed a trend for the superiority of the intervention over control groups. Another recent meta-analysis was able to draw on 30 RCTs on different drug and non-drug treatment approaches. Eight studies with N = 324 PwPD could be considered for meta-analysis on physical interventions in comparison with control groups. There was shown a significant but small effect of physical interventions on fatigue symptoms in PwPD compared to the active and passive control groups. No clear recommendations regarding duration, frequency and type of intervention can be drawn from the existing evidence. Based on these considerations, the following recommendation was given.

An overview of the recommendations for non-pharmacological intervention approaches to treat affective disorders in PwPD is given in Table 2.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^111THjJu]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The members of the GDG assessed the quality of the evidence according to the methodology described by the GRADE system. In this system, quality of supporting evidence is assessed based on explicit methodological criteria and classified as "high" (further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect), "moderate" (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate), "low" (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate), or "very low" (any estimate of effect is very uncertain).

The method we used for wording of recommendations is shown in Table 1. The GDG considered the quality of evidence, the balance between benefit and harms, patients' values and preferences, and the resources and potential costs involved. For instances where interventions or investigations were recommended (or not recommended), the GDG felt that the benefits clearly outweighed the harms for most people or vice versa. For instances where there was a closer balance between benefits and harm for interventions and investigations, the GDG made a conditional recommendation. For conditional recommendations, the GDG felt that clinicians should discuss with patients and families the relative merits of alternative management options to the intervention to help each patient arrive at a decision consistent with his or her values and preferences.

Table 1
Wording of Recommendations

For instances where there was insufficient evidence to support the use of an intervention or investigation for a specific indication, it was agreed that a statement should be made to acknowledge that the intervention or investigation was not recommended.

The guideline process was validated in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, using the AGREE reporting checklist 2016. 67

The draft guidelines were sent to several stakeholders and were externally reviewed by the representatives from the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, the European Calcified Tissues Society, the International Osteoporosis Foundation, the British Geriatrics Society, the Bone Research Society (UK), as well as several patients who are members of the UK Paget's Association. Several other organizations were invited to comment but did not respond (Supplemental Appendix S3). The final version of the guideline was revised and updated to take account of the comments that were received. The GDG intends to conduct regular reviews every 3 years after publication of the guidance to determine whether the evidence base has progressed significantly enough to alter the current guideline recommendations and require an update.

These clinical/biomarkers define the presence of a syndrome in which symptoms/signs of disease are evident (prodromal Parkinson's disease), but insufficient to permit diagnosis of clinical Parkinson's disease. In addition to this prodromal state, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) recognizes a preclinical state, in which neurodegeneration has started, but clinical symptoms/signs have not yet emerged. Preclinical stages are not currently definable, because most biomarkers become abnormal only at prodromal stages. As noted previously, however, there are at least 16 prospectively established clinical markers or biomarkers of prodromal disease. Because Parkinson's disease-related neurodegeneration generally starts outside the dopaminergic motor areas (in the olfactory bulb/nucleus, lower brainstem, and peripheral autonomic system), most markers are non-motor. Moreover, the prodromal state can be very long; the average duration is ∼10 years and many patients manifest subtle signs 15–20 years before clinical Parkinson's disease is diagnosed. Most clinical prodromal Parkinson's disease markers identify all prodromal synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy (of note, dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease are no longer considered mutually exclusive conditions by MDS criteria).

Introduction

Motor neuron disease (MND) covers a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders defined and characterized by degeneration of motor neurons. With an incidence of approximately 2.16 per 100.000 person-years and a median survival time of 3 to 5 years, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common and severe form, involving both lower motor neurons (LMN) and upper motor neurons (UMN), underpinned by a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Starting from our previous update, this review summarizes the recent highlights in ALS research published in the Journal of Neurology and other relevant scientific Journals during the last 60 months.

### Population-based versus hospital-based data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – A factor to consider? [^116bSBMW]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Registry Swabia

The SR is a population‐based clinical‐epidemiological registry in a defined geographic region in the South‐West of Germany (details see), including the city of Ulm from which the hospital‐based data were obtained (see above). The catchment area has approximately 8.4 million inhabitants. The aim of the registry is to collect data on all newly diagnosed ALS patients who had their residence in Swabia. Consequently, the registry provides estimates of epidemiological variables, such as incidence, and describes the natural history of ALS, including survival status. It further allows for the investigation of risk factors for ALS by means of a registry‐based case‐control study, which is, however, not part of this analysis.

Beginning on October 01, 2010, all newly diagnosed ALS patients (until 2020, n = 1739) were registered prospectively. ALS patients were defined by the diagnosis of possible, probable, or definite ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria. To synchronize the datasets for this analysis, all patients who did not agree to be visited by a study nurse to obtain baseline and follow‐up data were excluded (n = 568). In addition, patients with the El Escorial category of "suspected" ALS at baseline (n = 319) were excluded to match the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the hospital‐based database. The remaining dataset consisted of n = 852 patients.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients were actively followed up on a yearly basis by performing a standardized interview. For survival status, the registration offices were contacted annually, and, if a patient was deceased, the date of death was received (last systematic mortality update in December 2020). Collected demographic and clinical parameters match those described above for the hospital‐based dataset, except for FVC, which was not available for the SR.

### Orthopaedic management of Loeys-Dietz syndrome: a systematic review [^114cXYQd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rapidly progressive aortic aneurysmal disease along with other vascular manifestations present the greatest immediate risks to patients with LDS because past investigations have reported aortic root dilatations in more than 95% of probands for LDS, aortic dissection as early as 6 months of age, and an average lifespan of 26 years for patients presenting with aneurysmal disease. Given these comorbid presentations, cardiovascular disease is typically the focus of care and research associated with LDS.

However, a variety of musculoskeletal pathology has also been described in patients with LDS. These manifestations include idiopathic talipes equinovarus, scoliosis, spondylolisthesis, instability of the cervical spine, joint hypermobility, pectus deformity, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and deformity of the hip. The reported orthopaedic conditions in LDS can vary considerably from patient to patient and can often be quite severe. Because early detection and improved management of the vascular aspects of the disease help patients with LDS live longer, fuller lives, understanding these musculoskeletal manifestations will become increasingly important to optimize physical function and quality of life.

Although the musculoskeletal manifestations associated with LDS have previously been reported, the management of these conditions and associated outcomes have not been comprehensively described. Even among the general population, a broad spectrum of treatment approaches is available for many of the orthopaedic conditions reportedly associated with LDS, ranging from conservative measures, such as stretching and bracing treatment, to complex surgical procedures, such as multilevel spinal fusions. The severity of reported orthopaedic pathology coupled with the medical complexity of patients with LDS means that these challenging clinical decisions can be even more difficult to make for this population. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of current literature regarding the management of orthopaedic conditions and associated outcomes in patients with LDS. It is our hope that this review will provide a valuable reference for pediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, and anyone who provides care for patients with LDS.

### About amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [^116Rkq7K]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Highlights
- ALS also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a motor neuron disease.
- ALS is rare, though slightly more common in men than women.
- The disease affects the nerve cells in both the upper and lower parts of the body. It causes the muscles to become weak and leads to paralysis.
- No one knows what causes most cases of ALS. Overview ALS is a disease that affects the nerve cells in both the upper and lower parts of the body. This disease causes the nerve cells to stop working and die. The nerves lose the ability to trigger specific muscles, which causes the muscles to become weak and leads to paralysis. No one knows what causes most cases of ALS. Scientists have been studying many factors that could be linked with ALS, such as heredity and environmental exposures. Other scientists have looked at diet or injury. No cause has been found for most cases of ALS. In the future, scientists may find that many factors together cause ALS.

Health studies have not found definite environmental factors that are linked with either ALS or other MNDs. Some studies suggested a possible link with exposure to heavy metals. Other studies suggested a link with exposure to trace elements, solvents, radiation, and agricultural chemicals. No confirmed link was found with infections, diet, physical activity, and injury. How it impacts lives
- ALS is slightly more common in men than women, but recent studies suggest that this difference is decreasing over time. Familial ALS is equally common in men and women.
- ALS is age related; most people with ALS find out they have it when they are between 55 and 75 years of age.
- Most people live from 2 to 5 years after symptoms develop. How long a person lives with ALS seems to be related to age; people who are younger when the illness starts live slightly longer.
- About 5–10% of ALS cases occur within families.

This is called familial ALS and it means that two or more people in a family have ALS. These cases are caused by several inherited factors. The most common is in a gene called SOD1.
- Familial ALS is found equally among men and women. People with familial ALS usually do not fare as well as a person with ALS who are not related, and typically live only one to two years after symptoms appear.

### CDC grand rounds: national amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) registr… [^113fq5Kg]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Altmetric: Citations: Views: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Figure Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive fatal neurologic disease. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and the available treatments only extend life by an average of a few months. The majority of ALS patients die within 2–5 years of diagnosis, though survival time varies depending on disease progression. For approximately 10% of patients, ALS is familial, meaning it and has a genetic component; the remaining 90% have sporadic ALS, where etiology is unknown, but might be linked to environmental factors such as chemical exposures and occupational history. Challenges for Research, Drug Development, and Patient Care The onset of ALS is insidious. Patients might experience weakness in an upper or lower limb or difficulty speaking or swallowing, with bulbar onset disease.

No definitive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or imaging biomarkers for ALS have been identified yet; thus, ALS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, typically made after other diseases have been ruled out. As a result, approximately 9–12 months might elapse during the onset of new progressive weakness and a definitive diagnosis. This time window, essentially one quarter of an ALS patient's remaining lifespan, is a lost opportunity for developing drugs aimed at stopping the degeneration and death of motor neurons. 16). However, disease progression varies widely among patients. Certain functions can remain normal including bladder and bowel control, eye movements, and awareness. Unlike other progressive neurologic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, cognition and largely memory remain intact for the vast majority of ALS patients; however, new research suggests that frontotemporal dementia may be affecting more ALS patients than previously thought.

Barriers to progress in identifying the etiology, means of prevention, and cure of ALS remain formidable. An estimated 50%–70% of motor neurons are no longer functional when patients with clinical signs and symptoms come to medical attention. Therefore, clinical trials that enroll ALS patients use drugs that can only attempt to slow disease progression. At this time, there are no identified therapeutics that stop or reverse the death of these motor neurons. Other barriers include the large number of patients required for sufficiently powered clinical trials and the costs of trials.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: lou gehrig's disease… [^114mJwQe]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was first described in 1869. 1 It is frequently referred to as "Lou Gehrig's disease" in memory of the famous baseball player who died of ALS in
1941. 2 ALS is defined as adult-onset, idiopathic, progressive degeneration of anterior horn cells and upper and lower motor neurons resulting in progressive muscle weakness, wasting and fasciculations. 3–5 The clinical picture varies, depending on the location and progression of the pathologic changes. Diagnostic criteria of the World Federation of Neurology 6 can help define and classify ALS. Speech therapy evaluation demonstrated moderate to severe weakness of laryngeal muscles. Within a month, the patient had slurred speech, difficulty in swallowing liquids and fasciculations of the tongue. During the next year, she lost the ability to speak or swallow, and developed weakness and fasciculations in her shoulders, arms and upper trunk.

Communication was complicated by multiple daily episodes in which the patient laughed or wept inappropriately and switched from one emotion to the opposite within a few minutes. She became cachectic despite use of a gastrostomy tube and experienced increasing problems with balance, respiration, nutrition and hydration. Within two years, the patient became severely disabled because of generalized weakness. She experienced no sensory problems, intellectual deterioration or skin breakdown in spite of her degree of immobility. Difficulty in swallowing necessitated the use of a gastrostomy tube for feeding. The patient died of respiratory failure approximately three years after reporting the initial symptoms. Pathology Atrophy of the anterior horn cells and replacement of the large motor neurons by fibrous astrocytes causes the affected anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord to become hard, hence the term "lateral sclerosis".

Cellular abnormalities and inclusion bodies have been described in the degenerating neurons, but none of these changes are pathognomonic of ALS.
4. Clinical Features The classic presentation of ALS is insidious, progressive, asymmetric muscular weakness and atrophy along with neurologic signs, particularly fasciculations and hyperreflexia. 4 The clinical picture depends on the area of the nervous system that is damaged. The disease begins with equal frequency in upper and lower limbs. Bulbar symptoms are the initial manifestations in 19 to 25 percent of cases. 10, 15.
