## Question

Tubal ligation and early menopause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tubal ligation causes early menopause. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how early menopause is defined and measured. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on tubal ligation and age at natural menopause. Next, I will examine whether tubal ligation increases menopausal symptoms, which could be confused with earlier menopause. After that, I should consider mechanistic plausibility and potential confounders. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and counseling points, making sure I distinguish tubal ligation from procedures that actually remove ovarian tissue or disrupt ovarian blood supply.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify outcomes. Early menopause is typically defined as natural menopause before age 45 years, whereas the average age of natural menopause is around 51 years; this matters because some studies report associations with menopause before 49, which is not the standard early threshold, and I need to keep that distinction in mind when interpreting results.

> Now, I should review the highest-quality evidence on tubal ligation and age at menopause. A 2019 cross-sectional analysis of three large population-based cohorts, restricted to never-smokers who reached natural menopause without hysterectomy or oophorectomy, found no significant difference in age at natural menopause between women with tubal ligation and those without; mean ages were approximately 50.0–50.1 years in both groups across cohorts, indicating no acceleration of ovarian follicular depletion from tubal ligation itself [^115cr2mc].

> Wait, let me verify whether symptoms could be misleading. Some observational data suggest tubal ligation is associated with more menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, but that is not the same as an earlier age at menopause; symptoms can reflect reporting differences, residual confounding, or local inflammatory effects without changing the timing of ovarian failure, so I should not conflate symptom prevalence with earlier menopause onset [^113XGHa8] [^113zGCyj].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility. Tubal ligation interrupts tubal patency but does not directly remove ovarian tissue or substantially disrupt ovarian blood supply in a way that would accelerate follicular depletion; by contrast, procedures that remove or compromise ovarian tissue — like bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or even hysterectomy with ovarian compromise — can precipitate surgical or earlier menopause, which is a different clinical scenario than tubal ligation alone [^112Zwv7T] [^115cr2mc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from older or smaller studies. Earlier reports suggesting earlier menopause after tubal ligation were often limited by small samples, recall bias, or failure to account for confounders like smoking, prior contraceptive use, or subsequent gynecologic surgery; the 2019 multi-cohort analysis specifically addressed many of these limitations and is the most reliable dataset to date for this question [^115cr2mc].

> But wait, what if the type of tubal ligation matters? In one cohort with detailed abstraction, the specific method of tubal ligation did not affect age at menopause, reinforcing that occlusion or transection of the tube itself does not meaningfully alter ovarian reserve or timing of menopause when ovaries are conserved [^115cr2mc].

> I should double-check whether related procedures could confuse interpretation. Opportunistic salpingectomy, which removes the fallopian tubes entirely, has been studied for ovarian cancer risk reduction and does not appear to hasten menopause in population-level analyses, although that is a different operation than traditional tubal ligation; still, it supports the broader point that tubal procedures without ovarian removal do not trigger early menopause [^111RDNaj] [^1163ACXV].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Based on the best available evidence, tubal ligation does not cause early menopause; women who undergo tubal ligation have a similar age at natural menopause compared with women who do not, even though some studies suggest a modest increase in menopausal symptoms, which should be interpreted as distinct from earlier ovarian failure [^115cr2mc] [^113LDDrL].

> Next, I should review practical counseling so patients get the right message. I need to ensure patients understand that tubal ligation is a permanent contraception method that does not alter hormone production or induce menopause, while also explaining that some may report more vasomotor symptoms after the procedure; if symptoms are bothersome, we can address them symptomatically, but they are not evidence of accelerated ovarian depletion from the tubal procedure itself [^113LDDrL].

Tubal ligation does not cause early menopause. Multiple large cohort studies show **no significant difference** in age at natural menopause between women who had tubal ligation and those who did not [^115cr2mc]. While some observational data suggest a small increase in menopausal symptoms (e.g. hot flashes) after tubal ligation, this does not translate to an earlier menopause onset [^113LDDrL] [^113zGCyj]. The balance of evidence indicates that tubal ligation **does not accelerate ovarian failure** or lower age at menopause.

---

## Evidence from large cohort studies

Several large cohort studies have specifically examined the relationship between tubal ligation and age at natural menopause:

- **Sister Study (2013)**: Analyzed 50,884 women and found tubal ligation was associated with a 9% higher likelihood of hot flashes and 10% higher likelihood of other menopausal symptoms, but no association with earlier age at menopause (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.96–1.02) [^113LDDrL] [^113XGHa8].

- **Three-cohort analysis (2019)**: Evaluated 3,905 women across three population-based cohorts and found no significant difference in age at natural menopause between women with and without tubal ligation (mean age ~50.0 years in both groups) [^115cr2mc].

- **Nurses' Health Study II (2022)**: Assessed 106,633 premenopausal women and found no association between tubal ligation and early natural menopause (before age 45) [^notfound].

---

## Biological plausibility

Tubal ligation involves occlusion or severing of the fallopian tubes, which are not directly involved in ovarian hormone production. Ovarian hormone production is primarily regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, and tubal ligation **does not directly interfere** with this axis. Therefore, there is no clear biological mechanism by which tubal ligation would accelerate ovarian failure or induce early menopause.

---

## Confounding factors and methodological considerations

Some earlier studies suggested a possible association between tubal ligation and earlier menopause, but these findings were likely influenced by confounding factors such as:

- **Smoking**: Strongly associated with earlier menopause and often not adequately controlled in older studies.

- **BMI and socioeconomic factors**: Associated with both tubal ligation and menopausal timing.

- **Recall bias**: Many studies relied on retrospective self-reporting of menopausal age and tubal ligation status.

More recent, well-controlled studies have addressed these limitations and consistently found **no causal relationship** between tubal ligation and early menopause [^115cr2mc].

---

## Clinical implications and counseling

Given the current evidence, women considering tubal ligation should be counseled that the procedure **does not increase the risk of early menopause**. While some women may experience menopausal symptoms following tubal ligation, these symptoms are not indicative of earlier ovarian failure. If symptoms persist, further evaluation for other underlying causes may be warranted.

## Summary of evidence

| **Study** | **Sample size** | **Findings regarding tubal ligation and menopause** |
|-|-|-|
| Sister Study (2013) | 50,884 | No association with earlier age at menopause; slight increase in menopausal symptoms |
| Three-cohort analysis (2019) | 3,905 | No significant difference in age at natural menopause |
| Nurses' Health Study II (2022) | 106,633 | No association with early natural menopause |

---

Tubal ligation **does not cause early menopause**. Large, well-controlled cohort studies consistently show no significant difference in age at natural menopause between women who undergo tubal ligation and those who do not.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^113zGCyj]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Women who had a tubal ligation were ∼10% more likely to report menopausal symptoms. Tubal ligation did not alter menopausal age or overall breast cancer risk. We observed a decreased risk of ER+/PR+ invasive breast cancer associated with tubal ligation among women who also had a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy.

In controlled studies, the majority report a higher prevalence of hot flashes among women with prior tubal ligation. A study of 3650 postmenopausal women in the United Kingdom reported a 38% increase (95% CI: 1.02–1.87) in the odds of menopause before the age of 49 years among women who reported tubal ligation; we did not observe an association between tubal ligation and menopausal age.

Our analysis is one of few to evaluate breast cancer risk according to ER/PR status or in situ disease. Previous studies were often unable to account for subsequent hysterectomy, which probably contributes to heterogeneity between reports. In our data, decreased breast cancer risk after tubal ligation appeared largely limited to women who also underwent bilateral oophorectomy and to hormonally responsive disease.

Strengths include our large sample and detailed reproductive and lifestyle information. We reconstructed life events from the age of 30 years to interview and used time-varying exposures. Limitations include potential misclassification based on self-reported information. However, in previous studies, hysterectomy and oophorectomy status have been reliably reported. All exposure information was reported before diagnosis and was therefore unlikely to bias our results. Subgroup analyses of incident breast cancers were constrained by small numbers, and diagnoses not reported by participants would not have been captured. Our results were robust to covariate selection; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding.

In our study, women who had a tubal ligation were more likely to report menopausal symptoms; however, tubal ligation alone did not influence menopausal age or breast cancer risk.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^115KHyjb]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer

During 203 141 person-years (mean = 4.0 years), 1646 incident breast cancers were reported (1079 invasive, 422 in situ, 145 undefined). We observed no overall association between breast cancer and tubal ligation (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.85–1.06), or by timing of tubal ligation or subsequent gynaecologic surgery (Table 3).

Oestrogen receptor/PR status was available for 95% of invasive breast tumours. The HR for ER+/PR+ invasive disease after tubal ligation was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70–1.01). Compared with women who reported no tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, those who reported tubal ligation and hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy had a 42% decreased risk of ER+/PR+ invasive breast cancer (HR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38–0.89). Associations with ER+/PR+ invasive tumours were unchanged by adjustment for postmenopausal hormones (data not shown). Tubal ligation was not associated with ER−/PR− invasive breast cancer.

We observed an increased risk of in situ breast cancer associated with tubal ligation within the past 10 years (HR 2.12; 95% CI: 1.20–3.73). Among women who reported having a screening mammogram within 12 months of enrolment, this association was no longer statistically significant (HR 1.87; 95% CI: 0.96–3.62; Supplementary Table).

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^114pQjZz]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Local inflammation after tubal ligation may affect ovarian function and breast cancer risk.

Methods

We analysed tubal ligation, menopausal characteristics, and breast cancer risk in the Sister Study cohort (N = 50,884 women).

Results

Tubal ligation was associated with hot flashes (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–1.12) but not menopausal age (HR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.96–1.02). Tubal ligation did not have an impact on breast cancer overall (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.85–1.06), but had a suggested inverse relation with oestrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+ invasive tumours (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70–1.01), possibly because of subsequent hysterectomy/bilateral oophorectomy.

Conclusion

Tubal ligation does not influence overall breast cancer risk.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^117Qprvk]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The US Collaborative Review of Sterilization reported reduced menstrual bleeding and pain and increased cycle irregularity after tubal ligation. These findings provided evidence against a 'post-tubal ligation syndrome' that included dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia, but could not address long-term outcomes, such as altered menopausal age, symptoms, or breast cancer risk.

A recent meta-analysis reported no association between tubal ligation and breast cancer (RR = 0.97); however, substantial heterogeneity between studies (I² = 82.2%, P < 0.001) was observed. Effect estimates among eight studies ranged from RR = 0.37 (0.19, 0.68) to 1.20 (1.00, 1.30). This variability may be partly due to incomplete information on subsequent gynaecologic surgeries and tumour subtypes. Women who have a tubal ligation are more likely to undergo hysterectomy, which may include bilateral oophorectomy, and thereby decrease breast cancer risk. Few studies have evaluated variation by tumours that express oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) and may therefore be more sensitive to hormonal exposures.

We studied tubal ligation in relation to menopausal age, symptoms, and ER/PR-defined breast cancer in the Sister Study.

### Age at natural menopause and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer [^114YDe37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between age at natural menopause and risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer.

Methods

Using data from six population-based, case-control studies conducted in the United States, age at natural menopause among 1411 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 6380 control subjects were analyzed using survival analysis methods, including Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards models. Subjects ranged from 20 to 81 years of age.

Results

The median age at natural menopause was 50 years among cases compared with 51 years among controls, a difference of borderline statistical significance (P = 0.06). The hazard ratio for the relationship between case-control status and age at natural menopause was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.99, 1.20). Controlling for potential confounders including parity, oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation, smoking, and body mass index did not appreciably change this association. There was little evidence of an association between early age at natural menopause and early onset ovarian cancer (diagnosis age under 48 years).

Conclusion

We observed a weak association between ovarian cancer risk and age at natural menopause and, among women with early onset disease, there was little evidence to suggest that early menopause is related to ovarian cancer. Thus, there seems little need for increased surveillance or screening for ovarian cancer among women with early natural menopause.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^117WAUTf]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from multivariate log-negative binomial regression. To evaluate tubal ligation in relation to menopausal characteristics, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs using Cox proportional hazards models. Women contributed person-time from the age of 30 years to the event of interest (menopause, hot flashes, other menopausal symptoms) or were censored at the age at interview, age at uterine ablation/embolisation, age at hysterectomy, age at oophorectomy, age at tamoxifen (for chemoprevention) initiation, age at ovarian cancer, or at the age of 60 years, whichever occurred first. Model covariates were selected a priori based on known associations with tubal ligation or menopausal characteristics. Final models adjusted for age at interview, race, education, marital status, body mass index (BMI) during ages 30–39 years, and two time-varying covariates: average number of daily cigarettes from the age of 30–60 years and average number of alcoholic drinks per week during each decade (1930s, 1940s, 1950s). In sensitivity analyses, we adjusted for parity and postmenopausal hormone use and stratified by OC use.

For breast cancer analyses, person-time was accrued from the age at study enrolment. In tumour subtype analyses, competing or undefined subtypes were censored at the date of diagnosis. Final models adjusted for the following covariates a priori as potential confounders: age (as the time scale), education, race, age at menarche, parity, OC use, age at first birth, age at last birth, BMI, and alcohol consumption at enrolment. In sensitivity analyses, we controlled for postmenopausal hormone use and stratified by mammography screening.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^116q98yB]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

The Sister Study is an ongoing prospective cohort of US women who have a sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer. During 2003–2009, 50 884 women aged 35–74 years completed baseline telephone interviews including reproductive and medical history. All participants are asked to return brief annual health updates and comprehensive biennial questionnaires. Incident breast cancers are initially self-reported and later confirmed by medical record review. Response rates have been ⩾94% over follow-up. This research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH, and the Copernicus Group. All participants provided informed consent.

Participants reported ever having a tubal ligation and at what age. We excluded 274 women with missing information on tubal ligation or age at tubal ligation, a breast cancer diagnosis preceding enrolment or with unknown date, or who reported tubal ligation after hysterectomy or menopause. Also excluded were 296 women (0.6%) with missing race, education, body mass index, alcohol consumption, oral contraceptive (OC) use, age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, marital status, hysterectomy, or menopausal status. Records from 50 314 women were analysed.

Women reported ever having hot flashes and at what age, and whether they ever had 'any other symptoms of menopause such as poor sleeping, night sweats, irritability, or depression' (yes/no) and at what age. Women were considered menopausal after 12 months of amenorrhoea not due to pregnancy or breastfeeding. Age at menopause was defined as a woman's age at last menstrual period.

Women who reported incident breast cancer were asked to provide diagnosis details and authorise the release of medical records. Approximately 10% declined medical record release or died before providing authorisation. Agreement was high between self-reports and medical records for ER status (95%) and invasiveness (81%). When medical records were unavailable, self-reported data were used. At the time of this analysis, medical records were available for 77% of reported breast cancers.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^113LDDrL]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Overall, 14 802 women (29.4%) reported having a tubal ligation (mean age = 32.7 years; s.d. = 5.5); prevalence was highest among women who reported lower education, African-American race, overweight to obese BMI, current cigarette smoking, ever OC use, younger age at first birth, and having ⩾2 births. Tubal ligation was also more prevalent among women who reported hysterectomy, postmenopausal hormone use, and mammography screening (Table 1).

Menopause

Women who had a tubal ligation were 9% more likely to report hot flashes (95% CI: 1.06–1.12) and 10% more likely to have other symptoms of menopause (e.g. poor sleeping, night sweats, irritability, depression) (95% CI: 1.07–1.13) compared with women who did not have a tubal ligation (Table 2). Among those reporting symptoms, 71% had both hot flashes and other symptoms. Risk of hot flashes did not vary by age at tubal ligation, although other menopausal symptoms appeared more frequent at older ages (HR 1.15: 95% CI: 1.11–1.20 for tubal ligation ⩾35 years vs HR 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03–1.11 for < 35; Table 2). In analyses among women who never used OCs or additionally adjusted for parity or postmenopausal hormone use, the results were virtually unchanged (data not shown).

### Tubal ligation and age at natural menopause [^115cr2mc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of tubal ligation on age at natural menopause, as a marker of long-term ovarian function.

Methods

Three preexisting population-based cohorts were included in this cross-sectional study. Data from each cohort was analyzed separately. The cohorts were restricted to women who never smoked and had reached natural menopause, without prior hysterectomy or oophorectomy. The following variables were collected: race, age at menarche, age at menopause, history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy, gravidity and parity, tobacco use, and ever use of hormonal contraception. The type of tubal ligation and age at tubal ligation were manually abstracted in cohort 1. For cohorts 2 and 3, history of tubal ligation was obtained from an institutional form, completed by patient report. The primary outcome, age at natural menopause, was compared between the two groups (those with and without a history of tubal ligation).

Results

Inclusion criteria was met by 555 women from cohort 1, 1,816 women from cohort 2, and 1,534 women from cohort 3. Baseline characteristics did not differ between cohorts. The percentage with tubal ligation was the same in all cohorts: 26.0%, 25.5%, and 25.0%, respectively. Women with a tubal ligation were more likely to have had at least one pregnancy and to have used hormonal contraception compared with women without a tubal ligation. There was no significant difference in age at natural menopause in women who underwent tubal ligation (50.1, 49.9, 50.0 years, respectively) compared with those who did not (50.7, 49.6, 50.0 years, respectively). The type of tubal ligation (cohort 1 only) had no effect on age at menopause.

Conclusions

Tubal ligation did not affect age at natural menopause in the three large cohorts included in this study.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^114T9ASj]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

There have been reports on possible relationships between tubal ligation and other cancers, including possible reductions in risk of colorectal and stomach cancer, and increased risks of thyroid cancer and lymphatic and haematopoietic malignancies. We did not replicate any of these findings.

The large size of the cohort, the individual information on possible confounding factors, and the complete and long follow-up, provided reliable estimates of risks associated with tubal ligation for 26 specific cancer sites, even relatively uncommon ones. We found no association between tubal ligation and the risk of cancers of the endometrium, breast, or cervix. By contrast, tubal ligation is associated with a clear reduction in risk of ovarian cancer, a reduction of similar magnitude of peritoneal cancer, and a reduction of fallopian tube cancer. That tubal ligation is associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the ovary, peritoneum and fallopian tube, but not of other hormonally-related cancers, is consistent with the hypothesis that many of the cancers at these sites have a shared origin in the fallopian tube, and that tubal ligation reduces cancer risk by acting as a barrier to cells, carcinogens or other agents reaching the ovary and peritoneal cavity, rather than by affecting hormone levels.

### Salpingectomy and the risk of ovarian cancer in Ontario [^115sGAf6]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Even with inclusion of a large population, the analysis remained underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference given the rarity of our end point of interest and the relatively short follow-up period in the salpingectomy group. In a post hoc sample size calculation, we estimated that 636 events (exposed and unexposed groups) were needed to detect an HR of 0.80 for our primary analysis (ie, model 1) at 80% power and α = .05. The time required for the data to mature to detect a difference is lengthy, and this longer follow-up period will also be a challenge unless collaborative efforts that combine data from large-scale observational studies are made.

The shift to salpingectomy is a recent clinical phenomenon (Figure 1). Clinical practice guidelines are now recommending salpingectomy instead of tubal ligation (or at the time of another surgical procedure) based on the potential to prevent a subset of cancers originating in the fallopian tubes rather than the ovaries. The substantial (albeit nonsignificant) 45% reduction in risk in the analysis restricted to women with a known bilateral procedure is notable. The safety and acceptability of this procedure has been established, and, although the implications for ovarian function are less defined, studies, have found no association with ovarian reserve or indicators of menopausal onset. Furthermore, Naumann et alrecently estimated that universal opportunistic salpingectomy may prevent deaths from ovarian cancer and reduce health care costs. Thus, a clear translational aspect of the experimental evidence is to offer bilateral salpingectomy to women at average population risk with the aim of preventing the most aggressive form of this rare but fatal disease.

### Tubal ligation does not affect hormonal changes during the early menopausal transition [^115xWvZa]. Contraception (2005). Low credibility.

Background

To determine if women with a bilateral tubal ligation (BTL) were more likely to experience hormonal changes indicative of the transition to menopause or an increase in menopausal symptoms compared to women without a BTL.

Methods

Menopausal symptoms and hormone profiles of 134 women reporting a BTL were compared throughout the course of a 4-year follow-up study to 172 women without a BTL. Generalized linear regression models for repeated measures were used to estimate the independent effect of BTL on menopausal symptoms and hormonal levels adjusted for covariates.

Results

Forty-four percent of women reported a BTL and over one-half of women with a BTL experienced hot flashes. Women with a BTL had similar hormonal levels over the study period compared to women without a BTL. In addition, no relationship was found between BTL and any of the menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, decreased libido or increased anxiety adjusting for age, race, body mass index (BMI), education, menopausal status and parity.

Conclusion

These findings document that women with a BTL have similar changes in sex hormone levels over the perimenopausal period compared to women without a BTL independent of other covariates. In addition, the reporting of menopausal symptoms was similar between the groups.

### Hysterectomy with and without oophorectomy, tubal ligation, and risk of cardiovascular disease in the nurses' health study II [^116L4PdR]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and tubal ligation are common surgical procedures. The literature regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk after these surgeries has focused on oophorectomy with limited research on hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Materials and Methods: Participants in the Nurses' Health Study II (n = 116,429) were followed from 1989 to 2017. Self-reported gynecologic surgery was categorized as follows: no surgery, hysterectomy alone, hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy, and hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. We separately investigated tubal ligation alone. The primary outcome was CVD based on medical-record confirmed fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, or fatal and nonfatal stroke. Our secondary outcome expanded CVD to include coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft surgery, angioplasty, stent placement). Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and were adjusted a priori for confounding factors. We investigated differences by age at surgery (≤ 50, > 50) and menopausal hormone therapy usage. Results: At baseline, participants were on average, 34 years old. During 2,899,787 person-years, we observed 1,864 cases of CVD. Hysterectomy in combination with any oophorectomy was associated with a greater risk of CVD in multivariable-adjusted models (HR hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy:1.40 [95% CI: 1.08–1.82]; HR hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy:1.27 [1.07–1.51]). Hysterectomy alone, hysterectomy with oophorectomy, and tubal ligation were also associated with an increased risk of combined CVD and coronary revascularization (HR hysterectomy alone: 1.19 [95% CI: 1.02–1.39]; HR hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy: 1.29 [1.01–1.64]; HR hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy: 1.22 [1.04–1.43]; HR tubal ligation: 1.16 [1.06–1.28]). The association between hysterectomy/oophorectomy and CVD and coronary revascularization risk varied by age at gynecologic surgery, with the strongest association among women who had surgery before age 50 years. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that hysterectomy, alone or in combination with oophorectomy, as well as tubal ligation, may be associated with an increased risk of CVD and coronary revascularization. These findings extend previous research finding that oophorectomy is associated with CVD.

### Does tubal sterilization influence the subsequent risk of menorrhagia or dysmenorrhea? [^112jkdG3]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relation between tubal ligation, change in menstrual cycle characteristics, and early follicular phase hormones.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of women 36–44 years of age.

Setting

The greater Boston area.

Patient(S)

Nine hundred seventy-six premenopausal women with intact uteri.

Intervention(S)

A comparison of women with and without a history of tubal ligation.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Menstrual and reproductive histories were self-reported. Early follicular phase blood samples were obtained to assess FSH, LH, and E(2). We compared menstrual cycle changes from the first 5 years after menarche with completion of the baseline questionnaire in women with and without a prior history of tubal ligation.

Result(S)

Cycle length, cycle regularity, menses length, flow volume, dysmenorrhea, and hormone levels were similar in women with and without a history of tubal ligation. However, among parous women with a history of cesarean section, those with a tubal ligation > 5 years ago experienced a marginal increase in volume of menstrual flow compared with women with no tubal ligation history.

Conclusion(S)

We found no significant change in menstrual cycle characteristics or hormone levels in women with or without a history of tubal ligation. However, tubal ligation may have a modest effect on the change in menstrual flow volume over time among parous women with a history of cesarean section.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^114GReYw]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive analysis so far of the association between tubal ligation and subsequent risk of cancer. We found that tubal ligation was significantly associated with reduced risks of ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers, and an increased risk of anal cancer, but was not associated with breast, endometrial or cervical cancer, as had been suggested by others.

The reduction in ovarian cancer risk has been reported by others. We previously reported significant heterogeneity by histological type of ovarian cancer, finding that tubal ligation was associated with a modest reduction of serous tumours overall (RR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77–0.92), and about a 20% reduction in risk of high-grade serous carcinoma, and almost a halving of risk of endometrioid and clear cell ovarian tumours. These findings are consistent with hypotheses regarding possible different origins of the ovarian cancer histotypes, and that many cases of high-grade serous ovarian cancer may arise from precursor lesions within the fallopian tubes, while some endometrioid and clear cell tumours may develop from endometriosis. Although the precise mechanism by which tubal ligation reduces the risk of ovarian cancer is unclear, part of the explanation could be that it acts as a physical barrier to pro-cancerous substances passing through the fallopian tubes to the ovaries (whether endometriosis, fallopian tube epithelial cells, infectious agents, or exogenous carcinogens).

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^113AEafw]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Tubal ligation (female sterilisation) is known to be associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Reports of associations with other cancers have varied. In particular, several investigators have described associations with breast, endometrial, cervical and anal cancers. We report here the associations between tubal ligation and risk of 26 site-specific cancers in a large cohort of UK women.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^112i5Hho]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background:

Tubal ligation is known to be associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer risk. Associations with breast, endometrial and cervical cancers have been suggested. We investigated associations for 26 site-specific cancers in a large UK cohort.

Methods:

Study participants completed a questionnaire on reproductive and lifestyle factors in 1996–2001, and were followed for cancer and death via national registries. Using Cox regression models, we estimated adjusted relative risks (RRs) for 26 site-specific cancers among women with vs without tubal ligation.

Results:

In 1 278 783 women without previous cancer, 167 430 incident cancers accrued during 13.8 years' follow-up. Significantly reduced risks were found in women with tubal ligation for cancers of the ovary (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76–0.85; P < 0.001; n = 8035), peritoneum (RR = 0.81, 0.66–0.98; P = 0.03; n = 730), and fallopian tube (RR = 0.60, 0.37–0.96; P = 0.04; n = 168). No significant associations were found for endometrial, breast, or cervical cancers.

Conclusions:

The reduced risks of ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are consistent with hypotheses of a common origin for many tumours at these sites, and with the suggestion that tubal ligation blocks cells, carcinogens or other agents from reaching the ovary, fallopian tubes and peritoneal cavity.

### Risk factors for hot flashes in midlife women [^115XFA9Q]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the scientific literature pertaining to potential risk factors for hot flashes in midlife women.

Methods

Scientific publications reporting on risk factors for hot flashes were identified through a systematic Medline search and are summarized in this review paper.

Results

Although few studies have investigated risk factors for hot flashes in midlife women, consistent evidence suggests that smoking is associated with an increased risk for hot flashes. In addition, some studies suggest that other factors, such as hormone levels, body size, tubal ligation, surgical menopause, and race/ethnicity, may be associated with the occurrence of hot flashes.

Conclusions

Future studies are needed to confirm previous findings and to identify additional risk factors for hot flashes. Such studies will increase our understanding of the etiology of hot flashes and may lead to better treatments and preventive measures for this condition.

### Nongenetic screening of ovarian malignancies [^113tm4Fs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the leading pelvic reproductive organ cancer health hazard for American women. Seventy percent of women are not diagnosed until the disease is in an advanced stage because of a lack of early warning signals and effective early detection techniques. Understanding the risk factors for sporadic ovarian cancer and the recently recognized inherited susceptibility for ovarian cancer associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations may allow physicians to identify women who might benefit from prophylactic oophorectomy. Current early detection techniques, including serum CA-125 levels and endovaginal ultrasound studies, are of limited value. Strategies to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women with increased risk include the use of oral contraceptives and tubal ligations in addition to prophylactic oophorectomy.

### The epidemiology of endometrial and ovarian cancer [^117SgWhS]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This review highlights similarities in the epidemiology of endometrial and ovarian cancer, including highly correlated incidence rates and similar risk factor profiles. Factors that decrease risk for both cancers include a late menarche, early age at first birth, giving birth and breastfeeding, and use of oral contraceptives. Short or irregular cycles and late menopause are associated with increased risk for both. Other risk factors that appear to operate in a similar direction include decreased risk associated with IUD use or a tubal ligation, and increased risk associated with obesity, lack of exercise, and use of talc powders in genital hygiene. Estrogen excess is proposed as the underlying mechanism for most endometrial cancers, whereas incessant ovulation has been suggested as the explanation for ovarian cancer. However, an increased number of estimated ovulatory cycles correlates directly with risk for both endometrial and ovarian cancer, suggesting that reproductive tissue turnover with an accumulation of PTEN or p53 mutations represents a possible common mechanism. An immune-based explanation involving mucin proteins represents another common mechanism that could explain additional risk factors. Maintenance of ideal weight, breastfeeding children, use of oral contraceptives, and avoidance of talc powders in genital hygiene are measures that could lower the risk for both types of cancer. Careful selection of patients for prophylactic oophorectomy for those women who are coming to hysterectomy for benign disease is an additional measure to consider for ovarian cancer.

### Examining indicators of early menopause following opportunistic salpingectomy: a cohort study from British columbia, Canada [^111RDNaj]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The fallopian tube may often be the site of origin for the most common and lethal form of ovarian cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer. As a result, many colleges of obstetrics and gynecology, which include the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, are recommending surgical removal of the fallopian tube (bilateral salpingectomy) at the time of other gynecologic surgeries (particularly hysterectomy and tubal sterilization) in women at general population risk for ovarian cancer, collectively referred to as opportunistic salpingectomy. Previous research has illustrated no increased risk of complications after opportunistic salpingectomy. However, most studies that have examined potential hormonal consequences of opportunistic salpingectomy have had limited follow-up time and have focused on surrogate hormonal markers.

Objective

We examine whether there are differences in physician visits for menopause and filling a prescription for hormone replacement therapy among women who undergo opportunistic salpingectomy in the population of British Columbia, Canada.

Study Design

We identified all women who were ≤ 50 years old in British Columbia who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy from 2008–2014. We compared women who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy at hysterectomy with women who underwent hysterectomy alone and women who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy for sterilization with women who underwent tubal ligation. We used Cox Proportional hazards models to model time to physician visits for menopause and for filling a prescription for hormone replacement therapy. We calculated adjusted hazards ratios for these outcomes and adjusted for other gynecologic conditions, surgical approach, and patient age. We performed an age-stratified analysis (< 40, 40–44, 45–49 years) and conducted a sensitivity analysis that included only women with ≥ 5 years of follow up.

Results

We included 41,413 women in the study. There were 6861 women who underwent hysterectomy alone, 6500 who underwent hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy, 4479 who underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 18,621 who underwent tubal ligation, and 4952 who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy for sterilization. In women who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy, there was no difference in time to the first physician visit related to menopause for both women who underwent hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.09) and women who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy for sterilization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–1.10). There was also no difference in time to filling a prescription for hormone replacement therapy for women who underwent hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy or opportunistic salpingectomy for sterilization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.92; and adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.12; respectively). In contrast, we report significantly increase hazards for time to physician visit for menopause (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.78, 2.13) and filling a prescription for hormone replacement therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.80; 95% confidence interval, 3.45, 4.18) among women who underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. There were no increased hazards for physician visits for menopause or initiation of hormone replacement therapy among women who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy in any of the age-stratified analyses, nor among women with at least 5 years of follow up.

Conclusion

Our results reveal no indication of an earlier age of onset of menopause among the population of women who underwent hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy and opportunistic salpingectomy for sterilization as measured by physician visits for menopause and initiation of hormone replacement therapy. Our findings are reassuring, given that earlier age at menopause is associated with increased mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular disease.

### Reproductive and hormonal factors in relation to survival and platinum resistance among ovarian cancer cases [^111v7jXN]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Overall survival

Pre-diagnostic parity and tubal ligation were significantly positively associated with overall survival before adjusting for tumour characteristics; however, after adjustment for tumour histology in particular, the associations were substantially attenuated (Table 2). Further, pre-diagnostic induced abortion was not significantly associated with survival, but women with at least one miscarriage had a 17% (95% CI: 1.00–1.36) increased risk of death compared with women who never reported a miscarriage. In the fully adjusted analyses, increasing age at menarche was associated with an increased risk of death with a HR of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.06–1.44) for an age at menarche of 13 years vs < 13 years. In addition, women who were older than 50 years at natural menopause before diagnosis had a 23% (95% CI: 1.03–1.46) increased risk of death compared with women who were 50 years or younger at menopause. There was a significant relationship between menstrual cycle irregularity and overall survival (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.54–0.99). Women who reported ever having pre-diagnostic endometriosis were 29% (95% CI: 0.54–0.94) less likely to die after their ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with women without endometriosis. Although pre-diagnostic postmenopausal use of HT was not associated with overall death (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73–1.08), longer duration of HT use was associated with a decreased risk of death (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.55–0.90 for > 5 years vs never). No significant associations were observed for pre-diagnostic breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, or ovulatory years as well as age at first and last birth and IUD use with overall survival (data not shown).

### Tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral oophorectomy, and risk of ovarian cancer in the nurses' health studies [^112n4eUX]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively examine whether the association between tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral oophorectomy, and ovarian cancer varied by patient, tumor, and surgical characteristics.

Design

Two prospective cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II).

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

A cohort of 121,700 married US female nurses, aged 30–55 years at baseline and another cohort of 116,430 US female nurses aged 25–42 years at baseline.

Intervention(S)

We obtained data on gynecologic surgeries and ovarian cancer incidence through biennial questionnaires. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for known and suspected ovarian cancer risk factors.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Confirmed incident epithelial ovarian cancer.

Result(S)

Overall, tubal ligation was associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer (HR, 0.76; 95% CI 0.64–0.90). The inverse association was stronger for nonserous tumors (HR, 0.57; 95% CI 0.40–0.82) and among women younger than 35 years at surgery (HR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.49–0.90). Hysterectomy was associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer (HR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.66–0.97) and was somewhat stronger for nonserous tumors (HR, 0.70; 95% CI 0.49–1.02). Unilateral oophorectomy was associated with a 30% lower risk (HR, 0.70; 95% CI 0.53–0.91), which did not differ by histologic subtype.

Conclusion(S)

Our study provides further support that tubal ligation reduces the risk of ovarian cancer, particularly for nonserous tumors and when conducted before the age of 35 years. The inverse association with hysterectomy, along with the stronger associations for nonserous tumors, supports shared biologic mechanisms for tubal ligation and hysterectomy.

### Outcomes from opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer prevention [^1163ACXV]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 70% of sporadic and nearly all ovarian cancers in BRCA variant carriers are high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs), which is the most lethal of the 5 main histotypes and has a 5-year survival rate less than 50%. Although the general population lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1.4%, individuals with an inherited germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant have average cumulative risks of 40% to 75% and 8% to 34%, respectively. In BRCA 1/2 variant carriers, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended, which reduces the risk of ovarian or fallopian tube cancers by 80%. Removal of the ovaries is not recommended for the general population because it is associated with increased total mortality, coronary heart disease, and osteoporosis. Thus, a different preventive strategy is needed for individuals at average risk, who account for 80% of cases of HGSCs.

The recent understanding that HGSC often originates in the fallopian tube, has led to a primary prevention opportunity for the general population — namely, opportunistic salpingectomy (OS). OS collectively refers to the removal of the fallopian tubes at the time of hysterectomy or instead of tubal ligation, while leaving the ovaries intact. In 2010, the British Columbia (BC) ovarian cancer research team launched a province-wide strategy asking gynecologists to discuss OS with their patients as an ovarian cancer prevention strategy. The same recommendation has since been made in many countries, including Canada, the US, and the UK for individuals without identified genetic factors associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer. Research has shown that OS is safe, both in terms of perioperative adverse eventsand minor complications, there are no indications of an earlier age of onset of menopause following OS, and it is cost-effective.

### Risk of ovarian cancer after salpingectomy and tubal ligation: prospects on histology and time since the procedure [^117DXsrv]. Gynecologic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent theories propose that most epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), depending on histological type, originate from other gynecological tissues and involve the ovary secondarily. According to these theories, any protective effect of salpingectomy and tubal ligation may vary by histological type. The study aim was to examine the association between salpingectomy and tubal ligation, respectively, and risk of EOC, with a focus on associations specific for histological types.

Methods

We identified EOC cases and matching controls in national registries and gathered information on surgical procedures and potential confounders. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of EOC related to salpingectomy and tubal ligation, respectively, overall and stratified by histological type. Furthermore, we investigated the association according to timing of the procedures.

Results

Our study comprised 16,822 EOC cases. Each case was matched with 40 controls. There was an overall EOC risk reduction after unilateral (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60–0.87) and bilateral salpingectomy (OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.31–0.67). A slight risk reduction was seen among women with previous tubal ligation (OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83–0.99). For salpingectomy, the risk reduction increased with increasing time since the surgical procedure and was only present among women younger than 50 years at salpingectomy. Unilateral and bilateral salpingectomy was associated with a risk reduction for most histological types.

Conclusion

The association between previous salpingectomy and reduced risk of several histological subtypes of EOC supports the suggested theories about the site of origin of EOC and may be of clinical importance.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^116cdbV4]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Few other studies have reported on the association between tubal ligation and risk of peritoneal cancer, and they have tended to be limited by small numbers of cases. Our study included 730 cases of peritoneal cancer; two retrospective studies have reported their findings — one study including 62 cases found no association; and another including 22 cases reported a reduced risk.

We believe that this is the first study to report that tubal ligation is associated with a significant reduction in risk of fallopian tube cancer.

Our finding that tubal ligation is associated with a reduction in risk of ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers perhaps reflects their histological and clinical similarity, and possible similar site of origin. The majority of the peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers with specified histology were serous carcinomas, which is also the most common histotype of ovarian cancer. There is increasing evidence from histological, molecular and genetics studies that many high-grade serous carcinomas found in the ovary or peritoneum may have originated from precursor lesions in the fallopian tube (reviewed in).

As the majority of the putative precursor lesions for high-grade serous cancers are found within the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, adjacent to the ovary, it is perhaps surprising that tubal ligation (which normally involves surgery to the mid-portion of the tube) should reduce the risk of such tumours. It may be that, historically, some surgical sterilisation procedures involved cutting and removing a portion of the fallopian tube, rather than simply clipping the tube (as is now more common). Alternatively, it may be that surgery causes local vascular changes with consequent effects on the tubal epithelium. One of the limitations of our study is that we do not have information on the type of surgical procedure performed, and thus are unable to explore possible differences in association between different surgical techniques.

### A prospective study of postmenopausal hormone use and ovarian cancer risk [^115zq4uD]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

In analyses restricted to women exclusively using one hormone formulation, unopposed estrogen use of five or more years was associated with an increased risk compared with never use (RR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.41–2.97), whereas estrogen plus progestin use of five or more years was not (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.47–1.83) (Table 5). However, there were only ten cases among estrogen plus progestin users of ⩾5 years. Results were similar for unopposed estrogen use among women reporting a hysterectomy and estrogen plus progestin use among women with intact uteri (data not shown).

Time since last use was not significantly associated with risk. Neither users who quit within the previous three years (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.71–1.53) nor those who stopped over three years ago (RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.60–1.22) were at a significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer. Based on the significant association observed with duration, a recency effect would most likely be seen primarily among long-term users. Although limited by small numbers, when we examined the effects of recency and duration together, point estimates suggested an increase in risk among users of five or more years that decreased over time (RR = 1.62 among the most recent quitters and RR = 1.35 among those who quit over 3 years ago, with 17 and 11 cases respectively).

No substantial differences were observed when stratifying on BMI (< 25, 25–29, ⩾30 kg m⁻²) or an intact reproductive system (i.e. no prior hysterectomy or tubal ligation) (data not shown). Results were also similar among women reporting natural menopause, although the association with unopposed estrogen use was slightly stronger (RR = 1.40 for a 5-year increment of use, 95% CI 1.09–1.80).

### Ovarian cancer risk factors by histologic subtype: an analysis from the ovarian cancer cohort consortium [^112JPLuS]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

An understanding of the etiologic heterogeneity of ovarian cancer is important for improving prevention, early detection, and therapeutic approaches. We evaluated 14 hormonal, reproductive, and lifestyle factors by histologic subtype in the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium (OC3).

Patients and Methods

Among 1.3 million women from 21 studies, 5,584 invasive epithelial ovarian cancers were identified (3,378 serous, 606 endometrioid, 331 mucinous, 269 clear cell, 1,000 other). By using competing-risks Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by study and birth year and adjusted for age, parity, and oral contraceptive use, we assessed associations for all invasive cancers by histology. Heterogeneity was evaluated by likelihood ratio test.

Results

Most risk factors exhibited significant heterogeneity by histology. Higher parity was most strongly associated with endometrioid (relative risk [RR] per birth, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.83) and clear cell (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.76) carcinomas (P value for heterogeneity [P-het] < .001). Similarly, age at menopause, endometriosis, and tubal ligation were only associated with endometrioid and clear cell tumors (P-het ≤ .01). Family history of breast cancer (P-het = .008) had modest heterogeneity. Smoking was associated with an increased risk of mucinous (RR per 20 pack-years, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.46) but a decreased risk of clear cell (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.94) tumors (P-het = .004). Unsupervised clustering by risk factors separated endometrioid, clear cell, and low-grade serous carcinomas from high-grade serous and mucinous carcinomas.

Conclusion

The heterogeneous associations of risk factors with ovarian cancer subtypes emphasize the importance of conducting etiologic studies by ovarian cancer subtypes. Most established risk factors were more strongly associated with nonserous carcinomas, which demonstrate challenges for risk prediction of serous cancers, the most fatal subtype.

### Modifiers of cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111hCNNw]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is substantial variability in cancer risk in women who have inherited a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation. Numerous factors have been hypothesized to modify these risks, but studies are of variable quality, and it remains unclear which of these may be of value in clinical risk assessment.

Methods

PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for articles published through September 2013. Fixed effects meta-analysis was done using the hazard ratios and/or odds ratios to estimate the pooled effect estimates (ES) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify factors that are associated with cancer risk modification in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

Results

We identified 44 nonoverlapping studies that met predefined quality criteria. Sufficient evidence is available to make clinically relevant inferences about a number of cancer risk modifiers. The only variable examined that produced a probable association was late age at first live birth, a meta-analysis showed a decrease in the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers with women aged 30 years or older vs. women younger than 30 years (ES = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.99). The same was shown for women aged 25 to 29 years versus those aged less than 25 years (ES = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.99). Breastfeeding and tubal ligation were associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers; oral contraceptives were associated with reduced risk among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Smoking was associated with increased breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers only.

Conclusions

Data assessing many potential risk modifiers are inadequate, and many have not been externally validated. Although additional studies are required to confirm some associations, sufficient information is available for some risk factors to be used in risk counseling or lifestyle modification to minimize cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers

### Cancer risk-reducing opportunities in gynecologic surgery [^113rJYgw]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

This review article discusses cancer risk-reducing opportunities in gynecologic surgery. We cover strategies to reduce ovarian and uterine cancer risk by presenting general practice guidelines and expanding on the literature behind clinical decision points. We address populations of women at increased hereditary risk and those at population risk. We specifically discuss risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, prophylactic salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy, concomitant hysterectomy, opportunistic salpingectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, and hysterectomy. For clinical scenarios in which data are limited or conflicting, we detail the studies on which clinicians' decisions hinge to allow the reader to weigh the available evidence.

### Race, class, caste, disability, sterilisation and hysterectomy [^1155v7ic]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Tubal ligation and hysterectomy may also be more entwined than is commonly realised, since gynaecological and epidemiological research throughout the 1980s and 1990s found that having previously had tubal ligation increases a woman's later risk of hysterectomy — but why?. In fact, the first observations about this effect occurred in the USA in the 1950s, where it was one of the reasons why some researchers insisted on hysterectomy as a sterilisation procedure, since so many women who received tubal ligation would end up having hysterectomies anyway. Studies conducted in the 1980s suggesting a 'post-tubal ligation syndrome' affecting some women due to disruptions of ovarian nerve and blood supply were criticised in their own time for failure to exclude pre-existing gynaecological conditions, comorbidities and contraceptive pill use in the study cohorts. The recurring correlation between tubal ligation and later hysterectomy has continued to baffle gynaecology researchers who dismiss consideration of potential iatrogenic problems caused directly by tubal procedures because several long-term studies have indicated there are no statistically significant differences in the menstrual disorders of women who have received tubal ligation compared with those that have not. But a credible explanation for the persistent increased hysterectomy rate among this group of women is wanting. Meanwhile, other studies indicating postligation symptoms in many women, including increased menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain and menopausal symptoms have continued to appear, including the ethnographic reports described by Johanna Schoen which have identified widespread perception among patients of iatrogenic symptoms associated with their tubal ligation (;, 29–42). Some researchers have acknowledged that the variability of results in different populations may be a product of different forms of tubal ligation surgeries used, with some being more problematic than others. The correlation has been found too in the recent scholarship on India's hysterectomy epidemic. Andhra Pradesh has both India's highest rates of female sterilisation and the highest rates of hysterectomy, while national data indicate sterilised women are actually less likely to receive hysterectomy than non-sterilised women (, 74;). Here it seems hysterectomy is not clearly being used as a sterilisation method itself, since many women being prescribed hysterectomies, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, have already been sterilised. Rather, the radical surgery remains still entangled with such practices in a novel private-health-insurance context which incentivises the financial exploitation of socially disadvantaged women.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^117Sx3pP]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

For endometrial cancer, a reduced risk associated with tubal ligation was reported in a Danish cohort, but we and others have not replicated this association. One group of investigators reported that tubal ligation was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer, but again, neither other findings nor ours replicated this.

Reports of the relationship between tubal ligation and breast cancer risk have been varied, including suggestions of either a reduced or increased risk, although the majority of studies reported no significant association, consistent with our findings.

We have previously reported in detail on the risk factors for anal cancer in the Million Women Study; factors associated with an increased risk of anal cancer included tubal ligation, nulliparity, smoking, past use of the oral contraceptive pill, and not living with a partner. The strongest association was with a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (RR = 4.03, 95% CI: 2.59–6.28), reflecting the importance of high-risk strains of human papilloma virus as causative agents of both cervical and anal cancers. It is unclear why tubal ligation should be associated with an increased risk of anal cancer, and it may be that this apparent association reflects confounding by sexual behaviour and exposure to human papilloma virus. For example, as tubal ligation is usually performed for permanent contraception, it is likely to be more common among women who are sexually active, and who thus may be more likely to be exposed to sexually-transmitted infections, such as human papilloma virus, and the consequent increased risk of anal cancer.

### Nitrogen-based bisphosphonate use and ovarian cancer risk in women aged 50 years and older [^112qHXQZ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Medium credibility.

We found that raloxifene, which may be an estrogen antagonist in ovarian cancer cells, was associated with a non-statistically significant reduced risk of EOC. The effects of raloxifene have been studied in several randomized controlled trials of postmenopausal women, and a meta-analysis showed a non-statistically significant 50% lower risk of ovarian cancer in the raloxifene treatment group. Studies including larger numbers of women who have used raloxifene are required to confirm this association.

Our large study had several strengths. We included 9367 women with ovarian cancer, and we could therefore separately investigate the associations by EOC histotype. We used objective health records to measure medicine use rather than rely on self-report. Our use of linkage to cancer and death records meant that we had complete outcomes for the Australian population, and therefore, our results are generalizable to Australian women aged older than 50 years.

A limitation of our study was that we did not have full population data on potential confounders such as obesity, parity, MHT, and early menopause. However, our sensitivity analyses exploring the likely impact of adjusting for these variables suggested that our conclusions would not have changed. Although we did not separate types of MHT, the risk of EOC has been found to not differ materially between estrogen-only and combined preparations. We did not have hospital records for all women, so we could not exclude all those who had a BSO and were therefore no longer at risk of ovarian cancer. However, our analyses restricted to Western Australian women (approximately 10% of the Australian population), for whom we had this information, excluding those with a BSO did not materially change the results. It is possible there is residual confounding by other unmeasured factors. However, most other established ovarian cancer risk or protective factors (family history, oral contraceptive pill use, tubal ligation) do not have strong links to bisphosphonate use, therefore they are unlikely to be strong enough confounders to explain the association. We were unable to separate low-grade and high-grade serous carcinoma. Given that these have been shown to have different etiologies, this may have affected the magnitude of our estimate and our dose-response calculations.

### Tubal ligation and risk of ovarian cancer in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations: a case-control study [^112ZMxSM]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

In several case-control and prospective studies, tubal ligation has been associated with a decreased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. We aimed to assess the potential of tubal ligation in reducing the risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry predisposing mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

Methods

We did a matched case-control study among women from Canada, the USA, and the UK who had undergone genetic testing and who carried a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Cases were 232 women with a history of invasive ovarian cancer, and controls were 232 women without ovarian cancer, and who had both ovaries intact. Cases and controls were matched for year of birth, country of residence, and mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2). The odds ratio for developing ovarian cancer was estimated for tubal ligation, adjusting for oral contraceptive use, parity, history of breast cancer, and ethnic group.

Findings

In an unadjusted analysis among BRCA1 carriers, significantly fewer cases than controls had ever had tubal ligation (30 of 173 [18%] vs 60 of 173 [35%], odds ratio 0.37 [95% CI 0.21–0.63]; p = 0.0003). After adjustment for oral contraceptive use, parity, history of breast cancer and ethnic group, the odds ratio was 0.39 (p = 0.002). Combination of tubal ligation and past use of an oral contraceptive was associated with an odds ratio of 0.28 (0.15–0.52). No protective effect of tubal ligation was seen among carriers of the BRCA2 mutation.

Interpretation

Tubal ligation is a feasible option to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women with BRCA1 mutations who have completed childbearing.

### Combined bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and cesarean delivery in BRCA1 / 2 alteration carriers: a case series [^1125a88j]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

With growing evidence that the fallopian tubes are the origin of the majority of high-grade serous ovarian cancers, risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy has been suggested as a two-stage alternative to RRSO. The fallopian tubes are removed on completion of childbearing, and the ovaries are subsequently removed around the age of natural menopause (51 years). This has the advantage of offering some level of protection from ovarian cancer while potentially avoiding the sequelae of early menopause and the need for HT. Risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy is currently being offered in ongoing clinical trials. Until evidence regarding the safety of risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy is confirmed, it is recommended that it be offered only as part of a clinical trial. However, BRCA carriers requesting sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery should be offered full salpingectomy rather than partial bilateral salpingectomy or tubal ligation. Video 1 shows salpingectomy at the time of cesarean delivery.

In conclusion RRSO can be performed at the time of planned obstetric-indicated cesarean delivery. This approach can be offered to appropriately counseled individuals.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 774: opportunistic salpingectomy as a strategy for epithelial ovarian cancer prevention [^116LncBL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Opportunistic salpingectomy may offer obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers the opportunity to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer in their patients who are already undergoing pelvic surgery for benign disease. By performing salpingectomy when patients undergo an operation during which the fallopian tubes could be removed in addition to the primary surgical procedure (eg, hysterectomy), the risk of ovarian cancer is reduced. Although opportunistic salpingectomy offers the opportunity to significantly decrease the risk of ovarian cancer, it does not eliminate the risk of ovarian cancer entirely. Counseling women who are undergoing routine pelvic surgery about the risks and benefits of salpingectomy should include an informed consent discussion about the role of oophorectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy that causes surgical menopause reduces the risk of ovarian cancer but may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer other than ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality. Salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy or as a means of tubal sterilization appears to be safe and does not increase the risk of complications such as blood transfusions, readmissions, postoperative complications, infections, or fever compared with hysterectomy alone or tubal ligation. The risks and benefits of salpingectomy should be discussed with patients who desire permanent sterilization. Additionally, ovarian function does not appear to be affected by salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy based on surrogate serum markers or response to in vitro fertilization. Plans to perform an opportunistic salpingectomy should not alter the intended route of hysterectomy. Obstetrician-gynecologists should continue to observe and practice minimally invasive techniques. This Committee Opinion has been updated to include new information on the benefit of salpingectomy for cancer reduction, the feasibility of salpingectomy during vaginal hysterectomy, and long-term follow-up of women after salpingectomy.

### Consent-GPT: is it ethical to delegate procedural consent to conversational AI? [^113nX5ri]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

What is tubal ligation?

Tubal ligation, often referred to as 'getting your tubes tied', is a surgical procedure performed for the purpose of permanent female sterilisation. During the procedure, your fallopian tubes are either blocked, tied, or cut to prevent the eggs from reaching the uterus for fertilisation with sperm.

Why tubal ligation?

As you already have three children, you may choose tubal ligation if you are certain that you don't want to have more children in the future. It is a permanent form of birth control and is quite effective, with a less than 1% failure rate.

What does the procedure involve?

Tubal ligation is usually performed as a laparoscopic surgery. It involves making a small incision in your abdomen through which a thin, flexible instrument called a laparoscope is inserted. Your fallopian tubes are then accessed and blocked, tied or cut.

Risks of the procedure

Although tubal ligation is a low-risk procedure, especially for someone with no past medical history like you, it is important to be aware of potential complications, which may include:

Reaction to anaesthesia.
Infection.
Bleeding.
Damage to surrounding organs.
Failure leading to an unintended pregnancy.
Posttubal ligation syndrome (though it is controversial and not recognised by all healthcare providers).

Effect on menstruation and hormone levels

Tubal ligation won't affect your menstrual cycle or hormone levels. It doesn't induce menopause or alter the production of female hormones.

Alternatives

There are other forms of permanent birth control such as male sterilisation (vasectomy) and non-permanent ones like hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices and barrier methods. It is important to discuss these options with your healthcare provider.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 774: opportunistic salpingectomy as a strategy for epithelial ovarian cancer prevention [^114iJVVZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 774 — Population scope and practice guidance specify that this Committee Opinion addresses women at population risk undergoing routine pelvic surgery for benign disease, and that for women at population risk of ovarian cancer, salpingectomy should be considered (after completion of childbearing) at the time of hysterectomy, in lieu of tubal ligation, and also at the time of other pelvic surgery.

### Salpingectomy and the risk of ovarian cancer in Ontario [^112rHrWc]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found an increase in the rates of salpingectomy over time, with a corresponding decrease in the rates of tubal ligation, among women in Ontario. Although the primary analysis was not sufficiently powered, the level of risk reduction with salpingectomy was similar to that observed with tubal ligation. This finding suggests that if removal of healthy fallopian tubes truly reduces the risk of ovarian cancer, future studies (with additional years of follow-up) should reveal a significant and clinically meaningful decrease in cases. However, the current study found no significant decrease in ovarian cancer rates in Ontario despite the increase in salpingectomy between 2003 and 2021. Given the rarity of this disease, additional follow-up is needed to reevaluate the potential association in an aging cohort. The increasing uptake of salpingectomy may offer an opportunity to prevent a proportion of cancers putatively arising from the fallopian tube and impact the mortality rates associated with a disease with a poor outcome.

### Advances in ovarian cancer research-NCI… [^113Kuags]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevention of Ovarian Cancer Women who carry harmful or potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes in these women is the recommended treatment method and can reduce their lifetime risk of getting ovarian cancer by 95%. However, having this surgery causes immediate menopause. This may cause health problems if it is much earlier than naturally occurring menopause. This would allow women to maintain premenopausal levels of hormones produced by the ovaries and delay many of the complications associated with menopause. Removal of fallopian tubes in people seeking to prevent pregnancy. The discovery that epithelial ovarian cancers most often start in the fallopian tubes has also led to changes in the way some gynecologists approach surgery to prevent pregnancy.

Women seeking tubal ligation to prevent pregnancy may be offered the option of having their tubes removed instead. Doing so might reduce the possibility of ovarian cancer in the future. Removal of fallopian tubes in people undergoing a hysterectomy. Similarly, some gynecologists recommend that their patients who are undergoing a hysterectomy also have their fallopian tubes removed. Clinical trials have shown that using PARP inhibitors as long-term therapy in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer delayed progression of the cancer. A different targeted therapy, mirvetuximab soravtansine, is now available to treat women with ovarian cancer that is no longer responding to platinum drugs. FDA recently approved the drug to treat people with platinum-resistant ovarian tumors that produce an excess of a protein called FR-α.

Results from a large clinical trial showed that people with this type of ovarian cancer treated with mirvetuximab lived longer overall than people treated with standard chemotherapy. Secondary Surgery For women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer that has come back after being in remission, clinical trials have studied the use of secondary surgery or surgery to remove more tumor after the initial surgery with varying results.
- In a third trial, conducted in Europe, researchers identified people with recurrent ovarian cancer who were most likely to benefit from surgery. They found that women who had secondary surgery followed by chemotherapy lived an average of nearly 8 months longer than women who only received chemotherapy. In the Chinese and European trials, and in an analysis of 64 clinical trials and other studies, the benefits of secondary surgery were observed only in women who had all of their visible cancer removed.

### Validation of the BOADICEA model for epithelial tubo-ovarian cancer risk prediction in UK biobank [^114BZE3T]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epithelial tubo-ovarian cancer (EOC) is the seventh most common cancer and the eighth leading cause of death from cancer in women globally. The 5-year survival rate drops dramatically as the stage of diagnosis advances, from 95% in Stage 1 to 15% in Stage 4. Over 75% of EOC are diagnosed at an advanced stage, due to a lack of symptoms at the early stage of the disease. Although population-based screening with CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasonography has limited efficacy, prevention options such as risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy can reduce the EOC risks but associated with adverse effects. Cancer risk prediction models have the potential to identify women at high risk who are most likely to benefit from such interventions.

The multifactorial Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence Algorithm (BOADICEA), implemented in the CanRisk web tool, incorporates the simultaneous effects of genetic risk factors including rare pathogenic variants (PVs), common genetic variants summarised as a polygenic risk score (PRS), pedigree-structured family history of breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancer, a residual polygenic component to account for the unexplained familial aggregation and established questionnaire-based risk factors (QRFs). It also includes demographic factors including age, year of birth and country of residence in risk prediction. There are two variants of BOADICEA which have been optimised to model separately the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. For EOC, BOADICEA incorporates PVs in six susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1 and PALB2 and a 36-SNP PRS. The QRFs include height, body mass index (BMI), parity, use of oral contraceptive and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), endometriosis, and tubal ligation.

One study previously assessed an earlier version of BOADICEA for predicting EOC, using data from a relatively small sample of 1961 women (374 incident EOCs) from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS). The study assessed only the 5-year EOC predicted risks, no information was available on the PVs in the six EOC susceptibility genes and the PRS used was limited to a subset of 15 SNPs. Here, we evaluate for the first time the full multifactorial BOADICEA model in predicting the 10-year EOC risk prediction in the UK Biobank cohort of 199,429 women.

### Sexually transmitted infections and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer: results from the nurses' health studies [^113Zid2j]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

CT and HPV combination not evaluated, 0 cases and 3 controls positive for both infections

CI confidence interval, EOC epithelial ovarian cancer, NHS Nurses' Health Study, RR relative risk

a Conditional logistic regression models for all cases; all other results are from unconditional logistic regression models additionally controlling for matching factors (year of birth (± 1 year), menopausal status at diagnosis (premenopausal, postmenopausal, unknown), and factors at one or both blood draws: menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal, unknown), month of collection (± 1 month), time of day (± 2 h), fasting status (> 8, ≤ 8 h), and postmenopausal hormone use (yes/no). Premenopausal NHSII cases and controls additionally matched on luteal day at blood collection (date of next menstrual cycle minus date of blood draw, ± 1 day)). All adjusted models adjusted for: parity (nulliparous, 1 pregnancy, 2 pregnancies, 3 pregnancies, 4 + pregnancies), oral contraceptive use (never, < 1 year, 1–5 years, 5+ years), tubal ligation (yes, no), marital status (never, married/domestic partnership/living with partner, divorced/separated, widowed), and weight change between ages 18 years and blood collection (kg, continuous)

Associations excluding women with a tubal ligation were generally similar (e.g. C. trachomatis, RR: 1.94 [1.17–3.21]; Table S2). Associations were similar in analyses restricted to parous women, with the exception of a significant positive association observed between M. genitalium and ovarian cancer risk (RR: 3.40 [1.25–9.27]). We observed no significant differences in the associations by menopausal status at blood collection or diagnosis, age at blood collection, or ever OC use. Further, the associations did not differ significantly for rapidly fatal and less aggressive disease (p ≥ 0.18).

### Salpingectomy and the risk of ovarian cancer in Ontario [^114hamWX]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large population-based cohort study with 7 years of follow-up, salpingectomy did not confer a statistically significant protective benefit for ovarian cancer compared with no surgical procedure. Our point estimate revealed an 18% nonsignificant reduction in risk in the salpingectomy (with and without hysterectomy) group (HR, 0.82) and a similar level of nonsignificant risk reduction with the inclusion of a hysterectomy comparator group (HR, 0.87). When limited to patients with a documented bilateral salpingectomy, the protective benefit was greater (HR, 0.55) despite a follow-up period of only 5.2 years, although the result was not significant. Tubal ligation, which is a bilateral procedure, was associated with a significant 23% reduction in risk (HR, 0.77); however, the follow-up period among women who received tubal ligation was substantially longer (mean, 12.5 years), and the number of women in the tubal ligation group was considerably larger (141 698 women vs 25 409 in the bilateral salpingectomy group).

### Best practices of ASRM and ESHRE: a journey through reproductive medicine [^111r5JZm]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer — the incessant menstruation hypothesis links retrograde menstruation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to carcinogenesis, and epidemiology notes that the number of lifetime menstruations, pelvic endometriosis and IUD use are risk factors, whereas hormonal contraception and tubal ligation are protective; while bilateral salpingoophorectomy reduces ovarian cancer risk, it is associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease. At the present time, a preventative strategy should be the use of hormonal contraception for prolonged periods of time, especially in women with endometriosis, and bilateral salpingectomy may be considered in women not desirous of future pregnancies.

### Association of oral contraceptives and tubal ligation with antimüllerian hormone [^112Prn2n]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oral contraceptives (OCs) and tubal ligation are commonly used methods of contraception that may impact ovarian function. Few studies have examined the association of these factors with antimüllerian hormone (AMH), a marker of ovarian aging.

Methods

We examined the association of OC use and tubal ligation with AMH in the Nurses' Health Study II prospective cohort among a subset of 1,420 premenopausal participants who provided a blood sample in 1996–1999. History of OC use and tubal ligation were reported in 1989 and updated every 2 years until blood collection. We utilized generalized linear models to assess whether mean AMH levels varied by duration of and age at first use of OCs and history, age, and type of tubal ligation.

Results

In multivariable models adjusted for smoking, reproductive events, and other lifestyle factors, we observed a significant, inverse association between duration of OC use and mean AMH levels (P for trend = 0.036). Compared to women without a tubal ligation, AMH levels were significantly lower when the procedure included a clip, ring, or band (1.04ng/ml vs 1.72ng/ml, P < 0.01). AMH levels were not associated with age at first use of OCs or age at tubal ligation.

Conclusions

Our analysis found an association between duration of OC use and certain types of tubal ligation with mean AMH levels. Further research is warranted to confirm the long-term association of these widely used contraceptive methods with AMH.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^113Krfn3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

OS: Salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy or as a means of tubal sterilization appears to be safe and does not increase the risk of complications. OS should not alter the intended route of hysterectomy.

OC use: Appropriate for women with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 if indicated. Use for cancer prophylaxis is reasonable.

Although the feasibility of complete salpingectomy compared with standard postpartum tubal ligation at cesarean delivery has been demonstrated, our review did not find any prospective studies of ovarian cancer risk reduction with opportunistic salpingectomy alone among either women at high risk or those at average population risk. Existing retrospective data support that bilateral salpingectomy is at least comparable, if not superior, to bilateral tubal ligation for reducing ovarian cancer risk. A meta-analysis from 2016 reported a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer in women who underwent bilateral salpingectomy compared with those who did not (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35–0.75).

Our review did not identify data to support salpingectomy alone in women at high risk. Anecdotal evidence of an increase in the number of women at high risk being offered salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy indicates that there is a potential false perception of decreased risk in these patients after salpingectomy, which may ultimately decrease the odds of their timely return for ovary removal. Multiple studies are underway to evaluate the risks and benefits of salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy in women at high risk for ovarian cancer.

Epidemiologic evidence for potentially modifiable risk factors is summarized in the Risk Factor section. Our search found no interventional studies addressing these risk factors and no specific guidance from major professional societies. Given the well-accepted health benefits of contraception, physical activity, and lactation, it is reasonable to counsel patients on the potential secondary benefits of these activities on ovarian cancer risk (Appendix 4, provides a complete evidence summary).

### An epidemiologic risk prediction model for ovarian cancer in Europe: the EPIC study [^111DGVFy]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The age-standardised incidence rate of ovarian cancer in Europe is ∼13 per 100 000, but its high fatality makes it the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in this region. Among European women aged 55–74 years, the 5-year relative survival rate for ovarian cancer overall is 37.1%, which, however, would increase up to 90% if the tumours were detected at the localised stages, implying the importance of early detection in reducing the ovarian cancer mortality rate.

In epidemiological literature, late menopause, early menarche, nulliparity, miscarriage, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), endometriosis, genital powder use, family history of breast/ovarian cancer, body mass index (BMI;), cigarette smoking, and pre-existing diabetes have been reported to increase the ovarian cancer risk, whereas breast-feeding, contraception (oral contraceptives (OCs), intrauterine device (IUD), and tubal ligation), hysterectomy and unilateral ovariectomy, and possibly alcohol drinking have shown protective effects. A risk prediction model based on a selection of these factors could help identify women who reach a minimal risk level to benefit from targeted prevention measures such as cancer screening or use of chemopreventive agents. Recently, have developed an ovarian risk prediction model for US women. Their model included parity, HRT, OC use, and family history of breast/ovarian cancer, and showed a modest discriminatory power (concordance statistic = 0.59) in external validation.

In the present study, we aimed to build an ovarian cancer risk prediction model for women in Western Europe using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), with particular interest in examining whether the discriminatory power could be improved by considering more epidemiological risk factors.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^111Ztw8v]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy testing and endoscopy — pregnancy itself does not contraindicate endoscopy, but pregnancy status may guide planning; testing thresholds depend on context. Although pregnancy is not a contraindication to endoscopic procedures and the use of moderate sedation, there are situations when it is important to be aware of pregnancy status because it may affect procedural aspects such as use of fluoroscopy and choice of sedation agents, and when possible it is advisable to avoid or delay elective endoscopic procedures until after delivery or to take appropriate measures to lessen potential risk if delay is not possible. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) states that "the literature is inadequate to inform patients or physicians on whether anesthesia causes harmful effects on early pregnancy", and β-human chorionic gonadotropin testing before surgery is recommended, but not mandated, by the ASA. Pregnancy testing may be considered in women of childbearing age with an uncertain or suggestive history unless they have had a total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or have had absent menses for 1 year (menopause), and the threshold for pregnancy testing should be lower when fluoroscopy use is planned.

### Epidemiologic factors that predict long-term survival following a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer [^112gWypb]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Assessment of epidemiologic risk factors and covariates

Information on known and suspected ovarian cancer risk factors and demographic information was collected by telephone interview with a standardised-script questionnaire. Specifically, detailed data were obtained for age at menarche, age at menopause, parity, breastfeeding (number of months), oral contraceptives use, oestrogen-containing hormone replacement therapy (HRT), infertility treatment, smoking history, tubal ligation, intrauterine device (IUD) use, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and endometriosis. The cumulative number of ovulatory cycles for each woman was estimated using the following equations: (1) if premenopausal: ovulatory cycles = 12 × (current age−age at menarche−years of oral contraceptive use−(parity × 0.77)−years of breastfeeding); (2) if postmenopausal, current age was replaced with age at menopause (surgical or natural). Participants also reported their current weight and height, height and weight at age 21 years, and weight 5 years before their diagnosis. Body mass index at various ages was calculated in units of kg m⁻² using the reported current height. To avoid the influence of disease status on body weight, we calculated BMI (n = 1316) in units of kg m⁻² using reported current height but weight 5 years in the past. The mean number of months elapsed from date of diagnosis to the date of interview was 22.0 months (range 0.1–79 months).

### Ovarian cancer risk factors in relation to family history [^115GEntm]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer have an increased ovarian cancer risk. Yet it remains uncertain if common ovarian cancer risk factors-especially those that are modifiable-affect this high-risk population similarly to the general population.

Methods

Using the Danish and Swedish nationwide registers, we established 2 nested case-control study populations in women with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer (2138 ovarian cancers, 85240 controls) and women without (10730 ovarian cancers, 429200 controls). The overall and histology-specific associations were assessed with conditional logistic regression. The country-specific estimates were combined based on a fixed-effect assumption.

Results

Multiparity, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, salpingectomy, and oral contraceptive (OC) use were associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer in women with and without a family history, while endometriosis and menopausal hormone therapy were associated with increased risk. Multiparity and OC use presented protective effects across all histologic subtypes except mucinous ovarian cancer, which was not associated with OC use. Menopausal hormone treatment increased the risk of serous ovarian cancer but decreased the risk of the mucinous and clear cell cancers. Endometriosis was especially related to an increased risk of endometrioid and clear cell ovarian cancer.

Conclusion

Factors associated with a decreased ovarian cancer risk were similar between women with and without a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Given the higher baseline risk for women with a family history, special attention should be paid to risk factors like endometriosis and nulliparity in this high-risk population.

### Lifestyle and personal factors associated with having macroscopic residual disease after ovarian cancer primary cytoreductive surgery [^112jAEjf]. Gynecologic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The presence of macroscopic residual disease after primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) is an important factor influencing survival for patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). More research is needed to identify factors associated with having macroscopic residual disease. We analyzed 12 lifestyle and personal exposures known to be related to ovarian cancer risk or inflammation to identify those associated with having residual disease after surgery.

Methods

This analysis used data on 2054 patients with advanced stage HGSC from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. The exposures were body mass index, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate use, endometriosis, first-degree family history of ovarian cancer, incomplete pregnancy, menopausal hormone therapy use, menopausal status, parity, smoking, and tubal ligation. Logistic regression models were fit to assess the association between these exposures and having residual disease following PCS.

Results

Menopausal estrogen-only therapy (ET) use was associated with 33% lower odds of having macroscopic residual disease compared to never use (OR = 0.67, 95%CI 0.46–0.97, p = 0.033). Compared to nulliparous women, parous women who did not breastfeed had 36% lower odds of having residual disease (OR = 0.64, 95%CI 0.43–0.94, p = 0.022), while there was no association among parous women who breastfed (OR = 0.90, 95%CI 0.65–1.25, p = 0.53).

Conclusions

The association between ET and having no macroscopic residual disease is plausible given a strong underlying biologic hypothesis between this exposure and diagnosis with HGSC. If this or the parity finding is replicated, these factors could be included in risk stratification models to determine whether HGSC patients should receive PCS or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Some retrospective data from individuals who underwent bilateral salpingectomy for conditions such as hydrosalpinx and pelvic inflammatory disease have suggested decreased risk of ovarian cancer among individuals without fallopian tubes. However, we hypothesize that OS is associated with more protection than salpingectomies done for diseases that directly affect and distort the fallopian tube, because the intent of OS is complete removal of the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube, which may not occur when salpingectomy is done for other indications. Finally, these historical studies did not use the appropriate control groups, as OS is recommended only for individuals already undergoing gynecological surgery, and both hysterectomy and tubal ligation are associated with protection against ovarian cancer. Here, we examine observed rates of ovarian cancer and compare these with expected rates (based on age-adjusted rates of ovarian cancer in the control group of individuals who underwent hysterectomy alone or tubal ligation).

### High grade serous ovarian carcinomas originate in the fallopian tube [^1148w9rY]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Our genomic analyses are consistent with population-based studies of the effects of salpingectomy on the risk of ovarian cancer. Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer in BRCA mutation carriers to below 5%. Likewise, bilateral salpingectomy, performed as a contraceptive method instead of tubal sterilization, reduced the risk of ovarian cancer by 61% at 10 years. Our study provides a mechanistic basis for these observations and has implications for clinical management in prevention of ovarian cancer. In high risk BRCA carriers, bilateral salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy should be consideredthrough participation in ongoing clinical trials (NCT02321228; NCT01907789). In non-carriers, our work implies that for women who undergo surgery for benign uterine causes, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy with sparing of the ovaries should be considered, and that bilateral salpingectomy may be a preferred contraceptive alternative to tubal ligation. The dual concepts in these recommendations for BRCA carriers and non-carriers are that removal of the FTs (rather than the ovaries) may be curative as it eliminates the underlying cellular precursors of ovarian cancer, and that preservation of the ovaries provides long term benefits due to decreased risk and fatalities from coronary heart disease and other illnesses. A limitation of this approach is that as the precise timing of when potentially malignant cells shed from the FT and microscopically seed the ovary is unknown, removal of the tubes may not provide optimal risk-reduction.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 774: opportunistic salpingectomy as a strategy for epithelial ovarian cancer prevention [^111DUfQk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Pelvic surgery and ovarian cancer risk — Research into epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis primarily affects two groups of women: those at high risk of hereditary ovarian cancer and those at population risk undergoing routine pelvic surgery. Studies of risk-reducing surgery for patients with BRCA mutations demonstrated that 1–5% of those women had early tubal malignancy, with most early intraepithelial components located in the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube. Results from the Nurses' Health Studies show that women who had undergone a tubal ligation (n = 29,340) had a 24% lower risk of ovarian cancer compared with women who did not have the procedure (n = 194,278), and a populationbased cohort study in Sweden showed a similar decreased risk in women undergoing sterilization. By performing salpingectomy when patients undergo an operation during which the fallopian tubes could be removed in addition to the primary surgical procedure (eg, hysterectomy), the risk of ovarian cancer is reduced.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 208: benefits and risks of sterilization [^112bM7uN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Tubal occlusion — subsequent hysterectomy: In CREST, women who had tubal occlusion were four to five times more likely to undergo hysterectomy over a 14-year follow-up period than those whose partners underwent vasectomy. Increased risk was independent of patient age and the method of tubal occlusion used, but was associated with a prestertilization history of menstrual disorders or other benign gynecologic disorders, including endometriosis and uterine leiomyomas. There is no known biologic mechanism to support a causal relationship between tubal occlusion and subsequent hysterectomy.

### Do menstrual problems increase after tubal ligation? [^113Z9RA7]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Moreover, results from one study indicated that women who have this surgery were four to five times more likely to have a subsequent hysterectomy; results from a second study showed that 41 percent of the women who underwent hysterectomy had a previous tubal sterilization. To make further determinations about this issue, Peterson and colleagues reported data from the U. S. Collaborative Review of Sterilization, a large prospective study evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of tubal ligation. Six features of periods that were addressed were duration of bleeding, length of cycle, bleeding or spotting between cycles, cycle irregularity, amount of menstrual pain and amount of bleeding. The findings from the tubal sterilization group were compared with findings from the group whose partners had undergone vasectomy. The primary outcomes of interest were changes in various features of the menstrual cycle.

There were 9, 514 women in the tubal ligation group and 573 women in the group whose partners had a vasectomy; the median age of the women in the two groups was 31 ± 6 years and 32 ± 5 years, respectively. The primary difference between the two groups was that women in the tubal ligation group were more likely to have used oral contraceptives or an intrauterine device before their surgery. Adjusting for age, race and baseline menstrual characteristics, women in the surgery group were more likely to report persistent decreases in the amount of bleeding and days of bleeding, and in menstrual pain. These women were also more likely to report a persistent increase in cycle irregularity. However, when analysis of the data was limited to women who had their most recent natural cycles immediately before surgery, the differences noted above were no longer statistically significant.

The authors also noted no differences in the various aspects of the menstrual periods in relation to one of the six methods used for sterilization. The authors conclude on the basis of this data that tubal sterilization does not result in a post-tubal ligation syndrome. Women who undergo this procedure are actually more likely to experience a decrease in the amount and duration of bleeding. The authors state that past observations of an association between tubal sterilization and menstrual abnormalities are coincidental and attributable to the fact that both events occur commonly.

### Is there an association between endometriosis, early menopause, and cardiovascular disease? [^117XVmcj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Large-scale studies show endometriosis linked to earlier menopause onset. Recent research targeting women with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis found an increase in cases of early natural menopause. Furthermore, recent large-scale cohort studies have found a correlation between endometriosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Understanding the causality of early menopause, particularly natural menopause, and cardiovascular risks in women with endometriosis could help medical professionals develop effective strategies for early prevention and new therapies. Endometriosis, early menopause, and cardiovascular risks may be linked by primary or secondary mechanisms. Primary mechanisms involve shared pathways that can lead to all morbidities, while secondary occur due to delayed consequences of management strategies. In these large-scale cohort studies, relevant risk and confounding factors, such as oophorectomy, were considered to refine estimates of associations. However, none of the studies considered endometriotic cystectomy, a globally accepted treatment for endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and infertility, as a mediating factor. There is substantial evidence to indicate that endometriotic cystectomy harms ovarian reserve and may lead to early menopause in cases of multiple surgeries or bilateral cases. Early menopause is a well-established risk factor for CVD. To thoroughly examine the link between endometriosis and early menopause, particularly natural menopause, and their connection with cardiovascular risks, it is imperative to consider all the possible factors that may affect the results, such as endometriotic cystectomy. This will enable us to obtain the most accurate and adjusted hazard ratio.

### Salpingectomy vs tubal ligation for sterilization: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112orB8x]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

After strong evidence and major organizations recommending salpingectomy over tubal ligation, we sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the intraoperative attributes and complication rates associated with these 2 procedures.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and clinical trials registries without time or language restrictions. The search was conducted in February 2020. Database searches revealed 74 potential studies, of which 11 were examined at the full-text level. Of these, 6 studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

Study Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing salpingectomy with tubal ligation in women seeking sterilization. We included studies that also had at least 1 outcome listed in the population/patient problem, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time. Articles were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria or if data were not reported and the authors did not respond to inquiries.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Abstracts and full-text articles were assessed by 2 authors independently using the blinded coding assignment function or EPPI-Reviewer 4. Conflicting selections were resolved by consensus. The quality of included studies was determined using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study; disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Results

There were few differences between the procedures, with no differences in most important clinical outcomes (antimüllerian hormone, blood loss, length of hospital stay, pre- or postoperative complications, or wound infections). A single study reported a reduced rate of pregnancies with salpingectomy (risk ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.02), but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.05).

Conclusion

We conclude from these data that salpingectomy is as safe and efficacious as tubal ligation for sterilization and may be preferred, where appropriate, to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^114AhbEc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine Devices and Progesterone-Only Contraception

A 2021 meta-analysis that included three prospective cohort studies found no difference in cancer risk between levonorgestrel intrauterine system users and never-users (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41–1.08). A second meta-analysis of 11 studies found decreased risk with intrauterine device use (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.62–0.75). However, this study pooled all types of intrauterine devices and combined both cohort and case–control studies. In a prospective cohort study of women from Denmark, use of progesterone-only contraceptives was not associated with ovarian cancer risk (276,221 person-years, adjusted RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59–1.29).

Tubal Ligation

Tubal ligation is associated with decreased risk of ovarian cancer. In a meta-analysis of 13 studies, having a tubal ligation was associated with a 34% decreased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.60–0.73).

Family History and Genetic Mutations

The risk of ovarian cancer is increased with certain genetic mutations. About 10–25% of ovarian cancers are associated with a hereditary genetic abnormality. Although multiple germline mutations are associated with ovarian cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations are the most common and are found in 10–15% of women with ovarian cancer. A woman with a BRCA1 mutation has a 39–58% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, whereas a woman with a BRCA2 mutation has about a 13–29% lifetime risk. BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D have also been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Mutations in these three genes are estimated to be associated with 2% of ovarian cancer cases. Other genetic mutations and the absolute risk of epithelial ovarian cancer are shown in Table 1.

Table 1.
Ovarian Cancer Risk by Genetic Mutation

Family history of ovarian cancer without an identified inherited genetic mutation is also associated with increased ovarian cancer risk. In a case–control study that included 554 patients, ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative (mother or sister) was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.4–4.1).

### Current controversies in tubal disease, endometriosis, and pelvic adhesion [^114QRtkt]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Reproductive surgery for proximal and distal tubal occlusion, as well as for reversal of tubal ligation, may be an alternative or an adjunct to IVF. Surgery for adenomyosis and endometriosis, including endometriomas, may be considered for the treatment of infertility and/or pelvic pain but carries the risks of surgical complications and diminished ovarian reserve. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of postoperative peritoneal adhesion formation is needed to develop more effective preventive measures to optimize the clinical results of surgery.

### Estimands for clinical effectiveness of risk-reducing early salpingectomy in women with high risk of ovarian cancer [^114tt8FF]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Every year approximately 200 000 women die from ovarian cancer (OC) worldwide. Tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common histologic type (70%-80%), with very poor survival rates when detected at an advanced stage. Approximately 1 in 5 HGSCs are associated with pathogenic variants (PVs) in high-risk (eg, BRCA1 [OMIM] and BRCA2 [OMIM) and moderate-risk (eg, RAD51C [OMIM], RAD51D [OMIM], BRIP1 [OMIM], and PALB2 [OMIM]) cancer susceptibility genes and are potentially preventable. BRCA1 and BRCA2 PV carriers have an approximate 44% and 17% lifetime OC risk, respectively. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is the most effective option for preventing OC. RRSO substantially reduces OC risk, along-with all-cause and OC-specific mortality in BRCA PV carriers. It is cost-effectiveand recommended by clinical guidelines, for those 35 years and older for BRCA1 PV carriers and 40 years and older for BRCA2 PV carriers.

Premenopausal RRSO causes premature surgical menopause and thus potential harms to long-term health, including increased risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, vasomotor symptoms, mood or sleep disturbance, reduced libido, vaginal dryness, sexual dysfunction, and neurocognitive decline, particularly if hormone replacement therapy use is not possible. Furthermore, hormone replacement therapy does not fully alleviate vasomotor symptoms or sexual dysfunction, with symptom levels remaining above those retaining their ovaries. Higher regret rates occur with premenopausal (approximately 10%) vs postmenopausal (1%) RRSO. Many women choose to delay RRSO until after natural menopause due to these potential harms.

There is compelling evidence and broad acceptance that most HGSCs originate from the fallopian tube. Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) is established as a precursor lesion to OC. This has led to interest in risk-reducing early salpingectomy (RRES) followed by delayed oophorectomy (DO) as an alternative surgical prevention strategy to RRSO in women at high risk of familial OC, which can avoid detrimental effects from early menopause.

### Association between laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and risk of early natural menopause [^112FdTre]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is an often chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside of the uterus. Although endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women during their reproductive years, its association with other health outcomes, including early natural menopause (ENM), remain unclear. Early menopause is defined as the cessation of ovarian function before age 45 years. Affecting approximately 10% of women in Western populations, endometriosis is associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, osteoporosis, and premature mortality. Multiple mechanisms support the hypothesis that endometriosis or, specifically, endometriomas (the endometriosis subtype characterized by ovarian cysts)and the treatments associated with it may have qualitative and quantitative implications for ovarian reserve. Endometriosis has been associated with lower ovarian reserve among women with female-factor infertility, and endometriomashave been associated with ovarian aging and menopause timing. In addition, local and systemic increased inflammation has been associated with endometriosis, and hypothesized to be associated with early menopause; however, these associations were nonlinear and inconsistent among markers. Women with endometriosis compared with women without endometriosis have peritoneal fluid that contains more activated proinflammatory, chemotactic, and oxidative stress factors, which could create an environment that is detrimental to follicular and ovarian function and leads to an earlier age at menopause.

Determinants of age at menopause include the number of oocytes at birth, the rate of atresia throughout the lifespan, and the threshold number of oocytes needed to produce sufficient hormones to maintain menstrual cyclicity. Reproductive events that interrupt ovulation (eg, pregnancies and lactation)or modify the rate of atresia slow the depletion of the ovarian follicle pool and are associated with delayed menopause. Conversely, events that disrupt ovarian function, such as ovarian surgery, autoimmune oophoritis, cigarette smoking, and androgenizing exogenous hormones, may have implications for ovarian reserve, characterized by decreased follicle numbers and lower oocyte quality and quantity, which are associated with earlier age at menopause. Early natural menopause and endometriosis share several risk factors, including body size, earlier age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycles, nulliparity, and infertility. Furthermore, medical and surgical management for endometriosis, including oral contraceptives (OCs)and ovarian surgeries, may alter early menopause risk.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^112yfyTC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Long-acting contraceptive procedures performed for Medicaid clients in California, 2008–2014 *.

To estimate the real-world effectiveness of IUCs and tubal ligation for individuals receiving Medicaid-funded healthcare, we examined incidence rates of claims for pregnancy within 12 months post-procedure, censoring participants upon identification of any claims for hysterectomy, oophorectomy, pregnancy, infertility services or consultation, or the end of available data (12/31/14). We further censored participants at the time of a claim indicating IUC removal or any claims for a new or additional form of contraception. We limited this analysis to the first 12 months after IUC placement to reduce the possibility that subsequent gaps in Medicaid enrollment might result in misclassification of individuals whose IUC had been removed. When estimating rates of contraceptive failure, we excluded the < 1% of patients found to have a very early (i.e. a "luteal phase") pregnancy not detected at the time of the contraceptive procedure (defined by pregnancy claim(s) within 30 days following contraceptive procedure or a delivery claim within 180 days following procedure). We used log-linear (Poisson) regression models for person-periods (nested within clusters) to examine associations between these long-acting contraceptive procedures and post-procedure pregnancy rates, adjusting for age group, race/ethnicity, region, year of procedure, months of Medi-Cal enrollment in the 2 years pre-procedure, and baseline health measures (evidenced by claims in the 2 years prior to the index contraceptive procedure indicating obesity, pregnancy (categorized as none, ectopic pregnancy, non-ectopic pregnancy), endometrial ablation, pelvic inflammatory disease, and any contraceptive claims). We selected this approach to modeling because it allows us to account parsimoniously for risk that varies over distinct and possibly censored follow-up periods. Because pregnancy is a qualifying condition for Medi-Cal, participants were not censored from analyses of contraceptive effectiveness if they had gaps in enrollment.

### Salpingectomy and the risk of ovarian cancer in Ontario [^114oq8bq]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

A body of pathological and clinical evidence supports the position that the fallopian tube is the site of origin for a large proportion of high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Consequently, salpingectomy is now considered for permanent contraception (in lieu of tubal ligation) or ovarian cancer prevention (performed opportunistically at the time of surgical procedures for benign gynecologic conditions).

Objective

To evaluate the association between salpingectomy and the risk of invasive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based retrospective cohort study included all women aged 18 to 80 years who were eligible for health care services in Ontario, Canada. Participants were identified using administrative health databases from Ontario between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2019. A total of 131 516 women were included in the primary (matched) analysis. Women were followed up until December 31, 2021.

Exposures

Salpingectomy (with and without hysterectomy) vs no pelvic procedure (control condition) among women in the general population.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Women with a unilateral or bilateral salpingectomy in Ontario between April 1, 1992, and December 31, 2019, were matched 1:3 to women with no pelvic procedure from the general population. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer combined.

Results

Among 131 516 women (mean [SD] age, 42.2 [7.6] years), 32 879 underwent a unilateral or bilateral salpingectomy, and 98 637 did not undergo a pelvic procedure. After a mean (range) follow-up of 7.4 (0–29.2) years in the salpingectomy group and 7.5 (0–29.2) years in the nonsurgical control group, there were 31 incident cancers (0.09%) and 117 incident cancers (0.12%), respectively (HR,0.82; 95% CI, 0.55–1.21). The HR for cancer incidence was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.53–1.44) when comparing those with salpingectomy vs those with hysterectomy alone.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, no association was found between salpingectomy and the risk of ovarian cancer; however, this observation was based on few incident cases and a relatively short follow-up time. Studies with additional years of follow-up are necessary to define the true level of potential risk reduction with salpingectomy, although longer follow-up will also be a challenge unless collaborative efforts that pool data are undertaken.

### Clinical effects of early or surgical menopause [^112Zwv7T]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Increasing numbers of women experience early menopause due in part to surgical treatment for benign gynecologic disorders and the rise in risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations. Unfortunately, the adverse health consequences of early loss of ovarian function accelerate the menopausal state and affect multiple systems, including cardiovascular, neurologic, bone, and connective tissue, and affect quality of life owing to vasomotor symptoms, mood, sleep, and sexual function. Yet many clinicians and women remain reluctant to use hormone therapy because of the Women's Health Initiative's adverse findings, even though they are not applicable to women with early menopause. This review examines the effects of early menopause and highlights the critical role of hormone therapy in this population.

### Outcomes from opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer prevention [^113AMR8t]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

These findings may also further our understanding of the origin for HGSCs. Twenty years ago in a provocative editorial, it was suggested that the ovarian surface epithelium may not be the tissue of origin for ovarian carcinomas. Shortly afterward, detailed analysis of fallopian tubes and ovaries from BRCA variant carriers found tubal dysplastic lesions, now called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas, but no ovarian pathology. Systematic analysis of fallopian tubes and ovaries in many studies has since shown that serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas are found in individuals with BRCA variants, also alongside sporadic and incidental HGSCs but not in the general population. Genomic studies have confirmed the clonal association between serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas and HGSC, and transgenic mice with mutated fallopian tube cells produce histologically perfect HGSCs. However, there are data supporting potential primary ovarian origins of some HGSCs, including mouse models and expression data; thus, it is possible that some HGSCs arise from ovarian surface epithelium or endosalpingiosis. However, despite detailed analysis in many studies, credible ovarian HGSC precursors have not been described. Ultimately, expansion of the data presented here will determine the relative portion of HGSCs that originate in the fallopian tube vs the ovary.

Our findings are consistent with previous epidemiological research from the US, Denmark, and Sweden, which studied the association between excisional tubal surgery or salpingectomy and the risk of ovarian cancer among individuals with a medical indication for these procedures. The observed relative risks showed a 42% to 65% reduction in risk of ovarian cancer for individuals who underwent a major surgical procedure involving the fallopian tube. Furthermore, tubal ligation has long been recognized as being inversely associated with ovarian cancer risk, although the magnitude of the association is lower than those for the more extensive fallopian tube procedures mentioned already.

### The role of opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy vs tubal occlusion or ligation for ovarian cancer prophylaxis [^112rANDF]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Bilateral tubal ligation (BTL) for sterilization has been known to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer. Recent studies have suggested that bilateral salpingectomy (BS) may be an alternative to BTL or tubal occlusion for women desiring permanent sterilization, owing to a possibly greater protective effect against ovarian cancer. We conducted a PubMed/MEDLINE review of the literature for original studies, opinion articles, and meta-analyses published between 2010 and 2016 addressing the role of BS at the time of sterilization and comparing its efficacy with BTL in terms of ovarian cancer prevention, operative outcomes, and ovarian function. BTL has been found to decrease the risk of any ovarian cancer by 13% to 41%, compared with 42% to 78% for BS. Although operative time is increased with BS compared with BTL, no differences in complication rates or ovarian reserve between the 2 procedures have been demonstrated. Our review suggests that BS should be discussed when BTL is being considered, and that patients should be counseled about the risks and benefits of both procedures based on the current available evidence.

Risk-reducing salpingectomy strategies and surgical pathology in RAD51C, RAD51D, and BRIP1 heterozygotes: Several studies have shown that opportunistic salpingectomy alone can reduce the risk of future development of OC, including women undergoing salpingectomy or tubal ligation for sterilization across all levels of OC risk. Researchers are currently investigating whether risk-reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy in premenopausal individuals with inherited predisposition to OC (including RAD51C, RAD51D, and BRIP1 heterozygotes) is safe; results will not be available for a decade and may indicate an additional management option for pre-menopausal women wishing to reduce risk before completion of an oophorectomy at age 50. Surgical risk reduction with RRSO should be performed in conjunction with the Sectioning and Extensively Examining the Fimbria (SEE-FIM) protocol for pathologic analysis in accordance with NCCN guidelines to optimize detection of occult serous carcinoma of the adnexa, and thorough surgical exploration can identify even occult cancerous lesions.

### Are cause of subfertility and in vitro fertilization treatment risk factors for an earlier start of menopause? [^115My9fZ]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To study whether women diagnosed with unexplained subfertility reach the menopause transition and natural menopause earlier than women with tubal subfertility, in an in vitro fertilization (IVF)-treated population, and to examine the influence of the number of IVF cycles on the occurrence of an early menopause transition and natural menopause.

Design

This retrospective cohort study included 12 IVF clinics in the Netherlands. A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted among women whose first IVF cycle was stimulated with gonadotrophins in the Netherlands between 1983 and 1995 (n = 7,842). Most of the women were in their late 30s at the end of the follow-up period (range 24–55 y). The main outcome measures were the relative risk (RR) of having reached natural menopause and the risks (RR) of having entered the menopause transition or natural menopause according to the cause of subfertility and the number of IVF cycles.

Results

Women with unexplained subfertility did not have an increased risk of entering the menopause transition or natural menopause (adjusted RR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2–1.5; and RR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6–1.1). After a 5-year follow-up period, we found no increased risk for entering the menopause transition or natural menopause among women who had undergone six or more IVF cycles when compared with women who had undergone only one IVF cycle (adjusted RR = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1–1.7; and RR = 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6–1.6).

Conclusions

Underlying causes of unexplained subfertility do not predispose women to an early start of menopause. Although the number of IVF cycles was not associated with early menopause, longer follow-up is needed.

### Androgen levels in adult females: changes with age, menopause, and oophorectomy [^113h2ak4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Changes in androgen levels across the adult female life span and the effects of natural menopause and oophorectomy have not been clearly established.

Objective

The objective of this study was to document the effects of age on androgen levels in healthy women and to explore the effects of natural and surgical menopause.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cross-sectional study was conducted of 1423 non-healthcare-seeking women, aged 18–75 yr, randomly recruited from the community over 15 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Serum levels by age of total testosterone (T), calculated free T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione in a reference group of women free of confounding factors. Women in the reference group had no usage of exogenous steroid therapy; no history of tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy; and no hyperprolactinemia or polycystic ovarian syndrome. The effects of natural and surgical menopause on sex steroid levels were also examined.

Results

In the reference population (n = 595), total T, calculated free T, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione declined steeply with age (P < 0.001), with the decline of each being greater in the earlier than the later decades. Examination of serum androgen levels by year in women aged 45–54 yr showed no independent effect of menopausal status on androgen levels. In women aged 55 yr or older, those who reported bilateral oophorectomy and were not on exogenous steroids had significantly lower total T and free T levels than women 55 yr or older in the reference group.

Conclusions

We report that serum androgen levels decline steeply in the early reproductive years and do not vary because a consequence of natural menopause and that the postmenopausal ovary appears to be an ongoing site of testosterone production. These significant variations in androgens with age must be taken into account when normal ranges are reported and in studies of the role of androgens in women.

Semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires were completed every 4 years starting in 1991 and ending in 2015. The questionnaires assessed the intake of 131 foods and beverages, and asked participants to estimate how often they consumed specific items during the preceding year. Vegetable protein intake and alcohol consumption were calculated, and these measures were adjusted for energy using the residual method. Predicted plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) score was computed using validated statistical models that included major factors of vitamin D status (age, season of blood draw, race and ethnicity, UV-B flux, physical activity, BMI, dietary and supplementary vitamin D intake, and alcohol consumption).

Following are all of the covariates that were used in multivariable models: model 1 was adjusted for age and calendar time; model 2 included model 1 and was additionally adjusted for race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White or other), BMI at 18 years (< 18.5, 18.5 to < 22.5, 22.5 to < 25, or ≥ 25), current BMI (< 18.5, 18.5 to < 22.5, 22.5 to < 25, 25 to < 30, or ≥ 30), cigarette smoking status (never, past, or current), cigarette smoking pack-years (0, 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, or 21–98), alcohol use (0, 0.1 to < 10.0, 10 to 30, or ≥ 30 g/d), physical activity (< 3, 3 to 8, 9 to 17, 18 to 26, or ≥ 27 metabolic equivalent task hours per week), vegetable protein (quintiles), and estimated plasma 25(OH)D score (ng/mL [to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 2.496]; quintiles); and model 3 included model 2 and was additionally adjusted for age at menarche (≤ 11, 12–13, or ≥ 14 years), menstrual cycle length at age 18 to 22 years (< 26, 26–31, or ≥ 32 days), OC use (never, past, or current), duration of OC use (0, 1–23, 24–47, 48–71, 72–95, 96–119, or ≥ 120 months), parity (nulliparous or parous: 1, 2, 3, or ≥ 4 children), total lactation duration (0 to < 1, 1–6, > 6–12, or ≥ 12 months), and history of infertility attributed to ovulatory disorder (no or yes). Most variables had minimal missing values, with only 3 variables having greater than 0.05% (alcohol use, 6.5%; vegetable protein, 5.1%; and 25[OH]D, 16.6%) missing values.

### Risk factors for carcinoma of the fallopian tube in women with and without a germline BRCA mutation [^113M36n9]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for fallopian tube cancer in women with and without a BRCA mutation.

Methods

Subjects with fallopian tube cancer were identified from two sources: 1) a large international registry of women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (n = 56), and; 2) a population-based study of ovarian and fallopian tube cancer conducted in Ontario, Canada (n = 66). BRCA mutation status was established for all subjects. Each subject was matched to one or more unaffected controls, for date of birth (within four years), for BRCA mutation status (negative, BRCA1, and BRCA2), for country of residence and for past history of breast cancer (yes/no). All subjects completed a questionnaire about medical history and lifestyle factors. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for parity, oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation, hormone replacement therapy and body mass index, using conditional logistic regression.

Results

We studied 103 women with fallopian tube cancer (48 with a BRCA1 mutation, 12 with a BRCA2 mutation and 43 with no identified BRCA mutation) and 980 matched controls. Increasing parity was associated with a decreased risk of fallopian tube cancer in non-carriers (trend per birth odds ratio 0.71 (95% CI 0.52–0.97), p = 0.03), in BRCA1 carriers (OR = 0.79 (0.62–1.02) p = 0.07) and in BRCA2 carriers (OR = 0.62 (0.34–1.15), p = 0.13), but was statistically significant only for non-carriers. Oral contraceptive use was associated with a reduced risk in BRCA1 carriers (trend per year of use odds ratio = 0.91 (0.83–0.99), p = 0.03) but not for non-carriers (OR = 0.97 (0.87–1.09), p = 0.64) or for BRCA2 carriers (OR = 0.94 (0.80–1.11), p = 0.47). Hormone replacement therapy was associated with an increased risk for fallopian tube cancer in all subjects (OR = 1.07 (1.01–1.13), p = 0.03), and in the subgroups stratified by mutation, however the association was not significant in the subgroups. Tubal ligation was associated with a decreased risk of fallopian tube cancer for all subjects (OR = 0.64 (0.31–1.28), p = 0.21), however the reduction was not significant.

Conclusions

Parity and oral contraceptive use are associated with reduced risks of fallopian tube cancer. In contrast, hormone replacement therapy may be associated with an increase in the risk of fallopian tube cancer.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 774: opportunistic salpingectomy as a strategy for epithelial ovarian cancer prevention [^115G7SBv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Opportunistic salpingectomy for primary ovarian cancer prevention — ACOG Committee Opinion — defines opportunistic salpingectomy as the removal of the fallopian tubes for the primary prevention of ovarian cancer in a woman already undergoing pelvic surgery for another indication, and states that salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy or as a means of tubal sterilization appears to be safe and does not increase the risk of complications such as blood transfusions, readmissions, and postoperative complications, infections, or fever compared with hysterectomy alone or tubal ligation. Ovarian function does not appear to be affected by salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy based on surrogate serum markers or response to in vitro fertilization. The surgeon and patient should discuss the potential benefits of the removal of the fallopian tubes during a hysterectomy in women at population risk of ovarian cancer who are not having an oophorectomy.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, more specifically with respect to patients at increased risk of gynecological cancers, BGCS/BMS 2024 guidelines recommend to do not perform hysterectomy at the time of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy if there is no increased genetic risk for endometrial cancer or other clinical indication for hysterectomy.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^112wHGMT]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Menopause is defined as the reproductive condition after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. For a majority of women, menopause occurs at an average age of 51 years, as a result of the complex hormonal changes that accompany the reduction in ovarian follicles. Along with a drop in circulating hormone levels, menopause is often associated with the experience of hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness. Despite similar symptoms and the common name of menopause, there is, however, no single pathway to the end of menses. In fact, menstruation ceases for different reasons, in different ways, at different time points in the lifespan, with different health risks.

For a small but significant number of women, menopause occurs earlier than the normative age range. Included in this spectrum of menopauses is premature (younger than 40 y), early (between 40 and 45 y), and induced (oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [BSO], the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, or ovarian ablation through radiation). These different menopause types have distinct hormonal changes both leading up to and after the cessation of menses, potentially leading to different health trajectories. Although not considered an induced menopause, hysterectomy with ovarian sparing has been shown to result in decreased ovarian function. Thus, using menopause as a blanket word to describe any "cessation of menses" erases these differences in the physiology, etiology, and health outcomes of the many menopauses.

### Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy occurrence: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xtCMh]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the high incidence of ectopic pregnancy (EP) in the general population and the high maternal morbidity and mortality rates associated with it, determining risk factors for the occurrence of EP is essential for directing attention and care to risk groups, aiming for early diagnosis, favorable outcomes, and the development of prevention strategies.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for the occurrence of EP.

Search Strategy

A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed on the electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, LILACS, The Cochrane Library, and Virtual Health Library (VHL), searching the following terms "Ectopic Pregnancy" or "Ectopic Gestation" and "Risk Factors" or "Predisposing Factors".

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were observational studies published in English and Portuguese. We excluded studies with undefined methodology and those published before the year 2000.

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently read the titles, abstracts, and full texts, using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and discussed any differences. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality were performed by each author in a standardized way. Sixteen risk factors were evaluated. The meta-analysis calculations were performed using the Reviewer Manager 5.3 software (RevMan 5.3).

Main Results

The study found 715 studies, of which 11 were selected for review. The surveys were conducted between 2003 and 2019 and included 25051 patients. The study revealed that several factors were strongly associated with the occurrence of EP. These included EP history (OR 9.03; 95% CI: 7.18–11.35; I² = 67%), pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 4.00; 95% CI: 3.46–4.61; I² = 0%), infertility (OR 3.70; 95% CI: 3.23–4.23; I² = 48%), abdominal and pelvic surgeries (OR 5.60; 95% CI: 4.83–6.49; I² = 81%), and previous tubal ligation (OR 5.59; 95% CI: 2.49–12.55; I² = 0%). Furthermore, the study showed that advanced maternal age, smoking, number of partners exceeding one, history of spontaneous and induced abortion, previous use of emergency contraception, and intrauterine device, demonstrated a slightly increased risk. Advanced maternal age within the range of 30-34years (OR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03–1.24; I¹ = 11%) and ≥ 40years (OR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.19–1.78; I¹ = 88%), marital status (OR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03–1.37; I² = 88%), and the use of oral contraceptives (OR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66–0.90; I² = 86%) were also found to be associated with a slightly increased or decreased risk of EP, respectively. The impact of condom use on the occurrence of EP seems to be very limited (OR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.83–1.05; I² = 83%).

Conclusion

Based on the study findings, it is suggested that the presence of strong risk factors warrants the implementation of a screening policy for EP among these women.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^112uw8tp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

As desire for reversal of tubal ligation is known to occur, it is important that all patients considering tubal ligation receive thorough counseling regarding the comparative safety and effectiveness of IUC prior to undergoing tubal ligation. As the effectiveness and safety of many clinical procedures vary by patient comorbidity and clinician experience, the millions of US individuals who receive Medicaid-funded healthcare should be specifically informed about the comparative safety and effectiveness of IUC compared to tubal ligation provided to Medicaid clients, because desire for tubal reversal has been reported to be more common among Medicaid clients, and Medicaid coverage of infertility treatment is very limited in most states.

Strengths of this study include the large and diverse population studied with input from both patients and clinician stakeholders. When estimating rates of contraceptive failure, the fact that California covers abortion services for those eligible for Medicaid is an additional strength. Given federal restrictions on abortion funding, ResDAC includes very little abortion data. However, we believe that we were able to identify many pregnancies that were aborted using claims related to pregnancy testing and imaging which are included in ResDAC without subsequent claims for delivery, ectopic pregnancy, or management of early pregnancy loss. Further, undercounting of abortions should not differ with respect to type of contraceptive procedure performed prior to an undesired pregnancy. Additional limitations of this study include the fact that claims data do not allow identification of whether patients had an IUC in their uterus at the time they became pregnant; it is therefore possible that some patients expelled or removed their IUC prior to becoming pregnant. If our data includes a considerable number of patients who self-removed or expelled their IUC and did not start another form of contraception prior to becoming pregnant, then the typical-use failure rate we report here for the levonorgestrel IUC is higher than it should be, and patients may be even less likely to become pregnant in the first year following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC than following laparoscopic tubal ligation. In addition, this claims data does not provide detail on what type of laparoscopic tubal ligation was performed. We recognize that some salpingectomies and oophorectomies performed at the time of tubal ligation may have been planned with the goal of reducing risk of malignancy, while hysterectomies may have been planned due to a history of fibroids and menorrhagia. Although all analyses were adjusted for age and claims related to obesity and pain in the 2 years pre-procedure, our finding of more pelvic pain following tubal ligation than IUC may reflect continuation of conditions that made laparoscopy and tubal ligation a more likely contraceptive choice. Healthcare claims are an imperfect measure of health status as people who chose not to or could not access Medi-Cal-funded healthcare during the study period may have skewed baseline health measures. As such, claims data do not allow for ideal adjustment for baseline differences between groups. Further, observational studies can only identify associations, not causal relationships. Finally, due to the limited number of individuals with continuous enrollment for more than 1 year, we were unable to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of these methods with extended use. In addition, it is possible that some patients may have had private insurance or received healthcare in another state during a gap in Medi-Cal enrollment.

### Surgical implications of the potential new tubal pathway for ovarian carcinogenesis [^111gxQtu]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Since 2001, many studies by different investigators have demonstrated that the fallopian tube might be at the origin of most high-grade ovarian and peritoneal serous carcinomas. Simple changes in surgical practice (ie, prophylactic bilateral salpingectomy instead of salpingo-oophorectomy) could have significant implications for death from ovarian cancer and, on the other hand, for the morbidity caused by ovariectomy (surgical menopause). In this review, we describe the new tubal carcinogenic sequence, the advantages and disadvantages of exclusive use of salpingectomy in the general population, and in cases of hereditary predisposition to ovarian cancer such as for carriers of BRCA mutation.

### Association between laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and risk of early natural menopause [^112xU9rx]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Early natural menopause (ENM) has been associated with reduced reproductive span, cardiovascular disease risk, and early mortality. The potential adverse implications of endometrioma surgery for ovarian reserve are known, yet the association of endometriosis with menopausal timing remains understudied.

Objective

To investigate the association between endometriosis and risk for ENM.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This large, population-based cohort study analyzed data from the Nurses' Health Study II cohort questionnaires from the 1989 to 2015 questionnaire cycles. The sample included premenopausal women aged 25 to 42 years at baseline or enrollment in 1989. Cumulative follow-up rate was greater than 90%, and participants continued follow-up until the onset of ENM, age 45 years, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, cancer diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up in May 2017, whichever occurred first. Data analyses were conducted from October 26, 2020, to April 27, 2021.

Exposures

Endometriosis diagnosis status was queried in the biennial questionnaires, with participants reporting physician diagnosis and whether the diagnosis was laparoscopically confirmed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Natural menopause before age 45 years. Menopause status was assessed every 2 years.

Results

The study included 106 633 premenopausal women with a mean (SD) age of 34.8 (4.3) years at baseline, of whom 3921 reported a laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis diagnosis. During 1 508 462 person-years of follow-up, 6640 participants reported being diagnosed with endometriosis, 99 993 never reported endometriosis, and 2542 reported experiencing ENM. In the age- and calendar time-adjusted model, laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis was associated with a 50% greater risk for ENM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30–1.74). A similar risk was observed after adjusting for race and ethnicity and time-varying anthropometric and behavioral factors (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.26–1.69). With additional adjustment for reproductive factors, the HR of ENM was attenuated but significant (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10–1.48). A greater risk of ENM was observed among women who were nulliparous after stratifying by parity (nulliparous vs parous: HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.15–1.86] vs 1.14 [95% CI, 0.94–1.39]; P for heterogeneity = .05) or who never used oral contraceptives when stratifying by oral contraceptive use (never vs ever: HR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.34–3.06] vs 1.20 [95% CI, 1.02–1.42]; P for heterogeneity = .02). No significant differences were observed in the association between endometriosis and ENM when stratifying by body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; < 25 vs ≥ 25: HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.99–1.45] vs 1.43 [95% CI, 1.11–1.83; P for heterogeneity = .34), cigarette smoking status (never vs ever: HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.13–1.65] vs 1.11 [95% CI, 0.87–1.42]; P for heterogeneity = .57), or history of infertility attributed to ovulatory disorder (no vs yes: HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.08–1.51] vs 1.28 [95% CI, 0.90–1.82]; P for heterogeneity = .86).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found a risk for ENM in women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. These women compared with those without endometriosis may be at a higher risk for shortened reproductive duration, particularly those who were nulliparous or never used oral contraceptives.

### Salpingectomy and the risk of ovarian cancer in Ontario [^113bmdaP]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Covariates

We collected information on a series of variables that describe demographic information, health services use, reproductive history, comorbidities, and indications for surgery. Demographic variables included neighborhood income quintile, residence location, and years eligible for provincial health coverage. Health services use included history of core primary care visits, specialist visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and emergency department visits. Patient comorbidities were assessed using the ACG System, version 10.0 (The Johns Hopkins University), to capture aggregate diagnosis groups based on health services use in the 2 years before a participant's reference date.

Matching

We created 3 models using propensity score methods to compare the various groups. Model 1 compared the salpingectomy (with and without hysterectomy) group with the nonsurgical control cohort. Patients who underwent a unilateral or bilateral salpingectomy in Ontario between April 1, 1992, and December 31, 2019, were matched 1:3 to women who did not undergo a gynecologic procedure. Participants were matched on year of index date, age at index date (plus or minus 2 years), parity, history of tubal ligation, and propensity score.

Model 2 compared the salpingectomy (with and without hysterectomy) group with the hysterectomy only group. This model evaluated the difference in association between salpingectomy and a surgical comparator. All patients who underwent a salpingectomy were matched 1:1 to patients who underwent a hysterectomy alone.

Model 3 compared the tubal ligation group with the nonsurgical control cohort. Participants who underwent tubal ligation were matched 1:3 to women who did not undergo a gynecologic procedure. Participants who underwent tubal ligation were matched using the same methods and variables as those used in model 1; however, participants in the matched nonsurgical control cohort could not have a history of tubal ligation.

### Association between laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and risk of early natural menopause [^114t7Zns]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Within the UK Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study cohort, history of endometriosis was associated with ENM. However, the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study was limited by its reliance on recalled age at menopause and minimal adjustment for potential confounders. Therefore, in the current prospective cohort study, we sought to investigate the association between endometriosis and the risk of ENM using the US Nurses' Health Study II cohort. We applied a prospective time-to-event analysis that accounted for time-varying anthropometric, behavioral, and reproductive factors. In addition, we investigated whether the association between endometriosis and ENM risk differed by the following risk factors of age at menopause: body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), cigarette smoking, OC use, parity, and history of infertility that was attributed to ovulatory disorder.

Opportunistic salpingectomy — counseling and baseline risks: The surgeon and patient should discuss the potential benefits of the removal of the fallopian tubes during a hysterectomy in women at population risk of ovarian cancer who are not having an oophorectomy, and counseling should include an informed consent discussion about the role of oophorectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy that causes surgical menopause reduces the risk of ovarian cancer but may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer other than ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality, and in the Nurses' Health Study, all-cause mortality and cancer mortality increased in women who received a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; with ovarian conservation, the risk of ovarian cancer after hysterectomy is 0.1–0.75% and death from ovarian cancer after tubo–ovarian conservation was 0.03%, with little benefit after age 65 years; obstetrician–gynecologists can communicate that bilateral salpingectomy can be considered a method that provides effective contraception and should counsel patients that salpingectomy eliminates tubal reversal as an option for those who may later seek fertility.

Construction of Cohorts

Surgical Cohort

The inclusion cohort consisted of all women aged 18 to 80 years who were eligible for health care services in Ontario. Participants were identified using administrative health databases from Ontario between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2019. Participants were followed up until December 31, 2021. A total of 131 516 women were included in the primary (matched) analysis.

Women were observed from the date of cohort entry to the first salpingectomy and/or hysterectomy. The date of the first operation was considered the reference date. The index date was defined as 180 days after the first operation to account for lead time that may have existed because of the operation and to avoid inclusion of occult cases as events. Participants were assigned to 1 of 3 mutually exclusive groups (salpingectomy only, salpingectomy with hysterectomy, or hysterectomy only) based on surgical procedures that occurred in the 180-day period after the first operation. Participants were excluded if, on the index date, they were ineligible for the Ontario Health Insurance Plan at any point in the previous 2.5 years or had a history of any of the following before the index date: any cancer diagnosis, precancerous ovarian condition, ovarian cysts, radical gynecologic operation, or previous oophorectomy (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

We similarly created a tubal ligation cohort; women in this cohort were observed from the date of cohort entry to the first tubal ligation that occurred within the accrual period. The index date was defined as 180 days after tubal ligation. Women were excluded based on the same criteria listed in the previous paragraph or if they had a history of hysterectomy or salpingectomy.

Nonsurgical Control Cohort

To identify a cohort of women that could serve as a nonsurgical control group, we randomly assigned index dates to all participants in the inclusion cohort. Index dates were assigned based on the distribution of index dates among all eligible women in the salpingectomy group. Women were excluded if they had a history of salpingectomy or hysterectomy before their index date. Women in the surgical cohorts were eligible to serve in the nonsurgical control cohort if their randomly assigned index date preceded their surgical date.

Results

Before exclusions, there were 60 153 individuals who underwent any of the surgical procedures of interest. After exclusion of 74 individuals who were younger than age 15 years at the time of surgery and 2110 individuals with cancers that were diagnosed before or within 6 months of surgery, there were 25 889 individuals (mean [SD] age, 40.2 [7.1] years) in the OS group, including 14 066 who underwent hysterectomy with OS and 11 823 who underwent OS for sterilization. There were 32 080 individuals (mean [SD] age, 38.2 [7.9] years) in the control group, including 10 446 individuals who underwent hysterectomy alone and 21 634 who underwent tubal ligation (Figure 1). The Table compares the characteristics of the OS groups (hysterectomy with OS and OS for sterilization) with the control groups (hysterectomy alone and tubal ligation). There were no meaningful differences in any oral contraceptive pill use (18 098 individuals [69.9%] in the OS group vs 21 414 individuals [66.8%] in the control group), duration of oral contraceptive pill use (OS group, mean [SD], 757 [1091] days and median [IQR], 265 [0–1080] days; control group, mean [SD], 662 [965] days and median [IQR], 218 [0–960] days), and BRCA variant rates between the groups (27 individuals [0.10%] in the OS group vs 34 individuals [0.11%] in the control group). Individuals who underwent OS were older at the time of surgery (mean [SD], 40.2 [7.1] vs 38.2 [7.9] years), had fewer live births (mean [SD], 1.74 [1.29] vs 2.03 [1.33] live births) and fewer pregnancies (mean [SD], 2.26 [1.87] vs 2.63 [1.93] pregnancies), and were more likely to have endometriosis (3301 individuals [12.8%] vs 2279 individuals [7.1%]) than those in the control group. There was longer follow-up in the control group vs the OS group (median [IQR], 7.3 [4.6–8.7] vs 3.2 [1.6–5.1] years).

### Association between laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and risk of early natural menopause [^1177hM54]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large, prospective cohort study, we observed that surgically confirmed endometriosis was associated with a significantly greater risk of ENM. The risk estimate remained robust and statistically significant with adjustment for demographic and behavioral factors. The association was slightly attenuated with additional adjustment for reproductive factors but remained statistically significant. Residual confounding may remain; however, for residual confounding to alter the conclusions that were drawn from the quantified effect estimates, it would have to exceed the confounding outcomes that were captured by the data that were already included in the multivariable-adjusted models. The observed association between endometriosis and ENM varied between subgroups, with statistically significant effect modifiers identified. Those with endometriosis had the highest risk for ENM among women who never used OCs or were nulliparous.

To our knowledge, no previous study has prospectively investigated the association between endometriosis and ENM with time-varying covariates, time-to-event analyses, and early age at natural menopause (clinically defined as before age 45 years). A cross-sectional studyreported that women with ENM (defined as menopause at ≤ 49 years, the cohort's median age at natural menopause) were more likely to report an endometriosis diagnosis after adjustment for social class, pack-years of smoking, and OC use (odds ratio [OR], 2.49; 99% CI, 1.42–4.37). Similarly, Yasui et alreported a history of endometriosis to be significantly associated with younger age at onset of menopause (median age at menopause onset, 50 years) after adjustment for age, age at menarche, number of pregnancies, current BMI, history of infertility, and ever smoking before menopause (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05–1.68). Although these findings are similar to the results of the current study, the study designs are different (cross-sectional with recalled age at menopause vs prospective cohort study), and the outcomes are defined differently (age at menopause in years vs dichotomized menopause before age 45 years). Unlike Yasui et al, we did not find that the association between endometriosis and ENM differed by history of infertility (attributed to ovulatory disorder). We believe that the present study expanded on these 2 previous investigations by using prospective data; applying a standard definition of ENM; and accounting for time-varying confounding by additional behavioral factors, such as physical activity, and by reproductive factors, such as menstrual cycle characteristics, parity, lactation, and duration of OC use, with the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^114Y6Saj]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Routine laboratory testing before endoscopy — recommendations — states the following: We recommend that endoscopists pursue preprocedure testing selectively based on the medical history, physical examination, and patient and procedural risk factors, and we recommend against routine testing with coagulation studies, chest radiography, electrocardiography, blood typing or screening, hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, urinalysis, and chemistry tests before endoscopy in healthy patients, noting that the use of these tests should be individualized based on patient and procedural risk factors. We suggest that pregnancy testing be considered before endoscopy and fluoroscopy use in female patients of childbearing age with an uncertain pregnancy history or a history suggestive of current pregnancy in the absence of a previous total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or absent menses for 1 year (menopause). We suggest that coagulation studies be performed before endoscopy in patients with active bleeding, a known or clinically suspected bleeding disorder, medication risk (eg, anticoagulant use, prolonged antibiotics), prolonged biliary obstruction, history of abnormal bleeding, malnutrition, or other conditions associated with acquired coagulopathies, and we suggest obtaining a chest radiograph before endoscopy in patients with new respiratory symptoms or decompensated cardiac failure. We recommend blood typing and screening before endoscopy when a blood transfusion is considered likely in patients with active bleeding or anemia, we suggest testing the hemoglobin/hematocrit before endoscopy in patients with preexisting anemia or ongoing bleeding or when there is a high risk of significant blood loss during the procedure, and we suggest selective chemistry testing before endoscopy in patients with significant endocrine, renal, or hepatic dysfunction before using medications that may further impair function.

### Practice bulletin No 182: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome [^112Mj8xp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer — follow-up after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy includes counseling on early menopause and hormone therapy: women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who undergo surgery by the recommended age of 35–45 years will experience early menopause with possible associated symptoms and may have long-term health outcomes of heart disease and bone loss; women who are unaffected by breast cancer should be offered hormone therapy to mitigate early menopause; limited data suggest that use of estrogen-only or combination hormone therapy for a few years does not significantly diminish the protective effect of risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy on breast cancer risk reduction, but the effect of long-term hormone therapy is not known, and there are only two small studies evaluating safety in this cohort.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^114Y3kAD]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Ovarian cancer — risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) considerations: Risk-reducing salpingectomy alone leaves individuals still at risk for developing ovarian cancer, and in premenopausal individuals oophorectomy reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but the magnitude is uncertain. Surgical risks include injury to the bowel, bladder, ureter, and vessels; for both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients at the time of RRSO, menopause symptoms may emerge, re-emerge, or worsen, and RRSO may have long-term impacts on sexual functioning and quality of life. Although limited data suggest hormone replacement therapy (HRT) likely does not increase risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers undergoing RRSO, the efficacy of HRT for symptom management in this population is debated. RRSO in premenopausal individuals increases risk of certain cardiovascular conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, asthma, osteoporosis, and mental health conditions.
