## Question

Antibiotic course for cellulitis lower extremity hospitalization

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal antibiotic course duration for lower-extremity cellulitis requiring hospitalization. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity classification that drives duration. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend for duration in nonpurulent cellulitis. Next, I will examine randomized and meta-analytic evidence comparing shorter versus longer courses. After that, I need to consider special populations and modifiers that might extend therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note uncertainties and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framing, because duration hinges on whether this is uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis versus complicated disease with abscess, necrosis, immunocompromise, or systemic toxicity. IDSA 2014 defines nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic signs as mild, with systemic signs as moderate, and with sepsis or severe compromise as severe, and it recommends at least 5 days of therapy with extension if not improved, which anchors the default duration for typical cases [^114pSATx] [^116PoWQe]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to hospitalized patients too; yes, IDSA's 5-day recommendation is for typical cellulitis and is commonly extrapolated to stabilized inpatients who are improving, while acknowledging that many hospitalized patients have moderate severity and comorbidities that may justify individualized durations [^114pSATx] [^116PoWQe].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on duration. The 2019 JAMA Dermatology systematic review and meta-analysis found no superiority of longer courses over shorter courses and concluded that extending therapy beyond 5 days lacked supportive evidence in cellulitis and erysipelas, supporting a 5-day default when patients are clinically improving [^111PYrVi]. Wait, let me verify whether this included hospitalized patients; the meta-analysis spans outpatient and inpatient data, and while heterogeneity exists, the absence of a duration benefit signal is consistent across trials, which supports applying 5 days as a baseline when patients respond clinically [^111PYrVi].

> I will now examine randomized data specific to hospitalized patients. The 2020 multicenter, double-blind DANCE trial tested 6 days versus 12 days of flucloxacillin after initial IV therapy in severe cellulitis requiring hospitalization and failed to show noninferiority for the primary endpoint, with a concerning signal for more relapses by day 90 in the 6-day arm (24% vs 6%), suggesting that in some hospitalized, more severe cases, longer therapy may reduce recurrence even if short-course therapy achieves initial cure [^112eJiED]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the trial was underpowered and confidence intervals were wide, so this is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, but it does raise a caution about blanket 5–6 day rules in severe inpatients [^112eJiED].

> Let me consider guideline convergence to reconcile these findings. IDSA 2014 recommends a minimum of 5 days with extension if not improved, which operationalizes a 5-day default with reassessment at 48–72 hours, and this remains the most authoritative anchor for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis even in the hospital setting when patients are stabilizing [^114pSATx] [^116PoWQe]. The American College of Physicians Best Practice Advice similarly endorses 5–6 days for nonpurulent cellulitis when patients can be monitored, aligning with stewardship principles [^111gsSaf]. But wait, what if the patient is severely ill or has slow response? WSES/SIS-E suggests 7–14 days individualized to clinical response, which is reasonable for moderate–severe disease or slow responders, and IDSA's MRSA guidance allows 5–10 days with individualization, reinforcing that extension is acceptable when clinically justified [^115KeBek] [^114Z8V8r].

> I should double-check special populations and modifiers that often accompany hospitalization. In obesity, underdosing and prolonged courses are common, yet data do not show benefit to longer durations solely for obesity, so I need to ensure weight-based dosing rather than automatic prolongation, especially for agents like clindamycin or TMP-SMX where underdosing is a recognized driver of failure [^114LXZYN] [^112FyTjX]. In diabetic foot soft-tissue infection without osteomyelitis, many experts accept 7–14 days, with some trials suggesting 7–10 days may suffice when source control and clinical response are adequate, so I should individualize rather than default to long courses [^117CGQ5R]. For immunocompromised hosts or those with slow clinical response, extending to 10–14 days can be reasonable, but I need to ensure I am not substituting duration for inadequate source control or misdiagnosis [^115KeBek].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most hospitalized adults with nonpurulent lower-extremity cellulitis who are clinically improving, a total of 5–6 days of active therapy is appropriate, with reassessment at 48–72 hours and extension only if there is inadequate response or special risk factors. This balances the meta-analytic signal of no duration benefit with the DANCE trial's recurrence concern in severe disease [^111PYrVi] [^112eJiED]. For patients with moderate severity, slow response, obesity with concern for underdosing, or significant comorbidities, 7–10 days is reasonable, and for severe infection or immunocompromise, 10–14 days may be justified, always tied to clinical trajectory rather than a fixed stop date [^115KeBek] [^114Z8V8r]. I should confirm that this aligns with stewardship data showing shorter, targeted courses reduce utilization without increasing failure, which supports defaulting short and extending selectively [^111BwCZv].

> I need to ensure I address route and transition planning, because duration is only one piece. Stable inpatients without contraindications can often complete therapy orally after 2–3 days of IV treatment, and meta-analytic data suggest oral therapy achieves comparable outcomes to IV when appropriately selected, which facilitates shorter total lengths of stay without compromising efficacy [^112gCWiy]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to the agents we use; yes, the comparative effectiveness data span oral beta-lactams and MRSA-active oral agents, supporting early IV-to-oral switch when clinically stable [^112gCWiy].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and monitoring. The DANCE trial's relapse signal warrants cautious interpretation given power limitations, and ongoing work suggests patient-specific recurrence risk tools may refine duration decisions in the future, so I should document objective response and reassess at 5–6 days to decide on extension rather than reflexively prolonging therapy [^112eJiED] [^112YD7cv]. I should also remember that misdiagnosis is common in lower-extremity erythema, so if the course is atypical or response is poor, I need to reconsider mimics like venous stasis, lymphedema, DVT, or gout before escalating duration or spectrum [^116qPMsz] [^115UMQFw].

> Bottom line, after verifying the evidence and guidelines, the default duration for hospitalized lower-extremity nonpurulent cellulitis that is responding clinically is 5–6 days, with extension to 7–10 days for moderate severity, slow response, or significant comorbidity, and 10–14 days reserved for severe infection or immunocompromise, always reassessing at 48–72 hours and transitioning to oral therapy when stable to minimize unnecessary exposure and length of stay [^114pSATx] [^111PYrVi] [^112eJiED] [^115KeBek].

For lower extremity cellulitis requiring hospitalization, **5–6 days of antibiotics** is standard if the patient is clinically improving, with extension to 10–14 days for slow response, severe infection, or immunocompromise [^116PoWQe] [^111gsSaf]. Use **IV beta-lactams** (e.g. cefazolin, nafcillin, ampicillin-sulbactam) for nonpurulent cases; add MRSA coverage (vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin) if risk factors are present or if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours [^112z7Dvu] [^111zAoE9]. Transition to oral therapy when stable, and tailor therapy to culture results if obtained [^115KeBek] [^112aNEXQ].

---

## Recommended antibiotic duration

- **Standard duration**: 5–6 days for clinically improving patients [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe].
- **Extended duration**: 10–14 days for slow response, severe infection, or immunocompromised patients [^115KeBek] [^114LP8SG].
- **Individualized duration**: Base on clinical response, comorbidities, and severity [^114TVReZ].

---

## Empiric antibiotic selection

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Nonpurulent cellulitis | IV beta-lactam (cefazolin, nafcillin, ampicillin-sulbactam) [^112z7Dvu] [^116QtZHg] |
| Purulent cellulitis or MRSA risk factors | Add MRSA coverage (vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin) [^111zAoE9] [^111FU7My] |
| Severe infection or sepsis | Broad-spectrum therapy (vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem) [^113PjKu3] [^115p3xNL] |

---

## Clinical response and adjustment

Reassess at **48–72 hours**; if there is no improvement, broaden coverage (e.g. add MRSA therapy) or evaluate for complications (abscess, necrotizing infection, osteomyelitis) [^112z7Dvu] [^1152eBNE]. Transition to oral therapy once the patient is clinically stable, afebrile, and able to tolerate oral medications [^115KeBek].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

- **Severity of infection**: Longer courses for severe disease or systemic toxicity [^115KeBek].
- **Clinical response**: Extend if slow or inadequate improvement [^116PoWQe].
- **Patient factors**: Immunocompromise, obesity, chronic edema, or poor wound care may require longer therapy [^notfound].
- **Complications**: Abscess, necrotizing infection, or osteomyelitis necessitate prolonged therapy and source control [^117CGQ5R].

---

## Evidence supporting shorter antibiotic courses

A systematic review and meta-analysis found **no difference in clinical response between shorter (≤ 7 days) and longer (≥ 10 days) antibiotic courses** for cellulitis, supporting shorter durations when patients improve clinically [^111PYrVi]. The **DANCE trial** suggested that 6 days of therapy may be noninferior to 12 days in hospitalized cellulitis, though relapse rates were higher in the 6-day arm, indicating the need for careful patient selection and follow-up [^112eJiED].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

Shorter courses (5–7 days) are effective for most patients, with **similar clinical response and lower risk of adverse effects** compared with longer courses [^111PYrVi]. Longer courses (10–14 days) are reserved for severe infection, slow response, or immunocompromise, with **no clear superiority over shorter courses** in uncomplicated cases [^111PYrVi].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA recommends **5–6 days of therapy for uncomplicated cellulitis**, extending to 10–14 days for severe infection, slow response, or immunocompromise [^116PoWQe] [^111gsSaf]. WSES/SIS-E advises **7–14 days**, individualized to clinical response and patient factors [^115KeBek].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Initial assessment**: Evaluate severity, systemic toxicity, and risk factors (e.g. MRSA, immunocompromise) [^114pSATx].
- **Empiric therapy**: Start IV beta-lactam; add MRSA coverage if indicated [^112z7Dvu] [^111zAoE9].
- **Reassessment**: At 48–72 hours, adjust therapy based on response and culture results [^112z7Dvu].
- **Transition**: Switch to oral therapy when stable [^115KeBek].
- **Total duration**: 5–6 days for improving patients; 10–14 days for severe or complicated cases [^111gsSaf] [^115KeBek].

---

The standard duration of antibiotics for lower extremity cellulitis requiring hospitalization is **5–6 days** if the patient is improving, with extension to 10–14 days for slow response, severe infection, or immunocompromise. Therapy should be individualized based on clinical response, severity, and patient factors.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: a systematic review [^111DTneb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no agreement on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics. This can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019. Outcomes of interest included the clinical response to antibiotic regimens (type, dose, route, duration) and the safety of antibiotics in LLC. Trial quality was identified using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Four RCTs were included. All included studies showed no significant differences between the clinical response to different antibiotic type, administration route, treatment duration or dose. LLC may be overtreated and shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC. Three studies were high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Applying a clinical prediction rule to distinguish lower… [^115UMQFw]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question How can a clinician best determine whether a patient with lower leg erythema has cellulitis. Evidence Summary Lower extremity cellulitis typically presents with acutely expanding erythema, warmth, edema, and tenderness. These signs and symptoms are nonspecific, making it difficult for clinicians to distinguish between true cellulitis and its mimics, many of which do not need treatment with antibiotics. Common mimics include contact dermatitis, venous stasis dermatitis, superficial thrombophlebitis, gout, and lymphedema but can also include more serious mimics such as deep venous thrombosis, necrotizing fasciitis, and septic arthritis. The ALT-70 clinical prediction rule has been validated prospectively, and it outperformed thermal imaging for the diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis in the emergency department.

The ALT-70 clinical prediction rule applies only to lower extremity cellulitis and does not apply to patients with surgery in the past 30 days, penetrating trauma, indwelling hardware at the site, burns, diabetic ulcers, abscess, known history of osteomyelitis, or intravenous antibiotic use in the 48 hours before the emergency department visit. 8 Testing positive for four of seven components was highly sensitive and specific for cellulitis, 8 but prospective validation with a full range of potential alternate diagnoses is needed. Applying the Evidence A 66-year-old patient presents to the emergency department with lower right leg redness that they noticed several days ago.

Their heart rate is 93 beats per minute, and they have erythema with some scaling over the mid shin measuring 5 in × 7 in. This area feels warm and appears mildly swollen, although the measured difference in calf size is only 0. 5 cm. Because of concerns for cellulitis, you order a complete blood count, which returns with a white blood cell count of 7, 800 per μL (7. 8 × 10.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Causes Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis, an infection in the subcutaneous tissues. This page focuses on one of the most common causes of cellulitis: Streptococcus pyogenes. S. pyogenes are also called group A Streptococcus. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread.

Medical conditions
- Chronic edema
- Impaired lymphatic drainage of the limbs
- Obesity
- Venous insufficiency Increased risk for repeat infections The following conditions increase a person's risk of recurrent cellulitis infections:

- Impaired lymphatic drainage of the limbs
- Venous insufficiency
- Due to saphenous vein removal for coronary artery bypass grafting. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^115z6nqP]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

Objectives

The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

Results

A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and 81 patients (16.3%) received both oral and IV antibiotics in the ED. A total of 102 (20.5%, 95% confidence [CI] = 17.2% to 24.2%) patients had treatment failures. Fever (temperature > 38°C) at triage (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 11.7), chronic leg ulcers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.2), chronic edema or lymphedema (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.2), prior cellulitis in the same area (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.5), and cellulitis at a wound site (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.0) were independently associated with treatment failure.

Conclusions

These risk factors should be considered when initiating empiric antibiotic therapy for ED patients with cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^116qPMsz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

### Costs and consequences associated with misdiagnosed lower extremity cellulitis [^113Hxubb]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Inflammatory dermatoses of the lower extremity are often misdiagnosed as cellulitis (aka "pseudocellulitis") and treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization. There is limited data on the cost and complications from misdiagnosed cellulitis.

Objective

To characterize the national health care burden of misdiagnosed cellulitis in patients admitted for treatment of lower extremity cellulitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study using patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) of a large urban hospital with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis between June 2010 and December 2012. Patients who were discharged with a diagnosis of cellulitis were categorized as having cellulitis, while those who were given an alternative diagnosis during the hospital course, on discharge, or within 30 days of discharge were considered to have pseudocellulitis. A literature review was conducted for calculation of large-scale costs and complication rates. We obtained national cost figures from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for 2010 to calculate the hospitalization costs per year attributed to misdiagnosed lower extremity pseudocellulitis.

Exposures

The exposed group was composed of patients who presented to and were admitted from the ED with a diagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient characteristics, hospital course, and complications during and after hospitalization were reviewed for each patient, and estimates of annual costs of misdiagnosed cellulitis in the United States.

Results

Of 259 patients, 79 (30.5%) were misdiagnosed with cellulitis, and 52 of these misdiagnosed patients were admitted primarily for the treatment of cellulitis. Forty-four of the 52 (84.6%) did not require hospitalization based on ultimate diagnosis, and 48 (92.3%) received unnecessary antibiotics. We estimate cellulitis misdiagnosis leads to 50 000 to 130 000 unnecessary hospitalizations and $195 million to $515 million in avoidable health care spending. Unnecessary antibiotics and hospitalization for misdiagnosed cellulitis are projected to cause more than 9000 nosocomial infections, 1000 to 5000 Clostridium difficile infections, and 2 to 6 cases of anaphylaxis annually.

Conclusions and Relevance

Misdiagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis is common and may lead to unnecessary patient morbidity and considerable health care spending.

### Route and duration of antibiotic therapy in acute cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and harms of antibiotic treatment [^112gCWiy]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Compared with guideline recommendations, antibiotic overuse is common in treating cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses on antibiotic route and duration of treatment for cellulitis in adults and children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries from inception to Dec 11, 2019 for interventional and observational studies of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis. Exclusions included case series/reports, pre-septal/orbital cellulitis and non-English language articles. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to produce summary relative risk (RR) estimates for our primary outcome of clinical response.

Prospero

CRD42018100602.

Results

We included 47/8423 articles, incorporating data from eleven trials (1855 patients) in two meta-analyses. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Only two trials compared the same antibiotic agent in each group. We found no evidence of difference in clinical response rates for antibiotic route or duration (RR(oral:IV) = 1.12, 95%CI 0.98–1.27, I² = 32% and RR(shorter:longer) = 0.99, 95%CI 0•96–1.03, I² = 0%, respectively). Findings were consistent in observational studies. Follow-up data beyond 30 days were sparse.

Conclusions

The evidence base for antibiotic treatment decisions in cellulitis is flawed by biased comparisons, short follow-up and lack of data around harms of antibiotic overuse. Future research should focus on developing patient-tailored antibiotic prescribing for cellulitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases, and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings, and BIOSIS Previews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions and mortality.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70. There were few previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes per study. Five of the six included trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in participants with cellulitis of the legs, and one assessed selenium in participants with cellulitis of the arms. Among the studies assessing antibiotics, one study evaluated oral erythromycin (n = 32) and four studies assessed penicillin (n = 481). Treatment duration varied from six to 18 months, and two studies continued to follow up participants after discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a follow-up period of up to one and a half to two years. Four studies were single-centre, and two were multicentre; they were conducted in five countries: the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. Based on five trials, antibiotic prophylaxis (at the end of the treatment phase ('on prophylaxis')) decreased the risk of cellulitis recurrence by 69%, compared to no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.72; n = 513; P = 0.007), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) six, (95% CI 5 to 15), and we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as moderate. Under prophylactic treatment and compared to no treatment or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence rate of cellulitis by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; four studies; n = 473; P value = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) and significantly decreased the rate until the next episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; three studies; n = 437; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence). The protective effects of antibiotic did not last after prophylaxis had been stopped ('post-prophylaxis') for risk of cellulitis recurrence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.52), incidence rate of cellulitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.36; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.74), and rate until next episode of cellulitis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; two studies; n = 287). Evidence was of low certainty. Effects are relevant mainly for people after at least two episodes of leg cellulitis occurring within a period up to three years. We found no significant differences in adverse effects or hospitalisation between antibiotic and no treatment or placebo; for adverse effects: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; four studies; n = 469; P = 0.48; for hospitalisation: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.57; three studies; n = 429; P = 0.47, with certainty of evidence rated low for these outcomes. The existing data did not allow us to fully explore its impact on length of hospital stay. The common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and diarrhoea; rash (severe cutaneous adverse reactions were not reported); and thrush. Three studies reported adverse effects that led to discontinuation of the assigned therapy. In one study (erythromycin), three participants reported abdominal pain and nausea, so their treatment was changed to penicillin. In another study, two participants treated with penicillin withdrew from treatment due to diarrhoea or nausea. In one study, around 10% of participants stopped treatment due to pain at the injection site (the active treatment group was given intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin). None of the included studies assessed the development of antimicrobial resistance or quality-of-life measures. With regard to the risks of bias, two included studies were at low risk of bias and we judged three others as being at high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of blinding.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of recurrence, incidence, and time to next episode, antibiotic is probably an effective preventive treatment for recurrent cellulitis of the lower limbs in those under prophylactic treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). However, these preventive effects of antibiotics appear to diminish after they are discontinued (low-certainty evidence). Treatment with antibiotic does not trigger any serious adverse events, and those associated are minor, such as nausea and rash (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is limited to people with at least two past episodes of leg cellulitis within a time frame of up to three years, and none of the studies investigated other common interventions such as lymphoedema reduction methods or proper skin care. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted, including long-term follow-up and other prophylactic measures.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. 1 Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation. 2

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. 3 Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. 4 This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. 5 Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. 6 However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. 7 A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research. 8

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower‐limb cellulitis.

We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower‐limb cellulitis only. Lower‐limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically indistinguishable from cellulitis.

A preliminary search found no previous systematic reviews that investigated the development or validation of diagnostic criteria or tools for cellulitis.

Cellulitis

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection primarily of the dermal lymphatics and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset impact with fever and raised white blood cell count. Outpatient therapy should be recommended for patients with adherence to therapy, who do not have general signs of inflammation or hemodynamic instability.

Patients with a previous attack of cellulitis, especially involving the legs, can present recurrences. The infection usually occurs in the same area as the previous episode. edema, especially lymphedema, venous insufficiency, prior trauma (including surgery) to the area, and tinea pedis can increase the frequency of recurrences. Addressing these factors may decrease the frequency of recurrences.

The pathogens involved are streptococci and S. aureus. Cellulitis associated with abscesses is usually caused by S. aureus. In contrast, typical (non-purulent) cellulitis is most commonly caused by both streptococcal species and S. aureus. MRSA is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

In neutropenic and immunocompromised patients, Gram-negative bacteria should be considered.

Treatment
Antibiotic therapy for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.

To investigate whether antibiotic treatment of 6 days' duration is non-inferior to treatment for 12 days in patients hospitalized for cellulitis.

Methods

This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial enrolled adult patients hospitalized for severe cellulitis who were treated with intravenous flucloxacillin. At day 6 participants with symptom improvement who were afebrile were randomized between an additional 6 days of oral flucloxacillin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified for diabetes and hospital. The primary outcome was cure by day 14, without relapse by day 28. Secondary outcomes included a modified cure assessment and relapse rate by day 90.

Results

Between August 2014 and June 2017, 151 of 248 included participants were randomized. The intention-to-treat population consisted of 76 and 73 participants allocated to 12 and 6 days of antibiotic therapy, respectively (mean age 62 years, 67% males, 24% diabetics); 38/76 (50.0%) and 36/73 (49.3%) were cured in the 12- and 6-day groups respectively (ARR 0.7 percentage points, 95%CI: -15.0 to 16.3). Cure rates were 56/76 (73.7%) and 49/73 (67.1%) with the modified cure assessment (ARR 6.6, 95%CI: -8.0 to 20.8). After initial cure without relapse, day 90 relapse rates were higher in the 6-day group (6% versus 24%, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Given the wide confidence intervals, we can neither confirm nor refute our hypothesis that 6 days of therapy is non-inferior to 12 days of therapy. However, a 6-day course resulted in significantly more frequent relapses by day 90. These findings require confirmation in future studies.

### ED management of cellulitis: a review of five urban centers [^111crurx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem presenting to the emergency department (ED). This study examines the epidemiology of cellulitis in 5 Canadian urban EDs and determines the practice variation in this management among sites. From computerized provincial ED diagnosis information, 10% of cellulitis charts from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998 were randomly selected for review. All 5 EDs in one urban region were sampled; physicians were unaware of the study when seeing patients. A standardized audit form was used to collect information pertaining to visits for the incident infection case. Cases were excluded if simple cellulitis was not the primary diagnosis or if procedures such as incision and drainage were initially required. A total of 416 adult charts were retrospectively identified. The mean age was 46 years and 61% were men; 38% had seen another physician before the ED presentation. Cellulitis was most commonly located in the upper (41%) and lower (48%) extremities. Most cases were treated with intravenous cefazolin (58%; range among sites: 49%-66%); however, over 25 different antibiotics and doses were initially prescribed. Each case required a median of 4 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1, 9) ED visits. Some patients (14%) received an increase in dose (3%) or a change in antibiotic regimen (11%) during their treatment. Few patients (3%) required a second change in regimen. Specialist consultations were obtained in only 6% of patients and hospitalization was rare (7%). The most common discharge prescription was oral cephalexin (62%); however; many different regimens were prescribed. Cellulitis is a common ED problem which consumes considerable resources to treat. Considerable practice variation exists with respect to in-ED and post-ED management. These results suggest the need for the development of practice guidelines for the treatment of this common ED problem.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^112sbGvU]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Lower limb cellulitis is a frequently encountered condition in the acute hospital setting, yet many patients with only mild lower limb cellulitis undergo unnecessary collection of blood cultures and X-ray imaging. This leads to increased healthcare costs and prolongation of the length of hospitalisation. A retrospective review of electronic medical records was performed to determine the frequency of blood cultures and lower limb X-rays performed for patients with lower limb cellulitis presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine and admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine, in a national tertiary hospital. Quality improvement methods were implemented to increase accessibility to and awareness of lower limb cellulitis management guidance among clinical staff, to empower appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis. The percentage of patient encounters with blood cultures performed subsequently improved from a baseline median of 73.3% to a post-intervention median of 52.3%, with direct healthcare cost savings and additional ancillary beneficial effects for patients and healthcare staff. However, no reduction in the frequency of imaging performed was observed, for which the opportunity arises for further root-cause analyses and intervention. Encouraging small changes in individual clinicians' routine daily clinical practice through quality improvement initiatives results in significant impacts when multiplied across healthcare staff and departments. Initiatives implemented need to be accessible, realistic and pragmatic to maximise real-world on the ground effects and facilitate a sustained impact.

Abstract

Lower limb cellulitis is a frequently encountered condition in the acute hospital setting, yet many patients with only mild lower limb cellulitis undergo unnecessary collection of blood cultures and X-ray imaging. This leads to increased healthcare costs and prolongation of the length of hospitalisation.

A retrospective review of electronic medical records was performed to determine the frequency of blood cultures and lower limb X-rays performed for patients with lower limb cellulitis presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine and admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine, in a national tertiary hospital.

Quality improvement methods were implemented to increase accessibility to and awareness of lower limb cellulitis management guidance among clinical staff, to empower appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis. The percentage of patient encounters with blood cultures performed subsequently improved from a baseline median of 73.3% to a post-intervention median of 52.3%, with direct healthcare cost savings and additional ancillary beneficial effects for patients and healthcare staff. However, no reduction in the frequency of imaging performed was observed, for which the opportunity arises for further root-cause analyses and intervention.

Encouraging small changes in individual clinicians' routine daily clinical practice through quality improvement initiatives results in significant impacts when multiplied across healthcare staff and departments. Initiatives implemented need to be accessible, realistic and pragmatic to maximise real-world on the ground effects and facilitate a sustained impact.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Development and validation of the baseline recurrence risk in cellulitis (BRRISC) score [^112YD7cv]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is the commonest form of non-purulent skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). In the United States (US), the overall incidence of SSTIs increased by 24% from 2000–2012, with the incidence in older adults almost doubling and associated healthcare costs tripling to $15 billion. While most patients with cellulitis respond well to antibiotics and mortality rates remain low, a substantial proportion (13–47%) experience recurrence of the infection within a year.,

Recommended treatment durations vary from 5–7 days, with advice to extend treatment if clinical improvement is not seen. However, the evidence base for antibiotic duration is weak. A meta-analysis of eight trials examining clinical response rates between patients with cellulitis treated with shorter versus longer antibiotic durations found no evidence of a difference between groups. However, agents in the shorter arms were often longer acting agents (e.g. azithromycin) or not commonly used for cellulitis in practice (e.g. quinolones), most patients had mild disease, and follow up did not extend beyond 30 days. In practice, > 75% of patients receive > 5 days of therapy, exceeding 14 days in almost one third of patients in one study.

The 'DANCE' trial overcame some of these limitations, comparing 6 versus 12 days of flucloxacillin for hospitalised patients with cellulitis with follow up to 90 days. While the trial was underpowered for the primary outcome of cure within 14 days, more recurrences occurred in the short treatment group by day 90 (24% versus 6%, p = 0.045). Although 76% of patients achieved a successful clinical outcome with short duration therapy, this highlights the potential for prolonged therapy after immediate clinical response to reduce risk of recurrence in some patients.

Observational studies which generally include more acutely unwell and comorbid populations than those recruited to clinical trials, demonstrate that patient susceptibility, illness severity and early clinical response predict clinical outcomes in cellulitis. Two small, retrospective studies have previously developed risk scores to identify patients at high risk for recurrent cellulitis but neither has been successfully externally validated.

Our primary objective was to develop and temporally validate a risk score to predict those at highest risk of cellulitis recurrence. A secondary objective was to describe antibiotic treatment for this population.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PYrVi]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, 5 trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% CI were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary end points, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

Results

A total of 43 studies with a total of 5999 evaluable participants, whose age ranged from 1 month to 96 years, were included. Cellulitis was the primary diagnosis in only 15 studies (35%), and in other studies the median(interquartile range) proportion of patients with cellulitis was 29.7% (22.9%-50.3%). Overall, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus did not add an advantage. Use of intravenous antibiotics over oral antibiotics and treatment duration of longer than 5 days were not supported by evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, only low-quality evidence was found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis; future trials need to use a standardized set of outcomes, including severity scoring, dosing, and duration of therapy.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Flucloxacillin alone or combined with benzylpenicillin to treat lower limb cellulitis: a randomised controlled trial [^113Dn4Sn]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether using intravenous benzylpenicillin in addition to intravenous flucloxacillin would result in a more rapid clinical response in patients with lower limb cellulitis.

Methods

This was a randomised controlled trial set in an inner city teaching hospital, comprising 81 patients with lower limb cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics. The main outcome measure was the mean number of doses of antibiotic required until clinical response.

Results

The mean number of doses required was 8.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.09 to 9.86) in the benzylpenicillin and flucloxacillin combined group. In the flucloxacillin only group it was 8.71 doses (95% CI 6.90 to 10.5), a mean difference of -0.24 doses (95% CI -2.48 to 2.01, p = 0.83). Other markers of treatment efficacy showed no difference between groups at review the following day; temperature decrease (mean difference -0.07 degrees C, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.62, p = 0.84), or diameter decrease of affected area (mean difference -34 mm, 95% CI -99 to 31, p = 0.30). Patient subjective assessments were also similar between the different drug regimen; improvement on a visual analogue scale of pain/discomfort from admission to first review (mean difference 10 mm, 95% CI -12.6 to 14.2, p = 0.91) and on second review (mean difference 15 mm, 95% CI -18.6 to 21.6, p = 0.88). Patient overall subjective feelings of improvement on first review (p = 0.32) and on second review (p = 0.64) were also similar.

Conclusions

This study provides no evidence to support the addition of intravenous benzylpenicillin to intravenous flucloxacillin in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis.

### Decreased antibiotic utilization after implementation of a guideline for inpatient cellulitis and cutaneous abscess… [^111BwCZv]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Because the clinical practice guideline was focused to the treatment of cellulitis or abscess requiring hospitalization without additional complicating factors, cases involving deep tissue infection, bacteremia, intensive care unit admission, diabetic ulcer or other chronic ulcer, peripheral arterial disease, recurrent cellulitis within 90 days, human or animal bite, severe cellulitis necessitating surgical debridement or fascial biopsy, necrotizing fasciitis, periorbital or perirectal involvement, and hospitalization, surgery, or long-term care facility residence within 90 days were excluded. The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. The final baseline cohort included 169 patients, and the intervention cohort included 175 patients. Overall, patients in the 2 time periods had similar demographic and clinical characteristics.

The lower or upper extremities were the predominant sites of infection. Markers of severity of illness — fever at presentation, failure of outpatient treatment, leukocytosis, and need for operative drainage in cases of abscess — were similar in each cohort and similar when stratified by classification of cellulitis or abscess. Although the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for patients hospitalized with cellulitis or cutaneous abscess is not known, the limited available evidence and extrapolation of data from the outpatient setting suggest that treatment durations of more than 7 to 14 days are not necessary. 3, 8, 14, 16–18 Similar to other institutions, 7 we demonstrated a median treatment duration of nearly 2 weeks in the baseline period. Implementation of the guideline promoting 7 days of therapy decreased the median duration of therapy by nearly 25%.

Moreover, patients were less likely to receive prolonged durations of therapy and more likely to receive a short course of therapy. Of importance, patients who received a short course of therapy were not more likely to experience clinical failure than those who received a long course of therapy. Our data suggest that short durations of therapy targeted to gram-positive pathogens decreases unnecessary antibiotic exposure without adversely affecting outcomes; however, clinical trials in this area are needed. In summary, implementation of a clinical practice guideline for inpatient cellulitis and cutaneous abscess led to shorter durations of more targeted antibiotic therapy and decreased use of health care resources without adversely affecting clinical outcomes. This broadly applicable intervention should be considered by hospitals and antibiotic stewardship programs to improve patient safety and decrease use of finite health care resources.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^115n4KRL]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Encouraging small changes in clinical practice can have significant impacts when effectively multiplied across many doctors and departments. Initiatives implemented need to be accessible, realistic and pragmatic, in order to maximise real-world on the ground effects and facilitate a sustained impact. Interventions need to be non-intrusive and tailored to ensure that no inadvertent adverse run-on effects negatively impact on pre-existing workflows and the experience of the end-users. This requires a thorough understanding of the underlying work processes of end-users, relevant physical and digital infrastructure and systems-based practices. Collaboration across clinical and non-clinical staff, at both junior and senior levels of seniority and across all the relevant clinical disciplines, is key to formulating this holistic understanding, to ensure the subsequent successful development and implementation of interventions and quality improvement policies. A well-chosen problem with carefully formulated interventions allows for significant direct and indirect benefits for patients, healthcare staff and healthcare systems as a whole.

This quality improvement initiative has demonstrated two interventions that may be potentially generalised for the rational management of other large volume and less clinically complex illnesses. Facilitating easy accessibility and clinicians' awareness of information is a necessary step that allows for existing management guidance to have a greater impact on clinical practice, and in particular, the incorporation of interventions directly into existing work processes without the need for additional steps is an effective and useful intervention for the busy clinician. Sustainability of interventions is key to ensure a continued long-term positive impact.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Urvcy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112z7Dvu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### The red leg dilemma: a scoping review of the challenges of diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis [^116n2Kdq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Presentations of suspected lower-limb cellulitis are commonly misdiagnoses, resulting in avoidable antibiotic prescribing or hospital admissions. Understanding the challenges posed in diagnosing cellulitis may help enhance future care.

Objectives

To examine and map out the challenges and facilitators identified by patients and health professionals in diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis.

Methods

A scoping systematic review was performed in MEDLINE and Embase in October 2017. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes. Quantitative data were summarized by narrative synthesis.

Results

Three themes were explored: (i) clinical case reports of misdiagnosis, (ii) service development and (iii) diagnostic aids. Forty-seven different pathologies were misdiagnosed, including seven malignancies. Two different services have been piloted to reduce the misdiagnosis rates of lower-limb cellulitis and save costs. Four studies have looked at biochemical markers, imaging and a scoring tool to aid diagnosis.

Conclusions

This review highlights the range of alternative pathologies that can be misdiagnosed as cellulitis, and emerging services and diagnostic aids developed to minimize misdiagnosis. Future work should focus on gaining a greater qualitative understanding of the diagnostic challenges from the perspective of patients and clinicians.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^117Pd3mv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was first to describe the early and late course after treatment initiation, including how rapidly the clinical and biochemical responses occur. Second, we wanted to examine early response dynamics in relation to underlying factors, etiology, and severity as well as antibiotic escalation and other outcomes. By limiting the study to cellulitis in a setting with low prevalence of BHS and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to first-line antibiotics, the study of early response in relation to baseline factors could be performed largely without influence of confounders such as need of surgical drainage or antibiotic resistance. The results may provide an improved basis for the assessment of early response and how initial response can be used in guiding continued treatment and predicting outcome.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^114TVReZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

### Risk factors for clinical failure in patients hospitalized with cellulitis and cutaneous abscess [^114LXZYN]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with clinical failure in patients hospitalized with cellulitis with or without abscess.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study among adults admitted for cellulitis/cutaneous abscess from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. Binary univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for clinical failure among evaluable patients.

Results

A total of 210 cases met inclusion criteria. Among 106 evaluable cases, clinical failure occurred in 34 (32.1%) patients. Weight over 100 kg (Odds ratio [OR] = 5.20, P = 0.01), body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 (OR 4.10, P = 0.02), inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy (OR = 9.25, P < 0.01), recent antimicrobial therapy (OR = 2.98, P = 0.03), and lower end of antibiotic dosing per treatment guidelines upon discharge (OR = 3.64, P < 0.01) were independent risk factors for clinical failure. Further subgroup analysis demonstrated that morbidly obese patients were at higher risk for clinical failure if they were discharged on a low oral dose of clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Inappropriate antimicrobial selection and dosing may adversely affect clinical outcomes among patients with cellulitis/cutaneous abscess. Obese individuals may be at particular risk for clinical failure secondary to inadequate dosing of antimicrobial therapy.

### Determining the optimal antibiotic duration for skin and soft tissue infections [^112FyTjX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optimal duration of therapy in SSTIs - a heterogeneous group of infections - remains unknown. The advances in knowledge of antibiotic duration of treatment in selected SSTIs that can impact clinical practice and published in the last 18 months are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence indicates that few patients receive guideline concordant empiric antibiotics and appropriate duration in the United States, although this likely can be extrapolated to other countries. One of the most commonly identified opportunities to improve antibiotic stewardship is duration of therapy more than 10 days. The long-standing debate regarding the significance of abscess size and its impact on clinical response to antibiotics, following proper drainage, is increasingly shifting towards the conclusion that abscess size is not directly associated with cure. In obese patients with SSTI, there is no benefit to longer antibiotic durations for SSTIs in patients with obesity, and it appears that longer antibiotic duration of therapy was associated with increased treatment failure. In diabetic foot infections (DFO), two randomized studies suggest that in the presence of osteomyelitis, the total duration of antibiotic therapy for patients treated nonsurgically does not need to be more than 6weeks. In a prospective, randomized, noninferiority, pilot trial, patients with DFO who underwent surgical debridement and received either a 3-week or 6-week course of antibiotic therapy had similar outcomes and antibiotic-related adverse events. In patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, successive observational studies clearly suggest that short duration of antibiotic treatment after NSTI source control is as well tolerated and effective as a longer course. It appears that 48h would be enough. The possibility of fixed versus individualized approaches to therapy for common bacterial infections, including SSTIs merits to be considered seriously. Fully individualized therapy may be an ideal approach to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of antimicrobials. Much more work is needed before this strategy becomes feasible.

Summary

There is increasing evidence that shorter duration of treatment is better in different types of SSTIs. Paradoxically, evaluation of real-life clinical practice indicates that long treatments continue to be commonly given to this population.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: results of the UK dermatology clinical trials network's PATCH II trial [^115M9d34]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Summary

Background

Cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg is a common, painful infection of the skin and underlying tissue. Repeat episodes are frequent, cause significant morbidity and result in high health service costs.

Objectives

To assess whether prophylactic antibiotics prescribed after an episode of cellulitis of the leg can prevent further episodes.

Methods

Double-blind, randomized controlled trial including patients recently treated for an episode of leg cellulitis. Recruitment took place in 20 hospitals. Randomization was by computer-generated code, and treatments allocated by post from a central pharmacy. Participants were enrolled for a maximum of 3 years and received their randomized treatment for the first 6 months of this period.

Results

Participants (n = 123) were randomized (31% of target due to slow recruitment). The majority (79%) had suffered one episode of cellulitis on entry into the study. The primary outcome of time to recurrence of cellulitis included all randomized participants and was blinded to treatment allocation. The hazard ratio (HR) showed that treatment with penicillin reduced the risk of recurrence by 47% [HR 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26–1.07, P = 0.08]. In the penicillin V group 12/60 (20%) had a repeat episode compared with 21/63 (33%) in the placebo group. This equates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of eight participants in order to prevent one repeat episode of cellulitis [95% CI NNT(harm) 48 to ∞ to NNT(benefit) 3]. We found no difference between the two groups in the number of participants with oedema, ulceration or related adverse events.

Conclusions

Although this trial was limited by slow recruitment, and the result failed to achieve statistical significance, it provides the best evidence available to date for the prevention of recurrence of this debilitating condition.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: a randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^117CGQ5R]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Virtually all infections of the foot in persons with diabetes involve the soft tissues. These soft tissue diabetic foot infections (ST-DFI) usually begin with superficial invasion of an ulcer or wound, but may progress contiguously to cellulitis, phlegmon, abscess, fasciitis, or osteomyelitis. – The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, which is considerably shorter than for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), is largely based on clinical experience. While there are some data concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy of non-amputated DFO, few studies have investigated the optimal duration for ST-DFI not accompanied by DFO. Many experts in the field recommend administering systemic antibiotic therapy for 1 to 3 weeks, with appropriate tissue debridement as needed. – The most recent recommendations of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot; state 1–2 weeks is adequate for most ST-DFIs. The recommendations of the 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are for 2–3 for moderate to severe ST-DFI (point 24 of recommendations), but urge decisions be based on the individual clinical response of therapy. Various reviews report antibiotic regimens for ST-DFI of relatively short (7–14 days)or relatively long durations (14–28 days). The results of our own retrospective study of 463 ST-DFIs did not define an optimal duration antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, but suggested that our current practice (median of 18 days for ST-DFI) might be too long. In that retrospective study, we failed to determine any minimal threshold for systemic antibiotics in ST-DFIs. The median duration of antimicrobial administration of 18 days statistically yielded to be too long regarding remission, because treatment durations as short as 7–10 days seemed to be enough, whenever the clinical evolution was favorable. Another study of patients with various types of cellulitis found that clinical remission rates were similar for those treated with 7 days of systemic antibiotic therapy compared to those who received longer treatment durations.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing recurrent cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1141Z1YZ]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Importance

A significant proportion of patients who have had a first episode of erysipelas or uncomplicated cellulitis will subsequently develop a recurrence. There is disagreement about how effective antibiotic prophylaxis is for preventing recurrent cellulitis.

Objective

To determine if antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing recurrent cellulitis compared to no prophylaxis using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Studies in any language identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, TRIP database, clinical practice guidelines websites, and ongoing trials databases up to 31st August 2012. Search terms included cellulitis, erysipelas, controlled clinical trial, randomized, placebo, clinical trials, randomly, and trial.

Study Selection

Only controlled trials comparing antibiotic prophylaxis to no antibiotic prophylaxis in patients age 16 years and above, and after 1 or more episodes of cellulitis, were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent extraction of articles was done by 2 investigators using predefined data extraction templates, including study quality indicators. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42012002528. Meta-analyses were done using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the number of patients with a recurrence of cellulitis. Secondary outcomes were (1) the time to next episode of recurrence, (2) quality of life measures, and (3) adverse events (e.g. allergic reactions, nausea).

Results

Five randomized controlled trials (n = 535), with 260 patients in the intervention arm and 275 in the comparator group met our inclusion criteria. 44 patients (8%) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 97 patients (18%) in the comparator group had an episode of cellulitis. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the number of patients having recurrent cellulitis, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.46 (95% CI 0.26–0.79). None of the studies reported severe adverse effects to antibiotics. There was methodological heterogeneity amongst the studies in terms of types of antibiotic used, delivery modes, number of recurrences of cellulitis at study entry, and study quality.

Conclusion and Relevance

Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent recurrent cellulitis. Future research should aim to identify the ideal type, dosage, and duration of antibiotics for prophylaxis, as well as to identify the group of patients who will benefit most from antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; P = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

Clinical Trials Registration

NCT00676130.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113nuWec]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing SSTIs (cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, Fournier's gangrene) require surgical intervention including drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue in addition to antibiotic therapy.

Several authors and organizations have proposed classification schemes for SSTIs based on such variables as anatomic location, rate of progression, depth of extension, and clinical presentation or severity. Each has key limitations both in assisting clinical management and in providing guidance for developing new therapeutic agents.

The consensus concluded that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or non-purulent), and the clinical conditions of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections.

Evidence synthesis and risk of bias assessment

All included studies were described in a narrative synthesis. To evaluate the methodological quality, all studies were assessed by two reviewers (M.P. and R.K. A.) using signalling questions in the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool, 12 with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (S. I.L. or E.B.‐T.). If the information was not clearly provided in the study, then the reviewers assessed the signalling question as 'unclear'.

For each domain, studies were judged as 'low risk' if all signalling questions were answered 'yes', 'high risk' if the answer to at least one signalling question was 'no', or 'unclear' in all other cases. 12

### Incidence of cellulitis in lower extremity burns: 6-year analysis [^114jB7hu]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with burn wounds of the lower extremities are at increased risk of developing cellulitis. The probability of developing burn-associated cellulitis is presumed to be correlated with a medical history of diabetes, the etiology of the burn, delay in hospitalization of the patient during their initial presentation, and depth of the burn itself. This study aims to identify factors that place patients at increased risk for developing lower extremity burn wound cellulitis.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of all Nassau University Medical Center Burn Center admissions from January 2010 to January 2016. All patients admitted with burns of any etiology isolated to the lower extremity were included in this study. Patients who were evaluated and followed as an outpatient were not included in this study. Pediatric patients less than or equal to 12 years of age were excluded from this study.

Results

Of the 218 admissions for lower extremity burns during the 6-year study period, 34% of patients developed cellulitis. Risk factors for developing lower extremity burn wound cellulitis included being male, greater depth of burn, and burn-to-admission delay. This was true in both univariate and multivariate analysis. total body surface area was a risk factor on univariate analysis but was not found to be an independent risk factor on multivariate analysis. No difference was observed in the development of cellulitis in patients discharged on oral antibiotics compared with those not given antibiotics.

Conclusions

Burn wound cellulitis is the second most common complication observed in burns. Identification of patients at risk for developing cellulitis is important. Admitting these patients at increased risk and excising and grafting the burned area is a reasonable solution in preventing this costly complication.

### Pathway with single-dose long-acting intravenous antibiotic reduces emergency department hospitalizations of patients with skin infections [^1131jXL1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection of patients

Patients were assessed in the ED and enrolled based on the same inclusion and exclusion criteria in both the usual care (February 2017 to January 2018) and the clinical pathway periods (March 2018 to March 2019). Enrollment criteria were created based on investigator consensus to identify patients with a moderately severe SSTI for whom parenteral therapy could be indicated due to infection severity, yet who, based on the judgment of the treating providers, could otherwise receive treatment in an outpatient setting.SSTIs were defined as skin lesions with erythema, swelling, tenderness, and/or drainage based on physical examination and categorized as follows: abscess was defined as a closed skin lesion found to have purulent exudate upon incision and drainage, cellulitis was defined as a closed skin lesion without evidence of a wound, and wound infection was defined as an open skin lesion. We estimated lesion area by measurement of the maximal length and perpendicular width of the infection, which was outlined by a tissue marker, using the formula for an ellipse (1/4 × π × length ×width).

We enrolled patients who were ≥ 18 years of age with abscess, cellulitis, or wound infection of known or suspected Gram‐positive etiology with an area of infection of ≥ 75 cm². Exclusion criteria included patients with an unstable comorbidity (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis, severe sepsis), immunosuppression, injection drug use and fever, pregnancy or breastfeeding, bilateral lower extremity involvement, severe neurological disorder, history of allergy to glycopeptide antibiotics, suspected Gram‐negative infection, infection likely to require broad‐spectrum antibiotics or more intensive care (e.g. infections associated with abdominal surgery, perirectal or perineal location, diabetic foot or decubitus ulcer, or animal or human bite or requiring drainage or debridement in the operating room or intensive care), known or suspected osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or endocarditis (Appendix 1). These enrollment criteria are consistent with the U.S. FDA's definition of an ABSSSI, for which dalbavancin treatment has been FDA‐approved. We also required eligible patients to be willing to return for evaluation and provide informed consent. A complete description of the enrollment criteria can be found in Appendix 1.

### Avoidable antibiotic exposure for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in the ambulatory care setting [^1137MrAc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent indications for outpatient antibiotics. A detailed understanding of current prescribing practices is necessary to optimize antibiotic use for these conditions.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adults treated in the ambulatory care setting for uncomplicated cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess between March 1, 2010 and February 28, 2011. We assessed the frequency of avoidable antibiotic exposure, defined as the use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity, combination antibiotic therapy, or treatment for 10 or more days. Total antibiotic-days prescribed for the cohort were compared with antibiotic-days in 4 hypothetical short-course (5–7 days), single-antibiotic treatment models consistent with national guidelines.

Results

A total of 364 cases were included for analysis (155 cellulitis, 41 wound infection, and 168 abscess). Antibiotics active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were prescribed in 61% of cases of cellulitis. Of 139 cases of abscess where drainage was performed, antibiotics were prescribed in 80% for a median of 10 (interquartile range, 7–10) days. Of 292 total cases where complete prescribing data were available, avoidable antibiotic exposure occurred in 46%. This included use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity in 4%, combination therapy in 12%, and treatment for 10 or more days in 42%. Use of the short-course, single-antibiotic treatment strategies would have reduced prescribed antibiotic-days by 19% to 55%.

Conclusions

Approximately half of uncomplicated skin infections involved avoidable antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic use could be reduced through treatment approaches using short courses of a single antibiotic.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111khPS9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" persist and can be useful in describing SSTIs as reported by Napolitano.

Uncomplicated SSTIs carry low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are improperly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to the most probable pathogen and local resistance patterns in impetigo, erysipelas, or mild cellulitis with drainage and debridement or simple surgical drainage in skin abscess.

Complicated SSTIs are associated with high risk for life-threatening infection. In patients who have complicated SSTIs, it is of paramount importance to initiate appropriate and adequate broad-spectrum initial empiric antibiotic therapy and to consider the need for surgical intervention for drainage and/or debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2: patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or are systemically well, but have a comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3: patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4: patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example necrotizing fasciitis.
