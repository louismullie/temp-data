Noro virus

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of norovirus covering epidemiology, transmission, clinical course, complications, diagnosis, management, and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologic agent and core virology. Then, I should verify the global burden and key epidemiologic features. Next, I will examine transmission dynamics and high-risk settings. After that, I need to detail the clinical presentation, incubation, and course in different populations. Then, I should review complications and at-risk groups. I will now examine diagnostic approaches and test performance. Next, I should review management principles and any off-label therapies. Finally, I will synthesize prevention strategies, outbreak control, and vaccine prospects, making sure each assertion aligns with guideline-level or high-quality evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the virologic basics: norovirus is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the Caliciviridae family, historically termed Norwalk-like viruses, with GII.4 variants typically predominating and evolving through immune escape, which complicates immunity and surveillance, and I should double-check that the most authoritative summaries agree with this framing before proceeding [^114ozXrj] [^115qzTen].

> Next, I should review the global burden to anchor severity and prioritization; norovirus causes roughly 685 million illnesses annually worldwide with substantial mortality, and in the U.S. alone estimates approach 19–21 million illnesses per year, about 56,000–71,000 hospitalizations, and 570–800 deaths, with a notable winter peak and even larger impact during pandemic strain years, which aligns with long-standing surveillance estimates and recent summaries [^116rHaLf] [^115wnS1y].

> I will now examine transmission dynamics, and I need to ensure I distinguish mechanistic plausibility from observed attack rates; the fecal–oral route is primary via person-to-person contact, contaminated food and water, and fomites, but aerosolized vomitus can seed short-range airborne spread, and healthcare and long-term care facilities experience frequent outbreaks with high attack rates and protracted durations, often exceeding two weeks, which reinforces the need for strict infection control in these settings [^1149QshZ] [^114EgNVM].

> Let me think about clinical presentation next; incubation is typically 12–48 hours, with abrupt onset of vomiting, non-bloody diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and occasional low-grade fever, and in otherwise healthy hosts illness usually resolves within 1–3 days, although children more often have diarrhea and adults more often vomit, so I should be careful to set expectations by age while reminding myself that severe dehydration and complications can occur at the extremes of age or in the immunocompromised [^111K6eJC] [^112Nxmb7].

> Hold on, I should verify risk stratification and complications; infants and young children have high incidence and can develop severe dehydration, the elderly have higher mortality and prolonged symptoms, and immunocompromised patients may develop chronic norovirus enteropathy with weight loss and malabsorption, with documented prolonged shedding and even superinfections or relapses; rare neurologic complications such as benign infantile convulsions and encephalopathy have been reported, and although uncommon, they underscore the need to consider seizures and altered mental status in the right context [^115wnS1y] [^111grxJU] [^11629CXW] [^114XWx2T] [^112z2nTP] [^111wB74m].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach; routine testing is not required for mild cases, but RT-PCR is the gold standard for outbreak investigations, severe disease, or immunocompromised hosts, with high sensitivity and specificity, whereas antigen immunoassays are rapid but less sensitive and prone to false negatives, and multiplex NAATs can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and ideally paired with epidemiologic criteria for outbreaks when applicable [^114cTUk3] [^113TfNu8].

> I need to check management principles carefully; there are no FDA-approved antivirals, so care is supportive with oral rehydration for mild disease and IV fluids for moderate to severe dehydration, and I should emphasize that antibiotics are ineffective and often inappropriately prescribed in long-term care outbreaks, while in immunocompromised patients with persistent infection, off-label options such as ribavirin, nitazoxanide, or enterally administered immunoglobulin have case-level evidence but remain investigational and should be individualized with multidisciplinary input [^1151EKke] [^114d1gxq] [^1138JRJ2] [^117DFN46] [^114ozXrj] [^116Bndch].

> Let me reconsider prevention and outbreak control to ensure alignment with guidelines; hand hygiene with soap and water is preferred over alcohol-based rubs because of norovirus's non-enveloped structure, ill food handlers should be excluded for at least 48 hours after symptom resolution, and healthcare facilities should implement contact precautions, cohorting, and rigorous environmental disinfection with chlorine-based agents, with public health authorities engaged early for outbreak coordination and molecular typing [^112b4ZyA] [^114tjH3r] [^114EgNVM] [^112o1WW5].

> But wait, what about vaccines; I should confirm the current status and not overstate readiness; multiple norovirus vaccine candidates are in clinical development, targeting dominant GII.4 lineages and leveraging HBGA-blocking antibody correlates of protection, yet no product is licensed, so vaccine impact remains prospective and will depend on breadth of protection across genotypes and durability in high-risk populations [^114kN4q5] [^115xwCC8].

> Finally, I should double-check that my synthesis reflects the key evidence gaps and practical takeaways; norovirus remains a leading global cause of acute gastroenteritis with outsized impact in young children, older adults, and immunocompromised hosts, transmission is efficient via multiple routes with healthcare settings particularly vulnerable, diagnosis should be molecular when it changes management, supportive care is the mainstay, and prevention hinges on hand hygiene, exclusion policies, and outbreak control, with vaccine development advancing but not yet available for deployment [^116rHaLf] [^114EgNVM] [^114cTUk3] [^1151EKke] [^114tjH3r] [^114kN4q5].

---

Norovirus is a **highly contagious virus** that causes acute gastroenteritis with sudden vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, typically resolving within 1–3 days [^111K6eJC]. It spreads via the **fecal–oral route** through contaminated food, water, surfaces, and aerosolized vomitus, with a very low infectious dose enabling rapid outbreaks in closed settings [^1111YQ1v] [^114kN4q5]. Diagnosis is clinical; RT-PCR is the gold standard for outbreak or research use, while antigen assays are rapid but less sensitive [^114cTUk3]. Management is supportive with rehydration; no antivirals or vaccines are approved, though candidates are in trials [^1151EKke] [^114kN4q5]. Prevention relies on hand hygiene, food safety, and surface disinfection, with heightened vigilance in healthcare and long-term care facilities [^111K6eJC] [^114EgNVM].

---

## Virology and pathogenesis

Norovirus is a **non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus** in the Caliciviridae family [^1111YQ1v]. The capsid confers environmental stability and resistance to common disinfectants, facilitating transmission [^115FKnv4]. Infection targets enteroendocrine cells in the small intestine, driving vomiting and diarrhea through neuroimmune pathways rather than direct epithelial destruction [^112hTXK7].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Incubation**: 12–48 hours after exposure [^111K6eJC].
- **Symptoms**: Sudden onset of vomiting, watery non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, and occasional low-grade fever [^112Nxmb7].
- **Duration**: Typically 1–3 days; longer in immunocompromised hosts [^111grxJU].
- **Complications**: Dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and immunocompromised patients; rare neurologic events (e.g. seizures, encephalopathy) [^111fvyeV].

---

## Transmission

- **Primary route**: Fecal–oral via contaminated food, water, surfaces, and person-to-person contact [^1111YQ1v].
- **Aerosolization**: Vomitus can generate infectious aerosols, aiding spread [^1111YQ1v].
- **Infectious dose**: Very low (10–100 virions), enabling efficient transmission [^notfound].
- **Settings**: Outbreaks cluster in healthcare, long-term care, childcare, restaurants, and cruise ships [^114kN4q5] [^114tjH3r] [^1111YQ1v].

---

## Epidemiology

Globally, **norovirus** causes ~685 million cases and 200,000 deaths annually, with the highest burden in low-income countries [^116rHaLf]. In the United States, it accounts for ~19–21 million illnesses, **56,000–71,000 hospitalizations**, and 570–800 deaths yearly [^115wnS1y]. Norovirus circulates year-round with a winter peak and exhibits high genetic diversity, particularly within **GII.4**, which drives periodic surges [^114kN4q5].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on acute vomiting and diarrhea in the absence of blood [^114b2r6T].
- **Laboratory testing**: RT-PCR is the gold standard for outbreak or research use; antigen assays are rapid but less sensitive [^114cTUk3].
- **Multiplex panels**: Useful in outbreak or complex cases but may detect low-level shedding in asymptomatic individuals [^notfound].

---

## Treatment

Management is **supportive**, emphasizing rehydration with oral solutions or IV fluids for severe dehydration [^1151EKke]. Antiemetics and antidiarrheals may be used cautiously in selected patients. No antivirals are approved; ribavirin, nitazoxanide, and oral immunoglobulin have limited, low-quality evidence and are not standard care [^115M3Cwj].

---

## Prevention and control

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing with soap and water (alcohol-based rubs are less effective) [^111K6eJC].
- **Food safety**: Cook shellfish thoroughly; wash produce; exclude ill food handlers for ≥ 48 hours after recovery [^114tjH3r].
- **Surface disinfection**: Use chlorine-based agents (≥ 1,000 ppm) for contaminated surfaces [^notfound].
- **Outbreak control**: Isolate symptomatic individuals, restrict movements, and coordinate with public health authorities [^114EgNVM].

---

## Vaccine development

Currently, **no vaccines are licensed**; several candidates targeting GII.4 are in phase I/II trials, with challenges including short-lived immunity and strain diversity [^114kN4q5].

---

Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and efficient transmission. Management is supportive, and prevention hinges on hygiene, food safety, and outbreak control; **vaccines remain under development** [^114kN4q5].

Noroviruses are a major cause of sporadic cases and epidemic outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The development of molecular diagnostic assays has led to an increased recognition of the significance of these viruses as causes of gastroenteritis in all age groups. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of norovirus infection, and it describes the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disease.

### Viral gastroenteritis [^116UtX9W]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Since the discovery of norovirus in 1972 as a cause of what was contemporarily known as acute infectious non-bacterial gastroenteritis, scientific understanding of the viral gastroenteritides has continued to evolve. It is now recognised that a small number of viruses are the predominant cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, in both high-income and low-income settings. Although treatment is still largely restricted to the replacement of fluid and electrolytes, improved diagnostics have allowed attribution of illness, enabling both targeted treatment of individual patients and prioritisation of interventions for populations worldwide. Questions remain regarding specific genetic and immunological factors underlying host susceptibility, and the optimal clinical management of patients who are susceptible to severe or prolonged manifestations of disease. Meanwhile, the worldwide implementation of rotavirus vaccines has led to substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality, and spurred interest in vaccine development to diminish the impact of the most prevalent viruses that are implicated in this syndrome.

### Norovirus infection in immunocompromised hosts [^11629CXW]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis caused by noroviruses often has a duration of 2–3 days and is characteristically self-limiting. In contrast, chronic infection caused by noroviruses in immunocompromised individuals can last from weeks to years, making clinical management difficult. The mechanisms by which noroviruses establish persistent infection, and the role of immunocompromised hosts as a reservoir for noroviruses in the general human population, are not known. However, study of this patient cohort may lead to new insights into norovirus biology and approaches to treatment.

### Norovirus infections in a tertiary care centre-individual cases do not necessarily lead to an outbreak [^111RTxgh]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Norovirus is responsible for the majority of gastroenteritis outbreaks within healthcare settings. Routes of spread include foodborne-, waterborne- and especially person-to-person transmissions.

Objective

We investigated the overall attack rate of norovirus, within and outside outbreak situations, transmitted via patient-to-patient contact in a tertiary care centre from January 2012 to March 2015.

Study Design

We monitored exposed asymptomatic patients next to infectious patients for the development of symptoms of acute gastroenteritis following exposure.

Results

We detected 102 patients with contact to 94 infectious patients. Of these only 11 patients developed typical norovirus symptoms after exposure while 91 patients remained asymptomatic. Total secondary attack rate was only 10.8%.

Conclusions

Patient-to-patient transmission of norovirus is potentially overestimated within clinical settings. Future prevention strategies should consider personal risk factors of exposed patients.

Diagnosis

Norovirus may be suspected based on symptoms, but routine testing is not usually conducted outside of outbreak investigations. Laboratory confirmation of norovirus is generally not necessary in clinical settings, although it may be useful in select situations, for example in immunocompromised patients with severe or persistent symptoms or for public health purposes during outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The most widely used method is reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which provides high sensitivity and specificity, can estimate viral load in stool samples, and can discriminate between pathogens. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) can also be used to diagnose norovirus AGE in stool samples but have poor sensitivity. Ideally, stool specimens should be collected < 2–3 days from symptom onset and frozen or refrigerated to ensure nucleic acid integrity.

Clinical and epidemiologic criteria are commonly used to identify outbreak cases. Outbreaks of AGE can be attributed to norovirus when there is a mean (or median) illness duration of 12–60 h; a mean (or median) incubation period of 24–48 h; vomiting in > 50% of individuals; and no enteric bacteria found.

Conclusion

The clinical course of almost all infected residents was typical for NG. Approximately 75% of the infected residents were administered some type of medication, most commonly infusions and antibiotics, with the highest cost being associated with antibiotics. Although the costs of the drugs were not very high, the appropriateness of different drug treatments should be examined.

### The molecular pathology of noroviruses [^116ui84x]. The Journal of Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Norovirus infection in humans typically results in acute gastroenteritis but may also occur in many animal species. Noroviruses are recognized as one of the most common causes of acute gastroenteritis in the world, being responsible for almost 20% of all cases. Despite their prevalence and impact, our knowledge of the norovirus life cycle and the pathological processes associated with norovirus-induced disease is limited. Whilst infection of the intestine is the norm, extraintestinal spread and associated pathologies have also been described. In addition, long-term chronic infections are now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge with respect to norovirus pathology and the underlying mechanisms that have been characterized to date.

Norovirus and rotavirus in high-risk populations — chronic and severe norovirus infection has been reported in patients receiving immunosuppression following organ transplantation, and patients who acquire norovirus infection while hospitalized, especially people with immunocompromising conditions and people of advanced age, may be more likely to die. Persistent non-vaccine-related and vaccine-related rotavirus diarrhea has been reported in young children with primary immunodeficiency, but rotavirus disease and hospitalizations overall have been reduced markedly since licensure of the 2 ACIP-recommended rotavirus vaccines.

3 Clinical observation

The most prevalent symptoms associated with norovirus infection include emesis and diarrhea, occasionally accompanied by nausea, abdominal discomfort, cramping, anorexia, malaise, and low-grade pyrexia. Common complications may encompass benign seizures, febrile seizures, convulsions, necrotizing enterocolitis as well as exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. Detection of respiratory secretions from children presenting with respiratory symptoms revealed that norovirus may also be implicated in respiratory diseases. Additionally, there have been reported cases where mild meningoencephalitis can be attributed to norovirus infection based on clinical manifestations.

The main symptoms associated with norovirus infection exhibited variability among individuals, with a higher prevalence observed in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Studies have indicated that young children exhibit more severe symptoms, with the establishment of protective immunity to prevent re-infection typically occurring before the age of 2 years. The primary manifestations of diarrhea in infants under 1 year old include watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, convulsions, and potentially fatal outcomes in severe cases.

In addition, the patients with norovirus gastroenteritis accompanied by convulsions also experience transient vomiting (lasting for approximately 2 days) in the absence of fever. For patients with immunocompetent norovirus gastroenteritis, the incubation period of infection is typically short, usually ranging from 24 to 48 h. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which generally resolve within a span of 72 h.

Furthermore, the various strains of the virus would exhibit distinct clinical manifestations. According to previous studies, the GII genotype is globally prevalent in human norovirus infections, while the GI genotype is only observed in a limited number of cases. Considering seasonal variations, the prevalence of GI genotypes is primarily observed during spring, whereas GII genotypes are predominant during autumn. Compared to other genotypes, norovirus GII infection is associated with a higher incidence of severe diarrhea and vomiting. Additionally, a greater proportion of patients infected with genotype GI experienced symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea lasting less than 3 days, and increased bowel sounds.

The comprehension of dominant strains and their correlation with clinical manifestations will facilitate the enhancement of clinical diagnosis accuracy and the development of evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies.

### Advances in human norovirus research: vaccines, genotype distribution and antiviral strategies [^115qzTen]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Norovirus, belonging to the Caliciviridae family, is a non-enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. It is widely acknowledged as a significant etiological agent responsible for non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis and considered a major cause thereof. Norovirus is primarily tranmitted via fecal-oral route, but can also be transmitted via airborne routes. Clinical manifestations often include symptoms associated with acute gastroenteritis, like nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, and others. Due to the specific pathogenic mechanism of the virus, and genomic diversity, there are currently no preventive vaccines or effective antiviral drugs available for treating norovirus-induced acute gastroenteritis infections. The management of such infections mainly relies on oral rehydration therapy while prevention necessitates adherence to personal hygiene measures. The present paper discusses the nature, transmission route, clinical manifestations, immune response mechanism, and vaccine research of Norovirus. The objective of this review manuscript is to systematically gather, analyze, and summarize recent research and investigations on norovirus in order to enhance our understanding of its characteristics and pathogenesis. This not only facilitates subsequent researchers in acquiring a more expedited and comprehensive grasp of the existing knowledge about norovirus but also provides clearer directions and goals for future studies.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^117MufGs]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective medical record review showed the clinical pictures, treatment, and medical resource use related to NG outbreaks at 19 typical geriatric facilities in Japan. From 2009 to 2011, there were 8 NG outbreaks in 6 facilities (32%), resulting in 146 infected residents. Analysis of the medical records of 107 infected residents in 5 of these facilities yielded the following results: 106 (99%) infected residents presented with primary symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea; 84 (79%) presented with associated symptoms; median symptom duration was 4 days; and approximately 70% of infected residents were diagnosed on the basis of symptom progression alone. Isolation circumstances varied between facilities. Approximately 75% of infected residents received treatment, most commonly infusions and antibiotics. The median antibiotic cost was about twice the all-drug cost.

Almost all of the infected residents presented with vomiting and diarrhea, and approximately 80% presented with associated symptoms, including decreased appetite, fever of 37 °C or greater, and general malaise, over a median symptom duration of 4 days. In a study of 7 LTCFs in the United States where outbreaks of NG occurred between 2009 and 2013, 40 of the 62 patients were aged 70 years or older, all of the infected residents aged 70 years or older presented with vomiting and diarrhea, and median symptom duration was 4 days. Up to this point, no studies in Japan or other Asian countries have investigated the clinical course of NG in multiple facilities for elderly persons based on medical records, making the present study the first of its kind. The clinical course of NG in facilities in this study was found to be nearly consistent with that previously reported for facilities in the United States.

### Unrecognized norovirus infections in health care institutions and their clinical impact [^113U18BU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Noroviruses (NoVs) have emerged as the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis (GE) in humans. Although diagnostic facilities have greatly improved, significant underdiagnosis of NoV in hospitals may still occur, thereby increasing clinical burden and nosocomial spread. We evaluated the underdiagnosis of sporadic NoV infections in a tertiary care hospital and estimated its clinical impact. From December 2008 until July 2009, fecal samples specifically referred for bacterial but not viral examination were retrospectively tested for NoV by real-time PCR. The clinical and virological data from patients with undiagnosed NoV infection (missed patients) were evaluated and compared with those from patients with recognized NoV. During the study period, 45 patients with undiagnosed NoV were detected, whereas 50 patients were regularly diagnosed. The missed NoV cases were more frequently adults than children (80% versus 46%; P < 0.001). The viral load levels did not differ between the diagnosed and missed patients, but missed patients more frequently presented without diarrhea (20% versus 4%; P < 0.07). The newly admitted missed NoV cases with GE underwent more diagnostic imaging (24% versus 4%; P < 0.01) and tended to be hospitalized longer. When missed-NoV patients were included, the number of nosocomial clusters doubled and missed patients were index cases in 5 of the 6 clusters. These data indicate that NoV infections are frequently missed despite routine laboratory testing and demonstrate that underdiagnosis of NoV patients is associated with costly abdominal imaging and nosocomial clustering. Awareness of NoV infection in adult patients and education about the importance of viral GE should be increased.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^114SArro]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Giardia sp. norovirus, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. are predominant etiological agents of infectious gastroenteritis in individuals with CVID. Symptoms are typically nonspecific and vary from self‐limiting to chronic or refractory gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, and weight loss. A favourable correlation exists between Giardia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter infections in CVID patients exhibiting undetectable serum IgA levels, which is expected considering the recognized function of IgA in mucosal immunity. Norovirus and cytomegalovirus infections seldom possess clinical relevance in immunocompetent individuals; nonetheless, their sequelae might be severe in cases of CVID.

Norovirus gastroenteritis is a predominant cause of gastroenteritis globally. Its prevalence has been determined to be 7% among CVID patients. Norovirus impacts 19% of the global population; however, it has been detected in up to 100% of individuals with CVID enteropathy. Chronic norovirus infections have been recognized as a cause of CVID enteropathy. Consequently, individuals with CVID and concomitant norovirus infections must be actively followed for symptom remission, and alternate treatments should be contemplated if infections persist.

However, currently, there is no established conventional therapy for chronic norovirus infection resulting in CVID enteropathy. In the absence of systematic comprehensive studies, we must depend solely on case reports. We recently diagnosed and successfully treated a patient with CVID‐associated enteropathy related to chronic norovirus infection, which constitutes the central focus of this review. Our objective is to provide a concise overview of this distinct form of primary immunodeficiency, drawing on the current — albeit still incomplete — body of knowledge.

### Noroviruses everywhere: has something changed? [^1176UWCQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noroviruses causing gastroenteritis in humans have increasingly been described in both the scientific literature and the lay press. This review summarizes new information about where and why these viruses are detected as well as new developments to prevent or treat these infections.

Recent Findings

Noroviruses are highly infectious and quite stable. Noroviruses infect all age groups, with particularly severe disease occurring in young children, the elderly, and persons with chronic diseases. Noroviruses also cause persistent infections in immunosuppressed patients. Host susceptibility factors have been identified, including histo-blood group antigens that likely function as initial receptors for some noroviruses. The patterns of susceptibility are complex, however, and not completely understood for all virus strains. X-ray crystallographic information on the virus capsid and other viral-encoded proteins provides targets for structure-based drug development.

Summary

The availability of new methods of detecting noroviruses has resulted in increased detection of these pathogens. Advances in understanding of virus replication and structure should lead to development of strategies to prevent and treat these infections. Such efforts may be challenged by the emergence of new virus strains that appear through mechanisms that remain to be understood.

### Epidemiological and clinical features of norovirus gastroenteritis in outbreaks: a population-based study [^113Bzuz8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Noroviruses are the most frequent cause of acute gastroenteritis in the community. In Catalonia, it is not clear how this type of viral gastroenteritis is evolving, and the objective of this prospective population-based study was to describe the incidence and epidemiological and clinical features of outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis due to norovirus in Catalonia between October 2004 and October 2005. Incidence rates were calculated using the estimated population of Catalonia in 2005. For each outbreak, the mode of transmission, the number of persons affected, demographic variables, clinical presentation, the date and time of onset of symptoms and the duration of symptoms, physician visits and hospitalizations were collected. Sixty viral outbreaks affecting 1791 people were identified, with no distinct seasonality. The mean number of outbreaks per month was 4.6. The global incidence was 24.6 per 100 000 person-years. The incidence was higher in women (25.7 per 100 000 person-years) and in the 5–11 years (52.4 per 100 000 person-years) and ≥ 65 years (42.4 per 100 000 person-years) age groups. The prevalence of vomiting, abdominal pain and general malaise was higher in children and adolescents, whereas the prevalence of diarrhoea and myalgia was higher in adults. These results suggest that norovirus infection has an important public health impact in Catalonia and that prevention strategies should be designed and implemented.

### Chronic norovirus infection and common variable immunodeficiency [^1138JRJ2]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic infection with norovirus is emerging as a significant risk for patients with immunodeficiency - either primary or secondary to therapeutic immunosuppression. Patients with primary immunodeficiency present a range of pathological responses to norovirus infection. Asymptomatic infections occur and differentiating viral carriage or prolonged viral shedding after self-limiting infection from infection causing protracted diarrhoea can be challenging, due to relatively mild pathological changes that may mimic other causes of diarrhoea in such patients (for instance pathogenic bacteria or parasites or graft-versus-host disease). However, a subset of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) experience a severe norovirus-associated enteropathy leading to intestinal villous atrophy and malabsorption. Symptomatic infection of up to 8 years has been demonstrated with clinical and histological recovery on viral clearance. Although oral immunoglobulins and nitazoxanide have been used to treat noroviral infections associated with immunosuppression, ribavirin is the only agent to date that has been linked to viral clearance in the Noroviral enteropathy associated with CVID.

5 Diagnostic Considerations

5.1 CVID

The diagnosis of CVID is frequently difficult due to its diverse clinical manifestations and the lack of universally recognized diagnostic criteria. The latest International Consensus Document (ICON) guidelines define five criteria necessary for diagnosis. (1) Serum IgG levels exceeding two standard deviations below the age‐adjusted reference range, confirmed on a minimum of two occasions separated by more than 3 weeks unless levels are severely diminished (< 100–300 mg/dL, contingent on age); (2) a concurrent reduction in either IgA or IgM; (3) compromised antibody responses to vaccination; (4) age exceeding 4 years; and (5) exclusion of secondary aetiologies of hypogammaglobulinemia.

The diagnostic criteria put forward by the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) vary in numerous significant respects. The ESID definition mandates a reduction in IgA, and the assessment of switched memory B cells (with levels below 70% of the age‐specific reference range) may act as a substitute for vaccination response evaluation. Furthermore, it is essential to establish the lack of significant T‐cell deficiency, and patients must exhibit at least one clinical manifestation, including heightened vulnerability to infections, autoimmune disorders, granulomatous inflammation, unexplained polyclonal lymphoproliferation, or a familial history of antibody deficiency. Tables 1 and Table 2 summarise the most commonly used diagnostic criteria for CVID.

### Epidemiology and risk factors of norovirus infections among diarrhea patients admitted to tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh [^111ASJCD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Platts–Mills and McQuade on pages 814–7.)

Noroviruses are a leading cause of endemic and epidemic acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among people of all ages worldwide. Although norovirus infections can be asymptomatic and are mostly associated with a mild and self-limited gastrointestinal illness, they can lead to severe dehydrating diarrhea in young children and the elderly and to chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. Annually, the estimated global costs of hospital care and lost productivity from norovirus infections is $60 billion.

Because of the high burden of noroviruses, the development of norovirus vaccines has become a high priority, and several norovirus vaccines are currently in clinical trials. Data on the disease burden and genotypic diversity of noroviruses and at-risk populations are needed to inform the implementation of targeted interventions, such as vaccines. Such data are not well defined in developing countries, including Bangladesh, where data are primarily available for young age groups or restricted to a few settings. In addition, in several high-endemic settings, definitive attribution of noroviruses as the etiologic agent of diarrheal episodes has been challenging owing to frequent detection of noroviruses in stool specimens from non-AGE controls.

We conducted a case-control study at 10 hospitals located across 7 of the 8 divisions of Bangladesh, with the following aims: (1) to compare the prevalence of norovirus in hospitalized AGE case patients and non-AGE controls; (2) to describe the clinical presentation of norovirus-associated AGE in hospitalized children and adults; (3) to assess the diversity of circulating norovirus genotypes; and (4) to identify risk factors associated with norovirus AGE hospitalization.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^115M3Cwj]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency, characterised by impaired antibody production, immune dysregulation, and a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Gastrointestinal involvement is frequent, affecting up to 20% of patients and significantly contributing to morbidity and mortality. Among infectious triggers, norovirus plays a particularly important role, as persistent infection may drive chronic inflammation and contribute to the development of CVID-associated enteropathy, a severe non-infectious complication marked by chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, and weight loss. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving impaired humoural immunity, absent mucosal IgA, and aberrant T- and B-cell interactions, resulting in defective viral clearance and sustained mucosal injury. Although viral eradication has been shown to induce clinical and histological improvement, no standardized therapeutic strategy currently exists. Intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement fails to adequately protect against gastrointestinal infections, and off-label antivirals such as ribavirin, nitazoxanide, or interferon alpha have yielded inconsistent results. Oral administered immunoglobulin preparations have shown variable efficacy in case reports, reflecting differences in viral genotypes, host susceptibility, and donor antibody repertoires. In this review, we summarise current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnostic considerations of CVID-associated enteropathy linked to chronic norovirus infection, with a special focus on therapeutic aspects. We also present our experience with a patient successfully treated with immunoglobulin therapy administered via nasogastric tube, leading to clinical remission, nutritional recovery, and viral clearance. Recognising norovirus as a key etiological factor in CVID enteropathy emphasises the need to conduct systematic studies and evidence-based therapeutic approaches.

2 Epidemiology

2.1 CVID

The prevalence of CVID is estimated to be between 1 in 25,000 and 1 in 50,000 individuals, with a greater frequency in Northern Europe. It is predominantly diagnosed post‐puberty, with the majority of cases occurring between the ages of 20 and 45 years. It exhibits no preference for race or gender.

2.2 Norovirus Gastroenteritis

Norovirus causes approx. 685 million gastroenteritis cases, 150,000 adult fatalities, and 50,000 child deaths annually. Although lower‐income countries face the largest disease burden, norovirus outbreaks occur worldwide. Mild disease patients may not seek treatment; hence, the number of cases may surpass the estimate. Food‐borne illness was the most common cause of norovirus outbreaks. Ingesting food contaminated during production or by food service workers during preparation might cause food‐related transmission. Raw fruits, vegetables, oysters, and seafood are high‐risk norovirus diets. Norovirus can affect anyone, although the elderly and immunocompromised are more at risk. Some studies reveal a 7% 30‐day death rate for community‐acquired norovirus in older persons. Neonates also develop more significant problems, including necrotising enterocolitis. Young children have the most norovirus cases. The annual incidence of norovirus in children under five is estimated at 21,400 per 100,000. Norovirus infections are also more common in underdeveloped countries. It has been calculated that norovirus causes 17% of developing country gastroenteritis. Immunocompromised patients are also affected by norovirus. Patients with impaired immune systems are more likely to contract norovirus, develop problems, and shed virus asymptomatically.

2.3 CVID Enteropathy

According to a hospital‐based study, the prevalence of gastrointestinal enteropathy in patients with CVID is estimated at 2%–4%. In a larger cohort of 728 CVID patients, 15.6% were found to have some form of CVID‐associated enteropathy. Furthermore, data from a retrospective database analysis (USIDNET registry) reported gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic diarrhoea and colitis, in 20% of all CVID patients.

### Norovirus disease in the United States [^115wnS1y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although recognized as the leading cause of epidemic acute gastroenteritis across all age groups, norovirus has remained poorly characterized with respect to its endemic disease incidence. Use of different methods, including attributable proportion extrapolation, population-based surveillance, and indirect modeling, in several recent studies has considerably improved norovirus disease incidence estimates for the United States. Norovirus causes an average of 570–800 deaths, 56,000–71,000 hospitalizations, 400,000 emergency department visits, 1.7–1.9 million outpatient visits, and 19–21 million total illnesses per year. Persons > 65 years of age are at greatest risk for norovirus-associated death, and children < 5 years of age have the highest rates of norovirus-associated medical care visits. Endemic norovirus disease occurs year round but exhibits a pronounced winter peak and increases by ≤ 50% during years in which pandemic strains emerge. These findings support continued development and targeting of appropriate interventions, including vaccines, for norovirus disease.

### A narrative review of norovirus epidemiology, biology, and challenges to vaccine development [^116rHaLf]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide, causing ~685 million cases annually. Each year, an estimated 1.5 million deaths occur globally due to all-cause AGE, with 136,000 to 278,000 related to norovirus infection –. Young children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals are particularly vulnerable to severe norovirus disease and its associated complications. In lower-income countries, deaths from norovirus AGE are common among children as a result of severe diarrhea and dehydration; in higher-income countries, deaths occur less frequently and are more commonly observed in the elderlydue to complications from disease including sepsis, cardiac complications, malnutrition, and colon perforation.

### Norovirus infection in older adults: epidemiology, risk factors, and opportunities for prevention and control [^117EvoSx]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. In older adults, it is responsible for an estimated 3.7 million illnesses; 320,000 outpatient visits; 69,000 emergency department visits; 39,000 hospitalizations; and 960 deaths annually in the United States. Older adults are particularly at risk for severe outcomes, including prolonged symptoms and death. Long-term care facilities and hospitals are the most common settings for norovirus outbreaks in developed countries. Diagnostic platforms are expanding. Several norovirus vaccines in clinical trials have the potential to reap benefits. This review summarizes current knowledge on norovirus infection in older adults.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114b2r6T]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — clinical presentations and likely etiologies are listed as follows: Persistent or chronic diarrhea has likely pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Cystoisospora belli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Visible blood in stool lists STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli), Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, noncholera Vibrio species, Yersinia, Balantidium coli, and Plesiomonas as likely pathogens. Fever is not highly discriminatory — viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can cause fever; in general, higher temperatures are suggestive of bacterial or E. histolytica, and patients infected with STEC usually are not febrile at time of presentation. Severe abdominal pain, often with grossly bloody stools (occasionally nonbloody) and minimal or no fever, lists STEC, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica as likely pathogens. Persistent abdominal pain and fever lists Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis and may mimic appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting within ≤ 24 hours suggests ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin or Bacillus cereus (short-incubation emetic syndrome). Diarrhea and abdominal cramping lasting 1–2 days suggests ingestion of Clostridium perfringens or B. cereus (long-incubation diarrheal syndrome). Vomiting and nonbloody diarrhea lasting 2–3 days lists norovirus as the likely pathogen.

The key theme emerging from the articles in this supplement is that burden of norovirus in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is substantial and that new tools for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are required. Basic understanding of norovirus biology continues to accelerate, but parallel increases in capacity and research funding are going to be needed to translate this knowledge into clinical trials and translational research that can result in public health gains.

Public health control and testing — an organism-specific diagnosis usually is necessary for public health control efforts because clinical factors alone rarely are sufficient to distinguish between etiologic agents; the most common cause of diarrheal disease outbreaks is norovirus; and health departments can provide guidance on testing, with public health laboratories assisting in testing for agents that exceed the diagnostic capacity of the clinical laboratory.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^112BMaTV]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 75% of infected residents were administered some type of treatment, with approximately 60% receiving infusion intravenously and approximately 30% receiving antibiotics. This study showed the actual state of treatment of NG patients in LTCFs, which had been unknown. Measures to prevent or control norovirus infection include hand washing, isolation of infected persons, and environmental disinfection; the recommended treatment is fluid when needed based on symptoms. More than half of infected residents in this study received intravenous fluid therapy, suggesting compliance with the MHLW manual. In contrast, the reasons for administration of antibiotics are not clear. According to previous studies, facilities for the elderly account for 47 to 79% of all antibiotic use in facilities every year, with 70% being administered to patients suffering from urinary tract and respiratory infections. It has been reported that 16 to 40% of antibiotic use in facilities is inappropriate. Of the 30 infected residents in this study who were administered antibiotics, 2 had symptoms besides vomiting and diarrhea associated with norovirus infection (1 patient was making abnormal respiratory sounds, and 1 patient had pneumonia) that might require treatment with antibiotics. Given that antibiotics are not expected to affect norovirus, the administration of antibiotics to the other 28 patients may have been inappropriate. Antibiotics should be administered cautiously to elderly individuals whose overall health status is in decline.

Approximately 70% of 107 infected residents were diagnosed on the basis of symptom progression. Methods for detecting norovirus include nucleic acid-based PCR methods and antigen-based immunoassay methods. The former methods are typically performed by government agencies or research entities to identify the causal agents of mass outbreaks of food poisoning or infection and require approximately 6 h to obtain results. Accordingly, antigen-based immunoassay methods, which are easy to perform and yield results in approximately 20 min or less, are more suitable for facilities. However, immunoassays have a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98%, resulting in a high probability of false-negative results. According to the cooperating facilities in this study, one set of immunoassays (10 tests) costs between USD 150 and 200, which is paid entirely by the facilities. It is for this reason that most of the infected residents were diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^113aXDvg]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

The future appears promising. Sophisticated norovirus culture methods, such as human intestine enteroids, may enhance our understanding of viral persistence and treatment efficacy. Simultaneously, it is essential to delineate the immunological correlates of viral clearance and to investigate targeted antiviral or vaccination methods. Until such advancements occur, the management of chronic norovirus‐associated CVID enteropathy must remain personalised, incorporating supportive care, meticulous nutritional monitoring, and targeted therapeutic interventions. Recognising chronic norovirus infection as a primary etiological factor in CVID enteropathy signifies a paradigm change, underscoring the necessity for systematic investigations to enhance diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive methods in this susceptible patient cohort.

What factors contributed to the success of the OHIG treatment we implemented? In our patient's case, we could not evaluate the Intratect preparation utilised to ascertain the norovirus‐specific neutralising antibody titre. Nevertheless, the patient's clear clinical improvement confirms that OHIG treatment was ‐at least partially‐effective in neutralising the virus. Throughout the treatment, our patient was supplied a cumulative total of 60 g (15 g per dosage) of OHIG on four separate occasions, exceeding the quantities reported in other case studies, where patients got roughly 4 g per day. It is believed that 3 g of IgA and somewhat less IgG are secreted daily in the digestive tract. In our case, 270 mg of remnant IgA per treatment was used, resulting in a cumulative total of 1080 mg of IgA. The residual IgA from the Intratect preparation may have contributed, although the IgG utilised may have mitigated the absence of mucosal IgA.

### Chronic sequelae and severe complications of norovirus infection: a systematic review of literature [^111fvyeV]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Norovirus causes an estimated 18% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide and is found to be associated with mortality. To create a first overview of severe complications and chronic sequelae of norovirus infections, a systematic review of literature was performed. Of 3928 individual hits, 176 publications remained for data extraction. Study periods varied between 1974 and 2017, though strongly skewed towards the last decade (n = 122, 70%). Countries of studies were worldwide, though Africa, and Carribean, Central and South America were underrepresented. Strong evidence was found for chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, affecting 9%-100% of investigated cohorts. The duration of chronic diarrhea varied from four weeks up to nine years, leading to either wasting, weight loss or failure to thrive in a third of the reported cases (224). Other complications with significant evidence were necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm infants associated with norovirus infection (8 papers), and benign infantile convulsions with gastroenteritis (BICG; 19 papers). Studies on norovirus infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mostly concluded against this association (5 of 7). The remaining papers mentioned a large variety of possible sequelae or complications. Based on the available literature, chronic norovirus diarrhea is the major sequela of norovirus infection in primary immune deficient, oncologic and transplant patients. Norovirus infection - like other gastrointestinal pathogens - can cause a range of sequelae and complications, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these manifestations.

### Norovirus illnesses in children and adolescents [^115AD1jk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Norovirus is a leading cause of childhood vomiting and diarrhea in the United States and globally. Although most illnesses caused by norovirus are self-resolving, severe outcomes may occur from dehydration, including hospitalization and death. A vast majority of deaths from norovirus occur in developing countries. Immunocompromised children are at risk for more severe outcomes. Treatment of norovirus illness is focused on early correction of dehydration and maintenance of fluid status and nutrition. Hand hygiene, exclusion of ill individuals, and environmental cleaning are important for norovirus outbreak prevention and control, and vaccines to prevent norovirus illness are currently under development.

### Are noroviruses emerging? [^115FKnv4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

First, research on the disease prevalence of noroviruses is only beginning. If noroviruses are an increasingly common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, with some cases resulting in diarrhea-related deaths and hospitalizations, then substantially greater investments are required in their diagnosis. Increased use of diagnostics along with improved surveillance, such as in sentinel sites, will permit identification of new strains and shifts in the epidemiology of norovirus disease. The development of easy-to-use, sensitive assays for use by clinical and public health laboratories should also have a high priority.

Second, we do not know how to stop norovirus transmission. Foods can be contaminated with norovirus either at the source or at the point of service by infected food handlers. Noroviruses can spread by water, direct person-to-person contact, or airborne droplets of vomitus, and they can persist in the environment as a source of continuing infection despite efforts at disinfection. Recent advances in finding a cell culture system for noroviruses may allow for assessing the efficacy of various disinfectants, but only by full epidemiologic investigation of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks and by application of molecular tests will transmission routes be determined, differences in epidemiology between strains be detected, and targeted control measures implemented.

Norovirus infections are common and likely to become more so. Effective prevention strategies must now be designed and implemented.

### Clinical manifestation of norovirus gastroenteritis in health care settings [^111vwnnH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Noroviruses are generally believed to cause relatively mild gastroenteritis of short duration in otherwise healthy adults. However, outbreaks in health care settings are common and affect vulnerable populations. During 2002–2003, a total of 4 major hospitals, 11 community hospitals, and 135 nursing homes in the county of Avon, England, were prospectively monitored for outbreaks of gastroenteritis. For 482 hospital staff, 166 nursing home staff, and 266 nursing home residents, the median duration of norovirus gastroenteritis was 2 days, with 75% achieving complete recovery within 3 days. The median duration of norovirus gastroenteritis for 730 hospital patients was 3 days (75% of the patients achieved complete recovery within 5 days), which was significantly longer than that for all other groups (P < .001). Therefore, infection in hospitalized persons may be more severe than that in other groups in the community at large. This increased duration of acute illness should be considered when implementing measures to prevent transmission in hospital settings.

Treatment and prevention

Treatment

To date, no US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies are available for norovirus AGE. Most norovirus AGE episodes last 2–3 days, are self-limiting, and are managed with hydration and supportive care. Severe cases may require medical intervention to alleviate fluid loss, including hospitalization. In lower-income countries with limited access to rehydration therapies, prevention of norovirus AGE is essential. Beyond infection control precautions, rehydration treatments do not differ substantially from the treatment of other non-bacterial causes of diarrhea.

In immunocompromised individuals with persistent norovirus infections, complications can be treated using intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, and adjustment of immunosuppression. Given the risk for chronic and severe disease, immunocompromised individuals could potentially benefit from prevention through vaccination or norovirus antiviral treatments –.

Symptoms exhibited by infected residents

Of the 107 patients whose records were examined, 106 (99%) presented with vomiting or diarrhea (both vomiting and diarrhea 52 (49%), diarrhea only 37 (35%), vomiting only 17 (16%)). Associated symptoms of some kind were observed in 84 (79%) patients, with some patients presenting with multiple symptoms (decreased appetite 69 (65%), fever of 37.0 °C or greater 59 (55%), general malaise 47 (44%), and vomiting of blood 2 (2%)). Median symptom duration for the 107 patients was 4 days (25th percentile, 2 days; 75th percentile, 6 days).

Isolation of infected residents

The number of isolated infected residents is shown in Table 1. The most common isolation method used was to place infected residents in the same room. However, in cases where same-room placement was deemed difficult due to room shortages, divider curtains around the beds were used to set off areas for infected residents. Of the 107 patients, 72 (67.3%) were isolated. Median isolation duration was 4 days (25th percentile, 3 days; 75th percentile, 5 days).

### Epidemiology and risk factors of norovirus infections among diarrhea patients admitted to tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh [^112ZA7c7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

More studies are needed to evaluate whether viral load could be useful in discerning norovirus as the cause of a gastrointestinal illness in high-transmission settings. Our finding of very high rates of coinfection among case patients (and controls) further emphasizes the difficulty with interpretating the presence of norovirus in stool specimens and underscore the high levels of asymptomatic infection that can be seen in high-burden settings.

The norovirus prevalence of 12% we observed among children < 5 years of age hospitalized with AGE is consistent with the detection rates of 14% our group documented for the same age group in prior surveillance years. As seen in other studies in Bangladesh and elsewhere, norovirus positivity rates were comparatively lower in older children (1%) and adults (4%). These detection rates translate to an age distribution of patients with norovirus-positive AGE that is highly concentrated among young children (82% of all norovirus-positive AGE patients were children < 5 years), highlighting this age group as a key target for public health interventions to control noroviruses, including vaccines.

Our data show that norovirus infections can be associated with severe disease requiring hospitalization and that the clinical presentation of norovirus AGE can be as severe as AGE caused by other pathogens. Compared with the illness severity we documented among children < 5 years of age in our previous report, various severity parameters indicated a relatively milder illness in this cohort of patients that covered the age spectrum, indicating the preponderance of severe illness among young children. Although the seasonality of norovirus was not as marked as that of rotavirus, norovirus infections (in AGE case patients and non-AGE controls taken together) were more commonly detected in the winter (14%) and summer (11%, higher in early summer) compared with the rainy season (8%), corroborating findings of other studies of norovirus disease burden in Bangladesh.

### Viral acute gastroenteritis in special populations [^117JxZMB]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is common and afflicts people of all ages. Nonviral causes of AGE are less common. Norovirus is a leading cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of AGE across all ages. Universal rotavirus vaccination of infants has reduced frequency and severity of rotavirus AGE cases in children and indirectly reduced cases in older adults. Severe illness is more likely in persons at age extremes or with immunocompromising conditions. Viral causes of AGE can lead to protracted diarrheal illness in immunocompromised persons. Nucleic acid amplification tests are changing diagnostic testing algorithms.

### Systematic literature review of role of noroviruses in sporadic gastroenteritis [^115y2jJJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of studies that used reverse transcription-PCR to diagnose norovirus (NoV) infections in patients with mild or moderate (outpatient) and severe (hospitalized) diarrhea. NoVs accounted for 12%(95% confidence interval [CI] 10%-15%) of severe gastroenteritis cases among children < 5 years of age and 12% (95% CI 9%-15%) of mild and moderate diarrhea cases among persons of all ages. Of 19 studies among children < 5 years of age, 7 were in developing countries where pooled prevalence of severe NoV disease (12%) was comparable to that for industrialized countries (12%). We estimate that each year NoVs cause 64,000 episodes of diarrhea requiring hospitalization and 900,000 clinic visits among children in industrialized countries, and up to 200,000 deaths of children < 5 years of age in developing countries. Future efforts should focus on developing targeted strategies, possibly even vaccines, for preventing NoV disease and better documenting their impact among children living in developing countries, where > 95% of the deaths from diarrhea occur.

### Infectious diseases in older adults of long-term care facilities: update on approach to diagnosis and management [^113jduSg]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infectious diseases in older adults in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), particularly nursing facilities, remains a challenge for all health providers who care for this population. This review provides updated information on the currently most important challenges of infectious diseases in LTCFs. With the increasing prescribing of antibiotics in older adults, particularly in LTCFs, the topic of antibiotic stewardship is presented in this review. Following this discussion, salient points on clinical relevance, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, therapy, and prevention are discussed for skin and soft tissue infections, infectious diarrhea (Clostridium difficile and norovirus infections), bacterial pneumonia, and urinary tract infection, as well as some of the newer approaches to preventive interventions in the LTCF setting.

### Profound diarrhoea and weight loss in an immunocompromised patient [^117DFN46]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 75-year-old man was admitted with a 3-month history of worsening diarrhoea and weight loss. He was on long-term immunosuppression following cardiac transplantation. Investigations revealed herpes simplex oesophagitis and stool samples were positive for norovirus. Treatment with acyclovir and nitazoxanide resulted in a complete resolution of symptoms. Norovirus is a common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, but immunosuppressed patients may present with chronic diarrhoea rather than an acute illness. This case highlights the importance of a low clinical threshold for testing for norovirus infection in immunocompromised patients.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^116aQAUi]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The items investigated were NG incidence and restriction of new admissions due to the outbreak (duration of restriction, number of new admissions to the facility during the restricted period), refer to Additional files 1 and 2. Residents who were suspected of having NG and were treated accordingly by facilities were designated "infected residents". Definition of outbreak is an epidemic limited to localized increase in the incidence of a disease. If an NG outbreak had occurred, the facility in question was visited with permission, and the medical records of infected residents were examined to collect the following information: sex, age, nursing care level, symptoms, symptom duration, use (or non-use) of an NG diagnostic kit, isolation circumstances, treatment during the symptomatic period (name of medications, daily dose, and number of days administered for each medicine), and outcomes. Symptoms were classified into primary symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) and associated symptoms (symptoms other than primary symptoms such as decreased appetite, fever of 37 °C or greater, general malaise). In cases where permission to examine medical records was not granted, the facility was asked to provide the above information for infected residents. The symptom durations were defined as the existence of symptom during the stay in the facility regardless of the infected residents' outcomes. Outcome data of patients who were transferred and hospitalized were confirmed by the facilities' records. Statistical analyses were performed comparing the group of residents who received treatment and the group of residents who did not receive treatment for the following items: age, care level, symptom duration, number of isolated residents, isolation duration, presentation of primary symptoms, and outcome (recovery or death). Independent t -tests were performed for continuous independent variables, and chi-squared tests were performed for categorical independent variables. IBM SPSS Ver. 24 was used to perform all analyses.

### A narrative review of norovirus epidemiology, biology, and challenges to vaccine development [^114kN4q5]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) globally. AGE resulting from norovirus causes significant morbidity and mortality in countries of all income levels, particularly among young children and older adults. Prevention of norovirus AGE represents a unique challenge as the virus is genetically diverse with multiple genogroups and genotypes cocirculating globally and causing disease in humans. Variants of the GII.4 genotype are typically the most common genotype, and other genotypes cause varying amounts of disease year-to-year, with GII.2, GII.3, and GII.6 most prevalent in recent years. Noroviruses are primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route and only a very small number of virions are required for infection, which makes outbreaks of norovirus extremely difficult to control when they occur. Settings like long-term care facilities, daycares, and hospitals are at high risk of outbreaks and can have very high attack rates resulting in substantial costs and disease burden. Severe cases of norovirus AGE are most common in vulnerable patient populations, such as infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, with available treatments limited to rehydration therapies and supportive care. To date, there are no FDA-approved norovirus vaccines; however, several candidates are currently in development. Given the substantial human and economic burden associated with norovirus AGE, a vaccine to prevent morbidity and mortality and protect vulnerable populations could have a significant impact on global public health.

9 Future Perspectives

Existing evidence for the application of oral immunoglobulin for norovirus infection treatment is scarce, predominantly derived from case studies and limited trials. These studies may exhibit publication bias, thus rendering the generalisability of the findings unclear. A notable disadvantage is the absence of high‐quality, randomized clinical trials, essential for validating the treatment's efficacy and establishing the best dose regimen.

The mechanism of action of immunoglobulin is intricate; it may exhibit both anti‐inflammatory and pro‐inflammatory characteristics, and the localised intestine effects of oral treatment remain inadequately comprehended. This necessitates additional inquiry to enhance comprehension of the pharmacodynamic and immunomodulatory mechanisms.

Additional methodological issues further obfuscate the interpretation of the data. The mode of delivery, such as nasoduodenal or nasogastric, can differ markedly across studies, thereby influencing efficacy and leading to result discrepancies. This constrains the extensive extrapolation of the data.

The existing data are encouraging; yet, the evidential quality is minimal. Future well‐structured, randomized, controlled trials are essential to elucidate the conditions, dosage, and delivery route for the effective use of oral immunoglobulin in treating norovirus infection.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^113TfNu8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) — capabilities, interpretation, and public health considerations: Multipathogen nucleic acid and amplification tests can simultaneously detect viral, parasitic, and bacterial agents including norovirus, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) in less time than traditional methods. With these assays, it is common to detect the presence of > 1 pathogen, and even a positive result for 1 pathogen should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation because tests detect nucleic acid as compared with traditional assays that generally detect viable organisms; the importance of detection of multiple pathogens in the same specimen is often unclear. The current FDA-cleared multiplex assays do not quantify the amount of nucleic acid present, and guidelines by IDSA and the American Society for Microbiology describe optimal tests with findings summarized in Table 5; since those guidelines, several gastrointestinal panels that detect > 20 viral, bacterial, and parasite enteric organisms have become available. There are important drawbacks to increasing use of CIDTs, as replacement of culture by CIDT in clinical laboratories will impede outbreak detection and investigation, while public health laboratories use molecular subtyping to detect, investigate, and control enteric outbreaks.

### Incidence and clinical profile of norovirus disease in Guatemala, 2008–2013 [^116D9ziR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading infectious cause of morbidity worldwide, particularly among children in developing countries. With the decline of rotavirus disease rates following introduction of rotavirus vaccines, the relative importance of norovirus will likely increase. Our objectives in this study were to determine the incidence and clinical profile of norovirus disease in Guatemala.

Methods

We analyzed data from a population-based surveillance study conducted in Guatemala from 2008 through 2013. Demographic information, clinical data, and stool samples were collected from patients who presented with AGE (≥ 3 liquid stools within 24 hours that initiated 7 days before presentation). Estimated incidence of hospitalized, outpatient, and total community norovirus disease was calculated using surveillance data and household surveys of healthcare use.

Results

We included 999 AGE hospitalizations and 3189 AGE outpatient visits at facilities, of which 164 (16%) and 370 (12%), respectively, were positive for norovirus. Severity of norovirus was milder than of rotavirus. Community incidence of norovirus ranged from 2068 to 4954 per 100000 person-years (py) in children aged < 5 years. Children aged < 5 years also had higher incidence of norovirus-associated hospitalization (51–105 per 100000 py) compared with patients aged ≥ 5 years (0–1.6 per 100000 py and 49–80 per 100000 py, respectively).

Conclusions

This study highlights the burden of norovirus disease in Guatemala, especially among young children. These data can help prioritize development of control strategies, including the potential use of vaccines, and provide a baseline to evaluate the impact of such interventions.

### Clinical and in vitro evidence favoring immunoglobulin treatment of a chronic norovirus infection in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency [^114ozXrj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a growing number of immunocompromised patients due to increased solid organ transplantation, increased incidence of cancer, and advances in the care of patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). Norovirus is the most common viral cause of gastroenteritis and these infections can become chronic in immunocompromised individuals. The mechanisms behind viral clearance are not clear, although high titers of immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies that can block binding of the virus to its receptors correlate with protection. Norovirus-specific IgA is associated with protection and a shorter duration of virus shedding, and norovirus-specific T cells have been detected in children and blood donors. There are at least 10 norovirus genogroups that can be further subdivided in genotypes, and as a result individual can be infected multiple times during their lifetime. Most infections are caused by genotype GII.4, for which new variants that can escape herd immunity emerge over time. It is, therefore, likely that people have a broad antibody response against GII.4.

### Global prevalence of asymptomatic norovirus infection: a meta-analysis [^111ShnbG]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

In practice, estimates of prevalence of asymptomatic NoV infections are affected by study design, settings, population, the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and other factors. Based on the 71 studies in our analysis, prevalence of asymptomatic NoV infection was 7%. The same result was obtained in another study in which prevalence was estimated from 20 studies, where asymptomatic individuals were only from control groups matched with cases in case–control studies. Studies with this design also met our study inclusion criteria, and our result in this design was also 7%. Beyond that, our studies included another two designs of studies. Prevalence was higher in cohort studies, and the proportion was calculated as the sum of several specimens collected from each individual divided by total number of positive individuals. Cohort studies might be a source of heterogeneity because detection of NoV in their stool may be shedding from a previously symptomatic infection. Information on the length of follow up or interval between previous reports of symptoms and sample collection was rarely given in texts. Norovirus prevalence tended to be higher in cases of acute gastroenteritis compared with asymptomatic infection. A pooled prevalence of norovirus in 187,336 patients with acute gastroenteritis from 175 articles was as high as 18% (95% CI 17–20). The high prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic norovirus infection showed that this pathogen brought heavy burdens and targeted control programs were needed for norovirus prevention.

### Viral gastrointestinal infections and norovirus genotypes in a paediatric UK hospital, 2014–2015 [^115x366H]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhoea in children is a common disease; understanding the incidence of causative viruses can aid infection control and vaccine development.

Objectives

Describe the incidence and characteristics of gastroenteric viruses including norovirus genotypes in a paediatric hospital cohort.

Study Design

Norovirus, adenovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus qPCR and norovirus genotyping results for all stool specimens (n = 4786; 1393 patients) at a UK paediatric tertiary referral hospital June 2014-July 2015.

Results and Discussion

24% (329/1393) of patients were positive for a GI virus; the majority were positive for norovirus (44%, 144/329) or adenovirus (44%, 146/329). The overall incidence of rotavirus (2%) is reduced compared to pre-vaccination studies; however the incidence of other GI viruses has not increased. Norovirus infections had a significantly higher virus burden compared to other GI viruses (P ≤ 0.03); sapovirus infections had the lowest viral burden. The number of norovirus cases per month did not follow the typical winter seasonal trend of nationally reported outbreaks. The number of cases per month correlates with the number of hospital admissions (R = 0.703, P = 0.011); the number of admissions accounts for 50% of the variability in number of cases per month. The breadth of genotypes seen (48% non-GII.4), suggests a community source for many norovirus infections and has implications for vaccine development. All GI viruses caused chronic infections, with the majority (50–100%) in immunocompromised patients. Incidence or duration of infection in chronic norovirus infections did not differ between genotypes, suggesting host-mediated susceptibility.

### Norovirus infections in long-term care facilities [^1149QshZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Noroviruses have emerged as one of the leading causes of viral gastroenteritis worldwide, affecting community-dwelling and institutionalized older adults. Recent global epidemics present a growing challenge to the healthcare system and to long-term care facilities. Noroviruses spread readily and rapidly through multiple routes (e.g., person-to-person contact, contact with contaminated surfaces, airborne dissemination of vomitus) and thus are able to sustain an epidemic efficiently and successfully. Although norovirus gastroenteritis is a short self-limited illness in healthy immunocompetent individuals, it can result in significant morbidity and mortality in vulnerable compromised persons such as frail elderly persons and older residents of nursing homes. Diagnosis is made by clinical assessment and confirmed primarily by stool evaluation using polymerase chain reaction. Treatment is confined to supportive measures. Public health prevention and control strategies provide guidance regarding surveillance and the necessary steps to curb the clinical effect and spread of norovirus infections in various settings, including long-term care.

### Development of rhabdomyolysis in a child after norovirus gastroenteritis [^115XKJra]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In children, the most significant cause of rhabdomyolysis or muscle breakdown is viral infection. However, there are no reports that norovirus, a gastroenteric virus that commonly infects children, specifically causes rhabdomyolysis. Here, we report the first pediatric case of norovirus-associated rhabdomyolysis.

Case Presentation

The patient, a 2-year-old boy with fever, diarrhea, and vomiting, was referred to our hospital with dysstasia and transaminitis. He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, norovirus genogroup GII was detected from stool samples by real-time quantitative reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, and thereafter, the norovirus GII.4 variant was identified.

Conclusion

However, the association between rhabdomyolysis and the isolated norovirus variant was not clarified. After treatment the patient recovered without renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Rhabdomyolysis is a disease for which there is a need for early detection and treatment. If abnormal posture or muscle weakness is observed during the course of gastroenteritis, blood and urinary tests should be performed to rule out rhabdomyolysis.

### Systematic literature review of role of noroviruses in sporadic gastroenteritis [^111UBagv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Estimated Prevalence of NoV Disease in Children

We estimate that each year NoVs cause ≈900,000 episodes of gastroenteritis that require a clinic visit and ≈64,000 hospitalizations among children < 5 years of age residing in high-income countries (Table 3). If one assumes that the proportion of annual childhood diarrhea-associated hospitalizations (≈124 million) and deaths (≈1.8 million) in developing countries approximates the overall proportion of children (12.1%) with severe NoV illness in our review, NoVs may cause up to 1.1 million hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths each year in children in developing countries.

### Prospective, real-time metagenomic sequencing during norovirus outbreak reveals discrete transmission clusters [^112Zq9K5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States, with an estimated incidence of 19–21 million cases per year. The high prevalence of norovirus complicates efforts to prevent its introduction into health-care settings from the community. Transmission primarily occurs through the fecal-oral route, though it can also occur via aerosolized viral particles and environmental contamination. Most cases of norovirus resolve in 12–60 hours, but hospital-associated outbreaks frequently involve immunocompromised patients, who can experience prolonged symptoms and viral shedding, and potentially act as reservoirs for viral transmission.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is increasingly used for the detection of infectious organisms when other clinical testing has been non-diagnostic. The same technique can be employed to elucidate pathogen transmission chains. We and others have previously used real-time metagenomics to both rule in and rule out the ongoing transmission of hospital-acquired respiratory virus infections.

Here, we describe a hospital-associated outbreak of norovirus that affected 13 patients over 27 days in a large, pediatric hospital and was temporally associated with a spike in self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms among staff. We discuss the use of real-time mNGS to identify transmission clusters within the outbreak and to elucidate the long-term impacts of the outbreak, including both ongoing transmission of an outbreak strain after hospital-acquired cases had ceased and chronic shedding of hospital-acquired virus in an immunocompromised host.

### Norovirus disease in the United States [^112bbRN4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in characterizing the incidence of norovirus disease in the United States; however, additional work is needed to fill some key gaps. Age-specific rates of norovirus disease, ideally from direct laboratory testing among population-based community cohorts, would help identify groups most often infected and thus those likely serving as primary human reservoirs for transmission. The causal role of norovirus and common concurrent conditions in norovirus-associated deaths also requires further clarification to help protect the most vulnerable populations. In addition, stable surveillance platforms that enable systematic and ongoing assessment of endemic norovirus disease are needed to characterize long-term trends, annual fluctuations, and effects of emergent norovirus strains.

As progress continues in the arena of norovirus vaccine development, such endemic norovirus disease data will be critical to guide formulation and quantify potential effects of vaccine. The burden of norovirus disease in the United States justifies continued efforts toward developing potential norovirus vaccines and identification of specific groups for such interventions. Our review suggests that for a vaccine to have maximal impact, it would need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in young children and the elderly, groups at the highest risk for severe norovirus disease. Other groups at risk for epidemic disease might also include health care workers, travelers, and military personnel. Data from our review can inform cost-effectiveness and modeling studies to define an investment case and public health strategy for controlling norovirus disease in anticipation of completion of vaccine development and licensure.

### Human norovirus targets enteroendocrine epithelial cells in the small intestine [^112hTXK7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

A pediatric intestinal transplant recipient presenting with severe norovirus gastroenteritis provided a rare opportunity to study norovirus infection during acute, life-threatening illness. Norovirus has been identified as a potential risk factor for acute secondary organ rejection in this patient population. The intensity of protein and RNA staining in intestinal tissue was reflected in the high number of viral genome copies in stool, allowing us to investigate the distribution and cellular tropism of norovirus in the likely absence of pre-existing immunity. Norovirus was distributed throughout the small intestine, with concentrated areas of virus in epithelial cells at or near the tips of small intestinal villi and above regions of GALT. Enteroendocrine cells were identified as an epithelial cell type associated with active norovirus replication. Enteroendocrine cells are specialized epithelial cells with sensory and endocrine functions that comprise approximately 1% of the intestinal epithelium. This discovery may offer insight into the pathogenesis of human norovirus, where symptoms often have an acute onset with explosive vomiting and diarrhea. Rotavirus, another enteric virus associated with gastroenteritis, was shown to infect enterocytes and secrete viral protein NS4, which caused the release of serotonin from proximal enterochromaffin cells (ECs), a subtype of EECs. There was evidence also that ECs could occasionally be infected directly by rotavirus, and serotonin receptor antagonists have been explored for the treatment of rotavirus-associated vomiting and diarrhea. Additional study will be needed to establish the role of EECs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised human hosts with norovirus disease, but the wide-ranging roles of EECs in gut-brain signaling, digestion, and mucosal immunity could offer important insight into strategies to treat norovirus illness.

### Nosocomial transmission of norovirus is mainly caused by symptomatic cases [^112ngqzh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Nosocomial norovirus (NoV) infection is common and may increase the burden of disease in healthcare settings, particularly in vulnerable hospitalized patients. Implementing effective infection control during and after admission may limit further spread, but evidence-based measures are lacking.

Methods

In this study, we performed a systematic evaluation of sources and modes of transmission during NoV outbreaks within 2 types of healthcare facilities. An outbreak protocol was developed to sample all patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) with and without symptoms on wards involved in outbreaks. Data on clinical history and possible high-risk exposures were collected. Five outbreaks were investigated, involving 28 patients with recognized symptomatic NoV infection.

Results

Enhanced sampling, however, yielded 65 additional cases, of whom 14% (n = 9) were asymptomatic patients, 57% (n = 37) were symptomatic HCWs, and 17% (n = 11) were asymptomatic HCWs. For 12% (n = 8), clinical data were not provided (2 HCWs and 6 patients). On the basis of the shedding kinetics, the onset of infection was estimated for each case. The generation interval was then used to construct plausible transmission pathways and reproduction numbers for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and HCWs.

Conclusions

We found that symptomatic patients and HCWs were more often involved in transmission events than asymptomatic shedders. Asymptomatic HCWs rarely contributed to transmission, despite high levels of fecal virus shedding.

### The norovirus epidemiologic triad: predictors of severe outcomes in US norovirus outbreaks, 2009–2016 [^113niGvz]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. Clarifying the viral, host, and environmental factors (epidemiologic triad) associated with severe outcomes can help target public health interventions.

Methods

Acute norovirus outbreaks reported to the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) in 2009–2016 were linked to laboratory-confirmed norovirus outbreaks reported to CaliciNet. Outbreaks were analyzed for differences in genotype (GII.4 vs non-GII.4), hospitalization, and mortality rates by timing, setting, transmission mode, demographics, clinical symptoms, and health outcomes.

Results

A total of 3747 norovirus outbreaks were matched from NORS and CaliciNet. Multivariable models showed that GII.4 outbreaks (n = 2353) were associated with healthcare settings (odds ratio [OR], 3.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.99–5.23]), winter months (November-April; 1.55 [95% CI, 1.24–1.93]), and older age of cases (≥ 50% aged ≥ 75 years; 1.37 [95% CI, 1.04–1.79]). Severe outcomes were more likely among GII.4 outbreaks (hospitalization rate ratio [RR], 1.54 [95% CI, 1.23–1.96]; mortality RR, 2.77 [95% CI, 1.04–5.78]). Outbreaks in healthcare settings were also associated with higher hospitalization (RR, 3.22 [95% CI, 2.34–4.44]) and mortality rates (RR, 5.65 [95% CI, 1.92–18.70]).

Conclusions

Severe outcomes more frequently occurred in norovirus outbreaks caused by GII.4 and those in healthcare settings. These results should help guide preventive interventions for targeted populations, including vaccine development.

### Rapid emergence and predominance of a broadly recognizing and fast-evolving norovirus GII.17 variant in late 2014 [^114wN9Sh]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Second, immune-escaped GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 targets all age groups and may cause severe gastroenteritis in previously less vulnerable population. To have a better chance of capturing emergent norovirus of substantial impact, we conducted our surveillance in hospitalized norovirus gastroenteritis that represents the severe end of the spectrum of disease. We reason that any change in the predominant circulating genotype or GII.4 variant in hospital cases may have crucial public health implications. Genotype change alone, however, may not be that surprising considering periodic high activity of norovirus non-GII.4 genotype is not uncommon. Another strong reason that prompted us to initiate this detailed investigation was the wide age distribution of our GII.17 cases. Young children aged < 5 years and adults aged > 65 years (that is, those at the extremes of age) are known to be at-risk groups for more severe norovirus gastroenteritis partly due to immature and waning immunity, respectively. Among our GII.4 cases, the median age was 1 year and at-risk age groups accounted for 81.0% of cases. This age distribution agreed well with the general norovirus epidemiology and clinical presentation that norovirus infection is mild (non-hospitalized) in otherwise healthy individuals. In sharp contrast, GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 targeted all age groups. The median age of our GII.17 cases was 49 years and the so-called at-risk groups only accounted for 52.3% of cases. Increased proportion of children and young adults aged 5–65 years is alarming because this previously less vulnerable age group is generally regarded as non-compromised, thus unlikely to develop severe norovirus gastroenteritis that required medical attention. Furthermore, higher proportion of elderly aged ≥ 85 years in GII.17 cases may have substantial clinical implications as this age group has been associated with most mortality in norovirus gastroenteritis. Although we observed two cases of fatal GII.17 infections, direct causal relationship remains elusive. Detailed comparison of clinical features with norovirus GII.4 is underway to assess the virulence of this novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014. One explanation for the wide age distribution is the virtually absence of immunity against the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 across all age groups. This is possible because of the rarity of and thus lack of previous exposure to norovirus GII.17 until now. Moreover, residue substitutions and insertion occurred in four out of five inferred antigenic epitopes on the VP1 P2 domain, indicating the establishment of a probably immune-escaped variant. This may resemble the cyclic surge in norovirus GII.4 gastroenteritis that coincides with the epochal evolution of GII.4 variants through immune evasion. Previous exposure to a different norovirus genotype, at least to GII.4 Sydney 2012, is likely to offer little or no cross-protection as suggested by our two cases of sequential (separated by 6 months to 2 years apart) GII.4 and GII.17 infections. The first known pandemic norovirus gastroenteritis occurred in 1996 with the emergence of the then novel GII.4 95/96 variant, followed by the Farmington Hills variant in 2002. The Farmington Hills variant and all other subsequent pandemic GII.4 variants differed from earlier GII.4 by a characteristic insertion at antigenic epitope D. Remarkably, the insertion at position 397 in the VP1 P2 domain of the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 was also mapped to the inferred antigenic epitope D. Whether or not the insertion will confer pandemic potential to the novel GII.17 Kawasaki 2014 is of immense interest.

### Development of rhabdomyolysis in a child after norovirus gastroenteritis [^115nWp4M]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Due to decreased incidence of rotavirus as the result of the rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has become the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in children less than 2 years old in Japan as well as in the United States. Rhabdomyolysis, muscle breakdown, in children is caused by acute viral infections such as influenza A/B, coxsackievirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. In up to 40% of children with rhabdomyolysis, renal failure is reported to develop. Delay in the detection of rhabdomyolysis may increase the risk of development of acute renal failure. Therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatments for rhabdomyolysis is crucial. However, infants and young children are unable to clearly complain of these symptoms and thus require close examination. Here we report the first case describing rhabdomyolysis in a norovirus-infected child.

### A narrative review of norovirus epidemiology, biology, and challenges to vaccine development [^114EgNVM]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Outbreaks

Norovirus AGE outbreaks are associated with high attack rates and substantial economic and clinical burden. The most commonly reported setting for norovirus outbreaks in the US and other industrialized countries is healthcare settings. The costs to hospitals associated with outbreaks can be substantial, depending on the number of units affected. Two systematic reviews of norovirus outbreaks occurring in hospitals and nursing homes worldwide found a median attack rate of 50% (range, 9–78) during an outbreak event and a protracted duration of outbreak with a mean of 16 days (range, 3–44) in nursing homes and 19 days (range, 6–92) in hospitals. Both patients and staff are important drivers of transmission of norovirus, though evidence suggests a larger number of transmitted infections occur in outbreaks when the index cases are patients than when index cases are staff. In a 1-year surveillance study of gastroenteritis outbreaks in three hospitals in England, attack rates of confirmed norovirus AGE during hospital outbreaks were 24.5% for staff (95% CI, 17.8–31.2) and 53.2% for patients (95% CI, 41.5–65.0). Guidelines to help control outbreaks in healthcare settings include enhanced hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, restriction of patient movements, and exclusion of ill staff from work.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors for seizures associated with norovirus gastroenteritis in childhood [^112z2nTP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Norovirus has become increasingly recognized as causing viral gastroenteritis in children. Few data are available on the characteristics of children admitted to pediatric emergency departments with norovirus gastroenteritis and accompanying seizures. Our aim in this study was to describe the clinical features of, and risk factors for, seizures accompanying norovirus gastroenteritis. We collected 6359 stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis, of whom 1444 (22.71%) had laboratory-confirmed norovirus gastroenteritis. Of all patients, 108 (7.48%) children exhibited norovirus gastroenteritis and seizures; 49 (45.4%) were febrile, and 59 (54.6%) afebrile. The mean patient age was 2.31 ± 2.12 years; most were < 5 years of age (92.6%). The afebrile group had a significantly higher incidence of 2 or more seizures than the febrile subjects (P = 0.004). Early recognition and prompt treatment of convulsions associated with norovirus gastroenteritis in children are important. Future studies might explore the long-term prognoses of these patients.

### Chronic norovirus infection in renal transplant recipients [^112afrC2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Norovirus infection is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis. In immunocompetent subjects, norovirus infection is a self-limiting disease of short duration. The present report provides first evidence that norovirus can cause chronic infection in renal transplant recipients. Two patients showed persisting norovirus excretion for > 7 months and 3 months, respectively. The first patient was asymptomatic after an acute episode of gastroenteritis and eliminated the virus spontaneously. The second patient developed severe symptomatic chronic infection with diffuse abdominal discomfort, fever, transient transplant dysfunction, recurrent episodes of diarrhoea, weight loss and histological signs of chronic intestinal inflammation. Norovirus elimination and relief of symptoms occurred only after reduction of immunosuppression. Thus, norovirus can evoke asymptomatic and symptomatic chronic infection in renal transplant recipients. Norovirus should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of both acute and chronic diarrhoea after transplantation. Reduction of immunosuppression may be indicated to allow virus elimination in symptomatic cases.

### Vital signs: foodborne norovirus outbreaks-United States, 2009–2012 [^114tjH3r]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The public health burden exacted by noroviruses is substantial. Although candidate norovirus vaccines are in development and show promise, behavioral interventions focused on food workers continue to be primary means to prevent foodborne norovirus disease. Provisions in the Food and Drug Administration Food Code outline how foodborne spread of noroviruses can be curtailed and food safety improved.

Key Points

Norovirus is highly contagious and can cause severe disease. About 1 in 15 U.S. residents become ill with it each year and up to 800 die.
Person-to-person contact and foodborne transmission are the main ways that norovirus outbreaks occur.
Of those foodborne outbreaks in which a single cause was identified, 48% were caused by norovirus, making it the leading cause of foodborne outbreaks in the U.S.
Restaurants are the most common setting for foodborne norovirus outbreaks. Food handlers infected with norovirus are the largest source of food contamination.
CDC recommends improved adherence to hand hygiene, having ill workers stay home until ≥ 48 hrs after their symptoms resolve, and having kitchen managers become formally certified in food safety.

### Systematic literature review of role of noroviruses in sporadic gastroenteritis [^113TLgHs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Some factors could have led us to overestimate the extent of sporadic NoV disease. Our estimates of sporadic NoV disease prevalence are based on a review of active surveillance data of all diarrhea cases and do not exclude cases originating from an outbreak. In a few studies, NoVs were detected in patients who were co-infected with another pathogen, and only a limited number of studies enrolled concurrent healthy controls, thus making it difficult to determine the fraction of diarrhea cases truly attributable to NoV. Among all studies testing for co-infections, however, the median rate of detecting another pathogen in addition to NoV was low (2%). This finding, combined with the fact that most studies only assessed for NoV among samples that previously tested negative for other bacterial and viral pathogens, suggests that our overall pooled proportion attributable to NoVs is unlikely to be much lower. In addition, for the studies that enrolled diarrhea-free controls, we subtracted control prevalence from the case prevalence of NoV disease when calculating the overall pooled estimate. Lastly, other unmeasured factors underestimating disease prevalence that could not be accounted for, such as inefficient primers, low virus shedding, delays in specimen collection, and lack of a sensitive case-definition are also likely to exist in these studies.

The heterogeneity in the NoV literature is evident and should be considered when interpreting the results of this review. Our systematic approach and strict inclusion criteria likely reduced heterogeneity but do not eliminate biases in the original studies, diversity in study design and population, and publication bias. Nonetheless, the findings of this review suggest that NoVs are a frequent cause of mild and severe sporadic gastroenteritis among children in high- and middle-income countries. In addition, hospital studies in our review only assessed patients admitted with diarrhea. Because of the highly infectious nature of NoVs, substantial additional health and economic effects would also occur from nosocomial disease and outbreaks in healthcare facilities, as previously identified by Lopman et al. NoVs are also a frequent cause of severe illness and death from diarrhea among children in developing countries, although firm conclusions cannot be made because of limited data. Systematic evaluations that use broadly reactive, state-of-the-art diagnostic assays, with concurrent evaluation of healthy controls and examination of potential co-infection, are needed to fully understand the role of NoVs in the etiology of sporadic childhood gastroenteritis. These evaluations are especially necessary in developing countries, where diarrhea remains a leading cause of childhood death, causing > 1.8 million annual deaths.

### Norovirus encephalopathy in a previously healthy child [^111wB74m]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis in all age groups. Afebrile convulsion is an occasional neurologic complication in norovirus infection, but encephalitis is rare. We report the case of a previously healthy 15-month-old girl with norovirus encephalopathy who had a poor neurologic outcome. Norovirus (genogroup II) was detected in plasma and stool by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, but the cerebrospinal fluid showed negative result for genome. Elevated concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α were observed on the third day of illness. The encephalopathy in our patient may be related to hypercytokinemia rather than to direct viral invasion.

### Differences in clinical presentation between norovirus genotypes in nursing homes [^113KS1nZ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In healthcare settings, norovirus (NoV) outbreaks are predominated by genotype II.4 (GII.4) strains. Periodically, new variants of GII.4 emerge, causing a temporary increase of outbreaks.

Objectives

To study the relationship between symptoms and NoV genotype.

Study Design

Data of 49 nursing homes which were monitored for NoV outbreaks in the winter seasons of 2005/2006 and/or 2006/2007 were used.

Results

Data on symptoms and duration of illness were available for 465 residents and 174 staff members from 28 NoV outbreaks. Genotype GII.4 was responsible for 21 outbreaks. Attack rates for residents seemed to be higher in GII.4 outbreaks compared to other genotypes. In outbreaks caused by GII.4, residents vomited more often than in outbreaks with other genotypes. They also had more often complaints of nausea, abdominal cramps, fever, and mucus in stool. The GII.4 2004 variant outbreaks showed higher percentages of nausea, stomach ache, and fever than outbreaks with the GII.4 2006a variant. Differences in duration of illness were not found. In nursing home staff, no clear differences were found between outbreaks caused by GII.4 and non-GII.4 NoVs.

Conclusions

Genotype GII.4 was found to be related to more symptomatic disease, including more residents vomiting, and to a lesser extent, higher attack rates among residents.

### Diagnosis and management of foodborne illness [^115uzh14]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that each year, one in six Americans will experience a foodborne illness. The most common causes in the United States are viruses, such as norovirus; bacteria, such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Listeria; and parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia. Resources are available to educate consumers on food recalls and proper handling, storage, and cooking of foods. Diagnosis and management of a foodborne illness are based on the history and physical examination. Common symptoms of foodborne illnesses include vomiting, diarrhea (with or without blood), fever, abdominal cramping, headache, dehydration, myalgia, and arthralgias. Definitive diagnosis can be made only through stool culture or more advanced laboratory testing. However, these results should not delay empiric treatment if a foodborne illness is suspected. Empiric treatment should focus on symptom management, rehydration if the patient is clinically dehydrated, and antibiotic therapy. Foodborne illnesses should be reported to local and state health agencies; reporting requirements vary among states.

### Super-infections and relapses occur in chronic norovirus infections [^114XWx2T]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Norovirus causes chronic infections in immunocompromised patients with considerable associated morbidity. It is not known whether chronic infections involve super- or re-infections or relapses.

Objectives

To retrospectively investigate whether longitudinal sampling in chronically infected patients demonstrates persistent infection with the same virus, or super- or re-infection.

Study Design

Norovirus full genomes were generated from 86 longitudinal samples from 25 paediatric patients. Consensus sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis and genotyping.

Results

Super-infections occurred in 17% of chronically infected patients who were continuously PCR positive; including two with mixed norovirus infections. The median duration of infection was 107days longer in those with super-infections; however this was not statistically significant. A third of patients with interrupted norovirus shedding continued to be infected with the same virus despite up to 2 months of PCR negative stools, classified as a relapse. The majority (67%) of patients with interrupted shedding were re-infected with a different genotype.

Conclusions

Chronically infected patients who are continuously PCR positive are most likely to remain infected with the same virus; however super-infections do occur leading to mixed infection. Patients with interrupted shedding are likely to represent re-infection with a different genotype, however relapsing infections also occur. Our findings have implications for infection control as immunosuppressed patients remain susceptible to new norovirus infections despite current or recent infection and may continue to be infectious after norovirus is undetectable in stool. The relevance to children without co-morbidities remains to be determined.

### Norovirus-associated encephalopathy [^113auzKk]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Norovirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis. We describe the case of a 23-month-old girl with encephalopathy possibly associated with norovirus infection. The viral genome was detected in stool, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This is the first report of encephalopathy potentially caused by norovirus as indicated by the presence of the virus genome in CSF.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^114a1Bfz]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Outbreaks of norovirus infection can have detrimental impacts on long-term care facilities. This study investigated the incidence, clinical picture, treatment and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities.

Methods

Nineteen facilities in Osaka and Kyoto, Japan participated in questionnaire surveys conducted between 2009 and 2011 regarding the incidence of norovirus gastroenteritis. From clinical charts, the characteristics, symptoms, and treatment of infected residents were analyzed. Total drug cost per infected resident was calculated by multiplying the unit price for each drug by the daily dose and the number of days administered and summing the costs for each drug (USD 1 = JPY 100).

Results

Over the 3-year period, 8 outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis occurred in 6 facilities. The mean clinical course of 107 infected residents in five facilities that granted permission to examine patients' medical records was 4 days, with all but one resident presenting with vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 84 (79%) also presenting with associated symptoms. Of 107 infected residents, 72 (67%) were isolated. The proportion of infected residents isolated varied from 50 to 100% depending on the facility. Of the infected residents, 81 (76%) received some type of medication, the most common being infusion (67 patients, 63%) and antibiotics (30 patients, 28%). The median total cost of all drugs administered was USD 4.4, and the median drug cost per infected resident per day was USD 2.0. Total drug cost over the entire treatment period was the highest for antibiotics, at USD 8.6.

Conclusion

Clinical course was similar to those of norovirus cases examined at other long-term care facilities. The majority of infected residents received some type of medication. Although the economic burden was not large, not a few infected residents were given antibiotics, which are ineffective for norovirus.

### Quantitative detection of norovirus excretion in pediatric patients with cancer and prolonged gastroenteritis and shedding of norovirus [^115iwVfn]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Although chronic courses of norovirus infection have been described in immunocompromised patients, little is known about noroviral shedding and correlation with clinical symptoms in these patients. In this report, the quantitative courses of norovirus excretion in nine pediatric patients with hematologic and oncologic disorders and prolonged gastroenteritis were investigated. In a retrospective study multiple fecal samples from nine pediatric cancer patients were examined by a one-step real-time PCR. Clinical data of the patients were reviewed and virological data were correlated with clinical symptoms. All nine patients presented with prolonged illness and prolonged noroviral shedding. Vomiting and diarrhea were associated with high norovirus concentrations and norovirus excretion declined slowly in the patients. Retrospectively, initial PCR-testing for norovirus was performed with a median of 7 days after onset of symptoms. This finding hints at the difficulty of obtaining early diagnosis of the infection in these children. The patients were shedding high norovirus concentration over a long period of time. Results of sequential quantitative PCR-testing for norovirus correlated with clinical symptoms. Both clinical symptoms and quantitative PCR-testings help to define the severity of norovirus infection and to estimate the risk for transmission. To prevent the spread of the disease, usage of virocidal disinfectants and isolation procedures should be maintained as long as patients are positive for noroviruses. Since vomiting is frequent in pediatric patients with oncological conditions, a screening program for rapid detection of norovirus infection in this group of patients should be considered.

### Chronic norovirus infection in a transplant patient successfully treated with enterally administered immune globulin [^116Bndch]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Norovirus infection causes a significant burden of morbidity and (in the developing world) mortality. In immunocompromised hosts, norovirus infection can become chronic, with devastating consequences. Unfortunately, therapeutic options for chronic disease are unproven, and treatment is largely supportive. We report a case of norovirus infection causing debilitating chronic gastroenteritis in a transplant patient that responded to a short course of enterally administered human immune globulin.

### Norovirus-associated encephalitis in a previously healthy 2-year-old girl [^112NpDfd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

We describe the case of 2-year-old girl with encephalitis associated with norovirus infection. The viral genome was detected in cerebrospinal fluid and stool by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This is the first time in Spain and the second worldwide that the genome of norovirus from the stool sample and 2 cerebrospinal fluid samples were genetically characterized and matched.

### Effect of norovirus inoculum dose on virus kinetics, shedding, and symptoms [^111ChDYW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The effect of norovirus dose on outcomes such as virus shedding and symptoms after initial infection is not well understood. We performed a secondary analysis of a human challenge study by using Bayesian mixed-effects models. As the dose increased from 4.8 to 4,800 reverse transcription PCR units, the total amount of shed virus in feces increased from 4.5 × 10¹¹ to 3.4 × 10¹² genomic equivalent copies; in vomit, virus increased from 6.4 × 10⁵ to 3.0 × 10⁷ genomic equivalent copies. Onset time of viral shedding in feces decreased from 1.4 to 0.8 days, and time of peak viral shedding decreased from 2.3 to 1.5 days. Time to symptom onset decreased from 1.5 to 0.8 days. One type of symptom score increased. An increase in norovirus dose was associated with more rapid shedding and symptom onset and possibly increased severity. However, the effect on virus load and shedding was inconclusive.

### Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and norovirus gastroenteritis: a previously unrecognized cause of morbidity [^112ecXqv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A retrospective study of the clinical, epidemiologic, and virologic features of norovirus gastroenteritis in 12 adult allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.

Methods

Norovirus infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Strains were genotyped by nucleic acid sequence of the most highly conserved region of the norovirus gene encoding the capsid S (shell) domain.

Results

Ten of 12 patients presented with vomiting of short duration, but diarrhea was present in all. The median time from onset to norovirus diagnosis was 1 month (range, 0.25–6.0 months). Eleven patients were receiving immunosuppression when norovirus infection was diagnosed: 8 for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in an organ other than gut, 1 for previous gut GVHD, and 2 for presumed gut GVHD that proved to be norovirus gastroenteritis. Six patients required enteral or parenteral nutrition for severe weight loss. In 10 patients, diarrhea lasted a median of 3 months (range, 0.5–14 months) and virus was shed at a high level throughout. The remaining 2 patients died after 4 months of diarrhea (one died of unrelated complications, and the other died of malnutrition). The noroviruses found were GII (untyped), GII-3, GII-4, and GII-7 in 1, 1, 9, and 1 patients, respectively. Eleven of the 12 patients had acquired their infection in the community. Phylogenetic analysis of the GII-4 strains demonstrated that all differed.

Conclusions

Noroviruses are a hitherto unsuspected cause of prolonged morbidity and mortality in adults after allogeneic HSCT. The use of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect high viral load levels in feces distinguishes norovirus gastroenteritis from gut GVHD.

### Prospective, real-time metagenomic sequencing during norovirus outbreak reveals discrete transmission clusters [^114gawjE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Norovirus outbreaks in hospital settings are a common challenge for infection prevention teams. Given the high burden of norovirus in most communities, it can be difficult to distinguish between ongoing in-hospital transmission of the virus and new introductions from the community, and it is challenging to understand the long-term impacts of outbreak-associated viruses within medical systems using traditional epidemiological approaches alone.

Methods

Real-time metagenomic sequencing during an ongoing norovirus outbreak associated with a retrospective cohort study.

Results

We describe a hospital-associated norovirus outbreak that affected 13 patients over a 27-day period in a large, tertiary, pediatric hospital. The outbreak was chronologically associated with a spike in self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms among staff. Real-time metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of norovirus genomes demonstrated that 10 chronologically overlapping, hospital-acquired norovirus cases were partitioned into 3 discrete transmission clusters. Sequencing data also revealed close genetic relationships between some hospital-acquired and some community-acquired cases. Finally, this data was used to demonstrate chronic viral shedding by an immunocompromised, hospital-acquired case patient. An analysis of serial samples from this patient provided novel insights into the evolution of norovirus within an immunocompromised host.

Conclusions

This study documents one of the first applications of real-time mNGS during a hospital-associated viral outbreak. Given its demonstrated ability to detect transmission patterns within outbreaks and elucidate the long-term impacts of outbreak-associated viral strains on patients and medical systems, mNGS constitutes a powerful resource to help infection control teams understand, prevent, and respond to viral outbreaks.

### Global prevalence of asymptomatic norovirus infection: a meta-analysis [^112U2Duc]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Studies about asymptomatic norovirus infections have been frequently reported. We aim to assess the global prevalence of asymptomatic infections.

Method

We identified publications that included the proportion of asymptomatic norovirus infections by searching in PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science and by screening references from the articles reviewed. The principal summary data were the prevalence of asymptomatic norovirus infection. Random-effect models for meta-analysis were fitted to generate estimates of overall and subgroup prevalence.

Findings

Of 81 studies included, asymptomatic norovirus prevalence was estimated at 7% (95% CI: 6%–9%). Africa, Meso America and South America had higher prevalence (15%, 14%, 11%, respectively) while the prevalence in Europe and North America was lower (4%). Prevalence was similar between community and hospital (9%). Prevalence was higher in children (8%) than adults (4%). For food handlers, prevalence was estimated at 3%. In context of outbreaks, prevalence estimated from 15 studies was as high as 18% (95% CI: 10%–30%).

Interpretation

This knowledge could have an impact on the development of transmission prevention strategies in the future. The high prevalence indicated asymptomatic individuals must not be overlooked.

Outstanding questions

The high prevalence indicated asymptomatic individuals must not be overlooked. Asymptomatic individuals may play an important role in norovirus transmission. This knowledge could have an impact on the development of transmission prevention strategies.

### An outbreak of norovirus infection in a long-term-care unit in Spain [^116pwxW1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Norovirus belongs to the Caliciviridae family and causes outbreaks of infectious enteritis by fecal-oral transmission. In Spain, there have been few outbreaks reported due to this virus. We describe an outbreak on a long-term-care hospital ward.

Methods

Cases were classified as probable, confirmed, and secondary. Stool cultures were performed. Polymerase chain reaction detection of norovirus was also performed.

Results

The outbreak occurred from December 7 to 28, 2001, involving 60 cases (32 patients, 19 staff members, 8 patients' relatives, and 1 relative of a staff member). Most (82%) of the cases were female. The most frequently involved ages were 20 to 39 years for staff members and 70 to 89 years for patients. The incubation period of secondary cases in patients' families had a median of 48 hours (range, 1 to 7 days). Clinical symptoms included diarrhea (85%), vomiting (75%), fever (37%), nausea (23%), and abdominal pain (12%). Median duration of the disease was 48 hours (range, 1 to 7 days). All cases resolved and the outbreak halted with additional hygienic measures. Stool cultures were all negative for enteropathogenic bacteria and rotaviruses. In 16 of 23 cases, the norovirus genotype 2 antigen was detected.

Conclusion

This outbreak of gastroenteritis due to norovirus genotype 2 affected patients, staff members, and their relatives in a long-term-care facility and was controlled in 21 days.

### Duration of immunity to norovirus gastroenteritis [^115Fq5nn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The goal of this study was to gain a better estimate of the duration of immunity to NoV AGE, and our results suggest that it is longer than was previously understood. We modeled a range of possible infection and immunity processes to capture the unknown aspects of the transmission process, and from these models, we estimate a mean duration of immunity ranging from ≈4 to 8 years. Variations in duration of immunity between models can be traced to inclusion of presymptomatic and postsymptomatic states in the model scenarios. The best-fit models converge on a much higher infectiousness and R₀ for young children (< 5 years) than for older children and adults. This finding is consistent with observational studies that found contact with a symptomatic child to be the prime risk factor for NoV infection for children and adults and suggests that young children have a key role in the transmission of NoV to all age groups. Children have relatively high rates of contact with both other children and adults, and because of their lower levels of hygiene, they are likely to be more infectious than adults, given contact.

### Abnormal computed tomography findings among children with viral gastroenteritis and symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis [^114y1hVb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate computed tomography (CT) findings in pediatric patients with viral gastroenteritis who presented with clinical features of acute abdomen.

Patients and Methods

During 2 seasons of viral gastroenteritis from 2005 to 2007, 302 children with acute gastrointestinal symptoms were admitted to our center for treatment of dehydration and associated complications. Stool specimens obtained from 130 of the 302 were tested for norovirus with the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method.

Results

Among the 130 patients, 44 tested positive for norovirus, 34 for rotavirus, and 1 for adenovirus. In the remaining 51, except one with Campylobacter jejuni, no viral or bacterial pathogen was detectable. An abdominal CT scan was performed in 4 patients with norovirus and in 1 with rotavirus for suspected acute abdomen including acute appendicitis. Computed tomography (CT) findings were similar among the 5 patients, including thickening of the bowel wall and fluid-filled bowel loops in the small intestine with no pathological findings in the stomach, appendix, or colon.

Conclusions

Anatomical changes in the small intestine were shown by CT in 5 children with viral gastroenteritis who presented with acute abdomen. These imaging features of viral gastroenteritis may be useful in differential diagnosis of acute abdomen to avoid unnecessary surgery.

### Control and prevention of viral gastroenteritis [^1155eMVL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Diarrheal illness remains 1 of the top 5 causes of death in low-income and middle-income countries, especially for children < 5 years of age. Introduction of universal childhood vaccination against rotaviruses has greatly reduced the incidence and severity of illness in upper-income and lower-income settings. For adults, norovirus is the leading cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of diarrheal illness and is responsible for nearly 21 million episodes annually in the United States, of which 5.5 million are foodborne. Public health efforts to control and prevent norovirus illness have focused on rapid outbreak detection and source identification and control of transmission in institutional settings.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^116xwwoV]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

It can be inferred that OHIG treatment did not accomplish total viral eradication; nonetheless, it successfully diminished the quantity of infectious virus in the intestine momentarily, enabling the patient's immune system to eliminate the residual infection. The reported failure of OHIG treatment in certain instances may be attributed to norovirus mutation or the presence of a viral strain against which the donors who participated in the immunoglobulin preparation did not generate neutralising antibodies. Consequently, it would be prudent to standardise immunoglobulin preparations according to the concentration of norovirus‐specific neutralising antibodies or, alternatively, utilise convalescent plasma, akin to therapies for SARS‐CoV‐2.

There is also evidence that some of the immunoglobulin administered orally avoids degradation in the stomach and reaches the small intestine.

For our patient, we administered OHIG therapy alongside IVIG treatment. While lacking precise findings, one cannot dismiss the putative antiviral function of the idiotype network modulated by immunoglobulin therapy in the mucosa.

### Norwalk virus shedding after experimental human infection [^113Ven2R]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Noroviruses are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis in the United States. Although in vitro replication systems for these viruses have recently been described, human noroviruses cannot readily be grown in cell culture, and no small animal model of human norovirus infection is available. Much of what is known about these viruses has by necessity been learned from experimental human infection and from observational studies of naturally acquired infection. Norwalk virus is the prototype strain in the genus Norovirus, and many of the human experimental infection studies have used this strain. We describe the duration and magnitude of virus shedding in persons infected with Norwalk virus after experimental inoculation.

### Human noroviruses: recent advances in a 50-year history [^115xwCC8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noroviruses are a major cause of gastroenteritis. This review summarizes new information on noroviruses that may lead to the development of improved measures for limiting their human health impact.

Recent Findings

GII.4 strains remain the most common human noroviruses causing disease, although GII.2 and GII.17 strains have recently emerged as dominant strains in some populations. Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) expression on the gut mucosa drives susceptibility to different norovirus strains. Antibodies that block virus binding to these glycans correlate with protection from infection and illness. Immunocompromised patients are significantly impacted by norovirus infection, and the increasing availability of molecular diagnostics has improved infection recognition. Human noroviruses can be propagated in human intestinal enteroid cultures containing enterocytes that are a significant primary target for initiating infection. Strain-specific requirements for replication exist with bile being essential for some strains. Several vaccine candidates are progressing through preclinical and clinical development and studies of potential antiviral interventions are underway.

Summary

Norovirus epidemiology is complex and requires continued surveillance to track the emergence of new strains and recombinants, especially with the continued progress in vaccine development. Humans are the best model to study disease pathogenesis and prevention. New in-vitro cultivation methods should lead to better approaches for understanding virus-host interactions and ultimately to improved strategies for mitigation of human norovirus-associated disease.

### Protracted viral infections in patients with multiple myeloma receiving bispecific T-cell engager therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen [^111Tdewn]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Immune correlates of the disease course, protracted viral infections, and treatment. (A) shows immune correlates of parvovirus B19 infection with absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and hemoglobin (Hb) levels and the duration of bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE) therapy; (B) shows the course of parvovirus B19 infection with ALC, IgG, and Hb levels with ongoing BiTE therapy; (C) illustrates the protracted course of norovirus infection, treatment with nitazoxanide and autologous stem cell boost, frequency of diarrhea, and the duration of BiTE therapy.

As evident from the cases, use of prophylactic IVIG should be the standard of care. Comprehensive screening for viruses should be performed prior to initiation of BiTE and treatment postponed until complete eradication of any baseline active viral reactivation/infection. Active monitoring and surveillance for viruses such as CMV, EBV, SARS-CoV-2, and other community respiratory viruses should be pursued. A low threshold should be maintained for testing for appropriate pathogens based on apt clinical presentations (parvovirus, norovirus, HHV6B, etc). Pre-emptive antiviral therapy for CMV and EBV viremia with therapy interruption may be considered. Prophylactic antiviral therapy is essential. Since antibody synthesis is paralyzed in patients with RRMM, available strategies to provide passive immunity against ongoing viral infections such as against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern should be considered and asymptomatic infections treated early to prevent progression. Evolving evidence further supports the use of additional (booster) vaccine doses. Given significant risk of infections with prolonged use, examining BiTE therapies for RRMM on protocols with fixed duration or intermittent dosing are urgently needed. Meanwhile, comprehensive infection prevention strategies are urgently needed, particularly in patients with durable remission on ongoing therapy.

### About norovirus… [^111K6eJC]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What it is Norovirus is a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. It is sometimes called the "stomach flu" or the "stomach bug. " However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after. Keep Reading: Norovirus Facts and Stats. Signs and symptoms A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. Most common symptoms: Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain Other symptoms: Fever, headache, and body aches. Dehydration If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses.

Symptoms of dehydration include:

- Decreased urination
- Dry mouth and throat
- Feeling dizzy when standing up
- Crying with few or no tears
- Unusual sleepiness or fussiness. How it spreads Norovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways. You can get norovirus by: Having direct contact with someonewith norovirus, like caring for them, sharing food or eating utensils with them, or eating food handled by them. Eating food or drinking liquidsthat are contaminated with norovirus. Touching contaminated objects or surfacesand then putting your unwashed fingers in your mouth. You can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. Keep Reading: How Norovirus Spreads. Prevention Norovirus is very contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself and others, including:

- Wash your hands well and often.
- Cook shellfish thoroughly and wash fruits and vegetables.
- Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces.
- Wash laundry in hot water.
- Stay home when sick for 2 days after symptoms stop. Keep Reading: How to Prevent Norovirus. Testing and diagnosis Diagnostic methods for norovirus focus on detecting viral RNA or viral antigen. Diagnostic tests are available at all public health laboratories and many clinical laboratories. Keep Reading: Laboratory Testing for Norovirus.

### Introduction… [^1111YQ1v]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Infectious agent Norovirus infections are caused by non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses of the genus Norovirus, which in the past have also been referred to as Norwalk-like viruses, Norwalk viruses, and small round-structured viruses. Norovirus is one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis, sometimes referred to as stomach flu; however, norovirus has no biologic association with influenza or influenza viruses. Transmission Norovirus transmission occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, either through direct person-to-person contact or indirectly via contaminated food or water. Norovirus also is spread through fomites and aerosols of vomitus. Epidemiology Norovirus outbreaks frequently occur in settings where people live or congregate in close quarters and can easily infect each other.

Norovirus is a commonly reported cause of acute diarrhea among travelers in confined spaces. Although noroviruses have been detected in different animal species, those viruses are genetically different from the noroviruses infecting humans. Viral contamination of fomites can persist during and after outbreaks and can be a source of infection. On cruise ships, for instance, environmental contamination has caused recurrent norovirus outbreaks on successive cruises with newly boarded passengers. Transmission of norovirus on airplanes has been reported during domestic and international flights and likely results from contamination of lavatories or from symptomatic passengers in the cabin. Globally, norovirus causes approximately 18% of acute gastroenteritis cases and is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths annually.

In the United States, norovirus is the leading cause of medically attended gastroenteritis in young children and of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in people of all ages; norovirus causes approximately 19–21 million illnesses a year and approximately 50% of all foodborne disease outbreaks. Clinical presentation Infected people usually experience acute onset of vomiting and non-bloody diarrhea. The incubation period ranges from 12 to 48 hours. Other symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea, and sometimes a low-grade fever. Illness is generally self-limited, and most patients fully recover in 1–3 days. In some cases, especially among young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, dehydration can occur which may require medical attention.

### General information about norovirus… [^112Nxmb7]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

General Information about Norovirus General Information about Norovirus Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause gastroenteritis in people. Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines, causing an acute onset of severe vomiting and diarrhea. Norovirus illness is usually brief in people who are otherwise healthy. Young children, the elderly, and people with other medical illnesses are most at risk for more severe or prolonged infection. Like all viral infections, noroviruses are not affected by treatment with antibiotics. Norovirus infections spread very rapidly. Healthcare facilities and other institutional settings are particularly at-risk for outbreaks because of increased person-to-person contact. For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library.

Symptoms of Norovirus The symptoms of norovirus illness usually include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and some stomach cramping. Sometimes people also have a low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. People may suddenly feel very sick and vomit frequently or have several episodes of diarrhea, but most people get better within 1 or 2 days and they have no long-term health effects related to their illness. Diarrhea is more common in children and vomiting is more common in adults.
