## Question

Does hydroxyzine block histamine H1 or H2 receptors?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydroxyzine blocks histamine H1 or H2 receptors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hydroxyzine is classified on authoritative drug labels. Then, I should verify its receptor pharmacology and mechanism from contemporary structural biology. Next, I will check clinical indications and guideline usage patterns that imply the receptor target. Finally, I'll rule out H2 activity by contrasting with established H2 antagonists and ensure there are no credible sources listing hydroxyzine as H2‑blocking.

> Let me first confirm the formal classification. The FDA labels for hydroxyzine describe it as having antihistaminic properties used for pruritus and related allergic conditions, which in pharmacology parlance aligns with H1 blockade rather than H2, and they consistently refer to it clinically as an antihistamine without any claim of H2 antagonism; multiple clinical sources explicitly categorize hydroxyzine as a sedating first‑generation H1‑antihistamine, not an H2 blocker [^114TZr5f] [^117RXHtD] [^115bsh7C] [^114aqXLy].

> Wait, let me verify the receptor‑level mechanism. Modern structural and mechanistic literature makes clear that classic antihistamines like hydroxyzine act as inverse agonists at the histamine H1 receptor, whereas H2 antagonists are a distinct class exemplified by cimetidine, ranitidine, and nizatidine; hydroxyzine is not listed among H2 ligands in these receptor family overviews, which supports H1 selectivity for hydroxyzine [^113rqCzy] [^113BzBYc] [^117Lueaz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should cross‑check whether clinical usage patterns match H1 targeting. Hydroxyzine's approved and common uses — histamine‑mediated pruritus, urticaria, and sedative effects — are mediated predominantly via H1 pathways, and guidelines for urticaria and pruritus emphasize H1 antihistamines first line, with any H2 blockade (when tried) provided by separate agents like cimetidine or ranitidine rather than by hydroxyzine itself [^111G7gZs] [^114g6JGf] [^111XxWic].

> But wait, what if there is subtle gastric or H2‑like action hidden in labeling language; I need to check the gastrointestinal notes. The labels state hydroxyzine does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and may show mild antisecretory activity, yet they do not ascribe H2 receptor antagonism, and hydroxyzine is not used clinically as an H2 blocker — H2 antagonism remains the role of drugs like cimetidine and ranitidine in both structural reviews and therapeutic evidence syntheses, not hydroxyzine [^114TZr5f] [^117RXHtD] [^113rqCzy] [^111XxWic].

> I should double‑check for any contrary listings. Across FDA labels, contemporary receptor‑structure summaries, randomized trials describing hydroxyzine as a sedating first‑generation H1 antihistamine, and evidence‑based reviews, there is no credible evidence that hydroxyzine blocks H2 receptors; the consistent signal is H1 inverse agonism with no appreciable H2 antagonism [^114TZr5f] [^114aqXLy] [^115bsh7C] [^113rqCzy].

> Synthesis and answer: Hydroxyzine blocks histamine H1 receptors as an inverse agonist and is classified as a first‑generation H1 antihistamine; it does not function as an H2‑receptor antagonist [^115bsh7C] [^113rqCzy] [^111XxWic].

Hydroxyzine blocks histamine **H1 receptors** [^113rqCzy] and does not block **H2 receptors**. It is a first-generation antihistamine [^114aqXLy] that **acts as an H1 inverse agonist** [^111R9Dov] [^113BzBYc], providing antipruritic, anxiolytic, and sedative effects, but it does not reduce gastric acid secretion or treat acid-related disorders.

---

## Pharmacological classification and mechanism of action

Hydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine [^112KYm3s] that **selectively blocks H1 receptors** in the CNS and periphery [^113rqCzy], reducing histamine-mediated symptoms such as pruritus, urticaria, and allergic reactions [^114TZr5f]. It also acts as an inverse agonist at H1 receptors [^111R9Dov], stabilizing the inactive receptor conformation and reducing constitutive activity.

---

## Clinical implications of H1 receptor blockade

Hydroxyzine's H1 blockade produces several **clinically relevant effects**:

- **Antipruritic effects**: Effective for pruritus from allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatoses [^1129B8xH] [^112KYm3s].

- **Anxiolytic and sedative effects**: Used for anxiety, tension, and as a sedative premedication due to CNS penetration and H1 blockade [^1136REKF] [^112KYm3s].

- **Antiemetic effects**: Reduces nausea and vomiting [^114TZr5f], likely via central H1 blockade [^117RXHtD].

---

## Lack of H2 receptor blockade

Hydroxyzine **does not block H2 receptors**, which mediate gastric acid secretion [^113rqCzy]; therefore, it does not reduce gastric acid output or treat acid-related disorders. H2 antagonists (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine) are used for peptic ulcer disease and GERD; hydroxyzine is **not indicated** for these conditions.

---

## Clinical indications and therapeutic uses

Hydroxyzine **is indicated for**:

- **Pruritus**: Chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatoses [^111ajqi1] [^112KYm3s].

- **Anxiety and tension**: Short-term management of anxiety and tension states [^1136REKF] [^112KYm3s].

- **Sedation**: Premedication and postoperative sedation [^112KYm3s] [^111qyxGX].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Antiemetic use in various clinical settings [^114TZr5f] [^117RXHtD].

---

## Side effects and clinical considerations

Hydroxyzine's **H1 blockade** and CNS penetration cause:

- **Sedation and drowsiness**: Common due to CNS H1 blockade [^1135YTAc].

- **Anticholinergic effects**: Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention [^112KYm3s].

- **CNS depression**: Caution with other CNS depressants [^114si9UN].

- **QT prolongation**: Use caution in patients with QT risk factors [^114si9UN].

---

Hydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine that **selectively blocks H1 receptors**, providing antipruritic, anxiolytic, and sedative effects, but it does not block H2 receptors or reduce gastric acid secretion.

## References

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride [^112KYm3s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: For the symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. It is also useful in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria, atopic and contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus.

- **Sedative use**: As a sedative, hydroxyzine can be used in premedication and following general anesthesia. It may potentiate meperidine and barbiturates, so their use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Hydroxyzine is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way, and it may be used concurrently with this agent.

- **Long-term use**: The effectiveness of hydroxyzine as an antianxiety agent for long-term use, defined as more than four months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Histamine and H1-antihistamines: Celebrating a century of progress [^111R9Dov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

In this review, we celebrate a century of progress since the initial description of the physiologic and pathologic roles of histamine, and 70 years since the introduction of H(1)-antihistamines for clinical use. We discuss histamine and provide clinically relevant information about the molecular mechanisms of action of H(1)-antihistamines as inverse agonists (not antagonists or blockers) with immunoregulatory effects.

Unlike first (old)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced from 1942 to the mid-1980s, most second (new)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced subsequently have been extensively investigated with regard to clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety. Moreover, they are relatively free from adverse effects and are not causally linked with fatalities after overdose.

Important advances include improved nasal and ophthalmic H(1)-antihistamines with rapid onset of action (in minutes) for allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis treatment, respectively, and the effective and safe use of high (up to 4-fold) doses of oral second-generation H(1)-antihistamines for chronic urticaria treatment.

New H(1)-antihistamines introduced for clinical use include oral formulations (bilastine and rupatadine) and ophthalmic formulations (alcaftadine and bepotastine). Clinical studies of H(3)-antihistamines with enhanced decongestant effects have been conducted in patients with allergic rhinitis. Additional novel compounds being studied include H(4)-antihistamines with anti-inflammatory effects in allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and other diseases.

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride [^114TZr5f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is chemically unrelated to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate, or benzodiazepines. Although not a cortical depressant, its action may result from suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been observed experimentally. Experimentally and clinically confirmed effects include bronchodilator activity, antihistaminic and analgesic properties. An antiemetic effect has been demonstrated through the apomorphine and veriloid tests.

Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine, in therapeutic doses, does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and generally exhibits mild antisecretory activity.

Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with clinical effects typically noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.

### Structural basis of ligand recognition and activation of the histamine receptor family [^113rqCzy]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Histamine is a widely distributed biogenic amine that functions as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and as an important signaling molecule in the immune system, gut, and skin. It is produced through the action of L-histidine decarboxylase (HDC), which catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-histidine. Histamine is released most often by mast cells and basophils via degranulation in response to various immune and non-immune stimuli. Moreover, it mediates a wide range of physiological processes, including allergic reactions, inflammation, wakefulness, gastric acid secretion, and neurotransmission.

Many histamine functions are mediated by G protein-coupled histamine receptors, which include four members: H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R. Compared to other G protein-coupled receptors, histamine receptors have low sequence homology, which varies between 16–35% at the protein level. Drugs targeting H1R, H2R, and H3R have been used to treat allergies, gastroduodenal ulcers, and narcolepsy.

The inflammatory response caused by histamine release has long been thought to be mediated by the histamine H1 receptor, and H1 receptor antagonists, often referred to as antihistamines, have been used for years to treat allergies. Commonly used histamine H1 receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine, promethazine, and chlorpheniramine, are the most widely used nonspecific antiallergic drugs. Similarly, H2 antagonists, such as cimetidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine, are widely used to inhibit the oversecretion of gastric acid for the treatment of related conditions.

### Therapeutic options in allergic disease: Antihistamines as systemic antiallergic agents [^1143chop]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

As has been reported throughout this supplement, the pathophysiologic factors of allergic diseases involve many elements of systemic disease, such as effector-cell recruitment from circulation, stimulation of bone marrow progenitors, systemic effector-cell priming, and anaphylactic reactions. With this understanding, allergic inflammation can be thought of as a reflection of systemic immunologic responses with compartmentalized manifestations in various organ systems, including the upper respiratory tract, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Thus, any therapeutic approach to the treatment of allergic disease should address, in addition to the localized disease manifestations, the systemic immunologic dysregulation.

Second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine) have been used since the 1980s to treat localized allergy symptoms in the upper airways, skin, and, in some cases, the lungs. However, the efficacy of these agents in controlling systemic immune dysregulation and chronic allergic inflammation (e.g. nasal congestion) has not been proven. The potential role of newer antihistamines in the amelioration of both localized and systemic aspects of allergic disease represents an active area of interest. Desloratadine, a new selective histamine H(1)-receptor antagonist with potent antihistaminic and anti-inflammatory activity, is introduced and its potential for treating the systemic aspects of allergic disease is discussed.

### Efficacy and safety profile of fexofenadine HCl: A unique therapeutic option in H1-receptor antagonist treatment [^112gd3wQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Results of head-to-head comparative trials suggest that fexofenadine might offer distinct advantages compared with other antihistamines. Fexofenadine is highly selective for peripheral H(1)-receptors and does not cross the blood-brain barrier, as shown by positron emission tomography. These data support findings that fexofenadine is nonsedating and does not impair performance or driving ability, even at very high doses. In addition, fexofenadine does not interact with muscarinic receptors, which might offer a potential advantage compared with desloratadine, the recently approved active metabolite of loratadine. Fexofenadine is devoid of adverse cardiac effects, and changes in electrocardiogram parameters are not significantly different from those observed with placebo.

Fexofenadine has also been shown to have a favorable effect on nasal congestion. This therapeutic advantage might be related to its significant antiallergic properties, i.e. the demonstrated ability of fexofenadine to blunt the inflammatory effects of preformed and de novo synthesized mediators at clinically relevant doses in vivo and in vitro. Cumulatively, these benefits distinguish fexofenadine from other antihistamines and make it an optimum therapeutic option for treating allergy-mediated respiratory and dermatologic diseases.

### SPL drug information for hydroxyzine pamoate [^114si9UN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxyzine pamoate PO (also known as Vistaril):

- **Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxyzine has rarely been associated with this condition.

- **CNS depression**: Use extreme caution when concurrently using CNS depressants, such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates.

- **Somnolence**: Exercise extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Torsade de pointes**: Exercise caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions predisposing to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, or those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. Also, be cautious in cases of recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

### Molecular mechanism of antihistamines recognition and regulation of the histamine Hreceptor [^116yaxzg]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Histamine is a biogenic amine that plays an important role in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions by activating four different G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), classified as H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R. These four receptors are either well-established drug targets (H1R, H2R, and H3R) or are being evaluated for related diseases, such as targeting H4R for anti-inflammatory diseases. Among them, H1R is widely distributed throughout the body in epithelial cells and smooth vascular, neuronal, glial, and immune cells. When activated by histamine released by mast cells or basophils, H1R can cause allergic and inflammatory symptoms and has therefore been extensively targeted in the development of antihistamines.

At the time of writing, more than 45 H1R-antihistamines are available worldwide, and moreover, new antihistamines are continuously being investigated. Since the first antihistamine was introduced in 1937, antihistamines have evolved through the development process of first-generation, second-generation, and now new second-generation antihistamines. Although first-generation antihistamines, such as chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine, were once widely used clinically, they cause adverse central nervous system (CNS) responses due to their poor receptor selectivity and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and bind to H1R in the CNS. By introducing new chemical groups, such as carboxyl groups combined with protonated amines, second-generation antihistamines have been successively developed.

### Molecular mechanism of antihistamines recognition and regulation of the histamine Hreceptor [^112gizCi]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Recently, new second-generation antihistamines, mainly derived from the active metabolites or optical isomers of second-generation antihistamines, have been introduced. For example, as a metabolite of the second-generation antihistamine loratadine, desloratadine has been developed and defined as a new-generation antihistamine; however, it remains doubtful whether these newer antihistamines are actually superior to their predecessors in terms of efficacy and safety. Great challenges still exist in the development of new antihistamines, especially due to the lack of interaction details between H1R and second-generation antihistamines, which hinders the rational design of new drugs.

In addition to guiding drug development, elucidating the structural states of H1R will also help to understand the mechanism of inverse modulation of ligands on GPCRs. Since H1R has a high basal signaling capacity, a prominent feature of many GPCRs, and all antihistamines have been shown to be inverse agonists rather than antagonists, how H1R obtains its constitutive activity and how it is blocked by antihistamines remain poorly elucidated.

We determined the structure of H1R in the apo form and bound to different antihistamines. The structural information provides insights into the interaction and modulation of H1R with antihistamines and will facilitate the structure-based design of next-generation drugs.

### Patanase [^113gJ4WF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Olopatadine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist. The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans.

- **Mechanism of action**: Olopatadine functions as a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, with its activity well-validated across various testing platforms including isolated tissues and animal models.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Cardiac effects**: In a placebo-controlled cardiovascular safety study, 32 healthy volunteers received 20 mg oral solution of olopatadine twice daily for 14 days, which is 8-fold greater than the recommended daily nasal dose. The mean QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia's correction method for heart rate) change from baseline was -2.7 msec and -3.8 msec for olopatadine and placebo, respectively. In this study, 8 subjects treated with olopatadine had a QTcF change from baseline of 30–60 msec, 1 subject had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec. Eight subjects treated with placebo had a QTcF change from baseline of 30–60 msec, no subjects had a QTcF change from baseline greater than 60 msec, and no subjects had QTcF values greater than 500 msec.

	- In a 12-month study involving 429 perennial allergic rhinitis patients treated with Patanase Nasal Spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily), no evidence was observed of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation.

### H1-antihistamines: Inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects [^116j9sxS]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

This review addresses novel concepts of histamine H1-receptor function and attempts to relate them to the anti-inflammatory effects of H1-antihistamines. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiotoxic effects of H1-antihistamines are discussed. H1-receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the inactive and active conformations of which coexist in equilibrium. The degree of receptor activation in the absence of histamine is its 'constitutive activity'. In this two-state model, histamine acts as an agonist by combining with and stabilizing the activated conformation of the H1-receptor to shift the equilibrium towards the activated state.

Drugs classified previously as antagonists act as either inverse agonists or neutral antagonists. Inverse agonists combine with and stabilize the inactive conformation of the receptor, shifting the equilibrium towards the inactive state. Thus, they may down-regulate constitutive receptor activity, even in the absence of histamine. Neutral antagonists combine equally with both conformations of the receptor, do not affect basal receptor activity, but do interfere with agonist binding. All H1-antihistamines examined at the time of writing are inverse agonists. As the term 'H1-receptor antagonists' is obviously erroneous, we suggest that it be replaced by 'H1-antihistamines'.
The observations that H1-receptors modulate NF-kappaB activation and that there are complex interactions between GPCRs have allowed us to postulate receptor-dependent mechanisms for some anti-inflammatory effects of H1-antihistamines, e.g. inhibition of ICAM-1 expression.

### New onset delusional infestation following abrupt cessation of hydroxyzine [^116SCTLR]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

We concluded that this presentation of delusional infestation (DI) was likely caused by hydroxyzine withdrawal. Using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale, the patient earned a total of 4 points as follows: 3 points for the temporal nature of symptoms correlating with drug withdrawal and reintroduction, 1 point for previous reports of sedative withdrawal correlating with DI, and another 1 point for objective evidence of the adverse event (matchbox sign). However, he lost 1 point for the possibility that DI could be due to another cause, such as unsuspected illicit drug use. Historically, this patient has never reported alcohol use, and throughout our follow-ups over the years, we neither suspected illicit drug use nor had a reason to perform drug screening, although a negative screen would have been ideal. Another potential confounding factor was that the patient's sister had passed away just weeks before, and psychological stress could have contributed to his acute presentation of DI, but it is unlikely for this to abate in such a rapid fashion.

DI may be caused by stimulating medications or substances (e.g. amphetamines and cocaine) or withdrawal of sedative medications or substances (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol). One case report describes new-onset DI following acute withdrawal from the pharmacologic sedative trazodone. To our knowledge, we report the first known cases of DI caused by cessation of hydroxyzine, a histamine-1 receptor (H1R) antagonist. Hydroxyzine and other first-generation antihistamines are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and target H1Rs throughout the brain.

### Molecular mechanism of antihistamines recognition and regulation of the histamine H receptor [^115zCcpN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Histamine receptors are a group of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play important roles in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Antihistamines targeting the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) have been widely used to relieve symptoms of allergy and inflammation. To uncover the details of the regulation of H1R by known second-generation antihistamines and provide clues for the rational design of newer antihistamines, we determine the cryo-EM structure of H1R in the apo form and bound to different antihistamines. In addition to the deep hydrophobic cavity, we identify a secondary ligand-binding site in H1R, which may support the introduction of new derivative groups to generate newer antihistamines. Furthermore, these structures show that antihistamines exert inverse regulation by utilizing a shared phenyl group that inserts into the deep cavity and blocks the movement of the toggle switch residue W428 6.48. Together, these results enrich our understanding of GPCR modulation and facilitate the structure-based design of novel antihistamines.

### Ryaltris [^111ubcWL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Ryaltris contains both olopatadine hydrochloride and mometasone furoate. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to Ryaltris.

- **Olopatadine hydrochloride**: Olopatadine is a histamine-1 (H1) receptor inhibitor. The antihistaminic activity of olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans.

- **Mometasone furoate**: Mometasone furoate is a corticosteroid demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory activity. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on allergic rhinitis is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory effects on multiple cell types (e.g. mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g. histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: A study specifically designed to evaluate the effect of Ryaltris on the QT interval has not been conducted. In a 12-month study involving 429 patients treated with olopatadine hydrochloride two sprays per nostril (665 mcg per spray) twice daily, no evidence of any effect of olopatadine hydrochloride on QT prolongation has been observed.

- **HPA axis effect**: A study specifically designed to evaluate the effect of Ryaltris on the HPA axis has not been conducted. In one study, daily nasal doses of 200 and 400 mcg of mometasone furoate and oral dose of 10 mg prednisone were compared to placebo in 64 patients (22 to 44 years of age) with allergic rhinitis. Adrenal function was assessed before and after 36 consecutive days.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^117RXHtD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxyzine pamoate is unrelated chemically to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate, or the benzodiazepines. It is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to the suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

- **Skeletal muscle relaxation and other effects**: Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally. Additionally, bronchodilator activity and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated.

- **Gastric secretion and absorption**: Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine, in therapeutic dosage, does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and, in most cases, has mild antisecretory activity. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the clinical effects of hydroxyzine pamoate are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.

### British association of dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis, 2018 [^117TcjVp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pruritus, more specifically with respect to systemic therapy, the BAD 2018 guidelines recommend considering a combination of H1-antihistamines and histamine-3 receptor antagonists, such as fexofenadine and cimetidine, for patients with generalized pruritus.

### Structural basis of ligand recognition and design of antihistamines targeting histamine H receptor [^114dmkSf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The successes in therapeutic targeting of H1R, H2R, and H3R have inspired and propelled the development of numerous H4R antagonists and agonists for associated diseases. JNJ7777120 was initially developed as a selective antagonist for H4R based on its ability to inhibit histamine-induced Gi activation. It exhibits 1000-fold selectivity over H1R, H2R, and H3R. JNJ7777120 blocks histamine-induced chemotaxis in mouse mast cells and neutrophil infiltration, indicating its potential for treating inflammatory diseases. Later, JNJ7777120 was discovered to recruit β-arrestin without activating G proteins, making it a biased agonist for H4R, and offering a promising strategy to minimize undesired side effects. Several compounds targeting H4R have entered clinical trials for asthma, IBD, and arthritis; however, none have prevailed to date.

In contrast to H1R, H2R, and H3R, structural information for H4R is currently lacking. The first reported histamine receptor structure is the X-ray structure of the antagonist doxepin-bound H1R, resolved in 2011. This structure reveals the overall framework of H1R and the mode of antagonist binding, serving as a template for designing and developing H1R antihistamines. It took a decade for the active cryo-EM structure of H1R to emerge. The active structure shows a reduction in the size of the ligand-binding pocket via the ionic interaction of histamine with key residues in transmembrane helix 3, 6, and 7 (TM3, 6, and 7), followed by an outward movement of TM6 to open the intracellular cavity for the Gq protein.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^115xuiW1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Treatment approaches acting on peripheral sensory nerves**: Antihistamines are well-established antipruritic agents that inhibit H1R, which is expressed by itch-transmitting peripheral sensory nerve fibers, thus attenuating histaminergic itch. Histaminergic itch significantly contributes to itch observed in urticaria and insect bites/stings, and these forms can be effectively treated with antihistamines. However, most cases outside these dermatoses may result from nonhistaminergic itch mechanisms, rendering antihistamines suboptimal.

Analgesics and anesthetics inhibit the activation of ion channels, particularly NaV channels, and the generation of action potentials. Topical creams containing lidocaine are available as over-the-counter antipruritics in Japan and other countries. Topical ketamine (10% or 5%)–amitriptyline (5%)–lidocaine (5%) (TKAL) has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating both inflammatory itch (such as in atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) and neuropathic itch (like brachioradial pruritus and other neuropathic forms).

Use of coolants (cooling agents) results in partial and transient alleviation of the itching sensation. They activate cold-sensing TRPM8-expressing nociceptors, which stimulate Bhlhb-5-expressing itch-inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. Topical formulations containing TRPM8 agonists, such as menthol (1%–3%) and/or camphor, are available over-the-counter in Japan and other countries. Notably, a subset of patients with chronic itch report exacer…

### Update on rupatadine in the management of allergic disorders [^11712gB2]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In a review of rupatadine published in 2008, the primary focus was on its role as an antihistamine, with a thorough evaluation of its pharmacology and interaction with histamine H1-receptors. At the time, however, evidence was already emerging of a broader mechanism of action for rupatadine involving other mediators implicated in the inflammatory cascade.

Over the past few years, the role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a potent mediator involved in the hypersensitivity-type allergic reaction has gained greater recognition. Rupatadine has dual affinity for histamine H1-receptors and PAF receptors. In view of the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma group's call for oral antihistamines to exhibit additive anti-allergic/anti-inflammatory properties, further exploration of rupatadine's anti-PAF effects was a logical step forward.

New studies have demonstrated that rupatadine inhibits PAF effects in nasal airways and produces a greater reduction in nasal symptoms than levocetirizine. A meta-analysis involving more than 2500 patients has consolidated the clinical evidence for rupatadine in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in adults and children (level of evidence Ia, recommendation A).

Other recent advances include observational studies of rupatadine in everyday clinical practice situations and approval of a new formulation (1 mg/ml oral solution) for use in children. In this reappraisal, we revisit some key properties and pivotal clinical studies of rupatadine and examine new clinical data in more detail, including studies that measured health-related quality of life.

### An evaluation of the effects of high-dose fexofenadine on the central nervous system: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers [^113s4Uey]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

As regards central nervous system (CNS) effects, there are three types of antihistamines: those that cross the blood-brain barrier and cause widespread impairment of cognitive and psychomotor function; those that cross into the brain and, although without much impairment at low clinical doses, have a dose-related relationship to impairment; and those that do not cross into the brain and therefore possess no intrinsic potential for impairing CNS function.

- **Objective**: To investigate the acute effects of fexofenadine (360 mg) on various aspects of cognitive and psychomotor function in comparison to placebo and promethazine (positive internal control), an antihistamine known to produce psychomotor and cognitive impairment.

- **Methods**: Fifteen healthy volunteers received fexofenadine 360 mg, promethazine 30 mg, and placebo in a 3-way cross-over, double-blind study. For each treatment condition, subjects were required to perform a series of tests of cognitive function and psychomotor performance at baseline and 1, 3, 5, and 7 hours post-dose. The test battery consisted of critical flicker fusion (CFF), choice reaction time (CRT), compensatory tracking task (CTT), and a subjective assessment of sedation (LARS).

- **Results**: Fexofenadine was not distinguishable from placebo in any of the objective and subjective tests for up to seven hours following drug administration. However, all measures were significantly impaired following the administration of promethazine, which confirms the sensitivity of the test battery for sedation.

### Second-generation H1-antihistamines in chronic urticaria: An evidence-based review [^112rCEFz]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The effects of urticaria are predominantly mediated by histamine release; therefore, H1-antihistamines are the mainstay of treatment. Second-generation H1-antihistamines, compared with their first-generation counterparts, have demonstrated improved peripheral H1-receptor selectivity and decreased lipophilicity, which minimizes CNS adverse effects, and antiallergic properties in addition to being histamine inverse agonists.

Evidence of clinical efficacy and tolerability of second-generation H1-antihistamines available in the US for the treatment of chronic urticaria (CU) was analyzed using the GRADE system to develop the strength of recommendations for particular therapies. The evidence for the safety and efficacy of the majority of second-generation H1-antihistamines available in the US is of high quality, leading to a strong recommendation for their use in CU.

- **Efficacy comparisons**: There is a limited amount of data of variable quality comparing the efficacy between various second-generation H1-antihistamines in CU, leading to weak recommendations. For instance, cetirizine is favored over fexofenadine, and levocetirizine over desloratadine.

- **Higher dose efficacy**: Limited data of variable quality exist for the efficacy of higher doses of second-generation H1-antihistamines in CU patients not responsive to standard doses. These limited data lead to a strong recommendation that higher-than-recommended doses of fexofenadine do not offer greater efficacy in controlling CU and a weak recommendation that higher doses of levocetirizine and desloratadine are more effective in CU unresponsive to standard doses. More studies of higher quality are needed for further clarification.

### Clarinex [^112SJ9EH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Desloratadine is a long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H1-receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2–3 ng/mL (7 nanomolar), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H1-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro. Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H1-receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period. The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.

- **Effects on QT**: Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In CLARINEX-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods. Using the QTc(Bazett), there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in CLARINEX-treated subjects relative to placebo.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^114aqXLy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

The urticaria activity score (UAS) is outlined in Figure 3. The median scores were reduced from a baseline of 5.5 (3.75–6.00) to 2 (0–3) (P = 0.002) or 1 (0–4) (P < 0.001) following 5 days of treatment with levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine or levocetirizine monotherapy, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two treatments (P = 0.182).

Figure 3 displays the urticaria activity scores at the start of the study (baseline) and after 5 days of treatment with levocetirizine 15 mg daily plus hydroxyzine 50 mg at night (Levo + Hydroxy) or levocetirizine 20 mg daily alone (Levo Monotherapy). Horizontal bars indicate median values. Significant differences between treatments were calculated by Wilcoxon's nonparametric test for paired data, with 'NS' indicating no significant difference.

As the UAS combines objective and subjective elements, namely weals and pruritus, these were also analyzed separately. Weal scores were significantly reduced by both levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine (P = 0.005) and levocetirizine monotherapy (P = 0.003), with no significant difference between treatments (P = 0.314). Pruritus scores were also significantly reduced by both levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine (P = 0.001) and levocetirizine monotherapy (P < 0.001), yet again with no significant difference between treatments (P = 0.141).

### Variant effect of first- and second-generation antihistamines as clues to their mechanism of action on the sneeze reflex in the common cold [^112a4TNk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment with first-generation antihistamines reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal mucus weight, and, in some instances, cough in subjects with experimental or natural colds; however, treatment with second-generation antihistamines has not been effective for these complaints in trials in subjects with natural colds. This article reports the negative results of a clinical trial with loratadine, a second-generation antihistamine, in adults in the rhinovirus challenge model. This finding in the highly controlled setting of the challenge model confirms the earlier negative studies with second-generation antihistamines in natural colds. First-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors as well as passing the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly block histaminic receptors and do not pass the blood-brain barrier. The effectiveness of first-generation antihistamines in blocking sneezing in colds may be due primarily to neuropharmacological manipulation of histaminic and muscarinic receptors in the medulla.

### Guideline on the investigation and management of acute transfusion reactions [^114fFKoE]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute transfusion reactions, specifically concerning antihistamines, the BSH 2023 guidelines recommend considering slowing the transfusion and administering an antihistamine to patients with mild allergic reactions.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: A randomized controlled trial [^116YPeKx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

The primary result of this study was that both levocetirizine monotherapy and therapy with levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine were similarly effective in reducing urticarial symptoms, reducing night-time sleep disturbances, and improving quality of life (QoL). In contrast, daytime sedation was significantly less with levocetirizine monotherapy compared to levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine.

The effectiveness of levocetirizine in relieving the symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and improving QoL confirms previous findings. It is of particular relevance in this study that the subjective element of the urticaria activity score (UAS), specifically the severity of pruritus, was similarly reduced by both treatment regimens. This suggests that the central effects of hydroxyzine do not contribute to the overall antipruritic effect, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that histamine is involved primarily in the peripheral genesis of itch. Furthermore, both treatment regimens having a similar effect in reducing night-time sleep disturbances again indicates that it is the peripheral antipruritic effect of the non-sedating second-generation H1-antihistamine that is of prime importance rather than any central sedative effects.

### Zerviate [^117TpdWW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Zerviate, an antihistamine, functions as a histamine-1 (H1) receptor antagonist. The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has been documented in a variety of animal and human models. **Mechanism of action**: In vivo and ex vivo animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity. In vitro receptor binding studies have demonstrated no measurable affinity for receptors other than H1 receptors.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: In healthy subjects, bilateral topical ocular dosing of one drop of Zerviate™ (cetirizine ophthalmic solution) 0.24% resulted in a mean cetirizine plasma Cmax of 1.7 ng/mL following a single dose and 3.1 ng/mL after twice-daily dosing for one week. The observed mean terminal half-life of cetirizine was 8.6 hours following a single dose and 8.2 hours after twice-daily dosing of Zerviate for one week.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^114g6JGf]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Pruritus can persist in patients with polycythaemia vera (PV) even after their blood counts have normalized. Antihistamines, both H1 and H2 receptor antagonists, are commonly prescribed, although they demonstrate mixed results. Combination therapy at high doses may be required to be effective. Other adjunctive therapies that have been shown to be beneficial include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants, thalidomide, and naltrexone have also been found to be beneficial. Sometimes, creams containing menthol can provide some relief.

From a practical point of view, cutting nails is advisable to reduce skin damage. Joint management with a dermatologist should be considered for refractory symptoms and for patients requiring narrow‐band‐ultraviolet B (UVB) or ultraviolet A (UVA) treatment. The addition of oral psoralen to UV light (PUVA) is occasionally used. In patients who do not require cytoreductive therapy, the above options should be tried prior to initiating cytoreductive therapy to control pruritus.

- **Recommendations: Pruritus**:
	- Use antihistamines, which may require high doses and multiple agents. (GRADE 1C)
	- Consider the addition of H2 antagonists, such as ranitidine or cimetidine, for dual‐histamine blockade. (GRADE 2C)
	- Consider additional adjunctive therapies such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Molecular mechanism of antihistamines recognition and regulation of the histamine Hreceptor [^113BzBYc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Histamine receptors are a group of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play important roles in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Antihistamines targeting the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) have been widely used to relieve symptoms of allergy and inflammation. To uncover the details of the regulation of H1R by known second-generation antihistamines and provide clues for the rational design of newer antihistamines, we determined the cryo-EM structure of H1R in the apo form and when bound to different antihistamines. We identified a deep hydrophobic cavity and a secondary ligand-binding site in H1R, which may support the introduction of new derivative groups to generate newer antihistamines. Furthermore, these structures show that antihistamines exert inverse regulation by utilizing a shared phenyl group that inserts into the deep cavity and blocks the movement of the toggle switch residue W428 6.48. Together, these results enrich our understanding of GPCR modulation and facilitate the structure-based design of novel antihistamines.

### Molecular mechanism of antihistamines recognition and regulation of the histamine H receptor [^112DeTpY]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Astemizole is a second-generation antihistamine drug; however, it was withdrawn from the market due to its potential to cause arrhythmias at high doses. This is because astemizole not only targets the H1 receptor (H1R) but also blocks the hERG potassium channel. Additionally, astemizole has been shown to disrupt the protein-protein interaction within the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), thereby arresting the proliferation of cancer cells. Repurposing astemizole for new clinical uses has been continuously explored. Delineating the molecular recognition mechanism with astemizole is a prerequisite for precise modification to eliminate its pleiotropic effects.

The H1R structure bound to astemizole reveals that the fluorophenyl and benzimidazole groups of astemizole occupy positions similar to those accommodating the methoxyphenyl and pyridine groups of mepyramine, respectively. A hydrogen bond mediated by Y431 6.51, along with extensive hydrophobic interactions, coordinates astemizole. The piperidine group extends as the dimethylamino moiety of mepyramine and establishes an electrostatic interaction with the H1R residue D107 3.32. The shared pose of mepyramine and astemizole in the orthosteric pocket suggests that H1R adopts a conserved binding mode for ligands with similar chemotypes. Interestingly, the additional methoxyphenyl moiety of astemizole extends from the main ligand binding pocket toward the site defined by residues from ECL2, TM2, TM3, and TM7.

### Topical antihistamines display potent anti-inflammatory activity linked in part to enhanced permeability barrier function [^116yBGrg]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Systemic antagonists of the histamine type 1 and 2 receptors (H1/2r) are widely used as anti-pruritics and central sedatives but demonstrate only modest anti-inflammatory activity. Many inflammatory dermatoses result from defects in cutaneous barrier function, and since keratinocytes express both Hr1 and Hr2, it is hypothesized that H1/2r antagonists might be more effective if used topically to treat inflammatory dermatoses.

Topical H1/2r antagonists additively enhanced permeability barrier homeostasis in normal mouse skin by: (i) stimulation of epidermal differentiation, leading to thickened cornified envelopes, and (ii) enhanced epidermal lipid synthesis and secretion. As barrier homeostasis was enhanced to a comparable extent in mast cell-deficient mice with no further improvement following the application of topical H1/2r antagonists, it suggests that H1/2r antagonists likely oppose mast cell-derived histamines.

In four immunologically diverse murine disease models characterized by either inflammation alone (acute irritant contact dermatitis, acute allergic contact dermatitis) or by prominent barrier abnormalities (subacute allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis), topical H1/2r agonists aggravated, whereas H1/2r antagonists improved, inflammation and/or barrier function. The apparent ability of topical H1r/2r antagonists to target epidermal H1/2r could lead to increased efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses, likely due to decreased inflammation and enhanced barrier function. These results could shift paradigms in the treatment of such conditions.

### Role of histamine in the pathophysiology of asthma: Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of H1-receptor antagonists [^111o5Bvf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Cumulative clinical and laboratory evidence on histamine and its actions suggests that it has a pathophysiologic role in asthma. These findings have renewed interest in the potential therapeutic role of H1 antihistamines in this disease. A murine model of allergen-induced airway inflammation and methacholine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness has been used to clarify mechanisms of airway function, to identify potential therapeutic targets, and to investigate the effects of the H1-receptor antagonist fexofenadine. Findings suggest that there may be a role for second-generation antihistamines in treating asthma, with patient selection as well as dosing both important therapeutic considerations. Because high-dose therapy may be required to achieve a clinical response, agents with the widest therapeutic window and the lowest potential for sedation would offer the greatest therapeutic potential.

### Histamine H1 blocker hydroxyzine improves sleep in patients with cirrhosis and minimal hepatic encephalopathy: a randomized controlled pilot trial [^116BXB2R]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). High credibility.

Sleep difficulty is common in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Dysregulated histamine neurotransmission is associated with altered circadian rhythmicity, which is partially restored following central histamine H1 receptor blockade in cirrhotic animals. This study investigated the effects of the histamine H1 blocker hydroxyzine on sleep alterations in patients with cirrhosis, using a double-blind, randomized controlled trial design.

A total of 35 patients (age 56 years [36–69], Pugh's score 9 [7–12], portosystemic shunt: N = 7) with minimal HE and long-standing sleep difficulties (8 months [4–48]) who were free from benzodiazepines were randomized to receive hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime (N = 17) or placebo (N = 18) for a 10-day period. Measurements of sleep behavior using a visual analog scale and wrist actigraphy, neuropsychological tests, and protein s100beta serum levels were performed at baseline and on day 10.

Subjective improvement in sleep was observed in 40% of hydroxyzine-treated patients, but in none receiving placebo (P ≤ 0.04). Wrist actigraphy indicated a ≥ 30% increase in sleep efficiency (P < 0.04) among the hydroxyzine group. Neuropsychological tests (Z scores) and protein s100beta levels remained statistically unchanged in both groups. However, one patient developed an acute episode of encephalopathy, which was reversible upon cessation of hydroxyzine.

In conclusion, hydroxyzine 25 mg at bedtime improved sleep behavior, as assessed both subjectively and through wrist actigraphy, in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy compared to placebo.

### Molecular mechanism of antihistamines recognition and regulation of the histamine H receptor [^117Lueaz]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Desloratadine, an antihistamine for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, is a metabolic derivative of another second-generation drug, loratadine. For this reason, desloratadine has been called a new-generation antihistamine. However, except for displaying a higher affinity and slower dissociation rate with the target receptor H1R, desloratadine does not appear to confer improved efficacy or additional clinical benefit compared to loratadine. Nevertheless, it is still of great significance to uncover the molecular mechanisms leading to the difference in affinity to provide clues for the design of next-generation antihistamines.

The solved structure of desloratadine-H1R shows that desloratadine is buried in the main orthosteric pocket, and its tricyclic group is enclosed by a series of hydrophobic residues such as Y108 3.33, Y431 6.51, and F432 6.52 in a manner similar to the other two ligands. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions, Y431 6.51 also forms a hydrogen bond with the N atom in the pyridine moiety, as in the mepyramine-H1R complex. Mutation of Y431 6.51 and F432 6.52, two residues in which mutation does not significantly affect the basal signaling ability of H1R, dramatically impairs the ability of mepyramine and desloratadine to inhibit H1R signaling, demonstrating the indispensability of main pocket residues in the coordination of ligands. Finally, the piperidine ring also forms an electrostatic interaction with D107 3.33.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^1135YTAc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Many physicians believe that the most effective way to treat chronic urticaria is to take a non-sedating second-generation H1-antihistamine in the morning and a sedating first-generation H1-antihistamine, usually hydroxyzine, at night to enhance sleep. But is this belief well founded?

- **Objectives**: To test this belief by comparing the effectiveness and prevalence of unwanted sedative effects when treating patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with levocetirizine 15 mg daily plus hydroxyzine 50 mg at night (levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine) vs. levocetirizine 20 mg daily (levocetirizine monotherapy).

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, 24 patients with difficult-to-treat CSU took levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine or levocetirizine monotherapy for periods of 5 days each. At the end of each treatment period, assessments were made of quality of life (Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire, CU-Q2oL), severity of urticaria symptoms (Urticaria Activity Score, UAS), sleep disturbance during the night, and daytime somnolence.

- **Results**: Both treatments significantly decreased UAS, night-time sleep disturbances, and CU-Q2oL scores (P < 0.001) without significant differences between the two. Compared with baseline, daytime somnolence was significantly reduced by levocetirizine monotherapy (P = 0.006) but not by levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine (P = 0.218). Direct comparison of the two treatment modalities in terms of daytime somnolence favored levocetirizine monotherapy (P = 0.026).

- **Conclusions**: The widespread belief that sleep is improved by a sedating antihistamine does not correlate with increased treatment efficacy and may lead to increased daytime somnolence, thus not supporting the combination treatment for enhancing sleep quality in CSU patients.

### H1-antihistamines reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or dual hepatitis B virus-hepatitis C virus infection [^113xXobX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Histamines are biologically active substances that potentiate the inflammatory and immune responses of the body and act as neurotransmitters. Antihistamines (AHs) are drugs that antagonize these effects by blocking or inhibiting receptors (H-receptors). They are categorized as either H1 or H2 AHs, depending on the type of H-receptor that they target. H1-AHs are mostly used to treat allergic reactions and mast cell–mediated disorders, and they are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide for the treatment of allergic symptoms (e.g. relief from hay fever). Recently, studies have used preclinical evidence to investigate the role of AHs as anticancer agents.

- **Multiple mechanisms**: Have been proposed for this potential effect, and they involve the use of antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and radiosensitizing properties; lysosomal cell death; and immunologic pathways. The effectiveness of anticancer therapy can be severely limited by specific tumor types or subtypes, and new and improved anticancer drugs are always required. The repurposing of existing medication is a time- and cost-effective means of addressing this challenge. AHs are safe drugs with minimal side effects that are well tolerated by most people; therefore, they are excellent candidates for repurposing as drugs for cancer therapy.

### Histamine H2-receptor antagonists for urticaria [^111XxWic]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common skin disease characterized by itching weals or hives, which can occur almost anywhere on the body. There are a number of different subtypes and a range of available treatment options. However, there is a lack of agreement on the efficacy of H2-receptor antagonists used in the treatment of urticaria.

- **Objectives**: To assess the safety and effectiveness of H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment of urticaria.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 7 October 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of H2-receptor antagonists in people with a clinical diagnosis of urticaria of any duration or subtype. Studies including H1-antihistamines for chronic urticaria are the subject of a separate Cochrane review and were not included in this review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted and analysed data.

- **Main results**: Four studies of relatively small size, involving 144 participants, were included in this review. A combination of ranitidine with diphenhydramine was more effective at improving the resolution of urticaria than diphenhydramine administered alone (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.36). Although there was a similar improvement in itching, weal size, and intensity, cimetidine provided no statistically significant benefit.

### H1-antihistamines for chronic spontaneous urticaria [^1129B8xH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the development of crops of red, itchy, raised weals or hives with no identifiable external cause. The objective of this review is to assess the effects of H1-antihistamines for CSU.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to June 2014: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and PsycINFO (from 1806). We also searched five trials registers and checked articles for references to relevant randomized controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of H1-antihistamines for CSU. Interventions included single therapy or a combination of H1-antihistamines compared with no treatment (placebo) or another active pharmacological compound at any dose.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants with complete suppression of urticaria, a 'good or excellent' response, 50% or greater improvement in quality of life measures, and adverse events. We present risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Main results**: We identified 73 studies (9,759 participants); 34 studies provided data for 23 comparisons. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short-term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate-term). Cetirizine 10mg once daily in both the short term and intermediate term led to complete suppression of urticaria by more participants than was observed with placebo (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.5).

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^111qyxGX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

This study demonstrates that patients receiving levocetirizine monotherapy experienced significantly less sedation during the day compared to their condition before the treatment started, aligning with the findings of Staevska et al. In contrast, patients treated with levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine experienced a similar level of sedation to those not treated. Moreover, those on levocetirizine monotherapy showed less daytime sedation than those receiving the combination with hydroxyzine. This strongly indicates that the sedative effects of hydroxyzine are due to its prolonged effects on the central nervous system. Given its terminal half-life of 20–25 hours, it is unsurprising that hydroxyzine has hangover effects into the next day.

We have identified two weaknesses in this study. First, we did not perform objective assessments of alertness or productivity. However, our study supports the conclusion of Murota et al. that pruritic diseases negatively impact daily activity and impair productivity. Improvement is seen in patients taking second-generation nonsedative H1-antihistamines, unlike those taking first-generation sedative options. These improvements are associated with alleviated itch and better quality of life. The second weakness is the study's 10-day duration, which is shorter than many similar urticaria studies. This was necessary as the study was conducted at a tertiary referral clinic with participants from across Bulgaria, ensuring sustainable follow-up was critical, especially considering compliance issues.

### Molecular mechanism of antihistamines recognition and regulation of the histamine H receptor [^117GAqo2]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

All four histamine receptors display constitutive activity; however, the ligands for each receptor subtype have distinct pharmacological profiles. Of these, all validated H1R blockers act as inverse agonists, in contrast to the existence of neutral antagonists for the other three histamine receptors. Examination of all reported H1R blockers shows that almost all of them contain a phenyl group at the hydrophobic core (Supplementary Fig. 10), and according to the structural information in this study, this phenyl group is inserted into the deep cavity and will block the activation switch of the toggle switch residue W428 6.48. As a result, all these H1R blockers most likely function as inverse agonists as well.

Comparison of the ligand pocket of H1R with those of the other three histamine receptors reveals clear differences in the main pocket, which should result in the specificity profile of various antihistamines. For example, residues 3.33, 5.46, and 6.52 make close contact with the three antihistamines used in this study; however, they exhibit sequence divergence in the other three histamine receptors (Supplementary Fig. 11). This difference may account for the exclusive selectivity for H1R of mepyramine, astemizole, and desloratadine.

Detailed comparison of ligand pockets, including those from aminergic receptors, further reveals that the secondary ligand pockets are even less conserved (Supplementary Fig. 12). Therefore, taking full advantage of the features of secondary pockets may lead to the development of new antihistamine drugs that are more selective and specific.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^114vj83Y]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

These guidelines also recommend against the use of older, sedating first-generation H1-antihistamines in patients with urticaria unless there is a special indication. This is because first-generation H1-antihistamines have pronounced unwanted effects, including anticholinergic effects and sedative actions on the central nervous system. At night, first-generation H1-antihistamines increase the latency to the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduce the duration of REM sleep. Furthermore, residual effects, or hangover, are still present the next morning. Such effects include impairment in divided attention, vigilance, working memory, and sensory–motor performance. For commonly used drugs, the incidence of subjectively reported somnolence has been documented to vary from 40% with chlorpheniramine or brompheniramine to 80% with hydroxyzine. Disturbingly, lack of subjective drowsiness does not mean that an individual is able to drive a vehicle without impairment because subjective somnolence and impairment of the ability to perform tasks are not necessarily correlated.

Despite the potential of first-generation H1-antihistamines to cause unwanted effects, many physicians believe that the most effective treatment for chronic urticaria is a nonsedating second-generation H1-antihistamine in the morning and a sedating first-generation H1-antihistamine, usually hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine, at night to reduce night-time itch and enhance sleep. The rationale for this is that the sedative component makes people sleep better in spite of the pruritus.

### The role of histamine H1 and H4 receptors in allergic inflammation: The search for new antihistamines [^114XqjKb]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2008). Low credibility.

Histamine plays a critical role in allergic inflammatory conditions. The inflammatory responses resulting from the release of histamine have traditionally been attributed to the histamine H1 receptor. Consequently, H1-receptor antagonists, commonly known as antihistamines, have been used to treat allergies for many years. However, the significance of histamine in the pathology of conditions such as asthma and chronic pruritus may have been underestimated.

Here, we review accumulating evidence suggesting that histamine indeed influences inflammation and immune function modulation in such diseases. Of particular interest is the discovery of a fourth histamine receptor (H4) and its expression on numerous immune and inflammatory cells. This has prompted a re-evaluation of histamine's actions, suggesting new potential for H4-receptor antagonists. Moreover, there may be a possible synergy between H1- and H4-receptor antagonists in targeting various inflammatory conditions.

### H1-antihistamines for primary mast cell activation syndromes: A systematic review [^111yM4W8]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Primary mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS) are a group of disorders presenting with symptoms of mast cell mediator release.

- **Objectives**: The objective of the review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of orally administered H1-antihistamines in the treatment of primary MCAS compared with placebo and other pharmacologic treatments.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted across five databases and three trial repositories. Additionally, an international panel of experts was contacted to identify both published and unpublished trials.

- **Results**: A total of 36 potentially relevant studies were identified, with five crossover trials meeting the eligibility criteria by enrolling a total of 71 patients (63 adults). All five studies were determined to be at a moderate or high risk of bias. Two of the studies compared an H1-antihistamine with a placebo, another two compared two different H1-antihistamines, while one study compared H1- and H2-antihistamines with oral cromolyn sodium. Four of the five trials were historical, reported from 1983 to 1993, small in scale (enrolling 8–15 patients), and utilized agents and dosing regimens less common in current clinical practice such as azelastine, chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine, and ketotifen. The fifth trial, enrolling 33 adults with cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis, found that four weeks of treatment with the second-generation H1-antihistamine rupatadine, as compared with a placebo, resulted in significant improvements in quality of life and symptom control. These symptoms included itching, wheals and flares, flushing, tachycardia, and headache, but not gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Hydroxyzine for generalised anxiety disorder [^1136REKF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone, and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication that has been used in the treatment of anxiety.

- **Objectives**:

	- To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD.
	- To review the acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent.
	- To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews, and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics and participant characteristics.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis, 2018 [^111dR1fZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of pruritus, specifically in terms of systemic therapy, the 2018 BAD guidelines recommend considering the use of sedative H1-antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, for short-term or palliative situations.

### Mast cell stabilizing properties of antihistamines [^111k332c]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Histamine is a key mediator of allergic inflammation, primarily through competitive antagonism of binding to H1 receptors. In this issue, Weller and Maurer report that the H1 antagonist desloratadine possesses mast cell-stabilizing properties when challenged in an IgE-dependent or -independent fashion. Thus, desloratadine provides benefits that are independent of H1 receptor binding and based on mast cell stabilization.

### H1-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without shock [^1139mG4G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an acute systemic allergic reaction, which can be life-threatening. H1-antihistamines are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of H1-antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1966 to June 2006), CINAHL (1982 to June 2006), and ISI Web of Science (1945 to July 2006). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing H1-antihistamines with placebo or no intervention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

- **Main results**: We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

- **Authors' conclusions**: Based on this review, we are unable to make any recommendations for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are needed, although these are likely to prove challenging to design and execute.

### New onset delusional infestation following abrupt cessation of hydroxyzine [^1152uMX5]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Delusional infestation (DI) is a psychocutaneous condition in which patients exhibit a fixed, false belief that they are infested with an insect or a parasite despite evidence indicating the contrary. In this article, we present a case of DI presenting after the abrupt discontinuation of long-term use of the H1 antihistamine hydroxyzine.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^1172KvvL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

There were highly significant reductions in night-time sleep disturbances (see Fig. 4a) with the median baseline VAS of 71 (21.75–78.5) reduced to 10 (0–25.25) (P = 0.001) by levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine and 17 (0–24.75) (P = 0.002) by levocetirizine monotherapy, with no significant difference between treatments (P = 0.868).

- **Daytime sedation**: Daytime sedation (refer to Fig. 4b) was significantly reduced (P = 0.007) by levocetirizine monotherapy from a median baseline VAS of 14 (11–28.5) to 0 (0–11). In contrast, the median sedation VAS following levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine of 5 (0–23.5) did not differ significantly from baseline (P = 0.218). Patients treated with levocetirizine monotherapy were significantly less sedated than those receiving levocetirizine plus hydroxyzine (P = 0.030).

Figure 4 illustrates the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for (a) night-time sleep disturbance and (b) daytime sedation at the study's baseline and after 5 days of treatment with levocetirizine 15 mg daily plus hydroxyzine 50 mg at night (Levo + Hydroxy), or levocetirizine daily 20 mg alone (Levo Monotherapy). Horizontal bars indicate median values. Significant differences between treatments were calculated by Wilcoxon's nonparametric test for paired data, and results marked as NS indicate not significant differences.

### Evidence-based use of antihistamines for treatment of allergic conditions [^115bsh7C]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Available since the 1940s, H1 antihistamines are mainstay treatments for allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria. They function as inverse agonists that bind to the H1 receptor to inhibit histamine-induced inflammation. The older, first-generation drugs are no longer recommended for patient use because of their well-documented negative adverse effect profile. Evidence has been accumulating to support a newer generation of H1 antihistamines in oral and intranasal formulations, including in combination with intranasal corticosteroids. The literature is replete with large meta-analyses and systematic reviews establishing the safety and efficacy of second-generation H1 antihistamines in adult and pediatric allergic rhinitis populations, including combination nasal spray agents (e.g. MP29–02 or MP-AzeFlu).

Although intraclass differences do exist, patient preference, access, and costs should be the priority. Robust data on the regular, not as needed use of H1 antihistamines for urticaria have been published, including in the management of children and pregnant or lactating women. In addition, H1 antihistamines can be used in other related allergic conditions, such as the secondary symptoms of anaphylaxis, to provide patients with greater comfort, including in allergic asthma, depending on the individual.

### Prudoxin [^111mRwYn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Although doxepin HCl does have H1 and H2 histamine receptor blocking actions, the exact mechanism by which doxepin exerts its antipruritic effect is unknown. Prudoxin® Cream can produce drowsiness, which may reduce awareness, including awareness of pruritic symptoms. In 19 pruritic eczema patients treated with Prudoxin® Cream, plasma doxepin concentrations ranged from non-detectable to 47 ng/mL from percutaneous absorption. Plasma levels from topical application of Prudoxin® Cream can result in CNS and other systemic side effects.

Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, doxepin undergoes hepatic metabolism that results in conversion to pharmacologically-active desmethyldoxepin. Further glucuronidation results in urinary excretion of the parent drug and its metabolites. Desmethyldoxepin has a half-life that ranges from 28 to 52 hours and is not affected by multiple dosing. Plasma levels of both doxepin and desmethyldoxepin are highly variable and are poorly correlated with dosage. Wide distribution occurs in body tissues, including lungs, heart, brain, and liver. Renal disease, genetic factors, age, and other medications affect the metabolism and subsequent elimination of doxepin.

### Management of urticaria: Not too complicated, not too simple [^114jg8SM]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of anti-H2 antihistamines, most guidelines have deleted this recommendation, except for the American guidelines.

- **Should treatment for CSU be provided on-demand or in a sustained manner**: The beneficial effects of nonsedating H1-antihistamines given on demand appear to be low. Key point: Nonsedating H1-antihistamines should be given in a sustained manner.

- **Does antihistamine-induced somnolence affect its use in CSU**: It is well known that H1-antihistamines cause sedation, somnolence, and fatigue, leading to impairment of cognitive function, memory, and psychomotor performance. A position paper by the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN) highlights the risk posed by the general perception that first-generation H1-antihistamines, all of which are sedating, are safe simply because of their long-standing use. Given the unwanted side effects and potential dangers of first-generation H1-antihistamines, newer, nonsedating second-generation H1-antihistamines with superior risk/benefit ratios, which are widely available at competitive prices, are strongly recommended.

Key point: Nonsedating antihistamines are recommended for CSU treatment.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: Best care practice guidelines [^113KRX3R]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapies include traditional oral antihistaminic medications. Some patients prefer sedating formulations at bedtime, such as diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and chlorpheniramine. Others opt for non-sedating preparations during the day, like cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. The efficacy of these treatments is variable and recommendations are based on anecdotal experience due to a lack of substantial evidence in epidermolysis bullosa (EB) and other dermatologic conditions.

Centrally acting medications, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, have shown efficacy in the burn literature and may also apply to EB. These medications have been used successfully for neuropathic pain. Antidepressants with nortriptyline re-uptake inhibitory actions have been utilized for various pruritic conditions, with mirtazapine showing promise.

Low-dose cyclosporine has been employed in a single case of dominant dystrophic EB to reduce generalized itching. Anecdotal success has been noted with ondansetron in EB, similar to reports for pruritus from cholestatic jaundice, although controlled trials did not confirm its efficacy. Similar suggestions have been made for the pruritus of uremia, leading to the recommendation that ondansetron should be considered, although clinical trials are necessary for EB.

Other medications that have shown sporadic clinical success in treating itch in EB include cyproheptadine and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.

### Histamine H1-receptor antagonists inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 activities via H1-receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms [^11174nt5]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Histamine H1-receptor antagonists are used to relieve the symptoms of immediate allergic reactions. They have additional anti-inflammatory effects that could result from an inhibition of the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). The implication of the H1-receptor in these effects is controversial. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1-receptor antagonist, while mizolastine and desloratadine are second-generation compounds. Mizolastine is also an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), an enzyme involved in NF-kappaB activation.

- **Objective**: We measured the ability of antihistamines to reverse histamine-induced smooth muscle contraction, an effect involving the H1-receptor. We then investigated whether these drugs affect NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities in A549 lung epithelial cells, and whether this potential regulation involves the H1-receptor and 5-LO.

- **Methods**: Muscle tone was measured on tracheal segments of guinea pigs. The H1-receptor was overexpressed by transfection and detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities were assessed by reporter gene assays in cells overexpressing or not overexpressing the H1-receptor. Production of regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), a chemokine whose expression is induced through NF-kappaB, was measured using an immunoassay.

- **Results**: H1-receptor antagonists reversed histamine-induced contraction in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of AP-1 and NF-kappaB activities by histamine was observed.

### Diphenhydramine as an analgesic adjuvant in refractory cancer pain [^113gjhzC]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Clinical and animal data suggest that antihistamines may have efficacy in the management of pain. While many mechanisms of action have been proposed for the analgesic action of antihistamines, the exact mechanism is unknown. Controlled clinical trials in different pain models have demonstrated that antihistamines have direct and adjuvant analgesic activity. We report three patients with advanced cancer pain refractory to adjuvants and oral, intravenous, and epidural opioids who achieved sustained pain relief after the repeated administration of diphenhydramine. Diphenhydramine may be useful in the treatment of neuropathic and nociceptive pain that has failed to respond to treatment with opioids and adjuvant analgesics. We suggest a starting dose of 25 mg of oral or parenteral diphenhydramine every 6 to 8 hours, with titration to effect.

### Antihistamines and driving ability: Evidence from on-the-road driving studies during normal traffic [^113NVCME]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

All antihistamines are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and thus may cause sedation. Most antihistamine users are ambulatory patients and therefore presumably drive a car.

- **Objective**: To summarize the effects of antihistamine drugs on driving ability.

- **Data sources and study selection**: A literature search (MEDLINE and cross-references) was performed using the keywords "driving" and "antihistamine". Sixteen studies using the on-the-road driving test during normal traffic were included in the review. Studies were double-blind and placebo-controlled, and included a positive control.

- **Results**: First-generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine, triprolidine, terfenadine, dexchlorpheniramine, clemastine) significantly impair driving performance after both one-time and repeated (daily) administration. Second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, ebastine, mizolastine, acrivastine, emedastine, mequitazine) may also impair driving performance, but the magnitude and extent of impairment depend on the administered dose, sex, and time between testing and treatment administration. Tolerance develops after 4 to 5 days of administration, but impairment is not absent. Third-generation antihistamines (fexofenadine and levocetirizine) have been shown to produce no driving impairment after both one-time and repeated administration.

- **Conclusions**: First- and second-generation antihistamines may significantly impair driving performance. In the context of driving safety, it is important to also consider the cardiotoxic properties of some of the second-generation antihistamines.
