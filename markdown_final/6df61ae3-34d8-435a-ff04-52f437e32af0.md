## Question

What is reactive gliosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what reactive gliosis is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and which cell types are involved. Then, I should verify the morphological and molecular hallmarks, especially GFAP and the concept of a graded continuum. Next, I will examine functional consequences, both beneficial and detrimental, and how they vary by context. After that, I need to check the triggers and disease contexts where reactive gliosis occurs. Finally, I will consider diagnostic markers, imaging correlates, and therapeutic implications, making sure I distinguish outdated binary models from current heterogeneous frameworks.

> Let me first confirm the core definition. Reactive gliosis is the universal, context-dependent response of glial cells — primarily astrocytes, but also microglia and oligodendrocyte lineage cells — to CNS injury, disease, or infection, characterized by morphological, molecular, and functional remodeling rather than a uniform, all-or-nothing process [^c1ade707] [^f95d9ff6] [^fda6bbed].

> Wait, let me verify the morphological and molecular hallmarks. The most consistent marker is upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with astrocytic hypertrophy, though GFAP is not universally expressed in resting astrocytes and should be interpreted in context. Additional markers include vimentin, nestin, and S100β, with emerging tools like multidimensional MRI and diffusion metrics helping detect scar-border astrogliosis in vivo [^f7696edd] [^3a8e86b1] [^e3372531].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniformity. I need to emphasize the graded continuum. Reactive gliosis spans mild to moderate changes with preserved domains and potential resolution, to severe diffuse astrogliosis with domain overlap and proliferation, to compact glial scar formation at lesion borders. This gradation is regulated by context-specific signaling and is not a binary good-versus-bad state [^382e2646] [^d786bd38] [^8acd695b].

> I will now examine functional consequences, but I should double-check the balance of benefit and harm. Beneficial roles include forming protective barriers that confine inflammation and infection, repairing the blood–brain barrier, clearing debris, and supporting tissue repair. Detrimental effects include synaptic dysfunction, impaired axonal regeneration due to scar formation, chronic neuroinflammation, and loss of homeostatic support, with the net effect determined by timing, location, and disease context [^4984deca] [^ba254862] [^5f337522].

> Let me consider triggers and disease contexts systematically. Reactive gliosis occurs after acute injuries such as trauma, stroke, and hemorrhage; in chronic neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and multiple sclerosis; in autoimmune and infectious CNS diseases; in metabolic and systemic conditions like obesity and diabetes; and in tumors, where tumor-associated astrocytes can shape the immune milieu [^ce972b82] [^e725185f] [^551e4691] [^2f33a777] [^2307e0e4].

> Next, I should review diagnostic and imaging correlates. GFAP immunohistochemistry remains a cornerstone, but I need to ensure I note its limitations and the value of complementary markers. Diffusion MRI metrics, particularly ADC, can help distinguish gliosis from vasogenic edema, and multidimensional MRI frameworks can map scar-border astrogliosis at the individual level, while fluid biomarkers like plasma GFAP and YKL-40 track astrocyte reactivity across disease stages [^f7696edd] [^e3372531] [^3a8e86b1] [^8aa58443].

> But wait, what if I'm overgeneralizing from outdated models? I should confirm the shift away from binary A1/A2 classifications. Current frameworks reject simple neurotoxic-versus-neuroprotective bins and emphasize heterogeneous, state-specific substates defined by multidimensional molecular and functional profiles; therapeutic strategies now focus on selectively suppressing pathological reactive states while preserving or enhancing beneficial ones, with HDAC3 inhibition and complement pathway modulation as concrete examples [^c1ade707] [^7cc8c2b5] [^9d0bbb70].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications to ensure coherence. Reactive gliosis is both a marker of CNS pathology and a driver of disease progression in many contexts, making it a promising therapeutic target. Interventions that modulate astrocyte reactivity — timing-sensitive JAK/STAT or complement blockade, HDAC3 inhibition, or strategies that redirect astrocyte progenitors — are being explored to mitigate scar formation, restore homeostasis, and improve functional outcomes after injury or in neurodegeneration [^f95d9ff6] [^7cc8c2b5] [^9d0bbb70].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. Reactive gliosis is a highly plastic, context-dependent glial response with graded morphological and molecular changes, dominated by astrocytes but involving multiple glial lineages. It exerts both protective and harmful effects that vary by insult, time, and location, and modern research aims to decode its heterogeneity to selectively enhance repair while suppressing toxicity [^c1ade707] [^f95d9ff6] [^fda6bbed].

Reactive gliosis is the **multifaceted response of glial cells** (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes) to CNS injury or disease, characterized by **morphological hypertrophy**, **proliferation**, and **upregulation of markers** such as GFAP and vimentin [^c1ade707] [^f7696edd]. It is a **graded, context-dependent process** [^382e2646] that can be beneficial (barrier formation, debris clearance, neuroprotection) [^4984deca] or detrimental (chronic inflammation, synaptic dysfunction, impaired regeneration) [^4d5b519e], depending on the trigger, severity, and timing [^f95d9ff6]. Reactive gliosis is a hallmark of many CNS pathologies, including trauma, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and infections, and is a key therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation and promoting repair [^a0a3044a] [^7cc8c2b5].

## Cellular components and morphological changes

Reactive gliosis involves **multiple glial cell types**, each with distinct morphological and functional changes:

| **Cell type** | **Morphological changes** | **Functional changes** |
|-|-|-|
| Astrocytes | - Hypertrophy <br/> - Process extension <br/> - Proliferation (in severe cases) <br/> - Upregulation of GFAP, vimentin, nestin [^f7696edd] | - Barrier formation <br/> - Debris clearance <br/> - Neurotransmitter uptake <br/> - Cytokine release <br/> - Synaptic modulation [^4984deca] [^4d5b519e] |
| Microglia | - Enlarged cell body <br/> - Shortened processes <br/> - Proliferation <br/> - Formation of rod-shaped cells [^notfound] | - Phagocytosis <br/> - Cytokine release <br/> - Antigen presentation <br/> - Neurotoxic or neuroprotective roles [^notfound] |
| Oligodendrocytes | - Swelling <br/> - Process retraction <br/> - Demyelination or remyelination attempts [^notfound] | - Myelin repair <br/> - Axonal support <br/> - Cytokine release [^notfound] |

---

## Molecular markers and signaling pathways

Reactive gliosis is characterized by **upregulation of specific molecular markers and activation of signaling pathways**:

- **GFAP**: A hallmark of astrocyte reactivity, used clinically and experimentally to identify reactive astrocytes [^f7696edd].
- **Vimentin and nestin**: Intermediate filaments upregulated in reactive astrocytes, indicating a return to a more immature, proliferative state [^notfound].
- **Cytokines and chemokines**: IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, and others are released by reactive glia, mediating inflammation and cell-cell communication [^notfound].
- **Signaling pathways**: JAK/STAT, NF-κB, MAPK, and complement cascades are key regulators of reactive gliosis [^b22d4626] [^9d0bbb70].

---

## Functional consequences

Reactive gliosis has **dual roles**, with both beneficial and detrimental effects:

### Beneficial effects

Beneficial effects include **barrier formation**, wherein astrocytes form a glial scar that contains injury, prevents spread of inflammation, and protects healthy tissue [^4984deca]; **debris clearance**, with microglia phagocytosing cellular debris and toxic aggregates; and **neuroprotection**, as reactive astrocytes release neurotrophic factors and antioxidants that support neuronal survival [^notfound].

---

### Detrimental effects

Detrimental effects include **chronic inflammation**, with sustained glial activation perpetuating neuroinflammation and neuronal injury [^f95d9ff6]; **synaptic dysfunction**, where reactive astrocytes disrupt synaptic transmission and plasticity, contributing to cognitive and motor deficits [^4d5b519e]; and **impaired regeneration**, as glial scars and inhibitory extracellular matrix molecules (e.g. chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) hinder axonal regrowth and functional recovery [^ba254862].

---

## Regulation and modulation

Reactive gliosis is **tightly regulated** by intrinsic and extrinsic factors:

- **Intrinsic factors**: Genetic programs, epigenetic modifications, and cell-autonomous signaling pathways shape the reactive phenotype [^7cc8c2b5].
- **Extrinsic factors**: Cytokines, growth factors, and signals from neurons, microglia, and the extracellular matrix influence glial reactivity [^572df792].
- **Therapeutic modulation**: Strategies targeting specific pathways (e.g. JAK/STAT, complement) or using small molecules (e.g. HDAC3 inhibitors) are being explored to promote beneficial glial states and suppress harmful ones [^7cc8c2b5] [^9d0bbb70].

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic targeting

Reactive gliosis is a **key player in numerous CNS diseases**, including:

- **Neurodegenerative diseases**: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's disease feature prominent reactive gliosis that contributes to disease progression [^551e4691].
- **Acute injuries**: Stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury exhibit robust reactive gliosis that influences recovery and regeneration [^ce972b82].
- **Inflammatory diseases**: Multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune demyelinating diseases involve reactive glia in demyelination and remyelination processes [^e725185f].

Therapeutically, **modulating reactive gliosis** offers promising avenues:

- **Promoting beneficial glial states**: Enhancing neuroprotective, reparative glial functions to support recovery [^c5dbe024].
- **Suppressing harmful glial states**: Inhibiting chronic inflammation, synaptic toxicity, and scar formation to improve functional outcomes [^7cc8c2b5].
- **Biomarker development**: GFAP and other glial markers are being explored as biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response [^8aa58443].

---

Reactive gliosis is a **complex, context-dependent glial response** with both beneficial and detrimental effects. Understanding its mechanisms and regulation is essential for developing targeted therapies that harness its protective functions while mitigating its harmful effects.

### Reactive astrocytes as therapeutic targets for CNS disorders [^a0a3044a]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Reactive astrogliosis has long been recognized as a ubiquitous feature of CNS pathologies. Although its roles in CNS pathology are only beginning to be defined, genetic tools are enabling molecular dissection of the functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in vivo. It is now clear that reactive astrogliosis is not simply an all-or-nothing phenomenon but, rather, is a finely gradated continuum of molecular, cellular, and functional changes that range from subtle alterations in gene expression to scar formation. These changes can exert both beneficial and detrimental effects in a context-dependent manner determined by specific molecular signaling cascades. Dysfunction of either astrocytes or the process of reactive astrogliosis is emerging as an important potential source of mechanisms that might contribute to, or play primary roles in, a host of CNS disorders via loss of normal or gain of abnormal astrocyte activities. A rapidly growing understanding of the mechanisms underlying astrocyte signaling and reactive astrogliosis has the potential to open doors to identifying many molecules that might serve as novel therapeutic targets for a wide range of neurological disorders. This review considers general principles and examines selected examples regarding the potential of targeting specific molecular aspects of reactive astrogliosis for therapeutic manipulations, including regulation of glutamate, reactive oxygen species, and cytokines.

### Reactive gliosis and the multicellular response to CNS damage and disease [^fda6bbed]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

The CNS is prone to heterogeneous insults of diverse etiologies that elicit multifaceted responses. Acute and focal injuries trigger wound repair with tissue replacement. Diffuse and chronic diseases provoke gradually escalating tissue changes. The responses to CNS insults involve complex interactions among cells of numerous lineages and functions, including CNS intrinsic neural cells, CNS intrinsic nonneural cells, and CNS extrinsic cells that enter from the circulation. The contributions of diverse nonneuronal cell types to outcome after acute injury, or to the progression of chronic disease, are of increasing interest as the push toward understanding and ameliorating CNS afflictions accelerates. In some cases, considerable information is available, in others, comparatively little, as examined and reviewed here.

### Reactive astrocyte nomenclature, definitions, and future directions [^c1ade707]. Nature Neuroscience (2021). High credibility.

Reactive astrocytes are astrocytes undergoing morphological, molecular, and functional remodeling in response to injury, disease, or infection of the CNS. Although this remodeling was first described over a century ago, uncertainties and controversies remain regarding the contribution of reactive astrocytes to CNS diseases, repair, and aging. It is also unclear whether fixed categories of reactive astrocytes exist and, if so, how to identify them. We point out the shortcomings of binary divisions of reactive astrocytes into good-vs-bad, neurotoxic-vs-neuroprotective or A1-vs-A2. We advocate, instead, that research on reactive astrocytes include assessment of multiple molecular and functional parameters-preferably in vivo-plus multivariate statistics and determination of impact on pathological hallmarks in relevant models. These guidelines may spur the discovery of astrocyte-based biomarkers as well as astrocyte-targeting therapies that abrogate detrimental actions of reactive astrocytes, potentiate their neuro- and glioprotective actions, and restore or augment their homeostatic, modulatory, and defensive functions.

Reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation

Descriptive features of reactive astrogliosis and glial scars

Although reactive astrogliosis is used widely as a pathological hallmark of diseased CNS tissue, definitions of reactive astrogliosis can vary considerably among authors and there are no widely accepted categories of intensity or severity. Based on a large body of observations in experimental animals, a definition of reactive astrogliosis has recently been proposed that encompasses four key features: (1) reactive astrogliosis is a spectrum of potential molecular, cellular and functional changes in astrocytes that occur in response to all forms and severities of CNS injury and disease including subtle perturbations, (2) the changes undergone by reactive astrocytes vary with severity of the insult along a gradated continuum of progressive alterations in molecular expression, progressive cellular hypertrophy, and in severe cases, proliferation and scar formation, (3) the changes of reactive astrogliosis are regulated in a context-specific manner by inter- and intra-cellular signaling molecules, (4) the changes undergone during reactive astrogliosis have the potential to alter astrocyte activities both through gain and loss of functions that can impact both beneficially and detrimentally on surrounding neural and non-neural cells. Here, we propose to apply and extend this definition to identifying different gradations of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation that may be encountered in histopathological examinations of human disorders (Figs. 3, 4). According to this definition, reactive astrogliosis is not an all-or-none response, nor is it a single uniform process, nor is it ubiquitously synonymous with scar formation. Instead, reactive astrogliosis is a finely gradated continuum of progressive changes in gene expression and cellular changes. Although the increasing severities of reactive astrogliosis transition seamlessly along a continuum, it is convenient for purposes of description and classification to recognize three broad categories.

### Astrocytes: biology and pathology [^f1f9dcf4]. Acta Neuropathologica (2010). Low credibility.

Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that outnumber neurons by over fivefold. They contiguously tile the entire central nervous system (CNS) and exert many essential complex functions in the healthy CNS. Astrocytes respond to all forms of CNS insults through a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis, which has become a pathological hallmark of CNS structural lesions. Substantial progress has been made recently in determining functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and in identifying roles of astrocytes in CNS disorders and pathologies. A vast molecular arsenal at the disposal of reactive astrocytes is being defined. Transgenic mouse models are dissecting specific aspects of reactive astrocytosis and glial scar formation in vivo. Astrocyte involvement in specific clinicopathological entities is being defined. It is now clear that reactive astrogliosis is not a simple all-or-none phenomenon but is a finely gradated continuum of changes that occur in context-dependent manners regulated by specific signaling events. These changes range from reversible alterations in gene expression and cell hypertrophy with preservation of cellular domains and tissue structure, to long-lasting scar formation with rearrangement of tissue structure. Increasing evidence points towards the potential of reactive astrogliosis to play either primary or contributing roles in CNS disorders via loss of normal astrocyte functions or gain of abnormal effects. This article reviews (1) astrocyte functions in healthy CNS, (2) mechanisms and functions of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation, and (3) ways in which reactive astrocytes may cause or contribute to specific CNS disorders and lesions.

### The stem cell potential of glia: lessons from reactive gliosis [^7eb7f97d]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Astrocyte-like cells, which act as stem cells in the adult brain, reside in a few restricted stem cell niches. However, following brain injury, glia outside these niches acquire or reactivate stem cell potential as part of reactive gliosis. Recent studies have begun to uncover the molecular pathways involved in this process. A comparison of molecular pathways activated after injury with those involved in the normal neural stem cell niches highlights strategies that could overcome the inhibition of neurogenesis outside the stem cell niche and instruct parenchymal glia towards a neurogenic fate. This new view on reactive glia therefore suggests a widespread endogenous source of cells with stem cell potential, which might potentially be harnessed for local repair strategies.

Reactive astrogliosis, glial scar formation and CNS inflammation

Of particular interest as regards functions of reactive astrocytes, is recent evidence that reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation play essential roles in regulating CNS inflammation. In response to different kinds of stimulation, reactive astrocytes can make many different kinds of molecules with either pro- or anti-inflammatory potential and reactive astrocytes can exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects on microglia. A large body of experimental studies indicates that reactive astrocytes can exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory regulatory functions in vivo in a context dependent manner that is regulated by specific molecular signaling pathways. A functional model, which may reconcile the apparent paradox that reactive astrocytes have the potential to exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, is that reactive astrocytes exert different activities at different times after insults, or in different geographical locations in relation to lesions, as determined by context-specific signaling mechanisms. For example, reactive astrocytes may exert pro-inflammatory roles at early times after insults and in the center or immediate vicinity of lesions, but exert anti-inflammatory roles at later times and at the borders between lesions and healthy tissue. In cases of severe lesions, reactive astrocytes may form scars that act as cell migration barriers around the borders of areas where intense inflammation is needed and thereby restrict the spread of inflammatory cells and infectious agents into adjacent healthy tissue (Fig. 4 d). Together, these findings indicate that there is a normal process of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation that exerts various beneficial functions including protecting neural cells and function, restricting the spread of inflammation and infection, and promoting tissue repair. It is important to distinguish this normal process from the potential for dysfunction of reactive astrocytes to contribute to CNS disorders.

Mechanisms for contributions of reactive astrogliosis to CNS disorders and pathologies

Astrocytes and reactive astrocytes have the potential to impact on essentially all aspects of neural function through regulation of blood flow, provision of energy substrates, or by influencing synaptic function and plasticity. Increasing evidence indicates that dysfunctions of the process of reactive astrogliosis and scar formation have the potential to contribute to, or to be primary causes of, CNS disease mechanisms either through loss of normal functions or through gain of detrimental effects.

Introduction

Until quite recently, the prevailing view regarding the biology and pathology of astrocytes among those studying clinical disorders and structural lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) was most likely to be that (1) astrocytes are supportive glial cell components in neural tissue and (2) reactive astrogliosis is a reliable and sensitive marker of diseased tissue. The notion that dysfunctions of astrocytes or reactive astrocytes might contribute to the presentation of clinical signs or to mechanisms leading to pathological changes in CNS tissue was generally not considered. However, this viewpoint is gradually changing as a result of steadily increasing interest in and study of the biology and pathology of astrocytes. Over the past 25 years it has become clear that astrocytes are responsible for a wide variety of complex and essential functions in the healthy CNS, including primary roles in synaptic transmission and information processing by neural circuit functions. The functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation are gradually being elucidated. There is a growing body of evidence that points towards the potential for loss of normal astrocyte functions or gain of abnormal effects to contribute to, or play primary roles in, disease processes, and there are now numerous examples of astrocyte contributions to clinical and pathological mechanisms. This article summarizes recent advances in (1) astrocyte functions in healthy tissue, (2) the gradations, mechanisms, functions, and effects of reactive astrogliosis, and (3) the appearance and potential roles of reactive astrocytes in a variety of CNS disorders and pathologies.

### Do glia drive synaptic and cognitive impairment in disease? [^4d5b519e]. Nature Neuroscience (2015). Medium credibility.

Synaptic dysfunction is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative and psychiatric brain disorders, yet we know little about the mechanisms that underlie synaptic vulnerability. Although neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis are prominent in virtually every CNS disease, glia are largely viewed as passive responders to neuronal damage rather than drivers of synaptic dysfunction. This perspective is changing with the growing realization that glia actively signal with neurons and influence synaptic development, transmission and plasticity through an array of secreted and contact-dependent signals. We propose that disruptions in neuron-glia signaling contribute to synaptic and cognitive impairment in disease. Illuminating the mechanisms by which glia influence synapse function may lead to the development of new therapies and biomarkers for synaptic dysfunction.

Fig. 4
Schematic representations that summarize different gradations of reactive astrogliosis. a Astrocytes in healthy CNS tissue. b Mild to moderate reactive astrogliosis comprises variable changes in molecular expression and functional activity together with variable degrees of cellular hypertrophy. Such changes occur after mild trauma or at sites distant from a more severe injury, or after moderate metabolic or molecular insults or milder infections or inflammatory activation. These changes vary with insult severity, involve little anatomical overlap of the processes of neighboring astrocytes and exhibit the potential for structural resolution if the triggering insult is removed or resolves. c Severe diffuse reactive astrogliosis includes changes in molecular expression, functional activity and cellular hypertrophy, as well newly proliferated astrocytes (with red nuclei in figure), disrupting astrocyte domains and causing long-lasting reorganization of tissue architecture. Such changes are found in areas surrounding severe focal lesions, infections or areas responding to chronic neurodegenerative triggers. d Severe reactive astrogliosis with compact glial scar formation occurs along borders to areas of overt tissue damage and inflammation, and includes newly proliferated astrocytes (with red nuclei in figure) and other cell types (gray in figure) such as fibromeningeal cells and other glia, as well as deposition of dense collagenous extracellular matrix. In the compact glial scar, astrocytes have densely overlapping processes. Mature glial scars tend to persist for long periods and act as barriers not only to axon regeneration but also to inflammatory cells, infectious agents, and non-CNS cells in a manner that protects healthy tissue from nearby areas of intense inflammation

### Astrocyte reactivity: subtypes, States, and functions in CNS innate immunity [^9d0f8eec]. Trends in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes are neural parenchymal cells that ubiquitously tile the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to playing essential roles in healthy tissue, astrocytes exhibit an evolutionarily ancient response to all CNS insults, referred to as astrocyte reactivity. Long regarded as passive and homogeneous, astrocyte reactivity is being revealed as a heterogeneous and functionally powerful component of mammalian CNS innate immunity. Nevertheless, concepts about what astrocyte reactivity comprises and what it does are incomplete and sometimes controversial. This review discusses the goal of differentiating reactive astrocyte subtypes and states based on composite pictures of molecular expression, cell morphology, cellular interactions, proliferative state, normal functions, and disease-induced dysfunctions. A working model and conceptual framework is presented for characterizing the diversity of astrocyte reactivity.

### Reactive astrocytes acquire neuroprotective as well as deleterious signatures in response to tau and A ß pathology [^6ad5ed2e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Reactive astrocytes can suppress or exacerbate neuropathology, although what determines this is not well understood. Over the years it has become clear that classical markers such as Gfap immunoreactivity are helpful at defining the extent of astrocytic reactivity, but not at describing the diverse array of responses and phenotypic changes that have occurred, depending on the nature of the insult, the disease time-course or the response of other brain cell types in the immediate environment. Here, the profiling of astrocyte responses to both Tau and Aß pathology revealed that their 'reactive' status contains signatures associated with cellular dysfunction and inflammation, and also adaptive-protective responses, the latter of which, if harnessed, can slow both types of pathology central to AD.

Severe reactive astrogliosis with compact glial scar formation

Severe reactive astrogliosis with compact glial scar formation includes changes associated with milder forms, such as pronounced up regulation of GFAP and other genes, and pronounced hypertrophy of cell bodies and processes. In addition, glial scar formation progresses beyond these changes with groups of reactive astrocytes that exhibit pronounced overlapping of reactive astrocyte processes, obliteration of individual astrocyte domains, evidence of substantive astrocyte proliferation, and the clear formation of dense, narrow, and compact glial scars (Fig. 4 d). Recent experimental evidence indicates that these astrocyte scars act as neuroprotective barriers to inflammatory cells and infectious agents, and that they form in particular along borders to severe tissue damage, necrosis, infection or autoimmune-triggered inflammatory infiltration (Fig. 4 d). An important feature of these glial scars is the interaction of reactive astrocytes with other cell types, in particular fibromeningeal and other glial cells (Fig. 4 d), and the deposition of a dense collagenous extracellular matrix that contains many molecular cues that inhibit axonal and cellular migration. Triggering insults include penetrating trauma, severe contusive trauma, invasive infections or abscess formation, neoplasm, chronic neurodegeneration, systemically triggered inflammatory challenges. It is noteworthy that the glial scar formation is associated with substantive tissue reorganization and structural changes that are long lasting and persist long after the triggering insult may have resolved.

The findings summarized here show that there are pronounced differences along the continuum of potential responses of reactive astrocyte to insults of different kinds and severities. These differences are likely to be of consequence when considering the functions and impact of reactive astrogliosis on CNS disorders and pathologies, as discussed below.

Mild to moderate reactive astrogliosis

In mild or moderate reactive astrogliosis there is variable up regulation of expression of GFAP and other genes, as well as hypertrophy of cell body and processes that can vary in degree but that occurs within the domains of individual astrocytes without substantive intermingling or overlap of processes of neighboring astrocytes or loss of individual domains (Figs. 3 b, 4 b). There is little or no astrocyte proliferation in mild or moderate reactive astrogliosis; however, the up regulation of GFAP expression in astrocytes that do not express detectable levels of GFAP in healthy tissue (Figs. 3 a, 4 a) can lead to the staining of more cells (Figs. 3 b, 4 b), sometimes giving the false impression of proliferation. Mild or moderate reactive astrogliosis is generally associated with mild non-penetrating and non-contusive trauma, diffuse innate immune activation (viral infections, system bacterial infections), and in areas that are some distance to focal CNS lesions. Because there is little or no reorganization of tissue architecture, if the triggering mechanism is able to resolve, then mild or moderate reactive astrogliosis exhibits the potential for resolution in which the astrocytes return to an appearance similar to that in healthy tissue. The physiological consequences of mild or moderate reactive astrogliosis are not well understood.

Severe diffuse reactive astrogliosis

In severe diffuse reactive astrogliosis there is pronounced up regulation of expression of GFAP and other genes, together with pronounced hypertrophy of cell body and processes, as well as astrocyte proliferation, resulting in considerable extension of processes beyond the previous domains of individual astrocytes. As a result, there is substantive intermingling and overlapping of neighboring astrocyte processes with blurring and disruption of individual astrocyte domains (Figs. 3 c, 4 c). These changes can result in long-lasting reorganization of tissue architecture that can extend diffusely over substantive areas without the formation of dense, compact barriers as found in glial scars along borders to necrotic tissue (see below). Severe diffuse reactive astrogliosis is generally found in areas surrounding severe focal lesions, infections or areas responding to chronic neurodegenerative triggers.

Molecular dissection of reactive astrogliosis using transgenic technologies

Many experimental investigations of mechanisms and functions of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation make use of transgenic technologies combined with experimental animal models, which has revolutionized the study of neural injury and disease by allowing in vivo dissection of molecular and cellular mechanisms. Nevertheless, in interpreting results derived from studies using transgenic mice it is important to understand associated caveats. For example, different promoters (human or mouse GFAP, GLAST, etc.) may have different targeting properties/efficiencies as regards astrocytes and related cells. Although not all astrocytes express GFAP or GFAP-regulated transgenes in healthy tissue, most if not all appear to do so after CNS injury or other insults. It is essential that authors define transgene expression levels individually and specifically in every tissue region and experimental model being studied, as well as control for any possible confounding effects that may result from transgene expression in other cells both within and outside of the CNS.

### Astrogliosis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: role and therapeutic potential of astrocytes [^50247223]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. Although the molecular mechanism underlying motor neuron degeneration remains unknown; non-neuronal cells (including astrocytes) shape motor neuron survival in ALS. Astrocytes closely interact with neurons to provide an optimized environment for neuronal function and respond to all forms of injury in a typical manner known as reactive astrogliosis. A strong reactive astrogliosis surrounds degenerating motor neurons in ALS patients and ALS-animal models. Although reactive astrogliosis in ALS is probably both primary and secondary to motor neuron degeneration; astrocytes are not passive observers and they can influence motor neuron fate. Due to the important functions that astrocytes perform in the central nervous system; it is of key importance to understand how these functions are altered when astrocytes become reactive in ALS. Here; we review the current evidences supporting a potential toxic role of astrocytes and their viability as therapeutic targets to alter motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

Potential for loss of essential functions by reactive astrocytes

As discussed earlier, in healthy neural tissue, astrocytes play critical roles in many functions, including regulation of blood flow, homeostasis of extracellular fluid, ions and transmitters, energy provision, and regulation of synapse function, and synaptic remodeling (Fig. 2 a). In addition, different types of transgenic deletion studies show that reactive astrocytes exert a number of essential beneficial functions in response to CNS insults, including BBB repair, neural protection and restricting the spread of inflammatory cells, and infection. The disturbance or loss of these functions during the process of reactive astrogliosis has the potential to underlie neural dysfunction and pathology in various conditions including trauma, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and others. Genetic animal models are providing evidence for ways in which loss or attenuation of reactive astrocyte functions might worsen outcome after various kinds of CNS insults, for example, through excitotoxic neurodegeneration due to failure or attenuation of glutamate uptake or increased inflammation or infection due to loss or failure of astrocyte barrier functions. Clinical studies, discussed below, are also identifying a rapidly growing number of conditions that are precipitated by or exacerbated loss of functions by astrocytes or reactive astrocytes.

### The neuroprotective role of reactive astrocytes after central nervous system injury [^5f337522]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Reactive astrocytes have traditionally been viewed as a significant contributor to secondary neuronal damage and repair inhibition after central nervous system (CNS) injury attributed, in large part, to their roles in glial scarring. However, more recent transcriptional evidence has uncovered the vast diversity in reactive astrocyte identity and functions that comprises both neuroprotective and -toxic characteristics. Additionally, the capacity of reactive astrocytes to shift between these activation states demonstrates a high level of environment-dependent plasticity that drives the interplay between neuroprotection and -toxicity after CNS injury. These recent findings have spawned a new field of research that seeks to identify and categorize the function of these discrete subpopulations in the context of neurotrauma, as well as identify their regulators. Therefore, this review will discuss the major and most recent advances in this field of research, with a primary emphasis on neuroprotection. This review will also discuss the major pitfalls present in the field, with a particular focus on model species and their impact on the development of novel therapies.

### Reactive astrocytes: production, function, and therapeutic potential [^af99c4e1]. Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Astrocytes constitute approximately 30% of the cells in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). They are integral to brain and spinal-cord physiology and perform many functions important for normal neuronal development, synapse formation, and proper propagation of action potentials. We still know very little, however, about how these functions change in response to immune attack, chronic neurodegenerative disease, or acute trauma. In this review, we summarize recent studies that demonstrate that different initiating CNS injuries can elicit at least two types of "reactive" astrocytes with strikingly different properties, one type being helpful and the other harmful. We will also discuss new methods for purifying and investigating reactive-astrocyte functions and provide an overview of new markers for delineating these different states of reactive astrocytes. The discovery that astrocytes have different types of reactive states has important implications for the development of new therapies for CNS injury and diseases.

### Neuroglia in cognitive reserve [^37adbe54]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroglia and the brain compensation

Neuroglia represent the principal defensive system of the CNS. Neuroglial cells actively respond to pathology by mounting reactive gliosis, an evolutionary conserved program of glial defence. Reactive gliosis is complex, context-, and disease-specific. Brain trauma (mechanical, infectious, ischaemic or autoimmune) triggers proliferative anysomorphic gliosis, characterised by the proliferation and accumulation of astrocytes, microglia, and OPCs close to the lesion to form the protective glial barrier. In addition, glial cells undergo substantial biochemical and morphological remodelling (some microglia turn into phagocyting macrophage-like cells clearing the debris inside the lesion core; astrocytes lose their complex arborisations and become barrier-reactive astrocytes). Glial barriers effectively protect surrounding nervous tissue, assist wound closure, and are indispensable for postlesional regeneration. Regeneration of the brain is also supported by neurogenesis which is provided by radial stem astrocytes. In chronic pathologies, including AD, astrocytes undergo isomorphic, non-proliferative gliosis; in AD reactive astrocytes together with reactive microglia surround senile plaques thus limiting neuronal damage. This protective effect is diminishing with age and AD progression; glial paralysis at the advanced stages of the disease facilities neuronal death that translates into clinical dementia. Finally, OPCs in various forms of pathologies act as a source for regenerative remyelination. All in all, neuroglial cells are central for brain compensation.

Neuroglia, ageing and age-associated cognitive decline

Ageing is associated with cognitive decline and ageing is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders. Physiological ageing is characterised by relative preservation of neuronal numbers, and a significant loss of white matter associated with a decrease in number of oligodendrocytes and proliferative arrest of OPCs. Both astrocytes and microglia demonstrate significant atrophy in the aged brain, which translates into decreased homeostatic support and defensive capacity. Ageing is also associated with tau astrogliopathy, which underlies several neurodegenerative pathologies linked to cognitive deficits. In particular, age-dependent tau astrogliopathy was consistently observed in the brains of 'super-centenarians' aged more than 110 years. Thus age-dependent cognitive decline is, at least in part, linked to neuroglial decline and paralysis.

### GADD45G operates as a pathological sensor orchestrating reactive gliosis and neurodegeneration [^cd724904]. Neuron (2025). Medium credibility.

Reactive gliosis is a hallmark of neuropathology and offers a potential target for addressing numerous neurological diseases. Here, we show that growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gamma (GADD45G), a stress sensor in astrocytes, is a nodal orchestrator of reactive gliosis and neurodegeneration. GADD45G expression in astrocytes is sufficient to incite astrogliosis, microgliosis, synapse loss, compromised animal behavior, and the aggravation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conversely, silencing GADD45G specifically in astrocytes preserves synapses and rescues the histological and behavioral phenotypes of AD. Mechanistically, GADD45G controls the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4) and neuroimmune signaling pathways, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to profound molecular changes and the secretion of various factors that regulate both cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous reactive gliosis and glia-neuron interactions. These results uncover GADD45G signaling as a promising therapeutic target for AD and potentially for numerous other neurological disorders.

### Hypothalamic inflammation: marker or mechanism of obesity pathogenesis? [^b819cbd3]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Other studies, however, suggest a more complex picture in which microglia and astrocytes play a protective role by limiting the deleterious hypothalamic consequences of consuming an HFD. First, mice with moderately increased production of IL-6 from astrocytes were protected from DIO, rather than being more susceptible. Moreover, adult rats overfed during the neonatal period manifest hypothalamic microglial activation (as evidenced by major histocompatibility complex class II expression) without local inflammation, and hypothalamic microglia from mice fed an HFD accumulate the generally anti-inflammatory molecule IgG. Finally, our recent work suggests that effects of short-term HFD feeding on hypothalamic inflammation and reactive gliosis are separable from one another. Specifically, whereas both processes were evident within the first week of HFD consumption, hypothalamic inflammation subsided over the next 2 weeks despite accumulation of enlarged microglia in the ARC that continued unabated.

Although definitive answers are still awaited, these results are consistent with a model (Fig. 1) in which gliosis develops initially as a neuroprotective response to cope with neuronal stress induced by HFD feeding. In this scenario, glial responses initially constrain hypothalamic inflammatory signaling. With prolonged exposure to an HFD, however, astrocytes and/or microglia may eventually convert to a more proinflammatory, neurotoxic phenotype. Detailed cellular phenotyping and carefully timed functional interventions should help clarify these possibilities.

FIG. 1.
Model depicting the hypothalamic response to an HFD in animals predisposed to DIO. A: AgRP and POMC neurons are integral components of energy balance neurocircuitry located in the ARC nucleus, situated adjacent to the third cerebral ventricle (3V) along the floor of the hypothalamus. Activity of these neurons is sensitive to input from circulating hormones (e.g. leptin and insulin) and nutrients, and it plays an important role to establish the defended level of body weight. B: Recent evidence suggests that during HFD feeding, these neurons may be injured via unknown mechanisms, and that this injury triggers activation of local glial cell populations (astrocytes and microglia). This neuron injury and reactive gliosis can in turn impair homeostatic control of body fat stores, leading to increased body weight.

### Functional roles of reactive astrocytes in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [^f95d9ff6]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Despite advances in uncovering the mechanisms that underlie neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease, therapies that prevent neuronal loss remain elusive. Targeting of disease-defining markers in conditions such as Alzheimer disease (amyloid-β and tau) or Parkinson disease (α-synuclein) has been met with limited success, suggesting that these proteins do not act in isolation but form part of a pathological network. This network could involve phenotypic alteration of multiple cell types in the CNS, including astrocytes, which have a major neurosupportive, homeostatic role in the healthy CNS but adopt reactive states under acute or chronic adverse conditions. Transcriptomic studies in human patients and disease models have revealed the co-existence of many putative reactive sub-states of astrocytes. Inter-disease and even intra-disease heterogeneity of reactive astrocytic sub-states are well established, but the extent to which specific sub-states are shared across different diseases is unclear. In this Review, we highlight how single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing and other 'omics' technologies can enable the functional characterization of defined reactive astrocyte states in various pathological scenarios. We provide an integrated perspective, advocating cross-modal validation of key findings to define functionally important sub-states of astrocytes and their triggers as tractable therapeutic targets with cross-disease relevance.

### Astrocytes: a central element in neurological diseases [^9332afd0]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

The neurone-centred view of the past disregarded or downplayed the role of astroglia as a primary component in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. As this concept is changing, so is also the perceived role of astrocytes in the healthy and diseased brain and spinal cord. We have started to unravel the different signalling mechanisms that trigger specific molecular, morphological and functional changes in reactive astrocytes that are critical for repairing tissue and maintaining function in CNS pathologies, such as neurotrauma, stroke, or neurodegenerative diseases. An increasing body of evidence shows that the effects of astrogliosis on the neural tissue and its functions are not uniform or stereotypic, but vary in a context-specific manner from astrogliosis being an adaptive beneficial response under some circumstances to a maladaptive and deleterious process in another context. There is a growing support for the concept of astrocytopathies in which the disruption of normal astrocyte functions, astrodegeneration or dysfunctional/maladaptive astrogliosis are the primary cause or the main factor in neurological dysfunction and disease. This review describes the multiple roles of astrocytes in the healthy CNS, discusses the diversity of astroglial responses in neurological disorders and argues that targeting astrocytes may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for Alexander disease, neurotrauma, stroke, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.

### Selective induction of astrocytic gliosis generates deficits in neuronal inhibition [^51229d51]. Nature Neuroscience (2010). Medium credibility.

Reactive astrocytosis develops in many neurologic diseases, including epilepsy. Astrocytotic contributions to pathophysiology are poorly understood. Studies examining this are confounded by comorbidities accompanying reactive astrocytosis. We found that high-titer transduction of astrocytes with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) via adeno-associated virus induced reactive astrocytosis without altering the intrinsic properties or anatomy of neighboring neurons. We examined the consequences of selective astrocytosis induction on synaptic transmission in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. Neurons near eGFP-labeled reactive astrocytes had reduced inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptic currents. This inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) erosion resulted from a failure of the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle. Reactive astrocytes downregulated expression of glutamine synthetase. Blockade of this enzyme normally induces rapid synaptic GABA depletion. In astrocytotic regions, residual inhibition lost sensitivity to glutamine synthetase blockade, whereas exogenous glutamine administration enhanced IPSCs. Astrocytosis-mediated deficits in inhibition triggered glutamine-reversible hyperexcitability in hippocampal circuits. Thus, reactive astrocytosis could generate local synaptic perturbations, leading to broader functional deficits associated with neurologic disease.

### Astrocyte-immune cell interactions in physiology and pathology [^8d7aa6a1]. Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes play both physiological and pathological roles in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) function. Here, we review the varied functions of astrocytes and how these might change in subsets of reactive astrocytes. We review the current understanding of astrocyte interactions with microglia and the vasculature and protective barriers in the central nervous system as well as highlight recent insights into physiologic and reactive astrocyte sub-states identified by transcriptional profiling. Our goal is to stimulate inquiry into how these molecular identifiers link to specific functional changes in astrocytes and to define the implications of these heterogeneous molecular and functional changes in brain function and pathology. Defining these complex interactions has the potential to yield new therapies in CNS injury, infection, and disease.

### Glial degeneration and reactive gliosis in α-synucleinopathies: the emerging concept of primary gliodegeneration [^5da4178a]. Acta Neuropathologica (2006). Low credibility.

The concept of gliodegenerative diseases has not been widely established although there is accumulating evidence that glial cells may represent a primary target of degenerative disease processes. In the central nervous system (CNS), examples that provide a "proof of concept" include at least one alpha-synucleinopathy, multiple system atrophy (MSA), but this disease is conventionally discussed under the heading of "neurodegeneration". Additional evidence in support of primary glial affection has been reported in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Based on biochemical, genetic and transcriptomic studies it is also becoming increasingly clear that the molecular changes measured in whole tissue extracts, e.g. obtained from Parkinson's disease brain, are not based on a purely neuronal contribution. This important evidence has been missed in cell culture or laser capture work focusing on the neuronal cell population. Studies of animal and in vitro models of disease pathogenesis additionally suggest glial accountability for some CNS degenerative processes. This review provides a critical analysis of the evidence available to date in support of the concept of gliodegeneration, which we propose to represent an essential although largely disregarded component of the spectrum of classical "neurodegeneration". Examples from the spectrum of alpha-synucleinopathies are presented.

### Astrocyte biomarkers GFAP and YKL-40 mediate early Alzheimer's disease progression [^ee764374]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

There is increased recognition that glial cells play an active role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Astrocytes are important regulators of the brain's inflammatory response to injury and have been shown to become activated in reaction to the deposition of misfolded protein aggregates. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that reactive astrocytes surround amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tau deposits early in AD, and shown a strong correlation between astrocyte reactivity and increased accumulation of AD pathology. These activated astrocytes in turn release pro‐inflammatory molecules such as cytokines and chemokines, which may contribute to neurotoxic effects and exacerbate the progression of AD. However, the specific impact of reactive astrogliosis on key pathological events early in the AD continuum remains uncertain. A deeper understanding of how central disease mechanisms are mediated by activated astrocytes may provide us with insight into pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD.

### Myeloid lineage C3 induces reactive gliosis and neuronal stress during CNS inflammation [^9d0bbb70]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly prevalent with our aging population and are largely untreatable. When neurons die in the CNS there is a robust astroglial and microglial response characterized by phagocytosis and clearance of cellular debris, which may facilitate tissue repair. However, both of these glial types also have effector functions that are deleterious. They can recruit peripheral immune cells and release injurious molecules, including cytokines and factors associated with oxidative stress. The early complement component C3 is one of the most highly differentially expressed genes in neurotoxic astroglia, is elevated in most neurodegenerative diseases, and is specifically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease severity. Genetic deletion of C3 in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models of MS is protective of synapses in the hippocampus and lateral geniculate nucleus, supporting the notion that C3-mediated pathology is a major mechanism of injury.

Astrocyte appearance and roles in CNS disorders and pathology

CNS trauma

Traumatic brain and spinal cord injury are major causes of premature death, permanent physical disability, or long-lasting neuropsychiatric impairment. Reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation are prominent features of CNS trauma and are increasingly implicated as playing important roles in determining long-term clinical outcome. The appearance of reactive astrogliosis after CNS trauma (whether in the brain or spinal cord) varies with the (1) type of the trauma, i.e. whether it is penetrating, contusional, or diffuse (as in the case of diffuse axonal injury), (2) severity of the trauma, (3) length of time that has elapsed between injury and biopsy or autopsy, and (4) distance of the tissue examined from the site of injury/trauma. The same specimen may exhibit different severities of reactive astrogliosis in different locations, such as a distinct glial scar along areas of damaged tissue after penetrating or severe contusive trauma (Fig. 4 d), which may be surrounded by areas of decreasing severity of reactive astrogliosis (Fig. 4 c) as distance away from the lesion center increases (Fig. 4 b). Tissue at a considerable distance from the site of direct injury may show sequelae of transient edema and/or downstream effects such as Wallerian or trans-synaptic degeneration, or a combination of the two, significantly contributing to neurologic disability.

Severe reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation at sites of CNS trauma are well documented to inhibit axonal regeneration and are widely regarded as detrimental to clinical outcome. Nevertheless, recent studies using transgenic mouse models indicate that scar-forming reactive astrocytes exert essential neuroprotective functions after both brain and spinal cord trauma as discussed earlier.

Diffuse traumatic brain injury can lead to mild or moderate diffuse astrogliosis without obvious scar formation, in which reactive astrocytes hypertrophy and up regulate gene expression, including GFAP, but in which there is little or no loss of individual astrocyte domains (Figs. 3 b, 4 b). In animal experiments, mild to moderate reactive astrogliosis of this type exhibits the potential for resolution, but the functional consequences of these changes are not well understood. A cerebral concussion almost certainly impacts on astrocyte structure and function, but such injury is not life threatening, results in minimal if any abnormalities on neuroimaging, and is thus (by definition) not usually the subject of neuropathological review or investigation.

### The role of lipopolysaccharides in diabetic retinopathy [^85200323]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Reactive gliosis is an indispensable ingredient of neurodegeneration

Retinal neural glia are neuron-supportive cells with significant functions in immune modulation, metabolism regulation, and nourishment of neurones, which are essential for the homeostasis of the neuroretina network. Specifically, Müller cells are the most widely distributed in the retina, accounting for 90% of the retinal glia. They form a radial supporting structure along the entire width of the retina, which is critical for metabolism and intercellular communication. Comparatively, astrocytes are confined to the neuroretina, and this distribution is closely related to the presence of retinal vasculature. More importantly, astrocytes provide energy substrates for neurones and secrete neurotrophic factors and antioxidants to promote neural survival. Reactive gliosis refers to the proliferation and activation of Müller cells and astrocytes in response to retinal stress, which includes processes of neuroinflammation, phagocytosis of apoptotic neurones and cell debris, and secretion of neurotrophic factors. The upregulated expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an early sign of reactive gliosis, and increased GFAP expression can be detected in the aqueous humour of NPDR patients, the retina of DR mice, and the LPS-treated glial cells in vitro, this suggests the pivotal role of gliosis in the progression of DR. Under physiological conditions, a delicate balance is maintained between the damaging and protective effects of reactive gliosis. Long-term exposure to LPS, however, may give rise to chronic gliosis and result in the disturbance of this balance, namely, damage far surpassing protection. Eventually, the inability for activated glia to maintain appropriate support for BRB and the neuroretina could lead to the exacerbation of neurodegeneration in DR.

Multiple sclerosis and autoimmune inflammatory disorders

The CNS is affected by a number of different autoimmune inflammatory conditions. Reactive astrogliosis is a not only a prominent feature of these conditions, but various lines of evidence point towards central roles for reactive astrocytes in key pathogenic disease mechanisms discussed below. In the most common (Charcot) type of multiple sclerosis, plaques of demyelination are interspersed with and surrounded by reactive astrocytes and there are widespread regions of focal reactive astrogliosis of varying intensity throughout white matter and in some regions of gray matter. Astrocytes in demyelinating disease may exhibit unusual nuclear and cytological features. They may contain multiple distinct nuclei, especially in chronic disease. Such enlarged multinucleated astrocytes are often referred to as 'Creutzfeldt astrocytes' or 'Creutzfeldt–Peters cells'. The multiple nuclei within these astrocytes may be fragmented, such that the appearance of a given cell resembles an atypical or 'granular mitosis' of the type often encountered in high grade gliomas. Demyelinating lesions may also exhibit astrocytes that label with markers of cell division. The obvious diagnostic pitfall here is that a small biopsy from the edge of a demyelinating plaque may suggest a malignancy rather than multiple sclerosis (especially at the time of intraoperative consultation). Astrocytes in multiple sclerosis may also demonstrate the phenomenon of 'emperipolesis', i.e. an astrocyte apparently engulfing one or more other cells such as oligodendroglia or lymphocytes. The role of this process in the pathogenesis or progression/chronicity of multiple sclerosis is not certain. It should be emphasized that both multinucleation of astrocytes and astrocyte emperipolesis also occur in other disorders, including certain tumors and longstanding spongiform encephalopathy.

### Signaling pathways associated with gliosis can Be… [^198b709e]. stacks.cdc.gov (2004). Low credibility.

Details Personal Author: Description: Damage to the CNS is characterized by activation of microglia and astroglia, a phenomenon termed reactive gliosis. These cellular reactions have been implicated in both regeneration and degeneration of the CNS. Damage-induced production of cytokines and chemokines has been linked to the initiation of gliosis using several injury models, including exposure to known neurotoxicants. The Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway is a down-stream effector of cytokines and activation of this pathway is associated with gliosis. In particular, the transcription factor STAT3 is critical for astroglial response to CNS damage. Here, we used brain slices from mice treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxicant, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine to examine astroglial STAT3 activation responses. 12 hours post MPTP or saline treatment, C57Bl/6 female mice were sacrificed by decapitation and coronal slices of brain were prepared. Striatum was dissected and assayed for activated STAT-3. Phospho-STAT3 was present in slices from MPTP treated mice immediately following sacrifice while absent in control mice, recapitulating in vivo observations. These data suggest that activated STAT3 is pre-served in brain slices. Striatal slices were then exposed to phosphate free oxygenated buffer for various times. After 45 minutes both MPTP treated and control striata expressed p-STAT3, indicating that MPTP induced phosphorylation is retained ex vivo and that STAT3 activation can also result from slice injury. Production of cytokines upstream of STAT3 was examined by RT-PCR. Messenger RNA for CNTF and IL-6 was not altered while mRNA for MCP-1 and LIF was increased.

Finally we determined that AG490, a JAK inhibitor, and lavendustin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could diminish STAT3 phosphorylation in slices. These data suggest that activation of STAT3 is an early event in both toxicant and slice-induced glial activation. In addition, this investigation establishes the brain slice preparation method as a reliable model to examine reactive gliosis.

### The role of the gut microbiome in the regulation of astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease [^b22d4626]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Reactive Astrocytosis

Astrocytes serve a supportive function and are important for homeostasis in the CNS. They also serve a function in responding to pathologic insults in the context of disease or injury. In these contexts, astrocytes alter their morphological, transcriptional, and functional phenotypes in a process known as reactive astrocytosis or reactive astrogliosis (Fig. 1). Significant heterogeneity exists in reactive astrocytosis depending on the context and can manifest as astrocytes that take on a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotype that promote or limit CNS inflammation, respectively. The early rise of transcriptomic technology initially led to a discovery of distinct responses of reactive astrocytes, termed A1 (neurotoxic, defined in the context of lipopolysaccharide-mediated neuroinflammation) and A2 (neurotrophic, defined in the context of ischemic stroke models) after previously defined macrophage terminology (M1/M2). However, due to the development of more sophisticated transcriptomic technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, it is now clear that reactive astrocytes possess a significant heterogeneity of response rather than responses that are binary. Some of the primary signaling pathways initiating and sustaining reactive astrocytosis are Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). However, there are many proposed transcription factors mediating reactive astrocyte signaling.

Fig. 1
Continuum of astrocyte reactivity with respect to time. Astrocytes are supportive cells in the brain that function in blood-brain barrier maintenance, ionic buffering, neurotransmitter recycling, glycogen storage, and synaptic regulation during homeostasis. In the context of CNS insults or disease, they change their functional state to respond to pathology and become "reactive astrocytes". Reactive astrocytes lose many of their homeostatic functions and gain pro-inflammatory functions. While reactive astrocytes may be protective in acute contexts, such as in stroke, they are generally detrimental in chronic contexts, such as in neurodegenerative disease, where they may cause neurotoxicity, increase protein aggregation, or recruit pro-inflammatory peripheral immune cells.

### Endothelin, astrocytes and glaucoma [^c8b26973]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

It has become increasingly clear that astrocytes may play an important role in the genesis of glaucoma. Astrogliosis occurs in response to ocular stress or the presence of noxious stimuli. Agents that appear to stimulate reactive gliosis are becoming increasingly clear. One class of agents that is emerging is the endothelins (ETs; specifically, ET-1). In this review we examine the interactions of ET-1 with astrocytes and provide examples where ET-1 appears to contribute to activation of astrocytes and play a role in the neurodegenerative effects that accompany such reactivation resulting in astrogliosis. These actions are presented in the context of glaucoma although information is also presented with respect to ET-1's role in the central nervous system and brain. While much has been learned with respect to ET-1/astrocyte interactions, there are still a number of questions concerning the potential therapeutic implications of these findings. Hopefully this review will stimulate others to examine this potential.

### Reactive astrogliosis is associated with higher cerebral glucose consumption in the early Alzheimer's continuum [^60692c30]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study is observational and cross-sectional. Therefore, we cannot disentangle any causal relationships. It could be thought that astrocytes react to early Aβ dysmetabolism, but others have postulated that astrocytic metabolic dysfunction might trigger the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Still, our findings support conducting longitudinal and interventional studies to better understand the causal inter-relationships among these alterations early in the Alzheimer's continuum. A better understanding of the pathophysiological pathways affected in preclinical stages is fundamental for the rational design of preventive interventions. Another limitation in our study is that we assume GFAP to be a marker of reactive astrocytes. In this regard, it must be noted that GFAP is not exclusive to astrocytes in the central nervous system and that not all astrocytes produce GFAP. Still, GFAP is the best well-established and commonly used astrocytic marker in the literature. Finally, since astrocytes are not the only metabolically active non-neuronal cells in the brain, it could be thought that the observed increase in glucose consumption is driven by other processes such as microglial activation. In this regard, a recent study shown that microglial activation can also be a significant contributor to the [18 F]FDG PET signal. Given that astrocytes can directly trigger microglial activation, it could be possible that the increase of glucose consumption is indirectly mediated or significantly contributed by microglial activation. Nonetheless, in a recent study of our group with the same participants of this study, we did not find the same kind of relation with sTREM2, a marker of microglial activation, and [18 F]FDG uptake as the one found here with plasma or CSF GFAP. Thus, this result does not support to the microglial involvement in the association here presented.

### Pathologic and clinical correlates of region-specific brain GFAP in Alzheimer's disease [^e3ad592e]. Acta Neuropathologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Astrocyte reactivity plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Reactive astrocytes undergo extensive morphological and functional remodeling in response to a variety of central nervous system (CNS) insults, primarily serving to protect neural tissue and maintain homeostasis. Specifically, in AD, reactive astrocytes release proinflammatory cytokines that increase the synthesis and release of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) and reduce microglial Aβ phagocytosis. As such, astrocyte activation in response to early Aβ pathology initiates a positive-feedback loop that can persist potentially decades before symptom onset.

One highly conserved change in reactive astrocytes is strong upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein expressed predominantly by astrocytes. GFAP serves as a key cytoskeletal protein, helping astrocytes maintain their mechanical strength, support astrocyte–neuron interactions, and preserve blood–brain barrier integrity. Increased GFAP largely reflects changes in the astrocyte cytoskeleton, including hypertrophy and extension of processes toward the site of injury.

Numerous studies have assessed the viability of elevated plasma GFAP as a biomarker for AD and amyloid pathology. Plasma biomarkers are particularly useful due to their ease of collection and cost-effectiveness, and increasing effort is being applied to the evaluation of peripheral measurements of AD pathology and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, recent findings leveraging in vivo measurements of peripheral GFAP found that high GFAP expression relates to worse cognitive outcomes, particularly in amyloid-positive individuals. Despite these promising biomarker findings, very little is known about the association between GFAP levels in the brain and AD neuropathology, or whether upregulation of GFAP in the blood reflects upregulation in the brain, making the interpretation of plasma GFAP challenging. To date, few studies have examined how differences in GFAP abundance in the brain relates to AD neuropathology or concomitant pathways of injury in the brain. Similarly, it is not clear whether GFAP levels in the brain relate to antemortem cognitive performance, or whether such associations are modified by amyloid as is observed in the periphery. Characterizing such brain associations will shed light on the utility of GFAP as a biomarker of astrocytic changes in the AD brain.

### Sensitivity of diffusion MRI to perilesional reactive astrogliosis in focal ischemia [^72b37c7a]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

Reactive astrogliosis is a response to injury in the central nervous system that plays an essential role in inflammation and tissue repair. It is characterized by hypertrophy of astrocytes, alterations in astrocyte gene expression and astrocyte proliferation. Reactive astrogliosis occurs in multiple neuropathologies, including stroke, traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease, and it has been proposed as a possible source of the changes in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) metrics observed with these diseases. In this study, the sensitivity of dMRI to reactive astrogliosis was tested in an animal model of focal acute and subacute ischemia induced by the vasoconstricting peptide, endothelin-1. Reactive astrogliosis in perilesional cortex was quantified by calculating the astrocyte surface density as determined with a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody, whereas perilesional diffusion changes were measured in vivo with diffusional kurtosis imaging. We found substantial changes in the surface density of GFAP-positive astrocyte processes and modest changes in dMRI metrics in the perilesional motor cortex following stroke. Although there are time point-specific correlations between dMRI and histological measures, there is no definitive evidence for a causal relationship.

### Immune responses to central nervous system directed adeno-associated virus gene therapy: does direct CNS delivery make a difference? [^fad76f6b]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Immune Responses in the CNS and Privilege

Due to the protection conferred by the BBB, it has long been thought that the CNS is "immune privileged". However, the idea that the CNS is protected from immune responses has been challenged, and the term has further been refined, owing to more recent data demonstrating the tightly intertwined relationship of the CNS and the immune system. Compared to other tissues, the CNS has its own unique immune microenvironment which is strongly influenced by its distinctive resident cells. Glia are broadly considered to be the resident immune cells of the CNS, particularly microglia. One of the main responsibilities of glia is to protect neurons from damage and degeneration, which is one of the key characteristics associated with CNS disorders. Upon infection or injurious stimuli, glia undergo an inflammatory transformation, releasing proinflammatory molecules, like cytokines, to restore the CNS to homeostasis. When reactive gliosis goes unchecked, excess inflammation can contribute further to neuronal damage, which is why it is so important that immune responses to AAV in the CNS are properly regulated. Microglia, the resident macrophages in the CNS, phagocytose and eliminate particles that may pose a threat to the CNS. Once the danger has been eradicated, microglia return to a homeostatic state to continue to survey the brain for new insults. Interestingly, targeting glia, particularly microglia with AAV, has been a significant challenge in the field, however advancements have been made. Another important immune-like cell in the CNS is the astrocyte, which is more often transduced with AAV alongside neurons. Astrocytes are responsible for upholding the blockade at the BBB and preventing the passage of injurious molecules or cells from the periphery to the CNS. Dysregulation of astrocytes, whether due to disease or inflammation, can lead to disproportionate BBB leakage, potentially allowing more detrimental molecules or cells to enter the normally well-protected nervous system.

### Revisiting the critical roles of reactive astrocytes in neurodegeneration [^551e4691]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes, an integral component of the central nervous system (CNS), contribute to the maintenance of physiological homeostasis through their roles in synaptic function, K + buffering, blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance, and neuronal metabolism. Reactive astrocytes refer to astrocytes undergoing morphological, molecular and functional remodelling in response to pathological stimuli. The activation and differentiation of astrocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still controversies regarding their subset identification, function and nomenclature in neurodegeneration. In this review, we revisit the multidimensional roles of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Furthermore, we propose a precise linkage between astrocyte subsets and their functions based on single-cell sequencing analyses.

### Hypothalamic neuronal-glial crosstalk in metabolic disease [^2f33a777]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

Glial cells include astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Activation of non-neuronal CNS-resident glial cells, particularly microglia and astrocytes, is a phenomenon commonly referred to as "reactive gliosis". Seminal work by Thaler et al. in 2012 observed reactive gliosis in rodent models of obesity via immunohistochemistry, showing increased hypothalamic glia cell numbers and size, and increased glial cell marker gene expression. Surprisingly, elevated Gfap and Emri mRNA levels, markers of astrocytes and mature microglia, respectively, were increased after just one day of HFD feeding. Obesity-induced reactive gliosis can be reversed once mice are returned to a standard chow diet after at least 4 weeks, evident by reduced GFAP intensity and microglial activation. Newly-generated cells in the obese hypothalamus, identified by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling, are predominantly microglia, with few GFAP/BrdU double-positive cells. This implies that while hypothalamic microglia undergo cell proliferation during HFD-feeding, it is likely that existing astrocytes from other brain regions are recruited to the area, perhaps by chemokine signalling. Pharmacologically blocking cell proliferation in HFD mice has been shown to prevent this microglia and astrocyte accumulation and resultant neuroinflammation, indicated by decreased cell numbers and soma size. Blocking reactive gliosis also rescues the whole body HFD phenotype by lowering plasma IL1β and TNFα levels, reducing fat mass gain, and restoring leptin sensitivity, further highlighting reactive gliosis as a major contributor to metabolic disease.

Clinical assessment of reactive gliosis in humans can be inferred based on MRI. Increased MRI T2 relaxation time in the medial basal hypothalamus has been used as a surrogate marker for reactive gliosis in both miceand humans, and is significantly correlated with fat massand glucose intolerance. Another study also correlated T2 relaxation time with BMI, fasting insulin levels and homoeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score.

Obesity-induced neuroinflammation also poses a risk of cognitive declineas chronic exposure to obesogenic diets affects the neuronal wiring within the brain. Obesity has been shown to decrease synaptic inputs onto both POMC and AgRP/NPY neurons, affecting inhibitory synapses on POMC neurons, and stimulatory synapses on NPY neurons. Long-term HFD feeding (8 months) in mice eventually results in POMC neuron loss (approximately 25% reduction), highlighting the danger of long-term hypothalamic gliosis on physiologically crucial neuronal circuits.

### Early microglial and astrocyte reactivity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease [^8fb604fb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we provide compelling evidence that microglial and astrocyte biomarkers increase early on the AD continuum and have a significant influence on key pathogenic events at this stage. These results reinforce the idea that reactive microglia and astrocytes, in response to AD pathology, are crucial contributors to the progression of downstream neurodegenerative changes.

### Astroglial reactivity is a key modulator of Alzheimer's disease pathological progression [^8aa58443]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

This scientific commentary refers to 'Association of glial fibrillary acid protein, Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline' by Peretti et al.

Neuroinflammation plays an increasingly recognized role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Astrocytes and microglia in the brain become activated in response to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, and this activation is now understood to drive pathological progression in Alzheimer's disease, rather than being merely a bystander effect. In light of this, inflammatory markers, albeit not specific to Alzheimer's disease, have been included in the revised National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and staging, alongside amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration.

Among these neuroinflammatory markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has emerged as a sensitive and robust biomarker for astrocyte reactivity. It can be measured in both CSF and serum, although its levels in these fluids may differ markedly, for reasons that remain unclear. Notably, plasma GFAP levels are significantly elevated in association with early amyloid pathology. Even in cognitively unimpaired individuals, plasma GFAP may impact the aggregation of fibrillar Aβand the phosphorylation of tau. These findings suggest a key role for astrogliosis in very early Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, with elevated plasma GFAP detectable decades before the onset of symptoms. GFAP levels continue to rise across the Alzheimer's disease continuum, providing robust prognostic information on the risk of progression to dementia. Plasma GFAP is also being used as a pharmacodynamic marker in clinical trials of anti-Aβ immunotherapies, where its levels drop with treatment-driven reductions in amyloid plaques and clinical benefit.

Scar formation and maintenance

Tissue scarring in the CNS

Injury to any tissue results in a healing response, the purpose of which is firstly to curtail damage and restore homoeostasis and then, where possible, to restore tissue and organ function. Inflammation, tissue reformation (involving cell proliferation and/or migration) and tissue remodelling are conserved repair processes, although their success in restoring function varies across different tissues. A scar consists of the cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) formed as the result of attempted wound repair. In many organs, the formation of a scar is associated with a resolution phase and restoration of key functions of the tissue. The healed tissue may not directly recapitulate the pre-injury state but it regains some ability to execute its original function. However, the process of tissue scarring in the CNS is more complex than for many other tissues, and is associated with chronic non-resolving pathology.

Disease and injury to the CNS is almost always accompanied by some degree of reactive gliosis, inflammation and scarring. Scar tissue and associated deposition of ECM molecules such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs, discussed in more detail below) has been reported in humans and experimental animal models following traumatic brain injuryand stroke, as well in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, and disorders with a predominantly demyelinating and inflammatory pathology such as multiple sclerosis. However, despite the occurrence of reactive tissue changes and scarring in several other CNS pathologies, spinal cord injury represents a particularly striking example where wound repair is inefficient and injury-induced pathological changes are insurmountable.

There are several likely contributing factors to these regional and injury-specific differences in CNS scarring. Cell types involved in scarring in different CNS regions are phenotypically different. There are also differences in the levels of neuroinflammation and astrocyte activation after brain and spinal cord trauma, with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and damage-exacerbating leukocytes – and more abundant and widespread astrocytosis in spinal cord injuries compared to brain injuries. There are also differences in ECM composition and distribution between brain and spinal cord pathologies –. In this Review we specifically focus on scarring following spinal cord injury, and discuss the dynamic cellular and extracellular interactions that culminate in a hostile scar environment with limited capacity for repair.

### Myeloid lineage C3 induces reactive gliosis and neuronal stress during CNS inflammation [^b9229515]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Complement component C3 mediates pathology in CNS neurodegenerative diseases. Here we use scRNAseq of sorted C3-reporter positive cells from mouse brain and optic nerve to characterize C3 producing glia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model in which peripheral immune cells infiltrate the CNS, causing reactive gliosis and neuro-axonal pathology. We find that C3 expression in the early inflammatory stage of EAE defines disease-associated glial subtypes characterized by increased expression of genes associated with mTOR activation and cell metabolism. This pro-inflammatory subtype is abrogated with genetic C3 depletion, a finding confirmed with proteomic analyses. In addition, early optic nerve axonal injury and retinal ganglion cell oxidative stress, but not loss of post-synaptic density protein 95, are ameliorated by selective deletion of C3 in myeloid cells. These data suggest that in addition to C3b opsonization of post synaptic proteins leading to neuronal demise, C3 activation is a contributor to reactive glia in the optic nerve.

### Neuroimaging measures of iron and gliosis explain memory performance in aging [^b4a16504]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence from animal and histological studies has indicated that accumulation of iron in the brain results in reactive gliosis that contributes to cognitive deficits. The current study extends these findings to human cognitive aging and suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques like quantitative relaxometry can be used to study iron and its effects in vivo. The effects of iron on microstructure and memory performance were examined using a combination of quantitative relaxometry and multicompartment diffusion imaging in 35 young (21.06 ± 2.18 years) and 28 older (72.58 ± 6.47 years) adults, who also completed a memory task. Replicating past work, results revealed age-related increases in iron content (R2*) and diffusion, and decreases in memory performance. Independent of age group, iron content was significantly related to restricted (intracellular) diffusion in regions with low-moderate iron (hippocampus, caudate) and to all diffusion metrics in regions with moderate-high iron (putamen, globus pallidus). This pattern is consistent with different stages of iron-related gliosis, ranging from astrogliosis that may influence intracellular diffusion to microglial proliferation and increased vascular permeability that may influence all sources of diffusion. Further, hippocampal restricted diffusion was significantly related to memory performance, with a third of this effect related to iron content; consistent with the hypothesis that higher iron-related astrogliosis in the hippocampus is associated with poorer memory performance. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of MRI to iron-related gliosis and extend our understanding of its impact on cognition by showing that this relationship also explains individual differences in memory performance.

### Microdissection-based genotyping assists discrimination of reactive gliosis from glioma [^b0cf512e]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

We used molecular anatomic pathology to determine the mutational status (loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) to make the distinction between reactive gliosis and glial neoplasia. LOH has been shown to be absent in reactive states and present in neoplastic cellular proliferations. Three groups of patient specimens were analyzed: group 1, reactive gliosis (n = 15); group 2, gliomas of varying histologic type and grade (n = 54); group 3, diagnostically challenging reactive gliosis vs glioma (n = 16). No group 1 cases (0/15 [0%]) showed allelic loss, whereas all high-grade glial neoplasms, a subset of group 2 (35/35 [100%]) manifested at least 1 allelic loss alteration, with most cases (33/35 [94%]) displaying 2 or more such changes. During a look forward at the group 3 patients, clinical history clarified the problematic diagnosis in a subset of 11 patients: 8 (73%) of 11 clinical outcomes were predicted correctly by our analysis. The molecular anatomic pathology approach outlined herein is designed for minute, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, which are encountered in everyday surgical pathology practice. Molecular anatomic pathology opens the possibilities of molecular analysis to everyday pathology practice.

Reactive astrogliosis: beyond conventional glial scar concepts and markers

Neuroscientists have reported a growing body of evidence regarding distinctive scarring phenomena in the CNS, such as "filling destroyed space and building a wall", which occurs in response to severe damage or neuroinflammatory insults. One well-known cause of glial scarring is traumatic brain injury, a neurodegenerative and noncongenital insult to the CNS. Glial scarring has been observed in both experimental animal models and patient cases. Other triggers of glial scarring include stroke, ischemia, autoimmune responses, and even severe progression of neurodegenerative diseases –. In most of the cases mentioned above, astrocytes undergo morphological changes characterized by intensive overlapping processes in local lesions. These molecular and cellular alterations, known as "reactive astrogliosis", are considered a major requirement for the formation of glial scars. Initially, the prevailing concept of glial scarring and reactive astrogliosis was that glial scarring inhibited axonal regeneration, thus obstructing tissue regeneration after CNS injury. Based on the observed morphology in conventional immunohistology, glial scars with reactive astrogliosis serve as barriers to prevent the infiltration of local immune cells and infectious factors into CNS lesions and protect nondamaged neurons from nearby intense inflammatory responses. However, in addition to these neuroprotective functions, it remains controversial whether glial scar formation itself contributes to neuronal loss and degeneration, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Furthermore, because glial scar formation is typically observed in the later stages of animal models or patient cases, it is essential to thoroughly investigate mild and moderate reactive astrogliosis without glial scar formation. Such investigations may aid in the control and reduction of extensive neuronal loss, which may alleviate neurodegenerative symptoms.

Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), a component of intermediate filaments in CNS cells, has been widely used as a molecular marker of astrocytes under both normal and pathological conditions. However, it is important to not overlook the inherent characteristics of GFAP. Numerous astrocytes in the healthy CNS cannot be detected by conventional GFAP staining because GFAP was initially discovered in isolated plaques from multiple sclerosis patients. Several studies have indicated that GFAP expression is not related to the normal physiology of astrocytes in the healthy CNS. However, in pathophysiological conditions such as glial scar formation following CNS injury, GFAP and its upregulation are necessary. Therefore, GFAP expression levels are more useful and reliable for detecting reactive astrogliosis in response to CNS insults than for identifying normal astrocytes under healthy conditions.

### Astrocyte and oligodendrocyte pathology in Alzheimer's disease [^3752c177]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes in AD

Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the brain and perform a vast array of essential functions that include providing metabolic substrates to neurons, regulating ion homeostasis, buffering neurotransmitters, promoting synaptogenesis and synaptic activity, and maintaining the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Astrocytes also change their cell state in response to disease and injury stimuli. Cell non-autonomous external stimuli generate "reactive astrocyte" states, while autonomous internal stimuli, including genetic mutations, drive "diseased astrocyte" states. Both reactive and diseased astrocytes can undergo extensive changes in gene expression and morphological complexity that can contribute to disease through loss of homeostatic functions or gain of pathological functions. Understanding the effect of diseased and reactive astrocytes in AD remains a large area of research.

Reactive astrocytes are prevalent in AD and can acquire harmful and protective functions in response to Aβ and tau (Fig. 1). There is evidence that astrocyte pathology occurs early in AD and that reactive astrocytes actively contribute to neurodegeneration. Traditionally, the hallmark of astrocyte reactivity is the upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and astrocyte hypertrophy. Increased GFAP levels and hypertrophic astrocytes are evident in AD. Nevertheless, GFAP upregulation and hypertrophy are not specific to AD, nor are they sufficient to define the functional phenotype of reactive astrocytes. Diseased astrocytes caused by genetic factors also play a role in AD. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. Carrying a single APOE4 allele increases the risk of developing AD threefold, while homozygous carriers have a fifteen-fold increase in risk. APOE is predominantly expressed by astrocytes, and the APOE4 variant results in diseased astrocytes with altered homeostatic functions, such as lipid metabolism, as well as Aβ production and clearance, leading to Aβ accumulation. APOE4 expression in astrocytes is also sufficient to promote a chronic inflammatory state, while experimental reduction of APOE4 expression in astrocytes can mitigate neuroinflammation, resulting in decreased neuronal loss. Together, this data suggests that astrocyte dysfunction may mediate some of the APOE4-driven increase in AD risk.

### Podoplanin: a marker for reactive gliosis in gliomas and brain injury [^57b56691]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Reactive astrogliosis is associated with many pathologic processes in the central nervous system, including gliomas. The glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN) is upregulated in malignant gliomas. Using a syngeneic intracranial glioma mouse model, we show that PDPN is highly expressed in a subset of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes within and adjacent to gliomas. The expression of PDPN in tumor-associated reactive astrocytes was confirmed by its colocalization with the astrocytic marker S100β and with connexin43, a major astrocytic gap junction protein. To determine whether the increase in PDPN is a general feature of gliosis, we used 2 mouse models in which astrogliosis was induced either by a needle injury or ischemia and observed similar upregulation of PDPN in reactive astrocytes in both models. Astrocytic PDPN was also found to be coexpressed with nestin, an intermediate filament marker for neural stem/progenitor cells. Our findings confirm that expression of PDPN is part of the normal host response to brain injury and gliomas, and suggest that it may be a novel cell surface marker for a specific population of reactive astrocytes in the vicinity of gliomas and nonneoplastic brain lesions. The findings also highlight the heterogeneity of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in reactive gliosis.

### Repair mechanisms of the central nervous system: from axon sprouting to remyelination [^75d46996]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The central nervous system (CNS), comprising the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, has limited regenerative capacity, posing significant challenges in treating neurological disorders. Recent advances in neuroscience and neurotherapeutics have introduced promising strategies to stimulate CNS repair, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis. This review explores the complex interplay between inflammation, demyelination, and remyelination possibilities. Glial cells, including oligodendrocyte precursors, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia play dual roles in injury response, with reactive gliosis promoting repair but also potentially inhibiting recovery through glial scar formation. There is also an emphasis on axonal regeneration, axonal sprouting and stem cell therapies. We highlight the role of neuroplasticity in recovery post-injury and the limited regenerative potential of axons in the CNS due to inhibitory factors such as myelin-associated inhibitors. Moreover, neurotrophic factors support neuronal survival and axonal growth, while stem cell-based approaches offer promise for replacing lost neurons and glial cells. However, challenges such as stem cell survival, integration, and risk of tumor formation remain. Furthermore, we examine the role of neurogenesis in CNS repair and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which can facilitate regeneration. Through these diverse mechanisms, ongoing research aims to overcome the intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to CNS repair and advance therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases.

### Medullary astrogliosis in sudden infant death syndrome varies with sleeping environment: evidence for different mechanisms of death in alone versus Co-sleepers? [^053fb233]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Sudden infant death syndrome remains the leading cause of death in infants under 1 year, and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The current study investigated the hypothesis that co-sleepers die more rapidly from causes such as suffocation from overlaying by comparing levels of reactive astrogliosis in the medulla of infants who died sleeping alone to those who died co-sleeping. The amount of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in alone sleepers was significantly higher than shared sleepers in 3 specific areas of the medulla, the inferior vestibular nucleus, the medial vestibular nucleus and the cochlear nucleus. Given that glial fibrillary acidic protein elevations follow a delayed time course, this suggests that death in co-sleepers was more rapid, not allowing for reactive gliosis to occur. This provides evidence of pathological differences in mechanisms of death in infants who are classified as having died from sudden infant death syndrome, suggesting potential need for refinement of categorization of these cases.

### Spectrum of sublytic astrocytopathy in neuromyelitis optica [^c98566f0]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a disabling CNS inflammatory autoimmune disease, characterized by recurrent severe attacks of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. A serum autoantibody specific for aquaporin-4 water channel (AQP4) aids the distinction of NMO from other CNS demyelinating diseases. AQP4 is the principal CNS water channel, and is expressed predominantly in astrocytes. Astrocytopathic features recognized in NMO include cytolysis and clasmatodendrosis, as well as AQP4 loss. AQP4-specific IgG is acknowledged to be the primary driver of NMO neuropathology. The range of astrocyte reactions occurring in NMO is incompletely characterized, beyond loss of AQP4 and cytolysis. Knowledge of sublytic reactions, the frequency of astrocytic morphological differences and their relationship to demyelinating lesions represent a particular void.

The classic astrocytic reaction, termed 'reactive astrogliosis', 'reactive gliosis' or 'gliosis', manifests as a proliferation of hypertrophic astrocytes with upregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity. Does 'hypertrophic' morphological change always happen during astrocytic reactions? Astrogliosis is considered a nonspecific, chronic reaction to a wide variety of insults. Most observations are based on CNS diseases that do not selectively target astrocytes. Little is known about the spectrum of astrocytic reactions occurring in primary astrocytopathies, which reflect both the initial astrocytic response and secondary cellular interactions of astrocytes undergoing lethal stress.

NMO provides a unique opportunity to observe the astrocytic response to a cell-specific attack. The best-studied of the few identified primary astrocytic disorders is Alexander disease, a genetic disorder that presents clinically as a leukoencephalopathy. Most cases are due to GFAP gene mutations. Similarities and differences in the astrocyte reactions of Alexander disease and NMO remain to be addressed. Until now, models of autoimmune astrocytopathy induced in experimental animals by injecting AQP4-IgG only partly recapitulate histopathological features of NMO. Human astrocytes are more complex and diverse than rodents'. The direct study of human CNS tissues is invaluable for defining subtle pathological features of NMO. To record the spectrum and frequency of astrocyte pathology in NMO, we present here findings gained from a systematic histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological study of astrocytes in brain, spinal cord and optic nerve tissues obtained from autopsied NMO patients.

### Inflammation and gliosis in neurological diseases – clinical implications [^325be081]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2011). Low credibility.

The inflammatory reaction accompany all acute processes in the central nervous system (CNS), (as stroke or traumatic brain injury) and chronic neurodegenerative processes (as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease), and through the stage of cleaning of damage tissue, contribute to recovery and regeneration and eventually to restoration of the function. However many studies showed that inflammation in the CNS may be harmful because of an excessive vulnerability of the nervous tissue or impaired regulation. Manipulation of the inflammation is now one of the approaches in the treatment of the various diseases of the CNS.

### Mapping astrogliosis in the individual human brain using multidimensional MRI [^3a8e86b1]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Illustration of microstructural changes occurring in the grey–white matter junction when scar-border forming astrogliosis is present. In A, axons are tightly aligned, forming a densely packed cellular environment. In B, scar-border forming reactive astrocytes have overlapping processes that sequester damaged tissue and inflammation while preventing injured axons from growing through the border. These changes are hypothesized to be reducing the overall cellular density in the white matter.

Here, we performed a combined post-mortem multidimensional MRI and histopathology study to investigate the ways in which astrogliosis affects MRI relaxation and diffusion, and to establish whether multidimensional MRI can be used to map the presence of scar-border forming astrogliosis in brain tissue. We compared brain sections with histologically confirmed astrogliosis and from control subjects using robust quantitative radiological–pathological correlations and developed a multidimensional MRI machine learning framework to map astrogliosis. We showed the spatial accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed framework and its ability to produce results at the individual subject level. We stress that our findings do not shed light on the underlying cause of astrogliosis in these cases, but rather provide the ability to non-invasively map astrogliosis, which we hope would become an important new tool for investigating and diagnosing a wide array of CNS disorders.

### Reactive gliosis in a case of brain tumor… [^0533706f]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

It is a matter of common observation that the cerebral hemisphere, that is, the seat of a new growth, is usually larger than its fellow of the opposite side. This enlargement is due to several factors, the first of which is the presence of the tumor in the involved hemisphere. In the second place, there are vascular disturbances which may account for some of the discrepancy. Edema, thrombosis and hemorrhage are all known to occur within or in the vicinity of a tumor. Reactive gliosis also plays a part in the notable enlargement of the involved hemisphere. There are cases in which the tumor is of small size, compact, sometimes even calcified, in which, in spite of the absence of vascular disturbances, the hemisphere in which it is situated is enlarged out of all proportion to the size of the neoplasm. It is in these cases that reactive gliosis is. FREEMAN W. REACTIVE GLIOSIS IN A CASE OF BRAIN TUMOR. Arch NeurPsych. 1925; 14: 649–657.

### White matter involvement in sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^b12e398f]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

We found PrP Sc deposition was overall rare in the white matter, although one case, however, had mild to moderate involvement. This case is consistent with some literature reporting the occasional presence of PrP Sc in the white matter in sporadic CJD as well as with mouse models in which PrP Sc is not only routinely detected in the white matter, and suggest that it might be transported along white matter axons to distant grey matter regions.

In our cases, there were several clear differences between the reactive astrocytosis in the white and grey matter. In the grey matter, the reactive astrocytosis was much less robust and patchier, corroborating previous literature in sporadic CJD and animal models (Syrian hamsters and transgenic mice) in which reactive astrocytosis tended to co-localize with PrP Sc. In the white matter, we found reactive astrocytosis was moderate to severe and diffuse, but not associated with PrP Sc deposition. What causes these astrocytes to become reactive in CJD is not well understood. Interestingly in animal models, PrP Sc seems to induce microglial activation, and this event precedes reactive astrocytosis and neuronal degeneration. In the brain, two major classes of astrocytes, biochemically and developmentally distinct, have been identified on the basis of morphology and distribution in the brain: fibrous astrocytes with many glial filaments composed of GFAP and located mainly in white matter; and protoplasmic astrocytes with few glial filaments and located mainly in grey matter. The different degree of reactive astrocytic gliosis occurring in the white matter compared to grey matter might indicate that protoplasmic astrocytes (in the grey matter) are less capable of forming a dense reactive astrocytic gliosis as fibrous astrocytes (in the white matter). Although the grey matter was filled with deposits of PrP Sc, the white matter in five of six cases showed little or no PrP Sc by immunohistochemistry. The presence of PrP Sc in the grey matter might explain the presence of activated microglia there, however the relative absence or paucity of PrP Sc in the white matter in most of our cases with sporadic CJD raises the question of what causes the microglia to become activated and exuberant reactive astrocytosis to occur in white matter. Furthermore, animal models suggest that PrP Sc is transported between brain regions by axonal transport and that PrP Sc is transported out of neurons by exocytosis to the extracellular space. Perhaps sufficient PrP Sc is exocytosed from axons in the white matter to activate microglia and secondarily cause reactive astrocytosis, but the PrP Sc is removed in the process, which is why we do not see it in most cases. The same exocytosis mechanism could result in astrocyte infection with prions and formation of PrP Sc. Finally, it is possible that there was sufficient secondary axonal degeneration (although we did not see this by Bielchowsky staining) in the white matter due to neuron loss in the grey matter to account for reactive astrocytic gliosis and activated microglia.

### 'Hippocampal innate inflammatory gliosis only' in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy [^7a3f7c83]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug-resistant mesial-temporal lobe epilepsy is a devastating disease with seizure onset in the hippocampal formation. A fraction of hippocampi samples from epilepsy-surgical procedures reveals a peculiar histological pattern referred to as 'gliosis only' with unresolved pathogenesis and enigmatic sequelae. Here, we hypothesize that 'gliosis only' represents a particular syndrome defined by distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. We curated an in-depth multiparameter integration of systematic clinical, neuropsychological as well as neuropathological analysis from a consecutive cohort of 627 patients, who underwent hippocampectomy for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. All patients underwent either classic anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy. On the basis of their neuropathological exam, patients with hippocampus sclerosis and 'gliosis only' were characterized and compared within the whole cohort and within a subset of matched pairs. Integrated transcriptional analysis was performed to address molecular differences between both groups. 'Gliosis only' revealed demographics, clinical and neuropsychological outcome fundamentally different from hippocampus sclerosis. 'Gliosis only' patients had a significantly later seizure onset (16.3 versus 12.2 years, P = 0.005) and worse neuropsychological outcome after surgery compared to patients with hippocampus sclerosis. Epilepsy was less amendable by surgery in 'gliosis only' patients, resulting in a significantly worse rate of seizure freedom after surgery in this subgroup (43% versus 68%, P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 2.8, confidence interval 1.7–4.7). This finding remained significant after multivariate and matched-pairs analysis. The 'gliosis only' group demonstrated pronounced astrogliosis and lack of significant neuronal degeneration in contrast to characteristic segmental neuron loss and fibrillary astrogliosis in hippocampus sclerosis. RNA-sequencing of gliosis only patients deciphered a distinct transcriptional programme that resembles an innate inflammatory response of reactive astrocytes. Our data indicate a new temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome for which we suggest the term 'Innate inflammatory gliosis only'. 'Innate inflammatory gliosis only' is characterized by a diffuse gliosis pattern lacking restricted hippocampal focality and is poorly controllable by surgery. Thus, 'innate inflammatory gliosis only' patients need to be clearly identified by presurgical examination paradigms of pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients; surgical treatment of this subgroup should be considered with great precaution. 'Innate inflammatory gliosis only' requires innovative pharmacotreatment strategies.

### Massive retinal gliosis… [^0a823585]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Both Müller cells and astrocytes have been implicated in the dispute over the histogenesis of massive retinal gliosis. We studied three cases of massive retinal gliosis by light and electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Spindle fibrillary glial cells were joined by zonulae adherentes resembling those of the external limiting membrane of the retina. Furthermore, these cells produced a continuous basement membrane around an extracellular space filled with fine filaments, which was highly suggestive of vitreous cavity. In the proliferating cells, immunoperoxidase technique disclosed the presence of carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme C, characteristically found only in Müller cells. The glial cells in the preretinal membrane away from the gliotic nodule showed similar characteristics. We concluded that both the nodule of massive retinal gliosis and the associated preretinal glial membrane resulted from the proliferation and migration of Müller cells.

The findings so far suggest that in I 2 GO, different from HS, a less severe, more diffuse and widespread pathology is being found, implicating a more widespread epileptogenic zone with greater risk for seizure relapse after standard surgical procedures. Presurgical analyses as well as neuropsychological focus mapping have clearly ruled out epileptogenic network activity outside the hippocampal formation as the seizure onset zone in the present patients. If a suspicion of extratemporal or even temporal lateral focus was raised during the preoperative evaluation, patients were suggested for invasive diagnostic tests aiming to localize the focus precisely. Therefore, the observed gliosis pattern constitutes an intrinsic pathological aspect of the epileptogenic focus. In this respect, it is remarkable that the comparison of transcriptional programmes between both entities reveals a first hint of potential innate non-adaptive inflammatory alterations suggesting a distinct pathomechanism in I 2 GO. Pathogenetically, the molecular profile of the I 2 GO hippocampi uncovers a strongly inflammatory micromilieu evoked by the reactively transformed astroglial cell component that is therefore well suited to fundamentally contribute to epileptogenesis of the affected hippocampal network. We observed a distinct activation of the complement pathway associated with inflammatory adaptation of astrocytes similar to those observed in inflammatory diseases such as Morbus Alzheimer or encephalomyelitis disseminate (Supplementary Fig. 1). Further investigation is required to corroborate these initial suspicions. In addition, the frequent bilateral occurrence of I 2 Go underpinning these systemic inflammatory changes may be involved in disease pathogenesis. Thus, we assume that the reactive astrocytes in I 2 Go drive aberrant neuronal plasticity, which is constituted by an astrocyte-neuron signalling cascade resulting in persistent functional modification of hippocampal excitatory synapses.

In our work, we linked inflammatory transcriptional programmes to patients with a significantly worse clinical outcome in terms of seizure freedom and neuropsychology, although the causality was not proven and need further experimental validations. Other authors have demonstrated a neurotoxic effect of reactive astrocytes on the hippocampus in murine models. Although the definite mechanism remains to be further examined, it can be assumed that alterations in neuronal synapses are provoked by a loss of homeostatic functions and release of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, our results reveal abundant transcriptional differences between HS and I 2 GO, suggesting two different disease entities. The neuroinflammatory transcriptional signature of I 2 GO suggests more global and vaster pathomechanisms involved in epilepsy development, which may be less amendable by surgical treatment. In accordance, the clinical differences between both groups supported the transcriptional results.

### Astrocyte and oligodendrocyte pathology in Alzheimer's disease [^c5dbe024]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes therapeutic targets in AD

Therapeutic development for AD has focused almost exclusively on neurons with limited success thus far. As described in this review, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are active drivers of pathology, not passive bystanders in AD. Therapeutics that modulate the behavior of these glial cells, therefore, hold great potential for modifying disease in AD. Currently, there are no active clinical trials for AD of drugs designed specifically to target astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. In this section, we highlight findings from pre-clinical animal studies that show that modulating astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and myelination can diminish AD pathology.

The heterogeneous structural, functional, and transcriptional changes that occur in reactive or diseased astrocytes throughout the stages of AD progression make astrocytes a promising yet challenging therapeutic target. One promising therapeutic approach is the prevention of pathological reactive astrocyte formation and function. Reports have shown that the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, NLY01, blocks the secretion of microglial-derived cytokines that drive pathological reactive astrocyte formation in disease (Fig. 3). Using NLY01 to decrease pathological reactive astrocyte levels in the 5xFAD and 3xTG mouse models of AD attenuated neuroinflammation, was neuroprotective, and ultimately led to improved spatial learning and memory. While suppressing harmful reactive astrocytes is a promising therapeutic approach, it is also true that reactive astrocytes can be protective or reparative. Promoting the formation and function of beneficial reactive astrocytes is also a promising approach to treat AD. For example, the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) regulates the expression of antioxidant genes, and activation of NRF2 in astrocytes is neuroprotective. Indeed, NRF2 activation reduces astrocyte reactivity and decreases inflammation in the APP NLGF model of AD (Fig. 3). Similarly, a study in the 5xFAD model showed that Nrf2 knockout leads to increased formation of pathological reactive astrocytes, showing that NRF2 normally suppresses pathological astrocytes. The same study also found that pharmacological activation of NRF2 decreased pathological reactive astrocyte levels in 5xFAD mice and improved memory performance. Together, these exciting studies support the development of astrocyte-targeted treatments forthat suppress reactive astrocytes with pathological functions while enhancing reactive astrocytes with beneficial functions.

### A phenotypic screening platform for identifying chemical modulators of astrocyte reactivity [^7cc8c2b5]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Disease, injury and aging induce pathological reactive astrocyte states that contribute to neurodegeneration. Modulating reactive astrocytes therefore represent an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here we describe the development of an astrocyte phenotypic screening platform for identifying chemical modulators of astrocyte reactivity. Leveraging this platform for chemical screening, we identify histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitors as effective suppressors of pathological astrocyte reactivity. We demonstrate that HDAC3 inhibition reduces molecular and functional characteristics of reactive astrocytes in vitro. Transcriptional and chromatin mapping studies show that HDAC3 inhibition disarms pathological astrocyte gene expression and function while promoting the expression of genes associated with beneficial astrocytes. Administration of RGFP966, a small molecule HDAC3 inhibitor, blocks reactive astrocyte formation and promotes neuroprotection in vivo in mice. Collectively, these results establish a platform for discovering modulators of reactive astrocyte states, inform the mechanisms that control astrocyte reactivity and demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of modulating astrocyte reactivity for neurodegenerative diseases.

### Chitinases and chitinase-like proteins as biomarkers in neurologic disorders [^6e802993]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Role of chitinases and CLPs in the CNS

For many years, the CNS was thought to be an immunoprivileged site. Nowadays, it is accepted that the immune response takes place in the brain involving peripheral and local components. Neuroinflammation plays a role not only in primarily inflammatory diseases such as MS but also in nonimmunologic disorders like Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, acute CNS injury, and psychiatric disorders. Neuroinflammation is a physiologic process triggered by a wide range of harmful stimuli and involves a complex interplay of distinct cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, other glial cells, and peripheral components. It is necessary for tissue repair, recovery, and regeneration. Nevertheless, it can be a double-edged sword exerting detrimental effects when dysregulated or chronic. In this regard, chitinases and CLPs have been extensively described as markers of neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis in a wide variety of neurologic disorders. For some of these disorders, chitinases and CLPs have also been proposed as prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Notwithstanding, their specific role in neuroinflammation remains to be elucidated, and it appears to be disease or context specific.

### Tumor-associated reactive astrocytes aid the evolution of immunosuppressive environment in glioblastoma [^2307e0e4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Reactive astrocytes evolve after brain injury, inflammatory and degenerative diseases, whereby they undergo transcriptomic re-programming. In malignant brain tumors, their function and crosstalk to other components of the environment is poorly understood. Here we report a distinct transcriptional phenotype of reactive astrocytes from glioblastoma linked to JAK/STAT pathway activation. Subsequently, we investigate the origin of astrocytic transformation by a microglia loss-of-function model in a human organotypic slice model with injected tumor cells. RNA-seq based gene expression analysis of astrocytes reveals a distinct astrocytic phenotype caused by the coexistence of microglia and astrocytes in the tumor environment, which leads to a large release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGFβ, IL10 and G-CSF. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway shifts the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines towards a pro-inflammatory environment. The complex interaction of astrocytes and microglia cells promotes an immunosuppressive environment, suggesting that tumor-associated astrocytes contribute to anti-inflammatory responses.

### Astrocytes: biology and pathology [^f7696edd]. Acta Neuropathologica (2010). Low credibility.

Molecular markers and proteomic characterization

Immunohistochemical techniques that enable the detection of specific molecular markers at the single-cell level are essential tools for identifying and characterizing cells in healthy and pathological tissue. Expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) has become a prototypical marker for immunohistochemical identification of astrocytes. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize the appropriate uses and limitations of GFAP as an astrocyte marker. GFAP was first isolated as a protein highly concentrated in old demyelinated plaques from multiple sclerosis patients and was then found to be associated immunohistochemically with reactive astrocytes in such plaques and in other pathological contexts. In line with this original mode of identification, GFAP expression can be regarded as a sensitive and reliable marker that labels most, if not all, reactive astrocytes that are responding to CNS injuries (Fig. 3). However, GFAP is not an absolute marker of all non-reactive astrocytes and is often not immunohistochemically detectable in astrocytes in healthy CNS tissue or remote from CNS lesions (Figs. 3 a, 4 a). Although GFAP is immunohistochemically detectable in many astrocytes throughout the healthy CNS, it is clear from double staining with multiple markers (including transgenic reporter proteins) that many mature astrocytes in healthy CNS tissue do not express detectable levels of GFAP and that GFAP expression by astrocytes exhibits both regional and local variability that is dynamically regulated by a large number of inter- and intra-cellular signaling molecules.

### 'Hippocampal innate inflammatory gliosis only' in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy [^ceb56935]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Drug-resistant mesial-temporal lobe epilepsy is a devastating disease with seizure onset in the hippocampal formation. A fraction of hippocampi samples from epilepsy-surgical procedures reveals a peculiar histological pattern referred to as 'gliosis only' with unresolved pathogenesis and enigmatic sequelae. Here, we hypothesize that 'gliosis only' represents a particular syndrome defined by distinct clinical and molecular characteristics.

We curated an in-depth multiparameter integration of systematic clinical, neuropsychological as well as neuropathological analysis from a consecutive cohort of 627 patients, who underwent hippocampectomy for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. All patients underwent either classic anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy. On the basis of their neuropathological exam, patients with hippocampus sclerosis and 'gliosis only' were characterized and compared within the whole cohort and within a subset of matched pairs. Integrated transcriptional analysis was performed to address molecular differences between both groups.

'Gliosis only' revealed demographics, clinical and neuropsychological outcome fundamentally different from hippocampus sclerosis. 'Gliosis only' patients had a significantly later seizure onset (16.3 versus 12.2 years, P = 0.005) and worse neuropsychological outcome after surgery compared to patients with hippocampus sclerosis. Epilepsy was less amendable by surgery in 'gliosis only' patients, resulting in a significantly worse rate of seizure freedom after surgery in this subgroup (43% versus 68%, P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 2.8, confidence interval 1.7–4.7). This finding remained significant after multivariate and matched-pairs analysis. The 'gliosis only' group demonstrated pronounced astrogliosis and lack of significant neuronal degeneration in contrast to characteristic segmental neuron loss and fibrillary astrogliosis in hippocampus sclerosis. RNA-sequencing of gliosis only patients deciphered a distinct transcriptional programme that resembles an innate inflammatory response of reactive astrocytes.

Our data indicate a new temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome for which we suggest the term 'Innate inflammatory gliosis only'. 'Innate inflammatory gliosis only' is characterized by a diffuse gliosis pattern lacking restricted hippocampal focality and is poorly controllable by surgery. Thus, 'innate inflammatory gliosis only' patients need to be clearly identified by presurgical examination paradigms of pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients; surgical treatment of this subgroup should be considered with great precaution. 'Innate inflammatory gliosis only' requires innovative pharmacotreatment strategies.

### AAV6 mediated gsx1 expression in neural stem progenitor cells promotes neurogenesis and restores locomotor function after contusion spinal cord injury [^66e9a002]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

AAV6-Gsx1 reduces reactive gliosis and glial scar formation in the subacute and chronic SCI

The glial scar presents a physical and chemical barrier to regeneration due to a dense astrocyte/fibroblast cell layer, thick secreted ECM, and inhibitory molecules, e.g. CSPGs, collogen. NSPCs play a significant role in scar border formation and contribute glial fate progeny to the astrocyte scar populations. Gsx1 promotes newborn and immature neuronal populations in subacute SCI (Fig. 3). We also identified that these populations differentiate into excitatory and not inhibitory interneurons (Fig. 4).

We next investigated the effect of Gsx1 on reactive gliosis and glial scar formation at 14 dpi and 56 dpi. IHC analysis was used to determine the expression of GFAP (reactive astrocytes) at 14 dpi and CS56 (CSPGs) and GFAP (astrocyte density) in the mature glial scar at 56 dpi. The GFAP signal distribution at 14 dpi was most prominent in the spared neural tissue adjacent to the lesion site, and clearly astrocytes were elongating processes to begin formation of the glial scar (Fig. 5 a). We found that AAV6-Gsx1 (18.32% ​ ± ​2.22; n ​ = ​3) reduced reactive gliosis (GFAP/total cells) in comparison to AAV6-GFP control (36.79% ​ ± ​2.56; n ​ = ​3) at 14 dpi (Fig. 5 b). The CS56 signal distribution at 56 dpi was diffuse and most densely occurring at the scar border at the edge of the lesion core but spread 2 ​mm rostral/caudal to the injury site (Fig. 5 c). AAV6-Gsx1 (1.48% ​ ± ​0.23; n ​ = ​3) reduced CSPG deposition (CS56/total cells) in comparison to AAV6-GFP control (3.40% ​ ± ​0.69; n ​ = ​3) at 56 dpi (Fig. 5 d). The GFAP distribution formed a clear dense border surrounding the injury site with diffuse signal spreading 0.5–1 ​mm away from the injury scar border (Fig. 5 e). AAV6-Gsx1 (7.91% ​ ± ​2.73; n ​ = ​3) also reduced glial scar border astrocyte density (GFAP/total cells) in comparison to AAV6-GFP control (18.86% ​ ± ​2.56; n ​ = ​3) at 56 dpi (Fig. 5 f). Interestingly, LV-Gsx1-GFP did not significantly reduce reactive gliosis (27.77% ​ ± ​3.53; n ​ = ​3) at 14 dpi (Fig. 5 b), CSPGs (1.91% ​ ± ​0.19; n ​ = ​3) (Fig. 5 d) and astrocyte density (10.18% ​ ± ​0.49; n ​ = ​3) (Fig. 5 f) at 56 dpi compared with the AAV6-GFP control, however displayed a trend toward glial scar reduction. These results suggest that AAV6-Gsx1 reduced astrocyte populations during reactive gliosis and scar border maturation. Thus, our Gsx1-transduced NSPCs produced less glial fated cells (Fig. 5), e.g. astrocyte subtypes, and instead promoted differentiation into neuronal subtypes such as excitatory interneurons (Fig. 4).

### Injury-specific factors in the cerebrospinal fluid regulate astrocyte plasticity in the human brain [^cbc397a2]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Functional impairment is the main parameter to treat in any neurological disease, but most often there are few effective treatment options. To overcome this, a promising approach is to improve the function of glial cells, as they are important players not only in the intact brain for synaptic and circuitry functions, but also in pathological conditions where they regulate disease progression and scar formation –. A scar is dysfunctional tissue, and hence minimizing scar formation would improve neurological function. This is the case upon acute injury, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), hemorrhage or stroke where the scar also often causes an epileptogenic region, or in neurodegenerative disease, when glial cells determine the course of the disease (see, for example, ref.). Likewise, in other neurological diseases, such as glioma, the glial reaction can lead to epileptic dysfunction and determine tumor progression. It is therefore essential to understand how to alter the glial environment to foster functional recovery and minimize disease progression. However, our knowledge about heterogeneity of glial response in human pathology is still in its infancy.

Preclinical studies suggest a beneficial role of proliferating astrocytes for functional post-injury recovery by reducing scar formation, helping to reseal the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and restraining monocyte invasion. These proliferating astrocytes comprise a particularly plastic subset with neural stem cell (NSC) properties, upregulating NSC transcription factors after TBI, and forming multipotent neurospheres. They provide a source for neuronal replacement, as shown for example by deletion of Notch signalingor expression of neurogenic factors. However, it is yet unknown if such a population that exerts beneficial functions for brain repair exists in the human brain. Typically, mostly GFAP immunoreactivity is examined in human pathology as it is increased in reactive astrocytes in response to different brain insults, including stroke, TBI, inflammation, tumors, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. In this Article, we explored pathology-specific reactive astrocyte proliferation and acquisition of NSC hallmarks in the human brain.

### Astrocyte biomarkers GFAP and YKL-40 mediate early Alzheimer's disease progression [^fea65988]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We studied how biomarkers of reactive astrogliosis mediate the pathogenic cascade in the earliest Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages.

Methods

We performed path analysis on data from 384 cognitively unimpaired individuals from the ALzheimer and FAmilies (ALFA)+ study using structural equation modeling to quantify the relationships between biomarkers of reactive astrogliosis and the AD pathological cascade.

Results

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ) 42/40 was associated with Aβ aggregation on positron emission tomography (PET) and with CSF p-tau 181, which was in turn directly associated with CSF neurofilament light (NfL). Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mediated the relationship between CSF Aβ 42/40 and Aβ-PET, and CSF YKL-40 partly explained the association between Aβ-PET, p-tau 181, and NfL.

Discussion

Our results suggest that reactive astrogliosis, as indicated by different fluid biomarkers, influences the pathogenic cascade during the preclinical stage of AD. While plasma GFAP mediates the early association between soluble and insoluble Aβ, CSF YKL-40 mediates the latter association between Aβ and downstream Aβ-induced tau pathology and tau-induced neuronal injury.

Highlights

Lower CSF Aβ 42/40 was directly linked to higher plasma GFAP concentrations. Plasma GFAP partially explained the relationship between soluble Aβ and insoluble Aβ. CSF YKL-40 mediated Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation and tau-induced neuronal injury.

### Retinal pathological features and proteome signatures of Alzheimer's disease [^7faca638]. Acta Neuropathologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Unlike GFAP + -gliosis found predominantly in the inner retina, S100β + -gliosis was also apparent in the outer retina, implicating the reactivation of several glial cell populations. In response to brain injury, the GFAP and S100β astrocytic markers display differential expression, with scar-forming GFAP + -astrocytes surrounding lesion sites and S100β typically marking migrating hypertrophic astrocytes at distal regions. A recent study reported lower levels of the synaptic-protective glutamine synthetase (GS) marker and GFAP + glial cells in the retinas of AD patients compared to controls. In the current study, we found upregulation in GFAP and S100β markers of reactive astrocytes and Müller glial cells in the retinas of MCI and AD patients. Yet, our findings are consistent with other reports showing increases in the expression of these markers in the brains of AD patients and increases in GFAP + gliosis in AD retinas, suggesting that neuroinflammation may be a common feature of AD pathology in both the brain and retina. Future studies are warranted to explore the range of reactive astrocyte populations as well as Müller glia activation states and their relationships to AD pathophysiological processes in the retina.

### Interaction of reactive astrocytes with type I collagen induces astrocytic scar formation through the integrin-N-cadherin pathway after spinal cord injury [^572df792]. Nature Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) injury transforms naive astrocytes into reactive astrocytes, which eventually become scar-forming astrocytes that can impair axonal regeneration and functional recovery. This sequential phenotypic change, known as reactive astrogliosis, has long been considered unidirectional and irreversible. However, we report here that reactive astrocytes isolated from injured spinal cord reverted in retrograde to naive astrocytes when transplanted into a naive spinal cord, whereas they formed astrocytic scars when transplanted into injured spinal cord, indicating the environment-dependent plasticity of reactive astrogliosis. We also found that type I collagen was highly expressed in the spinal cord during the scar-forming phase and induced astrocytic scar formation via the integrin-N-cadherin pathway. In a mouse model of spinal cord injury, pharmacological blockade of reactive astrocyte-type I collagen interaction prevented astrocytic scar formation, thereby leading to improved axonal regrowth and better functional outcomes. Our findings reveal environmental cues regulating astrocytic fate decisions, thereby providing a potential therapeutic target for CNS injury.

### Tissue and cellular rigidity and mechanosensitive signaling activation in alexander disease [^0e23d377]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The mechanistic and therapeutic implications of our work may extend beyond Alexander disease. Upregulation of GFAP is a common finding in diverse brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and many other disorders characterized by clinically significant tissue damage. Expansion of astrocyte cell bodies and processes by abundant eosinophilic GFAP protein is the neuropathological hallmark of a process classically termed "reactive gliosis," but increasingly recognized as functionally significant. Our findings suggest that the morphological changes of gliosis may in some cases denote an alteration in mechanotransduction signaling that contributes actively to dysfunction and death of neurons and other brain cells. Although, the generalizability of our findings will require further experimental investigation, targeting the mechanotransduction pathways we outline here therapeutically may be applicable to other brain disorders.

### WT1 is not a reliable marker to distinguish reactive from neoplastic astrocyte populations in the central nervous system [^f446f8d5]. Brain Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

A diagnostic difficulty in neuropathology practice is distinguishing reactive from neoplastic astrocyte populations. This is particularly true in small biopsy samples that lack evidence of increased cellularity or mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, or necrosis. We performed the current study to validate the previously reported finding that in the central nervous system, the expression of WT1 is limited to neoplastic astrocytes. We retrospectively studied WT1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 100 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue samples consisting of 3 normal control tissues, 44 cases of reactive gliosis, 49 gliomas and 4 lesions suspicious for glioma. In normal human cortex, WT1 staining was restricted to vascular endothelium. Most cases of reactive gliosis (82%) showed at least focal WT1 positivity, and analysis of specimens with electrode monitoring lesions showed an inverse relationship between WT1 expression intensity and the number of days from electrode placement to tissue resection. All glioma samples (100%) and all cases suspicious for glioma (100%) showed at least focal WT1 positivity. Our results likely differ from those in the prior report because of differences in tissue fixation and IHC methodology. Thus, our findings indicate that WT1 expression alone is not a reliable feature to distinguish reactive from neoplastic astrocytes.

### Astrocytes: biology and pathology [^8056d2f5]. Acta Neuropathologica (2010). Low credibility.

Stroke and cerebrovascular disease

Brain parenchyma and the blood vessels that supply it are not, as they once were, viewed as separate 'compartments' within the CNS. Rather, the concept of the 'neurovascular unit' takes an integrated view of a given brain parenchymal blood vessel and the glial elements that surround it. Cellular elements in the vessel wall influence surrounding CNS parenchyma, just as the surrounding parenchymal elements affect vascular morphology and function. The 'neurovascular unit' idea becomes especially important when considering functional recovery after an ischemic infarct or 'stroke'.

From a practical diagnostic perspective, the appearance of astrocytes around a region of cystic encephalomalacia within brain that has resulted from an ischemic infarct or hemorrhage can be used to 'date' such a lesion (i.e. estimate how long it occurred prior to death), though not very accurately. The sequence of cellular events in an ischemic infarct progresses from intense neuronal eosinophilia (hours to 1–2 days after the insult), to influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (variable intensity, but usually within the same time frame), then ingress of macrophages/histiocytes (from blood or activated resident microglia) as liquefactive necrosis occurs (beginning 3–5 days after the infarct), and finally proliferation of an abundance of astrocytes that marginate and form a scar (Fig. 4 d) along the borders of an infarct from about 7–10 days after ischemia and then persist for life of the patient (Fig. 5). None of these time frames are precise, particularly in aged individuals, where the process of aging, as well as the exposure to other conditions, may influence the level of reactive astrogliosis that is observed. 'Chronic cystic infarcts' are usually associated with astrocytic gliosis, and a characteristic finding in a cortical cystic infarct is the preservation of the relatively paucicellular molecular layer overlying it and located immediately beneath the meninges, which then develops a dense collection of astrocytes, usually with gemistocytic phenotype. Astrocytic processes usually traverse the cystic cavity left by the death of brain tissue, in a delicate meshwork, with persistence of foamy histiocytes among the glial fibers.

### Growing cyst-like white matter lesions in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^4263e83a]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease with prominent neurocutaneous manifestations. The most common intracranial imaging finding of NF1 on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the high-signal intensity foci without a mass effect or growth in size.

Patient Description

We describe two children with NF1 in whom brain MRI showed growing cystic lesions and adjacent white matter signal abnormalities, which were confirmed as non-neoplastic cystic degeneration and reactive gliosis.

Conclusion

Growing cyst-like white matter lesions can be seen on serial brain MRI in children with NF1. Reactive gliosis with cystic degeneration could be a pathogenic basis of these cystic lesions.

### Neuroglia in cognitive reserve [^0453536a]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroglial cells (which, in the CNS are represented by astroglia, oligodendroglia, and microglia) are endowed with intricate molecular cascades controlling the nervous tissue environment in health and responding to the disease conditions through mounting defensive responses. Thus neuroglia support physiological neuroplasticity at multiple levels; neuroglial cells also define the progression and outcome of all neurological diseases. Similarly, neuroglia, acting through the cell-specific mechanisms, contribute and, to a large extent, define cognitive reserve (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Neuroglia contribution to the cognitive reserve.

Neuroglial cells are fundamental for all aspects of cognitive reserve. Brain reserve. Neuroglia working in concert with neurones define the brain structure and shapes its cytoarchitecture. Radial glia (prenatally) and stem radial astrocytes (postnatally) provide for neurogenesis. Astrocytes, through secretion of multiple factors such as trombospondins, hevins, glypicans, and cholesterol stimulate synaptogenesis, control synaptic maturation, and provide material for the adaptive remodelling of neuronal membranes. Microglia thorough synaptic pruning and trogocytosis shape synaptically connected neuronal ensembles, while oligodendroglial cells support connectome and provide for activity-dependent life-long myelination. Brain maintenance and brain resilience. Neuroglial cells through multiple molecular cascades support CNS homeostasis and define brain resilience through numerous protective pathways. Brain compensation. Neuroglia are central element of brain defense and regeneration; reactive glial cells erect perilesional barriers, remove pathogens and cellular debris, and orchestrate regeneration.

Neuroglia and the brain reserve

As mentioned before, the brain reserve is defined by a number of neurones and interneuronal connections formed by axonal projections (the connectome) and synapses. All these are regulated by neuroglia. Embryonic neurogenesis is the function of radial glia, whereas adult neurogenesis is supported by radial stem astrocytes (also known as neural stem cells, but exhibiting all major properties of astroglia). Synaptic connectivity is regulated by astrocytes, which secrete numerous factors regulating synaptogenesis, synaptic maturation, and synaptic extinction, as well as by microglia, which remove redundant, silent or malfunctional synapses through synaptic pruning, thus shaping neuronal ensembles. Brain-wide connectome is supported by oligodendroglia, which is also responsible for activity-dependent myelination. White matter occupies ~50% of the adult human brain, in comparison with ~10% in rodents, and is one of the main determinants of the human brain computing power and cognitive abilities.

### Glial cell response and microthrombosis in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients: an autopsy study [^7102477a]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The astrocytic response has not been studied before in aSAH human postmortem brain tissue. This probably results from the very limited availability of such tissue samples. Autopsy is often not done in aSAH patients because the cause of death is known from premortem brain imaging. Instead, the glial response has been extensively studied in experimental models of SAH. These studies showed diffuse microglial and astrocyte activation after experimental SAH. Following SAH, the morphology of microglia changes to an activated state, as their processes become shorter. In response to the hemorrhage, activated microglia will phagocytose blood components and release pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce an immune response. Inhibition of microglia activation reduced neuronal cell death in experimental SAH, but the exact mechanism of neuronal injury is unknown. Astrocytes respond to SAH in experimental studies by a multicellular process called reactive gliosis, which in turn can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the brain with both beneficial as well as detrimental effects. Furthermore, activated astrocytes are involved in blood–brain disruption, the production of reactive oxygen species, and cell death after experimental aSAH.

### Vitamin D reduces GABA-positive astrocytes in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease [^5218e109]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Reactive astrocytes have been increasingly recognized for their association with dementia and AD. Astrocytes, a subtype of glial cells, undergo morphological and functional changes in response to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury, transforming reactive astrocytes. Emerging evidence suggests that the neurotoxicity of reactive astrocytes may contribute to the progression of AD by promoting neuroinflammation, disrupting synaptic function, and impairing neuronal survival. Moreover, these cells have been implicated in the formation and deposition of Aβ plaques, a hallmark of AD pathology. Reactive astrocytes have been implicated in generating more tonic GABA release by increased MAO-B gene expression in AD models. GABA has been found to be elevated in reactive astrocytes, contributing to cognitive decline and neuronal dysfunction in AD. GABA released from reactive astrocytes activates neuronal GABA A receptors, which inhibit synaptic release. Tonic GABA release from reactive astrocytes reduces the spike probability at the synapse of the hippocampus, impairing synaptic plasticity and memory. Vitamin D supplementation indicates decreased mRNA levels of MAO-B and improved memory functions in AD model mice, suggesting the therapeutic effects of vitamin D by reducing neurotoxic reactive astrogliosis. In the hippocampus, we observed an increase in GABA-positive reactive astrocytes in vitamin D-deficient mice and a decrease in GABA-positive reactive astrocytes in vitamin D-supplemented mice. These findings suggested that vitamin D levels have a crucial role in the hippocampal-dependent memory function of AD model mice.

Recent studies highlight reactive astrocytes as a new target for AD treatment, with MAO-B inhibitors proposed as potential therapeutic agents targeting these cells. We discovered that vitamin D, as a nutritional supplement, may also suppress reactive astrogliosis in AD, functioning similarly to MAO-B inhibitors. This finding could advocate for nutritional interventions using vitamin D in AD treatment. However, the optimal dose of vitamin D in AD has not yet been established. Although vitamin D levels are recommended to be maintained between the lowest level (10 ng/ml) and toxic level (150 ng/ml), additional research and clinical trials are needed to determine the precise dosage of vitamin D that provides therapeutic benefits in AD. Provided that these further investigations are conducted, our study offers a rationale for pursuing clinical improvements in AD through vitamin D supplementation within the normal range.

The evidence reviewed suggests that astroglial‐mediated inflammation demonstrate both beneficial and detrimental properties. Classification of A1 and A2 is over simplistic as their function extends beyond pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory properties. The astrocytes are heterogeneous and dynamic, and their activation varies based on different pathological contexts and during disease trajectory. The astroglial response is dependent on individual susceptibility and influenced by prior astroglial priming. Selective modulation (promotion) of anti‐inflammatory phenotype in the early stage and selective modulation (inhibition) of proinflammatory phenotype may need to be deployed in the early and late‐stage neurodegenerative diseases. This may have to be in combination with strategies targeting neuroinflammation in addition to inhibiting the aggregation and pathogenicity of β‐pleated sheet structures.

### Loss of mtDNA activates astrocytes and leads to spongiotic encephalopathy [^43e36388]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Loss of mtDNA maintenance activates astrocytes

Embryonic lethality of the full TwKO predicted progressive death of the targeted neurons or astrocytes. Unexpectedly, however, mtDNA depletion in astrocytes caused a remarkable increase of GFAP-positive cells with reactive astrocyte morphology in the targeted brain regions (Fig. 3a, b). Such morphology is typical for disease-related reactive gliosis. Activation was progressive, starting at 2–3 months of age (absent at the age of 1 month, Supplementary Fig. 4b), peaking in the cortex at terminal stage. The TwKO neuro showed only modestly increased cortical astrogliosis at the terminal stage, with increased number of GFAP-positive cells of stellar morphology in cortex (Fig. 3a, b). Part of the population of reactive astrocytes in TwKO astro also co-expressed nestin, another marker of reactive gliosis. Nestin-positive cells are not found in the cortex of controls or TwKO neuro (Fig. 3c). The amount of GFAP + Nestin + double-positive cells was progressive (< 30% at the age of 3–4 months, and > 50% at 5–6 months). We then addressed the question, whether the remarkable number of activated astrocytes was due to their proliferation. In all three genotypes we found rare KI67-positive cells, marking cell division, but not co-localizing in the nuclei of the GFAP-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Furthermore, most of the astrocytes in the mouse cortex are Aldhl1-positive, and in TwKO astro they showed slightly swollen morphology, but their number was not changed (Fig. 3d). These data imply that the gliosis is due to astrocytes activated on site, but not their proliferation.

### Type I interferon inhibits astrocytic gliosis and promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury by deactivation of the MEK / ERK pathway [^e8a73057]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2009). Low credibility.

Formation of a glial scar is one of the major obstacles to axonal growth after injury to the adult CNS. In this study, we have addressed this issue by focusing on reactive astrocytes in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI). First, we attempted to identify profile changes in the expression of astrocytic gliosis 10 days after injury by using gliosis-specific microdissection, genome-wide microarray, and MetaCore(trade mark) pathway analysis. This systematic data processing revealed many intriguing activated pathways. However, considering that proliferation/mitosis is one of the most prominent features of reactive astrocytes, we focused on the functional role of the Ras-MEK-ERK signaling cascades in reactive astrocytes. SCI-induced proliferation of reactive astrocytes in the lesion is in accordance with the increase in the expression and phosphorylation of MEK-ERK. Second, to reduce reactive gliosis after SCI, liposomes containing the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene were administered locally 30 min after injury. At 14 days after this treatment, GFAP-positive intensity and MEK-ERK phosphorylation at the lesion were reduced. In the animals receiving the IFN-beta gene, significant recovery of neurobehavior and parameters of electrophysiology following SCI was revealed by assessments of rotarod performance and improvements in the Basso Mouse Scale for locomotion and cortical motor-evoked potentials. SCI resulted in the degeneration of biotinylated dextran amine-labeled descending corticospinal tract axons, but the IFN-beta gene delivery induced regrowth of a large number of corticospinal tract axons. These results suggest that liposome-mediated IFN-beta gene delivery inhibits glial scar formation after SCI and promotes functional recovery.

### RhoA drives actin compaction to restrict axon regeneration and astrocyte reactivity after CNS injury [^2a96b7db]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

An inhibitory extracellular milieu and neuron-intrinsic processes prevent axons from regenerating in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Here we show how the two aspects are interwoven. Genetic loss-of-function experiments determine that the small GTPase RhoA relays extracellular inhibitory signals to the cytoskeleton by adapting mechanisms set in place during neuronal polarization. In response to extracellular inhibitors, neuronal RhoA restricts axon regeneration by activating myosin II to compact actin and, thereby, restrain microtubule protrusion. However, astrocytic RhoA restricts injury-induced astrogliosis through myosin II independent of microtubules by activating Yes-activated protein (YAP) signaling. Cell-type-specific deletion in spinal-cord-injured mice shows that neuronal RhoA activation prevents axon regeneration, whereas astrocytic RhoA is beneficial for regenerating axons. These data demonstrate how extracellular inhibitors regulate axon regeneration, shed light on the capacity of reactive astrocytes to be growth inhibitory after CNS injury, and reveal cell-specific RhoA targeting as a promising therapeutic avenue.

Astrocyte heterogeneity

The increasing awareness of the complexity, importance, and diversity of astrocyte functions is giving rise to a growing interest in the potential for specialization and heterogeneity among astrocytes. The notion of astrocyte heterogeneity is not new. Numerous anatomical distinctions have long been recognized among gray (protoplasmic) and white (fibrous) matter astrocytes in different CNS regions, but these have long been over looked or discounted. In addition, there is a long-standing recognition of an extended family of astroglial cells that share similarities with, but also exhibit differences to, protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes, including Müller glia in the retina, Bergmann glia of the cerebellum, tanycytes at the base of the third ventricle, pituicytes in the neurohypophysis, cribrosocytes at the optic nerve head, and others. These different cell types express various astrocyte-related molecules such as GFAP, S100β, glutamine synthetase and others, and exert functions similar to astrocytes in manners specialized to their locations. In addition, these different types of astroglial cells share with astrocytes the ability to become reactive in response to CNS insults and these cells have the potential to play important roles in pathological changes in their specific locations as discussed below. As regards protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes, various lines of evidence suggest that there is considerable molecular, structural, and potentially functional diversity of astrocytes at both the regional and local levels, but such investigations are at an early stage. In this context it is interesting to note that the number, complexity, and diversity of astroglial cells associated with neurons has increased considerably with evolution, such that the ratio of astrocytes to neurons is 1:6 in worms, 1:3 in rodent cortex, and 1.4:1 in human cortex, implying that astrocyte roles increase in importance with sophistication of neural tissue. The human cerebral neocortex contains multiple subtypes of astrocytes, including types that do not appear to exist in rodent cortex. As molecular markers become more sophisticated, it seems likely that astrocytes will be revealed to be considerably more heterogeneous than thus far imagined. Such information is likely to impact on concepts about astrocyte roles in both health and disease.

### The neurovasculome: key roles in brain health and cognitive impairment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1aa1780c]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Astrocyte and pericyte alterations associated with white matter lesions — imaging and postmortem studies highlight changes in astrocytes and pericytes across neurological conditions linked to WMLs and cognitive dysfunction. Astrocytic clasmatodendrosis may be seen, but its contribution to cognitive dysfunction in disorders with WMLs such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. Earlier astrocyte changes, including swollen cell bodies, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and amoeboid shape, indicate dysfunction and loss of homeostatic support for surrounding WM. Experimental studies suggest reactive astrocytes participate in neuroinflammation and Aβ production in AD models. In age-related dementias, including poststroke dementia, capillary pericytes are decreased in the deep WM but not the overlying cortex. Overall, disrupted gliovascular and neurovascular interactions with compensatory microvascular remodeling are proposed as a substrate for a disconnection syndrome manifesting as cognitive impairment and dementia in individuals with WMLs.

4.1 Potential mechanisms underlying reduced diffusivities and FW in mild OSA

A clear understanding of what DTI metrics measure is necessary to infer underlying pathophysiological processes in OSA, and that insight comes mostly from animal or human studies with histopathology measurements. Reduced RD reflects pathological processes such as the separation of myelin sheaths (Shereen et al. 2011). Reduced AD is observed with beaded or fragmented axons (Winklewski et al. 2018). In addition to early axonal and myelin damage, decreased RD and AD, as well as MD, can be observed with processes that limit water movement, including reactive gliosis and inflammatory cellular infiltration, and cytotoxic edema (increased intracellular water) (Anderova et al. 2011; Boretius et al. 2012; Winklewski et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2012). Thus, all these processes could underlie lower white matter diffusivities observed in our OSA groups, especially in those with mild OSA. Reduced FW fraction in mild OSA supports the hypothesis that intracellular cytotoxic edema and/or reactive gliosis are ongoing. Indeed, lower extracellular water fraction could be explained both by the presence of more water inside the cells (cytotoxic edema) and increased cell density (reactive gliosis).

### Ependymoma and intraparenchymal calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the neural axis: incidental collision or unique reactive phenomenon? [^40258f92]. Acta Neuropathologica (2008). Low credibility.

The so-called "calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the neural axis" is a rare tumefactive lesion presumed to be reactive in nature. To our knowledge, association with a true neoplasm has not been previously reported. We recently encountered the case of a 67-year-old woman who underwent resection of an incidentally discovered cerebellar cystic mass with a distinct, calcified component. Histology demonstrated a partially ossified, lobulated, chondrocalcific lesion surrounded by chronic inflammation, spindle to epithelioid cells, and occasional multinucleated giant cells-all features of calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the neural axis. A low-grade ependymoma associated with marked piloid gliosis was found contiguous to the lesion. The unique combination of an ependymoma with marked reactive gliosis and a calcifying pseudoneoplasm supports the reactive nature of the latter.

Diagnosis and relevance of astrocyte proliferation

Here we discovered disruption of BBB integrity as a common trigger for the proliferation of human parenchymal astrocytes and the emergence of NSC-like cells. Despite the shared histopathological characteristics, such as cytoskeletal hypertrophy and GFAP upregulation, astrocytes activated by compression, infection or hyperexcitation failed to initiate a proliferative program. This finding fits well with previous data in mice.

But why is it important to know about astrocyte proliferation triggered by cerebral hemorrhage? Firstly, more and more case reports link previous TBI with increased rates of glioma emergence (for review see ref.), and proliferating astrocytes are a likely origin for this. Also epilepsy or mood disorders following stroke or TBI have been linked to astroglia abnormalities, as disease progression in Alzheimer's diseaseor chronic pain. Indeed, proliferating astrocytes have specific molecular properties, as highlighted in previous preclinical mouse models, and here by GAL3 expression. Moreover, proliferating astrocytes are predominantly located at the BVs, and influence the invasion of monocytes and scar formation. Conversely, the scar is what causes new epileptic foci due to lack of inhibition and reduced glutamate transporters. Thus, identifying the presence of this specific functional astrocyte subtype in an entire group of very frequent brain pathologies is a major step forward towards exploiting their beneficial roles or stratifying the glial reactivity in relation to disease progression.

### Functions of optic nerve glia: axoglial signalling in physiology and pathology [^b573aa39]. Eye (2004). Low credibility.

An early concept of glial function envisaged them as passive and unexcitable structural elements, much like the connective tissues of organs in the periphery. It is now known that glia have a widespread range of physiological roles and react to all forms of pathological insult. This paper reviews the major functions of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, the main types of glia in the optic nerve, and examines novel NG2-glia, otherwise known as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). The major function of oligodendrocytes is to produce the myelin sheaths that insulate CNS axons, but they also have important roles in the establishment of nodes of Ranvier, the sites of action potential propagation, and axonal integrity. Astrocytes have multiple physiological and pathological functions, including potassium homeostasis and metabolism, and reactive astrogliosis in response to CNS insults. The bulk of NG2-glia are postmitotic complex cells, distinct from OPCs, and respond to any insult to the CNS by a rapid and stereotypic injury response. This may be their primary unction, but NG2-glia, or a subpopulation of NG2-expressing adult OPCs, also provide remyelinating oligodendrocytes following demyelination. Oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and NG2-glia all contact axons at nodes of Ranvier and respond to glutamate, ATP, and potassium released during axonal electrical activity. Glutamate and ATP evoke calcium signalling in optic nerve glia and have dual roles in physiology and pathology, coupling glial functions to axonal activity during normal activity, but enhanced activation induces an injury response, as seen following injury, demyelination, and ischaemia.

### Clinical and neuropathological characteristics of hippocampal sclerosis: a community-based study… [^ded796e4]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Gliosis within individual cases demonstrated acutely reactive gemistocytic glia in some regions of the CA-1 and chronic gliosis within other regions of CA-1 in the same hippocampal sclerosis case. Background. Hippocampal sclerosis is a neuropathologic finding characterized by neuronal loss and gliosis in the CA-1 and subiculum of the hippocampus. Previous studies of HS have shown that this is a common postmortem finding in elderly subjects with dementia. However, these studies were from selected samples and therefore are not necessarily representative of patients seen in the general medical community. The clinical signs and symptoms of HS are generally quite similar to those seen in AD, with recent memory loss being prominent. There is evidence that, similar to AD, dementia in HS may progress over time. 1–4, 7, 8 However, behavioral disturbances and subtle neuropsychologic deficits may differentiate these patients from those with AD.

2, 7–11 Pathologically, HS is generally defined by the severe loss of neurons and concomitant gliosis in the CA-1 and subiculum region, with relative sparing of other hippocampal fields. One HS case was homozygous for APOE ϵ4. Interestingly, this patient did not manifest significant neuropathologic changes of AD. This included marked differences in severity of gliosis between affected and unaffected regions. Also notable was evidence of acute and chronic gliosis within the HS lesions of the same patient. Subicular neuronal loss and gliosis usually coexisted with HS pathologic change in CA-1, although there were 3 cases with CA-1 involvement without subicular changes, at the same level, and 1 case with subicular neuronal loss and gliosis without CA-1 change.

In 3 cases, neuronal loss and gliosis extended into the parahippocampal and inferior temporal gyri. This latter change was always associated with severe neuronal loss in the CA-1 and subiculum. Occasionally, there also appeared to be an extension of neuronal loss into the CA-2 regions.

Astrocytes

Astrocytes derive from the neuroectoderm lineage and are the most abundant cells in the CNS parenchyma playing an essential role in the tripartite synapse. In addition to participating in the fine tuning of synaptic transmission, structural support, glutamate uptake, metabolism of neurotransmitters, regulation of extracellular pH and K + levels, synaptic pruning, and clearance of debris and dead cells, astrocytes are also of major importance for the maintenance of the BBB.

In the 21 st century, astrocytes are increasingly viewed as having a pivotal role in neuroinflammation and as critical contributors to CNS pathologies. Indeed, astrocytes also become reactive in response to noxious stimuli and, together with microglia, are important players in neuroinflammatory processes influencing aspects of inflammation and immune reactivity highly relevant to neurological diseases.

Reactive astrogliosis is a graded and non-homogeneous response that fluctuates according to the type, severity, time, and duration of the insult. It is defined as the process whereby astrocytes undergo changes in transcriptional regulation, as well as biochemical, morphological, metabolic, and physiological remodeling, leading to gain of new function(s) or loss/upregulation of homeostatic ones.

Reactive astrocytes undergo this remodeling in response to diverse pathologies and have the capacity to adopt distinct state(s), characterized by a specific molecular profile, specific functions, and distinct impact on diseases. The spectrum of reactive astrocytes was recently considered to be between two extreme states: the neurotoxic A1, induced by neuroinflammatory insults, and the neuroprotective A2, associated with ischemia. However, these two distinct reactive states most likely co-exist, constituting a part of a heterogeneous population that contain both. Thus, reactive astrogliosis can have a pro-inflammatory or an anti-inflammatory outcome, depending on the signaling pathways that prevail. Reactive astrogliosis and scar formation are essential for confining CNS inflammation to the lesion site. However, under pathological conditions, reactive astrocytes are known to aggravate and perpetuate inflammatory responses, producing an exacerbated amount of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, it was shown that microglia can induce the neurotoxic phenotype in astrocytes through the secretion of three cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-1α, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, and Complement component 1q), which prompts the hypothesis that astrocytes are indeed crucial in neuroinflammatory processes. However, whether astrocytes can directly respond to an insult, or if they always require a priming by microglia is still debated.

### Blockage of STAT3 during epileptogenesis prevents GABAergic loss and imprinting of the epileptic state [^0aa188a0]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Here we focused on the role of STAT3 in the development of epilepsy and neuroinflammation. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is known to be rapidly activated in the hippocampus after status epilepticus. Previous reports have linked STAT3 activation to epileptogenesis, suggesting that STAT3 remains activated for up to 1 month, maintaining and aggravating the effect of astrogliosis.STAT3 could thus promote spontaneous seizures by contributing to reactive gliosis triggered by the initial event. STAT3 can be pharmacologically blocked by different drugs such as Pyridone or WP1066. It was shown that STAT3 blocked by WP1066 lowered the number of spontaneous seizures in a rat pilocarpine model of epilepsy reducing the severity of subsequent seizures.

We herein extend some of these results, and show that inhibition of STAT3 with WP1066 not only reduced the effect of epilepsy on neuronal circuit functionality, but this strategy also precisely preserved the topology of the circuit. We show that the alteration of the neuronal circuits was accompanied by topological changes such as the loss of GABAergic cells. We observed that the number of GABAergic cells decreased in comparison to control conditions at all time points. Interestingly, this loss of GABAergic cells has been shown in in vivo TLE induced models by pilocarpine. The role of GABAergic neurons in the development and prevalence of epilepsy has been extensively studied in animal models, demonstrating that GABAergic interneuron loss can change the excitation/inhibition balance. In this work, we have shown for the very first time that STAT3 blockage reduces GABAergic cell loss in an in vitro model of epilepsy.

Neuroinflammation is another hallmark of epilepsy; therefore, we resorted to analyse the inflammatory profile of the organotypic slices. Gliosis includes both reactive astrocytes and reactive microglia, as astrocytes and microglia are interconnected such that the activity of one cell type affects the activity of the other. Here, gliosis was measured by the area occupied by astrocytes and microglia. Our results confirm previous results in which STAT3 inhibition reduced GFAP and Iba1 overexpression after epilepsy. Thus, we have shown that STAT3 inhibition could affect the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the epileptogenic process.

Our data suggest that the JAK/STAT inhibition at the onset of the epileptic event could modify the progress of epilepsy. Inhibition of this pathway may open up novel therapeutic possibilities as a complement to other commonly used anticonvulsant drugs.

### Cerebral white matter diffusion properties and free-water with obstructive sleep apnea severity in older adults [^eebe1bab]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypoxemia in OSA may explain the presence of these pathological processes. Although we did not observe group differences between mild OSA and controls for hypoxemia measures, lower diffusivities and FW fraction correlated with more oxygen desaturation in those with an AHI ≤ 15. The acute stage following cerebral hypoxia/ischemia in animal models is characterized by lower diffusivities (MD, RD, AD) as well as histologic evidence of cytotoxic edema, lower extracellular water fraction, and reactive gliosis (Anderova et al. 2011; Pitkonen et al. 2012; Shereen et al. 2011). Interestingly, cytotoxic edema, increased total water content, and reactive gliosis were also observed in animal models of OSA (Aviles‐Reyes et al. 2010; Baronio et al. 2013). Cerebral swelling was reported in the case of edema due to hypoxia in altitude (Kallenberg et al. 2007; Sagoo et al. 2017). Moreover, in a previous study by our group, we found that nocturnal hypoxia values were associated with multiple regions of gray matter hypertrophy and thickening that we attributed to edema and/or reactive gliosis (Baril et al. 2017). Overall, OSA‐related hypoxia could cause cytotoxic edema and reactive gliosis that can be captured in vivo through a pattern of lower white matter diffusivities as well as lower FW fraction.

4.2 Potential biphasic relationship between OSA severity and white matter diffusion properties

Our study also found that altered white matter diffusion in moderate to severe OSA cases compared with controls was considerably less extensive than what was observed in mild OSA. Moderate to severe OSA individuals were especially heterogeneous in their white matter properties, and we hypothesize that this level of OSA severity may lead to diverse pathological responses that blurred white matter diffusion properties. In fact, cytotoxic edema, reactive gliosis, vasogenic edema, and cellular loss may have been present concomitantly with different intensities across participants, and therefore could have led to a greater variability in the moderate to severe OSA group. Because some of these pathological responses are known to decrease water diffusivity (cytotoxic edema, reactive gliosis) while other potentially more severe responses are known to increase water diffusivity (vasogenic edema, cellular loss), their concomitant presence might explain a transient apparent normalization of DTI metrics. Consistently, in ischemic conditions, normal diffusivity was observed with a large array of competing pathological mechanisms (Li et al. 2002). Further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms explaining white matter changes in both mild OSA and moderate to severe OSA.

Proteomics reveals role of C3 in regulating mTORC1 at peak EAE

To explore whether these findings could be validated outside of transcriptomics, we performed a full proteomic and phospho-proteomic experiment on optic nerves of C3KO and WT mice at the peak of EAE. Specifically, we took 7 WT and 7 C3KO mice that were EAE score-matched as well as 2 naïve WT and 2 naïve C3KO mice to serve as non-disease controls, and we utilized mass spectrometry to evaluate relative protein and phosphorylation site abundance across all samples. While our lab has previously published that C3KO does not affect global inflammation in the EAE model, we ensured our animals were matched in terms of their EAE scores to ensure that we were comparing animals that had similar inflammatory burden (EAE disease score at day 16 reflects the amount of acute-stage inflammation in the spinal cord).

Using an unsupervised clustering of publicly available datasets of astrocytes from different CNS diseases and our transcriptional data, we were able to align our samples to known reactive subtypes. The transcriptional profile of HS clustered within a non-inflammatory reactive state similar to reactive astrocytes found in stroke or glial tumour samples. In contrast, the histopathological 'gliosis only' showed astrocytes state similar to those observed in partially inflammatory diseases (Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Apparent diffusion coefficient in vasogenic edema and reactive astrogliosis [^e3372531]. Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Distinguishing between vasogenic edema and reactive astrogliosis may be difficult in some instances. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps can be used to differentiate these two types of changes.

Methods

The study population included 11 patients with perilesional vasogenic edema and 11 patients with gliosis examined with conventional MR imaging and DW imaging. The signal intensities of conventional pulse sequences and ADC values were calculated in regions of interest placed in the hyperintense edematous or gliotic regions and compared with those of normal-appearing white matter. Signal intensity ratios and ADC values in gliosis were compared with those in vasogenic edema using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

Results

While considerable overlap was present for signal intensity ratios on conventional MR images, areas of gliosis demonstrated significantly higher ADC values (1.76 ± 0.09 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) than areas of vasogenic edema (1.35 ± 0.06 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P < 0.0001) without overlap.

Conclusion

ADC values are helpful in differentiating reactive gliosis from vasogenic edema.
