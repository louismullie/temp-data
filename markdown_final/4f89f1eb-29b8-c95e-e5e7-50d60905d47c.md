## Question

A 52-year-old woman is referred to your clinic after an incidental finding of a 4 cm simple hepatic cyst on abdominal ultrasound performed for non-specific abdominal discomfort. She is currently asymptomatic, with no history of abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, or weight loss. Her liver function tests are normal. She is concerned about the cyst and asks whether she needs regular follow-up imaging to monitor for changes.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate management regarding surveillance imaging for this patient's simple hepatic cyst?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 4 cm simple hepatic cyst found incidentally in an asymptomatic 52-year-old woman with normal liver tests requires routine surveillance imaging, and if not, what the evidence-based management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and ensuring this is truly a simple cyst. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (EASL 2022, ACG 2024) say about surveillance in asymptomatic simple cysts. Next, I will consider whether cyst size changes the recommendation. After that, I need to check for any exceptions or red flags that would warrant further imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and counseling points, including what to do if symptoms develop.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification. A simple hepatic cyst on ultrasound is typically thin-walled, anechoic with posterior acoustic enhancement, and lacks internal septations, mural nodules, calcifications, or daughter cysts; ultrasound has about 90% sensitivity and specificity for this diagnosis, which supports confident characterization in most cases [^06e65b28]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if the original ultrasound report noted any atypical features, I should double-check and, if present, escalate to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to exclude complex cystic pathology before deciding on surveillance needs [^b37b903d] [^be6e2218].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on surveillance. The EASL 2022 guideline explicitly recommends not monitoring asymptomatic patients with simple hepatic cysts or peribiliary cysts, which directly addresses this scenario [^dc0c5d04] [^469a162e]. The ACG 2024 guideline likewise recommends expectant management without routine surveillance or intervention for asymptomatic simple hepatic cysts, regardless of size, which reinforces the same principle [^48786489] [^3e48db8a]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence — ACG labels this a strong recommendation with low-quality evidence, reflecting consensus that surveillance does not improve outcomes in this setting [^48786489].

> I will now examine whether cyst size alters management. Initially, I wondered if a 4 cm cyst might be "too large" to ignore, but hold on, I should verify — both EASL and ACG state that size alone does not mandate surveillance in asymptomatic simple cysts, and there is no size threshold in these guidelines that triggers routine follow-up imaging for simple cysts without symptoms or complex features [^dc0c5d04] [^48786489]. Let me reconsider: the key discriminator is not diameter but the presence of symptoms or atypical imaging features, so 4 cm is not an indication for surveillance by itself [^48786489].

> Next, I should review exceptions that would change management. If the ultrasound showed septations, mural thickening or nodularity, calcifications, heterogeneity, or daughter cysts, I should obtain CT or MRI to evaluate for complex cystic disease such as mucinous cystic neoplasm or hydatid disease, because these carry different risks and may require intervention or surveillance strategies [^b37b903d] [^be6e2218]. But wait, what if the patient develops new symptoms? If she experiences pain, early satiety, jaundice, or signs of infection, then ultrasound is the appropriate first step to reassess for complications or interval change, and management would pivot based on those findings rather than routine surveillance [^c1483788] [^7178b803].

> I should confirm counseling points. I need to ensure the patient understands that simple hepatic cysts are benign developmental lesions with no malignant potential and that most remain stable over time, which is why routine imaging is unnecessary in the absence of symptoms or atypical features [^06e65b28] [^48786489]. Let me verify that both guidelines align with this message — yes, both emphasize benign biology and recommend against surveillance in asymptomatic simple cysts, which supports clear, reassuring counseling [^dc0c5d04] [^48786489].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is no routine surveillance imaging for this 4 cm simple hepatic cyst. The most appropriate management is expectant care with patient education and instructions to return if new symptoms develop, consistent with EASL 2022 and ACG 2024 guidance [^dc0c5d04] [^48786489]. I should document the benign diagnosis, the rationale for no surveillance, and the return precautions, and I will not order follow-up imaging unless clinical status changes or new features appear on future studies that raise concern for complex cystic disease [^48786489] [^c1483788].

---

For an asymptomatic 4 cm simple hepatic cyst with normal LFTs, **no routine surveillance is needed** [^48786489] because simple cysts are benign and have no malignant potential [^06e65b28]. Current guidelines recommend **expectant management without routine imaging** [^dc0c5d04] [^3e48db8a]; reserve follow-up only for new symptoms or if atypical features develop [^c1483788] [^b37b903d]. Reassure the patient and advise her to return if she develops pain, jaundice, fever, or weight loss.

## Clinical significance of simple hepatic cysts

Simple hepatic cysts are **benign, fluid-filled lesions** lined by biliary epithelium [^06e65b28]; they are common incidental findings on imaging and have no malignant potential [^01c1a4e2]. They are typically asymptomatic and do not affect liver function, even when large [^a8296cbd].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Both the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) provide clear guidance on managing simple hepatic cysts:

- **EASL 2022 guidelines**: Do not monitor asymptomatic patients with simple hepatic cysts or peribiliary cysts [^dc0c5d04] [^469a162e].
- **ACG 2024 guidelines**: Expectant management without routine surveillance or intervention is recommended for asymptomatic simple hepatic cysts, regardless of size [^48786489] [^3e48db8a].

These recommendations are based on the **benign nature** of simple cysts and the lack of evidence that routine surveillance improves outcomes [^48786489].

---

## Evidence supporting no routine surveillance

There is **no evidence** that routine surveillance imaging alters outcomes in asymptomatic simple hepatic cysts [^notfound]. Simple cysts do not progress to malignancy, and complications such as hemorrhage or infection are rare [^a8296cbd]. When complications occur, they typically present with symptoms (pain, fever, jaundice) that prompt clinical evaluation [^04a49f4b].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting follow-up imaging

While routine surveillance is not recommended, certain scenarios may warrant follow-up imaging:

- **Symptomatic cysts**: If the patient develops symptoms such as abdominal pain, early satiety, jaundice, or signs of infection, ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality [^c1483788] [^7178b803].
- **Atypical features**: If ultrasound reveals atypical features such as septations, mural nodules, calcifications, or heterogeneous content, further evaluation with CT or MRI is recommended [^b37b903d] [^be6e2218].
- **Rapid growth**: If there is documented rapid growth of the cyst (> 50% increase in size within 6 months), further evaluation may be considered [^notfound].

---

## Patient counseling and reassurance

Patients should be counseled that simple hepatic cysts are **benign and common**, require no routine surveillance, and have no malignant potential [^48786489]. They should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop new symptoms such as persistent abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, or unexplained weight loss [^c1483788].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic simple hepatic cyst | No routine surveillance or intervention [^48786489] [^dc0c5d04] |
| Symptomatic cysts (pain, jaundice, infection) | Ultrasound evaluation and symptomatic management [^c1483788] [^7178b803] |
| Atypical features on imaging | CT or MRI for further characterization [^b37b903d] [^be6e2218] |
| Rapid growth (> 50% in 6 months) | Consider further evaluation [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a 52-year-old woman with an incidental 4 cm simple hepatic cyst, normal liver function tests, and no symptoms, **no routine surveillance imaging is recommended** [^48786489]. Management should focus on patient reassurance, education, and clinical follow-up if symptoms develop [^dc0c5d04]. This approach aligns with current EASL and ACG guidelines and reflects the benign nature of simple hepatic cysts [^48786489].

Mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver (MCN-L)—imaging features and management—Mural calcifications have a 90% specificity for MCN-L and can be seen in up to 69% of cysts, and on MRI the presence and enhancement of septations and mural nodularity are a highly sensitive feature, nearly 100%. Complete surgical resection is the gold standard for all MCNs, whereas cyst aspiration, sclerotherapy, partial resection, or cyst fenestration are not recommended. Fluid aspiration or biopsy of MCN-L is not recommended to distinguish it from a simple hepatic cyst because of low sensitivity, and MCN-L with thick septations, fenestrations, nodularity, calcifications, or mixed solid and cystic components require prompt evaluation for complete surgical resection. For patients who are not surgical candidates, surveillance imaging should be implemented, although a specific interval cannot be recommended, and changes suggestive of malignant degeneration should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board for consideration for nonsurgical options. In the postoperative period, surveillance imaging is recommended, although there are no established guidelines regarding specific intervals.

Polycystic liver disease (PCLD)—epidemiology and management: Isolated PCLD is far less common than ADPKD with a prevalence of 1–10 per million, and because the 6 genes identified in PCLD only account for 30%–45% of the population, genetic testing is generally not recommended, though in young patients with PCLD and few renal cysts who do not meet diagnostic criteria, genetic testing might be helpful to exclude ADPKD. PCLD has a largely female predominance (>80%), and in premenopausal women estrogen-containing OCPs led to a 5.5% higher height adjusted total liver volume over 10 years; exogenous estrogen use should be discontinued in patients with PCLD. Imaging surveillance of the cysts is not recommended in asymptomatic patients because there is no malignant potential.

Choledochal cysts—management and surveillance are type-specific: Patients with type I cysts should undergo complete cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy; type II cysts can undergo simple cyst excision; type III cysts can be managed endoscopically (via sphincterotomy) or by transduodenal excision for larger cysts. Type V cysts are managed based on the extent of intrahepatic disease with options including extrahepatic cyst excision with or without partial hepatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy, and liver transplantation may be required when resection is not feasible. We suggest that patients with type I and IV cysts should continue to undergo surveillance even after cyst resection because of the ongoing risk of malignancy. Key concepts emphasize that management is based on cyst type and malignancy risk; type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended; and in both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered.

The accurate diagnosis of a liver mass can usually be established with a thorough history, examination, laboratory inquiry, and imaging. The necessity of a liver biopsy to determine the nature of a liver mass is rarely necessary. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the standard of care for diagnosing liver lesions and high-quality imaging should be performed before performing a biopsy. This article discusses current consensus guidelines for imaging of liver masses, as well as masses found on surveillance imaging.

### Biologic and clinical features of benign solid and cystic lesions of the liver [^d6a9e84a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The widespread use of imaging analyses, either routinely or to evaluate symptomatic patients, has increased the detection of liver lesions (tumors and cysts) in otherwise healthy individuals. Although some of these incidentally discovered masses are malignant, most are benign and must be included in the differential diagnosis. The management of benign hepatic tumors ranges from conservative to aggressive, depending on the nature of the lesions. New imaging modalities, increased experience of radiologists, improved definition of radiologic characteristics, and a better understanding of the clinical features of these lesions have increased the accuracy of diagnoses and reduced the need for invasive diagnostic tests. These advances have led to constant adjustments in management approaches to benign hepatic lesions. We review the biologic and clinical features of some common hepatic lesions, to guide diagnosis and management strategies.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)–related polycystic liver disease—patient counseling and natural history: Practice Point 5.1.2: When people with ADPKD are informed about the presence of liver cysts found on imaging, they should be advised of the likely outcomes and possible symptoms. Counseling should note that liver cysts typically develop later than kidney cysts and are eventually seen in 90% of people with ADPKD, are more numerous and larger in women than in men, and typically remain asymptomatic throughout life. Patients should be advised that liver failure or the need for liver transplantation is unlikely, that liver dysfunction is extremely unlikely to occur as a result of PLD, but manifestations of hepatomegaly may affect QoL, and symptoms such as abdominal pain, early satiety, acid reflux, shortness of breath, weight loss, and loss of appetite should be communicated to the attending physician.

### Cystic liver lesions: a pictorial review [^bea90c0c]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatic cysts (HC) are sac-like structures mainly filled with liquid and showing a distinct membrane. They are usually found incidentally through imaging. A wide spectrum of imaging patterns may be observed for common and uncommon, neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. While simple hepatic cysts occur frequently and do not require any treatment or follow-up, non-typical cysts should be carefully analysed to avoid misdiagnosing a lesion that would require appropriate management. Therefore, adequate knowledge of all the relevant imaging patterns is critical to secure an accurate diagnosis. The aim of this review is to describe the imaging features of the different types of hepatic cysts.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^e3200bcc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Table 3 (continued)—management of biliary hamartomas, peribiliary cysts, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts, choledochal cysts, and hydatid cysts: Biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts are benign malformations and do not require surveillance imaging. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts are premalignant biliary lesions with a high risk of malignant transformation, and thus, continued surveillance imaging is recommended even after surgical resection. Management and treatment of choledochal cysts is based on type of cyst and risk of malignant transformation; Type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended. In both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered. For hydatid cysts, medical therapy with anthelmintic drugs is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture in symptomatic or active cysts to prevent recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, and medical therapy alone is not recommended unless percutaneous aspiration or surgery is contraindicated.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^410f60b0]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cystic liver disease has been increasingly reported in the literature, with a prevalence as high as 15-18%. Hepatic cysts are usually discovered incidentally, while their characterization and classification rely on improved imaging modalities. Complex cystic liver lesions comprise a wide variety of novel, re-introduced, and re-classified clinical entities. This spectrum of disorders ranges from non-neoplastic conditions to benign and malignant tumors. Their clinicopathological features, prognostic factors, and oncogenic pathways are incompletely understood. Despite representing a heterogeneous group of disorders, they can have similar clinical and imaging characteristics. As a result, the diagnosis and management of complex liver cysts can become quite challenging. Furthermore, inappropriate diagnosis and management can lead to high morbidity and mortality. In this review, we aim to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Symptomatic and complicated nonhereditary developmental liver cysts: cross-sectional imaging findings [^a8296cbd]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Commonly encountered in the general population, in the vast majority of cases nonhereditary developmental liver cysts are asymptomatic, not associated with altered hepatic function and confidently diagnosed on imaging studies, and do not require further workup, follow-up, or treatment. However, particularly in women, simple hepatic cysts may reach large sizes and cause symptoms and signs resulting from mass effect, vascular compression, and biliary obstruction. Furthermore, although rarely compared to the incidence observed in patients with adult polycystic kidney and liver disease, sporadic hepatic cysts sometimes undergo life-threatening complications such as intracystic hemorrhage, infection, or rupture, which require prompt imaging triage and appropriate interventional, laparoscopic, or open surgical treatment. This pictorial essay reviews with examples the cross-sectional imaging findings of symptomatic and complicated nonhereditary liver cysts, aiming to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with these uncommon, challenging occurrences. Emphasis is placed on the role of MRI as a useful problem-solving modality to elucidate the complex imaging appearances resulting from intracystic bleeding and superinfection, and to differentiate complicated cysts from other hemorrhagic liver lesions and biliary cystic tumors.

### Management of extrahepatic bile duct cysts [^1a8cfa2c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Why and how to undertake long-term surveillance?

Follow-up after surgery serves two purposes: to monitor for development of malignancy in the remnant biliary tissue, and development of late complications, such as anastomotic strictures or formation of stones or debris. Metachronous cancer is reported to occur in 2–4 per cent of patients after resection,. The prevalence of non-malignant strictures is reported to range from 2 to 17 per cent, a problem that appears to be less of an issue among patients operated in childhood. Follow-up may consist of annual liver function tests and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 measurement. Based on availability, the authors also recommend cross-sectional imaging with MRCP.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of cystic liver diseases [^ed2e1a7b]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The advent of enhanced radiological imaging techniques has facilitated the diagnosis of cystic liver lesions. Concomitantly, the evidence base supporting the management of these diseases has matured over the last decades. As a result, comprehensive clinical guidance on the subject matter is warranted. These Clinical Practice Guidelines cover the diagnosis and management of hepatic cysts, mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver, biliary hamartomas, polycystic liver disease, Caroli disease, Caroli syndrome, biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts. On the basis of in-depth review of the relevant literature we provide recommendations to navigate clinical dilemmas followed by supporting text. The recommendations are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine system and categorised as 'weak' or 'strong'. We aim to provide the best available evidence to aid the clinical decision-making process in the management of patients with cystic liver disease.

### Symptomatic nonparasitic hepatic cysts (...) [^2b0ad693]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures Morbidity rates and long-term recurrence. We considered the following variables for analysis: age, sex, hepatic cyst location, diameter of the cyst at primary surgery, symptoms, surgical procedure, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay, and long-term outcome. Results. The 34 patients underwent 47 operations for SNHC, with a mean follow-up of 50. 0 months. Ten patients underwent open and 8, laparoscopic deroofing of the cyst. Enucleation of the cyst and hepatic resections were performed as primary procedures in 4 and 2 patients, respectively, and as secondary procedures in 6 and 7 patients, respectively. SYMPTOMATIC nonparasitic hepatic cysts are frequent incidental findings at laparotomy and more so recently because of the increasing use and refinement of abdominal imaging and ultrasonography. 1-3 Determining the precise incidence of this disease is difficult; reports range from 0. 10% to
4.

7% according to autopsy, surgical, and ultrasonographic series. 1, 2 Symptomatic nonparasitic hepatic cysts may be congenital or acquired and are encountered more often in women and in individuals older than 60 years. 4-6. They arise from the aberrant development of intrahepatic biliary radicals. 7 These cysts are lined by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelium resembling that of bile ducts. 5, 6, 8, 9 Evidence of a biliary origin is also provided by the composition of the fluid contained. in the cyst. 10 Rare SNHCs may be lined by squamous epithelium, and these cysts may be complicated by the development of squamous cell carcinoma. 11 Most SNHCs are asymptomatic and require no treatment; treatment is indicated when they become highly symptomatic, cause complications, or demonstrate rapid growth. 12-19. Despite the rare occurrence and the more rare indication for treatment of these lesions, many options for their management have been proposed.

5, 10, 11, 20, 21 We assessed our experience in the treatment of symptomatic SNHC for more than 2 decades. Although the term nonparasitic includes cysts secondary to trauma or inflammation, only congenital cysts are discussed herein. Patients with histologically proven SNHC were recruited for this study. Thirty-four patients met this condition, and their medical records were analyzed retrospectively. The details of the primary surgery were abstracted from clinical charts of the original hospital referral. Variables considered for analysis were age, sex, hepatic cyst location, diameter of cyst at primary surgery, symptoms, surgical procedure, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay, and long-term outcome. Surgical procedures included open needle aspiration and sclerotherapy, open and laparoscopic deroofing of the cyst, cystojejunostomy, hepatic resection, and cystectomy. In all cases, surgical access consisted of laparotomy.

Hepatic resection and cystectomy were the only procedures used in patients with recurrent cysts. Patients underwent yearly clinical examinations, biochemical tests for liver function and cholestasis, radiological examinations, and ultrasonographic and computed tomographic liver scans when available. Major postoperative complications were considered pleural effusion, cholerrhagia, cholangitis, suppuration in the surgical field, liver or renal failure, cardiac deficit, urinary tract sepsis, and pneumonia. Long-term outcome was classified as poor when recurrence of the disease was evident. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1. All patients had a single cyst located in the right or in the left lobe. The cysts ranged from 7 to 28 cm in diameter. Ten patients had undergone previous treatment for their cysts. After 1994, laparoscopic and open procedures were performed.

### Incidentalomas: initial management [^cb5bace9]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Incidentalomas are increasingly common findings on radiologic studies, causing worry for physicians and patients. Physicians should consider the risk of discovering incidentalomas when contemplating imaging. Patients may assume that incidentalomas are cancer, and may not be aware of the radiation risks associated with repeat imaging. Once incidentalomas are detected, appropriate management is dependent on an informed patient's wishes and the clinical situation. Guidelines are provided for the initial management of eight incidentalomas (pituitary, thyroid, pulmonary, hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, and ovarian). Patients presenting with pituitary incidentalomas should undergo pituitary-specific magnetic resonance imaging if the lesion is 1 cm or larger, or if it abuts the optic chiasm. Thyroid incidentalomas are ubiquitous, but nodules larger than 1 to 2 cm are of greater concern. Worrisome pulmonary incidentalomas are those larger than 8 mm or those with irregular borders, eccentric calcifications, or low density. However, current guidelines recommend that even pulmonary incidentalomas as small as 4 mm be followed. Solid hepatic incidentalomas 5 mm or larger should be monitored closely, and multiphasic scanning is helpful. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms have malignant potential, and surgery is recommended for pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm with suspicious features. Adrenal lesions larger than 4 cm are usually biopsied. The Bosniak classification is a well-accepted means of triaging renal incidentalomas. Lesions at category IIF or greater require serial monitoring or surgery. Benign or probably benign ovarian cysts 3 cm or smaller in premenopausal women or 1 cm or smaller in postmenopausal women do not require follow-up. Ovarian cysts with thickened walls or septa, or solid components with blood flow, should be managed closely.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^5cca99f0]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Uncommon and congenital liver cysts

Ductal plate malformations, also known as fibropolycystic liver diseases, represent a unique spectrum of pathological abnormalities that are caused by an insult to the embryonic ductal plate development. As a result, congenital cystic lesions tend to develop in intra- or extra-hepatic bile ducts, predisposing for pancreatitis, cholangitis, lithiasis and malignancy. Depending on the timing of ductal plate insult, different congenital cystic lesions develop, including biliary hamartomas; autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (in the presence of >20 hepatic cysts), Caroli disease (type V lesions based on Todani classification), and choledochal cysts. These lesions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex cystic liver lesions when they are complicated with hemorrhage, bacterial superinfection, or intracystic development of neoplastic lesions, and should be treated as previously discussed. Polycystic liver disease with compression on the bile ducts, the hepatic veins, the inferior vena cava, the portal vein (causing portal hypertension) or adjacent viscera may dictate the need for open or laparoscopic fenestration of multiple liver cysts, or hepatectomy in appropriate surgical candidates. Orthotopic liver transplantation should be reserved for severe hepatic decompensation, ascites, malnutrition, vascular occlusion, or when resection fails or is deemed inappropriate.

Concluding remarks

Complex cystic liver lesions are increasingly being recognized in asymptomatic individuals or during workup for non-specific abdominal symptoms, leading patients to seek surgical attention. They encompass a spectrum of disorders ranging from non-neoplastic conditions to benign and malignant tumors. These complex cystic liver lesions pose multiple diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas to hepatobiliary specialists (radiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, hepatologists and surgeons). Liver cyst characteristics that can assist with their classification, include presence of septa, enhancing thickened wall, mural consistency/nodularity, calcifications, and quality of cystic fluid with or without debris. When a high index of suspicion for underlying malignancy is present, cases should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board meeting. If malignancy or high-grade dysplasia is anticipated, surgical options include radical resection and enucleation, according to cyst location and the patient’s performance status. When imaging characteristics are atypical or inconclusive, regular short-interval monitoring with high resolution imaging should be entertained (Fig. 5). Extensive research into the pathogenesis and progression of complex cystic liver lesions is currently underway. Ongoing studies will hopefully bring forward a set of clinically relevant molecular markers to help improve the diagnosis and classification of these lesions.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^3040845b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Liver masses in pregnancy—Asymptomatic hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia do not need management or surveillance during pregnancy (strong recommendation, very low level evidence). Hepatic adenomas should be monitored with ultrasound during pregnancy for growth, and patients with large adenomas (>5 cm) should be referred for resection before pregnancy (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Spontaneous rupture of hemangiomas is exceedingly rare, even with large lesions, and routine symptomatic follow-up and standard vaginal delivery is safe. Focal nodular hyperplasia is found in 3% of the population with multiple case series in pregnant women reporting routine pregnancies with good clinical outcomes. If a hepatic adenoma is larger than 5 cm or rapid growth is noted, surgical or radiological intervention should be recommended before pregnancy.

Biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts—characteristics and surveillance—Biliary hamartomas are benign malformations of the intrahepatic bile ducts that appear as multiple tiny cystic lesions, do not communicate with the biliary tree, can occur anywhere in the liver (often peripherally), and are usually smaller than 1.5 cm; they do not affect liver function tests, are largely incidental, and do not require specific surveillance. Malignant transformation to iCCA or HCC is rare. Peribiliary cysts are frequently perihilar, small in size (<1 cm), seen as a “string of pearls” around hilar portal veins, do not communicate with the biliary tree, are often found incidentally, and are commonly seen with chronic liver disease and/or portal hypertension. Biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts are benign malformations and do not require surveillance imaging.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^01c1a4e2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently affecting approximately 2.5-18% of the world population, cystic liver lesions are broadly classified into simple and complex cystic lesions. Hepatic simple cysts (HSCs), making up the majority of these lesions, are benign, rarely symptomatic, tend to remain stable in size, and seldom require treatment. Complex liver cysts, on the other hand, include congenital, premalignant, neoplastic, infectious, and post-traumatic lesions. Ultrasonography (US) as the first imaging modality, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), combined with clinical and laboratory data, provide useful information regarding the diagnosis and characterization of complex cystic liver lesions [-,]. Since the majority of complex cysts require surgical management, difficulties in reaching an accurate diagnosis pose problems in their effective management, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and effective management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Clinical management of polycystic liver disease [^2c58d6d4]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

A 41-year old female underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan in 2010 because of symptoms suggestive of appendicitis. Incidentally, multiple liver lesions characterised as cysts were detected. The presence of small to medium sized liver cysts (diameter between <1 cm and 4 cm) in all liver segments (>100 cysts) and absence of kidney cysts in the context of normal renal function led to the clinical diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD). Five years later she was referred to the outpatient clinic with increased abdominal girth, pain in the right upper abdomen and right flank, and early satiety. She had difficulties bending over and could neither cut her toenails nor tie her shoe laces. In her early twenties she had used oral contraception for five years. She has been pregnant twice. Clinical examination showed an enlarged liver reaching into the right pelvic region and crossing the midline of the abdomen. Laboratory testing demonstrated increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (80 IU/L, normal <40 IU/L) and alkaline phosphatase (148 IU/L, normal <100 IU/L) levels. Bilirubin, albumin and coagulation times were within the normal range. A new CT scan in 2015 was compatible with an increased number and size of liver cysts. The diameter of cysts varied between <1 cm and 6 cm (anatomic distribution shown [Fig. 2B]). There were no signs of hepatic venous outflow obstruction, portal hypertension or compression on the biliary tract. Height-adjusted total liver volume (htTLV) increased from 2,667 ml/m in 2012 to 4,047 ml/m in 2015 (height 172 cm). The case we present here is not uncommon, and prompts several relevant questions.

### KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline: a commentary on diagnosis and management of hepatopancreatic manifestations by the ERA working group genes&kidney [^87e23d59]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation, Management, and Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a long-awaited development and the first KDIGO guideline addressing a genetic kidney disease. The approval of tolvaptan as targeted therapy for ADPKD in 2015, marked a pivotal advancement, and galvanized towards a structured approach in research and clinical care. Considering the systemic nature of ADPKD guidance for the management of extrarenal manifestations is of special importance for nephrologists and requires interdisciplinary collaboration. In this regard, cysts in other organs, particularly the liver, are the most common extrarenal finding. While most liver cysts are incidental findings on routine imaging, both cyst infections and severe polycystic liver disease accompanying ADPKD come with a high disease burden and challenges in management. In contrast, pancreatic cysts in ADPKD are usually completely asymptomatic, but raise questions about the need for follow-up. This commentary provides an overview of the most important recommendations and practice points on hepatopancreatic cysts provided by the KDIGO guideline with the aim to contribute to implementation and to highlight remaining gaps in guidance, clinical care and research.

### A rare large symptomatic simple hepatic cyst [^430dd5c3]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A fit and well 4-year-old girl presented with a 1-year history of abdominal distension, pain and vomiting with signs of non-shifting dullness on the right side of the abdomen. An abdominal CT revealed a 19 cm epigastric cyst that did not appear to connect to any solid organ and was therefore thought to represent a mesenteric cyst. However, laparotomy revealed that the cyst was arising from the liver. The cyst was resected and subsequent histology revealed a simple hepatic cyst. The patient has been well post-operation. The case represents the largest described simple hepatic cyst in the 0-16 years paediatric age group in Europe to date. We outline the epidemiology, embryology, key investigations and management options for these lesions.

Summary of recommendations and conclusions (Level B)—imaging-based cyst management and biopsy indications are detailed. Women with imaging findings suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS 4–5) require tissue biopsy. If imaging suggests a simple cyst (no internal septations or mural thickening and BI-RADS 2) and if the history and examination also are consistent with benign disease, then routine clinical follow-up is recommended. If imaging suggests a complicated cyst and is BI-RADS 3, decisions regarding aspiration or imaging observation for 1–2 years should be made after thorough discussion with the patient based on preference or overriding concern. Complex cysts (nonsimple cysts with cystic and solid components and BI-RADS 4–5 imaging findings) require biopsy.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^4ef43cc5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Females with hepatic adenomas ≥5 cm—management: for females with HCA that are 5 cm or larger, a period of 6 months of observation is reasonable with cessation of exogenous hormone use (OCPs, hormonal intrauterine devices, and anabolic steroids) and, if applicable, a recommendation for weight loss, and in non-β-catenin mutated HCAs it is reasonable to observe at 6-month intervals. Any imaging features concerning for malignancy should lead to immediate treatment without a period of observation. In cases where the adenoma remains ≥5 cm after observation, definitive treatment should be pursued with surgical resection, and if not a resection candidate, other treatment options should be considered such as embolization. If the adenoma regresses to <5 cm, continued observation with contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended, and these patients should continue to have long-term follow-up surveillance imaging initially every 6 months, although malignancy is unlikely with HCA regression to <5 cm it has been infrequently reported to occur at this size.

Pancreatic cyst surveillance—Cyst surveillance should be offered to surgically fit candidates with asymptomatic cysts that are presumed to be IPMNs or MCNs (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Patients with IPMNs or MCNs with new-onset or worsening diabetes mellitus, or a rapid increase in cyst size (of >3mm/year) during surveillance, may have an increased risk of malignancy, so should be evaluated during a short-interval MRI or EUS±FNA (Conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Patients with IPMNs or MCNs with any of the following features should undergo EUS±FNA and/or be referred to a multidisciplinary group for further evaluation (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence): any of the following symptoms or signs—jaundice secondary to the cyst, acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst, significantly elevated serum CA 19-9; any of the following imaging findings—the presence of a mural nodule or solid component either within the cyst or in the pancreatic parenchyma, dilation of the main pancreatic duct >5 mm, a focal dilation of the pancreatic duct concerning for main duct IPMN or an obstructing lesion, mucin-producing cysts measuring ≥3 cm in diameter; or the presence of high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer on cytology. MRCP is the preferred modality for pancreatic cyst surveillance, and EUS may also be the primary surveillance tool in patients who cannot or choose not to have MRI scans (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In the absence of concerning features, cyst size guides surveillance intervals for presumed IPMNs and MCNs (Conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Surveillance should be discontinued if a patient is no longer a surgical candidate (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). It is reasonable to assess the utility of ongoing surveillance in those >75 years old, and an individualized approach for those 76–85 years should be considered including an informed discussion about surgery (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^1a0a1788]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Incidental focal liver lesions (FLLs)—initial evaluation and management: Incidental liver lesions can be defined as suspected findings within the liver, which are often identified on outpatient or emergency department imaging performed to investigate an unrelated clinical symptom such as pain, weight loss, or trauma, and imaging studies performed under these circumstances are usually either an abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, and while they may identify a FLL, they cannot adequately characterize the lesion itself. Given the extensive categories of benign and malignant pathologies of FLLs, as well as differences in management, liver-directed imaging is often needed for adequate clarification; however, there are a few instances where further workup of incidental FLLs is not necessary, specifically if the imaging appearance on abdominal ultrasound or single-phase CT is characteristic for a hemangioma or benign uncomplicated cyst. In most instances, characterization of liver lesions requires careful investigation of the medical history, clinical symptomatology, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging, with attention to histories that suggest increased risk such as previous cancer, constitutional symptoms, foreign travel, medications including oral contraceptive pills, hormone supplementation, or steroids, and risk factors for chronic liver disease. Detection is common, with some studies showing that up to 52% of patients without cancer have a benign liver lesion at autopsy and the American College of Radiology reporting that up to 15% of patients have an incidental liver lesion detected on routine noninvasive imaging; common modalities detecting incidental lesions include ultrasonography (US) with or without contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

### Practice bulletin no. 174 summary: evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^6a0ad9fa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Adnexal masses—observation criteria specify that observation is recommended when the morphology of the adnexal mass on ultrasonography suggests benign disease or when morphology is less certain but there is a compelling reason to avoid surgical intervention, and observation in the asymptomatic woman may be justified when the evaluation shows a normal CA 125 level in the absence of transvaginal ultrasound findings suspicious for cancer. With rare exception, simple cysts up to 10 cm in diameter on transvaginal ultrasonography performed by experienced ultrasonographers are likely benign and may be safely monitored using repeat imaging without surgical intervention, even in postmenopausal patients. Additional benign diseases that may be managed expectantly include suspected endometriomas, mature teratomas, and hydrosalpinx. Repeat ultrasound imaging is recommended whenever the diagnosis is uncertain and when cancer remains within the differential diagnoses, although the ideal interval and duration for ultrasound follow-up has yet to be defined. In one study, masses that were monitored and eventually diagnosed as malignancies all demonstrated growth by 7 months, and some experts recommend limiting observation of stable masses without solid components to 1 year, and stable masses with solid components to 2 years. Surgical intervention is warranted for symptomatic masses or for suspected malignancy based on the results of radiologic imaging, serum marker testing, or both.

Cystic liver lesions—Early reports from laparotomy series described a prevalence of 0.2%–1%, whereas recent ultrasound and CT series report a range of 2.5%–18%. Most cysts have an indolent course; however, it is important to differentiate benign, simple cysts from those with infection or neoplastic potential such as biliary cystadenomas/cystadenocarcinomas, choledochal cysts, and hydatid cysts.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^06e65b28]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Simple hepatic cysts—Hepatic cysts are thin-walled structures lined by cuboidal bile duct epithelium and filled with isotonic fluid and are the result of ductal plate malformation without communication with the biliary tree. Simple hepatic cysts can be diagnosed on conventional grayscale ultrasound with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%, and they are usually asymptomatic and incidentally found unless very large; there is a female predominance although there is no established correlation with OCP use or pregnancy and cyst prevalence increases with age. For symptomatic cysts, treatment options include surgical cyst fenestration, also known as deroofing/marsupialization, or aspiration with sclerotherapy; aspiration sclerotherapy can be achieved with substances including 100% ethanol, tetracycline, or other sclerosants.

Incidentally discovered solid hepatic mass—When a solid hepatic mass is incidentally discovered in a patient with no known risk factors, appropriate multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging (CT or MRI) should be the first step in management and is often a sufficient test for diagnosis and subtyping of hepatic adenomas. Biopsy should be performed when a hepatic adenoma has an uncharacteristic appearance on imaging or change in imaging features that are concerning for malignant transformation.

### Management of incidental liver lesions on CT: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^8a83a13c]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Committee on Incidental Findings presents recommendations for managing liver lesions that are incidentally detected on CT. These recommendations represent an update from the liver component of the ACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver. The Liver Subcommittee-which included five abdominal radiologists, one hepatologist, and one hepatobiliary surgeon-developed this algorithm. The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches categorize liver lesions on the basis of patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an assessment of benignity or a specific follow-up recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. The goal is to improve the quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected liver lesions.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^452cbed1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Focal liver lesions (FLLs) have become an increasingly common finding on abdominal imaging, especially asymptomatic and incidental liver lesions. Gastroenterologists and hepatologists often see these patients in consultation and make recommendations for management of multiple types of liver lesions, including hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, and hepatic cystic lesions including polycystic liver disease. Malignancy is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of FLLs, and healthcare providers must be familiar with the diagnosis and management of FLLs. This American College of Gastroenterology practice guideline uses the best evidence available to make diagnosis and management recommendations for the most common FLLs.

### Hepatic ultrasonography for surveillance in patients with uveal melanoma [^f1018cc6]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is a lack of information regarding the role of systemic surveillance in patients with primary uveal melanoma.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of serial hepatic ultrasonography (USG) for detection of asymptomatic liver metastases in patients undergoing surveillance after primary treatment of uveal melanoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study reviewing data from patients with primary uveal melanoma treated between October 2003 and October 2012 at a multispecialty tertiary care center. Patients were managed using a standardized protocol. Initial staging was done with contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This was followed by periodic surveillance with hepatic USG and liver function tests scheduled every 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter. Abnormal surveillance hepatic USG findings were categorized as (1) cyst or hemangioma, (2) indeterminate lesion, (3) suspicious for metastasis, or (4) consistent with metastasis. If indicated, hepatic USG abnormalities were confirmed by additional imaging modalities (confirmatory scans) such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Liver biopsy was performed only if the confirmatory scan was positive.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of hepatic USG for detecting asymptomatic liver metastases.

Results

In 263 patients (121 men, 142 women; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 61.1 [13.9] years), a total of 1390 hepatic USGs were performed, with a mean of 5.3 per patient (range, 1-17 per patient). Overall, 86 hepatic USGs of 71 patients (27%) were reported as abnormal. Of the 13 lesions identified as a cyst/hemangioma and 17 as indeterminate, 1 was found to be metastatic in each group (8% and 6%, respectively). Of 36 patients with findings suspicious for metastasis, 23 (64%) had metastasis confirmed. All 5 patients (100%) with findings consistent with metastasis had biopsy-proven metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of hepatic USG for findings that were indeterminate or suspicious for metastasis were 96% (95% CI, 80%-99%), 88% (95% CI, 83%-91%), and 45% (95% CI, 33%-59%), respectively. Specificity of the confirmatory scan was greater than that of hepatic USG (93% [95% CI, 89%-96%] vs 88% [95% CI, 83%-91%], respectively; P<.001). Only 4 of 30 patients (13%) with metastasis had abnormal findings on simultaneous liver function tests.

Conclusions and Relevance

A stepwise surveillance protocol based on serial hepatic USGs followed by confirmatory scans offers high likelihood of detecting asymptomatic metastases in patients with primary uveal melanoma.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^70213da7]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD Practice Point 1.3.7—people with no known family history and incidentally detected kidney cysts—imaging and follow-up: For people with no known family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) but with incidentally detected kidney cysts, kidney imaging can help to make a diagnosis. Abdominal imaging should be considered for consenting parents, siblings, and/or adult children; and if a positive family history is found, the scheme as indicated in Figure 1 should be followed. If multiple bilateral cysts are identified with increased kidney volume, with or without liver cysts, and no other disease features are suggestive of a different cause of kidney cysts, the presumptive diagnosis is ADPKD. If only a few incidental cysts are identified without kidney enlargement or liver cysts, no clear cutoff has been established; population data show that in a study of contrast-enhanced CT in 2012 potential kidney donors, 39% in the age range of 19–49 years had at least one cyst of size ≥ 2 mm, increasing to 63% for people 50–75 years, and the 97.5th percentile for number of total cysts ≥5 mm was 10 for men and 4 for women aged 60–69 years; the >97.5th percentile group was made up of those for whom an underlying genetic cause is suspected. Therefore, in people with a limited number of cysts and no increase or a minimal increase in TK, periodic follow-up (every 5 years) is suggested, and if cysts were first detected by ultrasound, follow-up imaging by MRI or CT and/or genetic testing are indicated when findings suggest another form of PKD.

Advances in imaging techniques will dramatically decrease the number of undiagnosed tumors. New molecular techniques should allow the identification of pathologic factors that are predictive of complicated forms. Surgery should be limited to symptomatic benign tumors or those who have a risk for complication (hemorrhage, rupture, or degeneration). When surgery is indicated, patients with benign disease are the best candidates for laparoscopy.

### ACG clinical guideline: the diagnosis and management of focal liver lesions [^a6a4cbc0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Focal liver lesions (FLL) have been a common reason for consultation faced by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. The increasing and widespread use of imaging studies has led to an increase in detection of incidental FLL. It is important to consider not only malignant liver lesions, but also benign solid and cystic liver lesions such as hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, and hepatic cysts, in the differential diagnosis. In this ACG practice guideline, the authors provide an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of FLL.
