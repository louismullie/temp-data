## Question

What are signs of infectious colitis that would make you consider antibiotics if diarrhea and colitis was noted on CT. 

Also what are options for Inpatient, broad spectrum antibiotics for colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which CT findings and clinical features of infectious colitis should prompt antibiotic therapy, and what inpatient broad-spectrum antibiotic options are appropriate when antibiotics are indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the CT patterns that raise suspicion for infectious colitis and how reliable they are. Then, I should verify which clinical severity markers justify empiric antibiotics while awaiting stool results. Next, I will distinguish when to treat C. difficile versus other bacterial pathogens. After that, I should outline inpatient broad-spectrum regimens and stewardship principles. Finally, I will integrate special populations like IBD and immunocompromised hosts, and close with a practical decision framework and caveats about imaging limitations.

> Let me first confirm the CT patterns that should trigger concern for infectious colitis. Colonic wall thickening greater than 4 mm, pericolonic fat stranding, mural hyperenhancement with target or double-halo signs, the accordion sign, nodularity, and unexplained ascites are classic for C. difficile colitis and, when combined, can raise the positive predictive value of CT to roughly 88%, though sensitivity remains modest at 52–70% depending on criteria and reader expertise, so a normal CT does not exclude disease [^43c90fc4] [^5ad08787]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these findings are not pathognomonic and can be seen in ischemic, inflammatory, or immune-mediated colitides, so I need to correlate with clinical context and labs before committing to antibiotics [^01af4206].

> Next, I should review the clinical severity markers that, when paired with CT colitis, justify empiric therapy. Profuse watery diarrhea with systemic toxicity, fever, tachycardia, marked leukocytosis, hypotension, signs of sepsis, ileus, or concern for toxic megacolon push me toward immediate treatment rather than waiting for stool results, especially if turnaround will exceed 24–48 hours or the patient is deteriorating [^9b616349] [^b4a0756f]. I need to ensure I also consider host risk: elderly, immunocompromised, cirrhosis, diabetes, and IBD increase the risk of severe or complicated disease and lower the threshold for empiric therapy while diagnostics are pending [^1d0e0542].

> I will now examine the two main infectious etiologies to treat differently: C. difficile versus other invasive bacterial colitis. For suspected C. difficile, I should start oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily if severe or if the patient has IBD, and add IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours if fulminant disease is suspected, ideally alongside early surgical consultation and close monitoring for toxic megacolon or perforation [^f037355f] [^21521990] [^b4a0756f]. Wait, let me verify the first-line shift — metronidazole is no longer preferred for initial nonsevere CDI, so vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first-line; I almost said metronidazole first-line, but that would be outdated, so I should correct that and prioritize vancomycin in severe or IBD-associated cases [^b0ae6c74] [^f037355f].

> For non–C. difficile invasive bacterial colitis, I should confirm that empiric therapy is reasonable when there is febrile dysentery, systemic toxicity, or high-risk host features. Options include a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours, or a beta-lactam with good enteric coverage such as ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours, with the choice tailored to local resistance patterns and prior antibiotic exposures [^1d0e0542]. Hold on, I should verify duration — most cases require 3–5 days if clinically improving, with longer courses for severe or immunocompromised hosts, and I should de-escalate or stop if cultures return negative and the patient is stable [^1d0e0542] [^d2bf3c67].

> But wait, what if the colitis is actually an IBD flare rather than infection. I need to check for IBD and C. difficile in all suspected flares, because CDI is common and worsens outcomes in IBD; in acute severe UC, I should not start routine broad-spectrum antibiotics unless there is suspected infection or systemic toxicity, and instead focus on IV corticosteroids with early endoscopy to assess severity and exclude CMV, reserving antibiotics for confirmed infection or fulminant disease [^fc6386ce] [^768a87a8]. I should double-check that guidelines align — yes, multiple high-quality sources advise against routine antibiotics in ASUC without infection, reinforcing a stewardship-first approach in IBD [^fc6386ce] [^768a87a8].

> Let me consider special populations and stewardship. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, I should maintain a lower threshold for empiric therapy and broaden the differential to include CMV and other opportunistic infections, using CT to assess for complications but not relying on it to exclude disease given limited sensitivity and specificity in this context [^90c2a784] [^7fcaa670]. I should confirm that I plan to narrow or stop antibiotics promptly when cultures and susceptibilities return, and avoid unnecessary repeat CT unless the patient deteriorates or new complications are suspected, to limit radiation and resource use [^d2bf3c67].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework. If CT shows colonic wall thickening with pericolonic stranding or other inflammatory features and the patient has fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, hypotension, severe abdominal pain, ileus, or immunocompromise, I should start empiric therapy directed at C. difficile and/or invasive bacteria while sending stool for C. difficile NAAT or GDH/toxin assays, bacterial culture, and O&P as indicated, then de-escalate within 48–72 hours based on results and clinical response [^c8fcf052] [^d2bf3c67]. If CT is normal but clinical suspicion remains high, I should not delay appropriate testing and treatment, because CT has imperfect sensitivity and a negative scan does not rule out infectious colitis [^ef33ba07].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed imaging limitations and follow-up. CT cannot reliably distinguish C. difficile from other colitides, and about 40–50% of patients with CDI may have a normal CT, so imaging complements but does not replace clinical judgment and endoscopy when indicated, particularly in severe or refractory cases where histology can change management [^ef33ba07] [^12fb0368]. I should confirm that I will reassess within 24–48 hours for clinical improvement and adjust therapy accordingly, escalating to rescue strategies or surgical evaluation if the patient fails to improve despite appropriate antibiotics and supportive care [^fc6386ce] [^21521990].

Infectious colitis on CT is suggested by **colonic wall thickening > 4 mm** with pericolonic fat stranding, mural hyperenhancement, the accordion sign, and mesenteric edema [^43c90fc4] [^5ad08787]. These findings, especially when diffuse or pancolonic, **raise concern for C. difficile** [^5ad08787] but are not specific and can occur in other colitides [^01af4206]. Empiric antibiotics are indicated for **severe disease** (fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, ileus, or toxic megacolon) [^9b616349] or when stool testing is delayed or unavailable [^b4a0756f]. For fulminant C. difficile, use high-dose oral vancomycin plus IV metronidazole [^21521990]; for severe non–C. difficile colitis, use a fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin with metronidazole, tailoring to local resistance and culture results [^1d0e0542] [^d2bf3c67].

---

## CT findings suggesting infectious colitis

CT is **not specific** but can identify features that increase suspicion for infectious colitis and help detect complications [^ef33ba07]. Key findings include:

- **Colonic wall thickening**: > 4 mm is sensitive and specific for colitis, with higher specificity when combined with other features [^43c90fc4] [^5ad08787].

- **Pericolonic fat stranding**: indicates mesenteric inflammation and supports an infectious process [^43c90fc4].

- **Mural hyperenhancement**: "target" or "double-halo" sign reflects mucosal hyperemia and edema [^5ad08787].

- **Accordion sign**: alternating bands of high- and low-attenuation colonic wall, highly suggestive of C. difficile colitis [^43c90fc4].

- **Mesenteric edema and ascites**: nonspecific but common in severe colitis [^5ad08787].

- **Pancolonic involvement**: more suggestive of C. difficile, whereas segmental disease may suggest other pathogens or ischemia [^5ad08787] [^01af4206].

---

## Clinical signs indicating antibiotic therapy

CT findings alone **do not mandate antibiotics**; they must be integrated with clinical severity and laboratory data. Indications for empiric antibiotics include:

- **Severe systemic illness**: fever, tachycardia, hypotension, or signs of sepsis [^9b616349].

- **Marked leukocytosis**: WBC > 15,000 cells/µL or rising counts [^9b616349].

- **Ileus or toxic megacolon**: severe disease with colonic dilation or systemic toxicity [^9b616349].

- **Immunocompromised state**: increased risk of severe infection and complications [^1d0e0542].

- **Delayed diagnostic testing**: stool results unavailable within 24–48 hours in severe cases [^b4a0756f].

---

## Recommended inpatient broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens

Empiric therapy should be guided by the **most likely pathogen**, local resistance patterns, and patient factors. Common regimens include:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Fulminant C. difficile colitis | - High-dose oral vancomycin (500 mg every 6 hours) ± rectal vancomycin enemas <br/> - IV metronidazole (500 mg every 8 hours) [^21521990] [^b4a0756f] | - First-line for severe/complicated CDI <br/> - Dual therapy for ileus or systemic toxicity [^21521990] |
| Severe non–C. difficile colitis (community-acquired) | - Fluoroquinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours) + metronidazole (500 mg IV every 8 hours) [^notfound] | Covers Gram-negatives and anaerobes; adjust to local resistance |
| Severe non–C. difficile colitis (healthcare-associated) | - Piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g IV every 8 hours) + metronidazole (500 mg IV every 8 hours) [^notfound] | Broad coverage for resistant Gram-negatives and anaerobes |
| Penicillin allergy | - Fluoroquinolone + metronidazole <br/> - Or carbapenem (e.g. ertapenem) if severe beta-lactam allergy [^notfound] | Alternative coverage avoiding beta-lactams |

---

## Duration and adjustment of therapy

Empiric antibiotics should be **narrowed or stopped** once a pathogen is identified or if no pathogen is found and the patient improves. Typical durations are 5–10 days, extended for slow response or immunocompromise, with daily reassessment of clinical status, leukocyte count, and renal function [^d2bf3c67].

---

## Conclusion

CT findings such as colonic wall thickening, pericolonic stranding, mural hyperenhancement, and the accordion sign raise suspicion for infectious colitis, particularly C. difficile, but **clinical correlation is essential**. Empiric antibiotics are indicated for severe disease or when diagnostic testing is delayed, with regimens tailored to the likely pathogen and local resistance patterns. Prompt, pathogen-directed therapy and stewardship improve outcomes and reduce complications [^d2bf3c67].

### Evaluating the CT diagnosis of Clostridium difficile colitis: should CT guide therapy? [^43c90fc4]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to further characterize the CT findings of Clostridium difficile colitis and to provide for the first time a diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value to help clinicians decide whether antibiotic treatment is warranted on the basis of CT findings while awaiting stool test results (which may take as long as 48 hr).

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review covering a 4-year period was performed of the charts and CT scans of 54 symptomatic patients with stool test results positive for C. difficile and of a control group of 56 patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea with stool test results negative for C. difficile.

Results

At our institution, C. difficile colitis was explicitly diagnosed at CT in these patients with a sensitivity of 52%, specificity of 93%, positive predictive value of 88%, and negative predictive value of 67%. The sensitivity can be raised to 70% with no change in specificity with more rigid adherence to diagnostic criteria of colon wall thickening of greater than 4 mm combined with any one or more findings of pericolonic stranding, colon wall nodularity, the "accordion" sign, or otherwise unexplained ascites.

Conclusion

Although routine CT screening of antibiotic-associated diarrhea is not advocated, the 88% positive predictive value of a diagnosis of C. difficile colitis in those who are scanned may merit consideration of treatment by clinicians on the basis of the CT results alone.

Purpose Of Review

To provide the definition, causes, and current recommendations for workup and treatment of acute infectious colitis in adults, a common medical problem of diverse cause.

Recent Findings

The management of acute colitis in adults depend upon establishment of cause. Most forms of infectious colitis are treatable with antimicrobials. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by guided culture on PCR-positive pathogens can often confirm active infection while standard culture methods provide isolates for antibiotic susceptibility testing, subtyping, and Whole Genome Sequencing.

Summary

Patients with colitis may be suffering from a range of etiologies including infectious colitis, neutropenic colitis, drug-induced colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The present review was prepared to provide an approach to prompt diagnosis and management of acute colitis to prevent severe complications (e.g. dehydration and malnutrition, or toxic megacolon) and provide recommendations for antimicrobial therapy.

Introduction

Antibiotics offer tremendous benefit to patients with infectious diseases and are commonly administered to patients cared for in U.S. hospitals. However, studies have demonstrated that treatment indication, choice of agent, or duration of therapy can be incorrect in up to 50% of the instances in which antibiotics are prescribed. One study reported that 30% of antibiotics received by hospitalized adult patients, outside of critical care, were unnecessary; antibiotics often were used for longer than recommended durations or for treatment of colonizing or contaminating microorganisms.

Incorrect prescribing of antibiotics exposes individual patients to potential complications of antibiotic therapy, without any therapeutic benefit. One such complication is infection with Clostridium difficile, an anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus that causes pseudomembranous colitis, manifesting as diarrhea that often recurs and can progress to sepsis and death; CDC has estimated that there are about 250,000 C. difficile infections (CDI) in hospitalized patients each year. Other complications related to unnecessary use of antibiotics include infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and complications from adverse events.

Evidence is accumulating that interventions to optimize inpatient antibiotic prescribing can improve patient outcomes. To assist health-care providers to reduce incorrect inpatient prescribing, information is needed regarding how frequently incorrect prescribing occurs in hospitals and how improving prescribing will benefit patients. In this report, current assessments of the scope of inpatient antibiotic prescribing, the potential for optimizing prescribing, and the potential benefits to patients are described.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^3766d4af]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients—initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) enterocolitis imaging—computed tomography (CT) performance and indications are limited: reported CT sensitivities range from 53% to 85% with specificities of 75% to 78%, and the CT pattern is indistinguishable from other forms of colitis. CT and magnetic resonance imaging are typically helpful only when pain, fever, or bleeding predominate to rule out complications, and diarrhea alone should not warrant abdominal imaging.

### The role of antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diarrhea [^1d0e0542]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious diarrhea is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and a common complaint in clinical practice. Routine empirical use of antibiotics for infectious diarrhea should be avoided because of the self-limited nature of most cases, the cost of antibiotics, and the potential to worsen the already significant problem of antibiotic resistance of enteric pathogens. For patients with severe invasive or prolonged diarrhea or who are at high risk of complications, such as the elderly, diabetics, cirrhotics, and immunocompromised patients, empirical treatment with a quinolone antibiotic for 3 to 5 days can be considered. Antibiotic treatment can be highly effective for Shigella, ETEC, and V. cholerae infections, and metronidazole is indicated for C. difficile colitis. The impact of antibiotics for other specific pathogens is modest, and antibiotic therapy should be reserved for the same group of patients who would be considered for empirical treatment. The most significant problem in the antibiotic treatment of infectious diarrhea is the progressive increase in resistance among enteric pathogens; only the prudent use of antimicrobials in all areas of daily practice can limit or delay the impact of this serious problem.

### Approach to the patient with infectious colitis [^5402a7eb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide current recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients with infectious colitis. Infectious colitis is diagnosed in someone with diarrhea and one or more of the following: fever and/or dysentery, stools containing inflammatory markers such as leukocytes, lactoferrin, or calprotectin, or positive stool culture for an invasive or inflammatory bacterial enteropathogen including Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or Clostridium difficile, or colonic inflammation by endoscopy.

Recent Findings

Standard stool culture should be performed in patients with infectious colitis. Epidemiologic findings including prior international travel, shellfish-associated diarrhea, living in parasite-endemic regions may suggest the need for specialized studies of etiology. When STEC is suspected as a pathogen because only low grade or no fever is seen in a patient with acute dysentery, a competent laboratory should look for E. coli O157:H7 and Shiga toxin directly in stool.

Summary

Once laboratory diagnosis is made, pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy should be initiated for all forms of infectious colitis other than STEC. For empiric treatment of febrile dysenteric diarrhea invasive bacterial enteropathogens (Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter) should be suspected and adults may be treated empirically with 1000mg azithromycin in a single dose.

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^d2bf3c67]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship—culture-negative suspected infection: Stop antibiotics in patients whose diagnostic culture(s) are negative unless there is clear evidence of bacterial infection. Patients often receive antibiotic treatment when bacterial infection is suspected but not yet confirmed, and usually, laboratory and radiology information are available after 3 days. Based on test and culture results, antibiotics should be deescalated to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic or discontinued if there is no further evidence of infection. Reducing antibiotic exposure decreases the risk of infections with C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and medical professionals should use their local antibiogram to develop guidance for narrow empiric choices to limit patient exposures to unnecessary antibiotics.

Clostridioides difficile infection—radiologic evaluation and CT performance: Radiologic evaluation has limited utility in the setting of CDI. Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. The ability for CT scanning to predict the need for surgical intervention is poor (sensitivity 52%–85% and specificity 48%–92%), and in fact, about 40% of patients with CDI have a normal CT scan without radiographic evidence of colitis. A retrospective review of 176 hospitalized patients with CDI found abnormal wall thickening, pancolitis, and bowel dilation on CT associated with colectomy, with wall thickening an independent predictor of 30-day mortality; however, these findings had a low predictive value of 50%.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis: an overview [^7fcaa670]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Histology

The common histologic features of ICI-induced colitis include acute colitis indicators, such as increased lamina propria cellularity, intraepithelial neutrophilic infiltrates, cryptitis, crypt abscesses, and apoptotic cells, which may precede diarrhea onset. Chronic colitis features, such as intraepithelial lymphocytes, basal lymphocytes, and crypt distortion, may also be present. The pattern of ICI-induced colitis can vary by drug, with ipilimumab linked to diffuse active colitis and nivolumab associated with lymphocytic colitis and, with long-term treatment, chronic active colitis. No single criterion confirms the diagnosis, emphasizing the need for contextual interpretation in clinical assessments.

Imaging

Limited data suggests that imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), may serve as an alternative for diagnosing ICI-induced colitis. Recent studies have shown that CT has suboptimal sensitivity (74%) and specificity (50%) when correlating radiologic findings with correct histological diagnosis of enterocolitis. Despite these limitations, CT scans remain helpful for excluding complications and assessing disease severity, especially if toxic megacolon, perforation, abscess, or obstruction is suspected. Further exploration of pathognomonic radiological signs is needed to consider CT as part of the standard of care for diagnosing ICI-induced colitis as it offers the advantage of being less invasive than endoscopy with biopsy.

Differential diagnosis

In patients receiving ICI therapy, the initial step of the differential diagnosis involves ruling out infectious causes (viral, bacterial, or parasitic) of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Microbiological studies and stool cultures are crucial in this context, considering these patients’ increased risk of infection. Distinguishing between infectious and ICI-induced colitis can be challenging, but specific features caused by pathogens can aid in differentiation. Opportunistic infections like Cytomegalovirus, diagnosed by characteristic cellular and intranuclear inclusions, can complicate ICI-induced colitis and impact steroid response. C. difficile infections overlaid on ICI-induced colitis have been documented in patients receiving ICI therapy.

Furthermore, gastrointestinal metastases as a potential cause of colitis must be excluded, particularly in patients with clinical signs of peritonitis, which warrants evaluation with CT to rule out colonic perforation.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can induce conditions like lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis, which can mimic ICI-induced colitis. The harm these conditions impose on the colon includes erosions and ulcers, with distinct histological findings.

Distinguishing between ICI-induced colitis and IBD is crucial, and distinctive histological features favor either diagnosis. ICI-induced colitis often presents with a rapid onset of symptoms, whereas IBD has an insidious onset, and specific lesions like fistulas may suggest C. difficile in patients with IBD.

### Inpatient management of inflammatory bowel disease-related complications [^fe602a3a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in therapeutic options, a sizeable proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease require hospitalization or surgery during their lifetime. While current treatment guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease cover the spectrum of disease severity and behavior, management of acute complications of inflammatory bowel disease can present unique challenges that are not always addressed in these guidelines. In this review, the authors provide a comprehensive summary of the existing literature focused on management of patients hospitalized with complications of inflammatory bowel disease. Proposed management algorithms are provided to guide clinicians through common scenarios to determine the most appropriate interventions - escalation of medical therapies, non-surgical therapeutic interventions (drainage of intra-abdominal abscess or endoscopic balloon dilation) or surgery. Prevention of complications is proposed through a multi-disciplinary approach that involves surgeons, dieticians, radiologists, pathologists and infectious disease consultants.

### An update on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^1336d417]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial morbidity and mortality and is implicated in recent epidemics. Data support the treatment of colitis with oral metronidazole in a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/d, with oral vancomycin as a second-line agent, not because its efficacy is questioned but because of environmental concerns. Nitazoxanide and other drugs are currently under intense study as alternatives. Treatment of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Current management strategies appear to be increasingly ineffective, especially for patients who experience multiple recurrences. Biotherapy and vaccination are currently being explored as treatment options for patients who have recurrent disease. Greater attention should be paid to hospital infection control policies and restriction of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

---

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^345b5b6c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Tigecycline maintains satisfactory profiles of safety and efficacy in treatment of multidrug resistant bacteria, in complicated intra-abdominal infections. Judicious use of antibiotics for multidrug resistant pathogens is important to preserve their effectiveness, and tigecycline is one of the few available compounds active against multidrug resistant strains. It may be more suitable to use tigecycline for empiric or definitive treatment of patients with high risk intra-abdominal infections. Combinations with other broad-spectrum antibiotics may be suitable in critically ill patients or in patients with health-care infections known or suspected to be owing to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Adequate therapy

Adequate indications and duration of therapy are particularly important. Inadequate duration of treatment is probably the main inappropriate use of antibiotics in surgical practice and the intensive care unit. Antimicrobial therapy for established infections should be continued until normalization of clinical signs of infection occurs, including normalization of temperature and WBC count. If clinical signs and symptoms persist after a reasonable course of antibiotic therapy, another infectious cause should be sought rather than prolonging antibiotic treatment for the initial infection.

Unnecessary broad coverage or prolonged therapy can carry high costs, toxicities of therapy and Clostridium difficile colitis superinfection. Clostridium difficile causes 15%-25% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the severity of which ranges from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis.

Over the past years, some Authors have investigated procalcitonin (PCT) to guide duration of antibiotic therapy. Currently, procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a laboratory variable that allows early differentiation between SIRS and sepsis. It was recently been used to guide antibiotic treatment in medical patients with pulmonary diseases.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^72c13339]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update—immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) colitis management emphasizes exclusion of infection, risk stratification, timely diagnosis, and graded therapy: Infectious causes of diarrhea should be excluded before treatment of suspected ICI colitis, and early stool testing for inflammatory markers in patients with grade 2 or higher colitis/diarrhea (more than 4 bowel movements daily above baseline) according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5 (CTCAE) and selected patients with less-severe diarrhea may help stratify high-risk patients for endoscopic evaluation; endoscopic confirmation of the diagnosis and severity of ICI colitis should be considered before initiation of high-dose systemic glucocorticoids, and abdominal imaging may be considered to exclude serious complications in patients with dominant symptoms of pain, fever, or bleeding, but should not be performed routinely in patients with diarrhea alone. Rapid progression of ICI colitis may occur within a period of days, particularly in patients treated with ipilimumab, and therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment is required. ICI colitis typically responds to high-dose systemic glucocorticoids, given in doses of 0.5–2 mg/kg prednisone equivalent daily with a taper of 4–6 weeks; however, these doses and schedules have not been rigorously examined, and infliximab and vedolizumab are reasonable options for treatment of glucocorticoid refractory colitis. Budesonide is ineffective as a prophylactic treatment for ICI colitis, but may be used for treatment of ICI-associated microscopic colitis. Patients who develop ICI colitis may be retreated with immunotherapy under select conditions, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease may have an increased risk of ICI-associated gastrointestinal adverse events, but may derive cancer treatment benefit from checkpoint blockade.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common cause of diarrhea in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The last few years have seen major changes in the treatment spectrum of CDI, most notably, recommendations against using metronidazole for initial CDI, the addition of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, and emergence of microbial replacement therapies. Several other therapies are undergoing clinical trials. This narrative review focuses on the treatment of CDI with a summary of literature on the newer modalities and the treatment guidelines issued by Infectious Diseases Society of America and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

### CT patterns of acute enterocolitis-a practical guide for the emergency radiologist [^01af4206]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute enterocolitis encompasses a broad spectrum of conditions affecting the small and large bowel, frequently presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Given the clinical overlap among infectious, inflammatory, immune-mediated, vascular, and miscellaneous etiologies, imaging plays a pivotal role in refining the differential diagnosis, identifying complications, and guiding timely management. Computed tomography (CT), owing to its accessibility and rapid acquisition, remains the cornerstone of imaging evaluation in acute settings. CT enables detailed assessment of bowel wall morphology, disease distribution, vascular involvement, and extraintestinal manifestations. While ancillary imaging modalities have a role in select scenarios, this review emphasizes a CT-focused approach tailored for acute care. We present a comprehensive, pattern-based review of the CT imaging features across various forms of acute enterocolitis, highlighting diagnostic hallmarks, interpretive pitfalls, and clinically relevant mimics. The included cases were encountered by the radiologists in their day-to day practice and included based on their ability to highlight the majority representative features of each pathology. Through the integration of structured tables, illustrative cases, and diagnostic tips, this article aims to enhance the radiologist's ability to recognize key imaging signatures, avoid diagnostic errors, and contribute meaningfully to multidisciplinary patient care.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^4a39113f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Guideline overview

C. difficile is a unique disease in that both infectious disease providers and gastroenterologists see and manage these patients. As such, guidelines from both disciplines will be reviewed, compared and contrasted. The goal of this manuscript is to focus on the evolution of the guidelines and changes over the last few years, but it is important from a foundational standpoint to understand the recommendations prior to the modern era to contextualize how they have evolved into what is recommended today. It is best to break these publications into three time frames: 1995–1997, 2009– 2013, and 2014 to the present.

### Imaging features of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli colitis [^a77a6d6f]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to define and illustrate the radiologic findings in patients with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli colitis.

Conclusion

Although not definitive, imaging studies in conjunction with an appropriate clinical history can aid in the early diagnosis of E. coli colitis and exclude surgical conditions. CT is more sensitive than conventional radiography for detection. Contiguous involvement, including the transverse colon, was seen in all patients. Because CT is becoming routine in the initial workup of patients with acute abdominal pain, it is important for the radiologist to suggest E. coli colitis in the proper setting.

### Colonic abnormalities on CT in adult hospitalized patients with Clostridium difficile colitis: prevalence and significance of findings [^12fb0368]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of an abnormal colon on CT in adult inpatients with Clostridium difficile colitis, compare the clinical presentation of these patients, and determine whether CT findings predicted the need for surgical treatment.

Materials and Methods

Over a 21-month period, 152 of 572 inpatients with C. difficile colitis were identified and had CT scans performed within 2 weeks of the diagnosis. These were independently and retrospectively reviewed by two reviewers. Those with colonic wall thickness greater than 4 mm were considered positive (CT-positive patients) and were further reviewed for specific findings in the colon. All 152 patients with CT scans were also retrospectively reviewed using the hospital information system for certain clinical parameters, admitting diagnoses, and reasons for scanning. The following were compared using several statistical tests: clinical parameters in CT-positive and CT-negative patients and surgical and nonsurgical groups to determine if positive scans or surgical treatment could be clinically predicted; specific CT findings in CT-positive patients to see if an association was found with clinical parameters or surgical treatment; and admitting diagnoses and reasons for scanning in scanned and unscanned populations to see which patients were more likely to undergo CT.

Results

Seventy-six (50%) of 152 scanned hospitalized patients with C. difficile colitis were CT-positive. These patients most often had segmental involvement (50 [66%] of 76 patients), with the rectum (60 [82%] of 73 patients) and sigmoid colon (61 [82%] of 74 patients) most often affected. Positive scans were associated with increased WBC, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Patients with signs and symptoms of infection or abdominal complaints were more likely to be scanned. No statistical correlation was found between specific CT findings and clinical parameters or clinical parameters and patients requiring surgery. There was no predictive value of specific CT findings for surgical treatment.

Conclusion

Half of the patients scanned had an abnormal CT, with segmental colonic disease more common than diffuse. Positive scans were more likely in patients with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and fever. Specific CT findings did not correlate with clinical parameters and could not predict surgical treatment.

Acute diverticulitis—antibiotic use and generalizability of evidence are described: Two recent randomized trials and 2 systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, suggesting selective and individualized use. Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### Diagnostic utility of CT for suspected immune checkpoint inhibitor enterocolitis [^56cfa259]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Consensus guidelines state that moderate to severe diarrhea (CTCAE grades 2–4) coupled with a negative infectious workup is sufficient to begin treatment with steroids, and even to escalate treatment to infliximab if ulceration is visible on endoscopy.Although endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is strongly recommended, it is not necessary prior to steroid initiation. Systemic steroids for the treatment of ICI enterocolitis are not benign, potentially abrogating the antitumor response of ICI and leading to reduced survival.As such, the consideration of multiple diagnoses and a comprehensive workup should be undertaken prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy. Here, we demonstrate that CT alone is an insufficient work up. A negative CT scan should not rule out the need for GI consultation and endoscopy with biopsy.

This study has several limitations. It is retrospective and limited to three hospitals within a single healthcare system. Although the inclusion of multiple hospitals allows for more generalizable conclusions, all sites have a high volume of patients treated with ICI, and therefore, increased incidence in ICI enterocolitis. They have highly specialized physicians with ICI expertize, so these results may not be generalizable to settings with different patient populations and without access to prompt endoscopic evaluation. We chose to focus on a heterogeneous patient population representing many malignancies, therapies and clinical presentations. Although we believe that this varied sample provides valuable real-world evidence, the heterogeneity may obscure important positive relationships between CT scan and diagnosis of ICI enterocolitis, as was seen previously in a more focused study examining melanoma patients presenting with diarrhea.A larger sample size would allow for more detailed subgroup analysis and the possible identification of patient populations for whom CT scan may play a more important role in diagnosis.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Clostridium difficile colitis (...) [^543baee1]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Colitis can occur as a result of infection with the bacterium Clostridium difficile. The disease results from disruption or removal of normal healthy bacteria from the colon by antibiotics. The C difficile bacterium produces toxins that attack the lining of the colon and can cause severe damage to the colon itself. More commonly, C difficile toxins produce diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Unfortunately, it is resistant to most antibiotics. Complications of C difficile colitis include bowel perforation and pseudomembranous colitis.

C difficile is one of the most common infections that are typically acquired in health care institutions, along with MRSA and VRE. Hand washing and disinfection, isolation of infected patients, and appropriate antibiotic use are the best ways to reduce spread of these types of infection. The March 4, 2009, issue of JAMA contains an article about Clostridium difficile colitis. Risk factors Treatment with antibiotics Hospitalization Nursing home residency. Critical illness Immune system depression Age older than 65 years Disease of the colon Recent gastrointestinal surgery Signs and symptoms Diarrhea, often watery Fever Abdominal pain and cramping Nausea with or without vomiting.

Weight loss Diagnosis Diagnosing C difficile colitis relies on the patient's history of frequent diarrhea for several days, typically in a person who is taking or recently took antibiotics. A stool sample is tested for presence of C difficile toxins. Other tests may be required if complications are suspected, including blood counts, blood chemistry testing, abdominal x-rays, or computed tomography scanning.

### 2019 update of the WSES guidelines for management of () infection in surgical patients [^5ad08787]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The issue of if or when to retest for CDI is inherently linked to the accuracy of the employed routine testing method. Methods with suboptimal sensitivity for C. difficile (e.g. stand-alone toxin EIAs) led to frequent retesting in some settings. In the absence of clear changes to the clinical presentation of suspected CDI (i.e. change in character of diarrhea or new supporting clinical evidence), repeating testing should not be performed.
11 CT imaging is suggested for patients with clinical manifestations of severe-complicated C. difficile colitis; however, its sensitivity is not satisfactory for screening purposes (Recommendation 2 B).

In certain clinical settings, adjunct testing methods such as radiologic diagnostic imaging may be useful for diagnosing CDI. Diagnostic computed tomography (CT) imaging can assist with an early diagnosis and may help determine the severity of the disease in patients with CDI.

CT has been studied as an imaging modality for diagnosing C. difficile colitis. Typical CT findings of CDC include colonic wall thickening, dilation, peri-colonic stranding, “accordion sign” (high-attenuation oral contrast in the colonic lumen alternating with low-attenuation inflamed mucosa), “double-halo sign, target sign” (intravenous contrast displaying varying degrees of attenuation caused by submucosal inflammation and hyperemia), and ascites. However, the most common finding, colonic wall thickening, is non-specific and can be found in other forms of colitis, although it may be more pronounced with CDI.

In the study by Kirkpatrick et al. CT diagnosis of CDC had a sensitivity of 52%, a specificity of 93%, and positive and negative predictive valued 88%, and 67% respectively. Sensitivity would have been increased to 70% with no change in specificity if colonic wall thickness of greater than 4 mm had been used as a diagnostic criteria, in conjunction with the presence of the following factors, colon wall nodularity, accordion sign, peri-colonic stranding, or otherwise unexplained ascites.
12 Ultrasound may be useful in critically ill patients suspected to have pseudomembranous colitis who cannot be transported to the CT scan suite (Recommendation 2 C).

### Clostridioides difficile colitis [^08f48aeb]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile colitis is an important source of hospital-acquired diarrhea associated with antibiotic use. Symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea, typically following a course of antibiotics; however, some cases of fulminant disease may manifest with shock, ileus, or megacolon. Nonfulminant colitis is treated with oral fidaxomicin. C difficile colitis has a high potential for recurrence, and recurrent episodes are also treated with fidaxomicin. Bezlotoxumab is another medication that may be used in populations at high risk for further recurrence. Fulminant disease is treated with maximal medical therapy and early surgical consultation. Antibiotic stewardship is critical to preventing C difficile colitis.

Indications for investigations, inpatient isolation and specialist referral

The panellists agreed that all patients admitted to hospital with ASUC should have a SARS-CoV-2 swab performed on admission. If the result was negative it was deemed appropriate to repeat the swab at the point of requiring rescue therapy and/or surgery to exclude subclinical infection. It was also considered appropriate to isolate all patients throughout their hospital stay, irrespective of their COVID-19 status (table 1).

Table 1 
Appropriateness of patient isolation and investigation in patients admitted with acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic

It was rated appropriate to perform a flexible sigmoidoscopy within 24 hours of admission. If a patient had not had a flexible sigmoidoscopy on admission, it was considered appropriate that one should be performed prior to rescue therapy or colectomy. Repeating this test at these time points was deemed unnecessary in patients who had already had a flexible sigmoidoscopy performed.

Routine CT scanning of the abdomen/pelvis on admission (in addition to abdominal X-ray) was deemed inappropriate. However, the appropriateness of routine chest CT on admission was rated as uncertain. The one scenario in which a CT scan of the chest was felt to be appropriate for all patients irrespective of COVID-19 status was in the context of patients requiring colectomy.

Throughout the scenarios, the panellists considered the appropriateness of discussion with COVID-19 specialists. In patients without symptoms or signs of COVID-19 and with a negative swab, this was deemed inappropriate if receiving first-line therapy but uncertain in patients requiring rescue therapy. However, it was considered appropriate in all patients with a positive swab, irrespective of the presence of symptoms or signs of COVID-19.

### Diagnostic utility of CT for suspected immune checkpoint inhibitor enterocolitis [^48e4b8ba]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the utility of CT for diagnosis of ICI enterocolitis was found to be lower than had previously been reported.We evaluated the role of CT scan in a heterogeneous patient population representing multiple tumor types and patients treated with both CTLA-4 inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, which is more representative of real-world ICI use. Notably, median time from ICI start to symptom onset in this population was 10.5 weeks, with an IQR of 5–22 weeks. This wide-ranging time to symptom onset is in keeping with previous work, which has placed colitis onset from combination PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy at 6–8 weeks and from PD-1 monotherapy at 25.4 weeks, with a range from 0.6 to 119 weeks. This suggests that we are capturing a representative real-world population presenting with similar symptoms in a similar time course to what has been previously described.Patients generally had moderate to severe diarrhea on presentation. The majority of those diagnosed with ICI enterocolitis also had severe symptoms based on colitis grade and treatment response, including the need for intravenous steroids and second-line therapies including infliximab and vedolizumab. Importantly, only two-thirds of patients had concordant grade of diarrhea and grade of colitis, indicating that severe diarrhea does not always correspond with severe colitis that might be visible on imaging. Even after subgroup analysis of those with severe diarrhea, sensitivity and specificity of CT scan, both in everyday clinical practice and after expert review, remained moderate to poor.

We demonstrated the NPV of CT scan in everyday clinical practice is poor, improving to only 63% from 52% following expert review. Even with careful review of possible signs of inflammation by expert abdominal radiologists, CT scan does not capture all cases of ICI enterocolitis. Poor NPV, especially as defined in a population at a large academic cancer center with a high prevalence of ICI enterocolitis cases, makes CT scan especially limited in the workup of diarrhea and suspected colitis, as negative imaging will not rule out the diagnosis. Taken together, this work demonstrates that, both in real-world settings and after review by expert radiologists, CT currently has limited utility in the diagnosis of ICI enterocolitis and cannot substitute for endoscopy with biopsy. As ICI enterocolitis can progress rapidly, with worsening inflammation and increasing symptom severity if not diagnosed and treated promptly, endoscopic assessment with biopsy should be performed in all patients with suspicion of this immune-related adverse event.

The purpose of this expert review is to synthesize the existing evidence on the management of Clostridium difficile infection in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease. The evidence reviewed in this article is a summation of relevant scientific publications, expert opinion statements, and current practice guidelines. This review is a summary of expert opinion in the field without a formal systematic review of evidence. Best Practice Advice 1: Clinicians should test patients who present with a flare of underlying inflammatory bowel disease for Clostridium difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 2: Clinicians should screen for recurrent C difficile infection if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should consider treating C difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients with vancomycin instead of metronidazole. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians strongly should consider hospitalization for close monitoring and aggressive management for inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection who have profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, a markedly increased peripheral blood leukocyte count, or other evidence of sepsis. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy for C difficile infection has been initiated. However, the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection should be individualized because there is insufficient existing robust literature on which to develop firm recommendations. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians should offer a referral for fecal microbiota transplantation to inflammatory bowel disease patients with recurrent C difficile infection.

Infectious diarrhea—diagnostic yield and selective testing report that among adults presenting with diarrhea to emergency departments in the United States, 17% of patients who submitted a stool specimen (as opposed to rectal swab) were found to have a bacterial enteric infection, that a bacterial etiology was found in 5%–11% of children seeking care in emergency departments and outpatient settings, and that restricting testing to patients with bloody stools, fever, or abdominal tenderness can increase the likelihood of identifying a bacterial pathogen; testing all patients with acute diarrhea for these pathogens would be inefficient.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a potentially fatal illness with an increasing incidence worldwide. Despite extensive ongoing research into CDI treatment, management of CDI still poses important problems, such as a high propensity to relapse and refractoriness to treatment, especially when there is an ileus and oral drugs cannot be administered. This guideline evaluates the available literature, discusses criteria for disease severity and provides recommendations for CDI treatment, indicating level of evidence and strength of recommendation.

### Core indicators of an evaluation and guidance system for quality of care in inflammatory bowel disease centers: a critical review [^77fb0cbb]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Exclusion of intestinal tuberculosis and clostridium difficile and virus infections

IBD and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) have similar clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and pathological features, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal ulcerations. However, their treatments are quite different; the commonly used therapeutic agents for IBD are immunosuppressants, which can exacerbate ITB; misdiagnosing IBD as ITB may delay the treatment, which could have serious consequences such as intestinal obstruction and toxic megacolon.To avoid these outcomes, IBD centers should have the ability to differentiate between ITB and IBD. Chest radiography is insufficient for high-risk areas because of its low detection rate.

Surveys have shown that the prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is higher in patients with IBD than in those without IBD, especially in those with UC.CDI is associated with increased hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in IBD; additionally, it may necessitate escalation of therapy and colectomy. The increasing incidence of CDI in IBD may be due to an imbalance of intestinal bacteria and a loss of colonization resistance against C. difficile.Due to the poor outcomes of CDI in IBD, it should be detected early, and treated with escalation or de-escalation of immunosuppressants along with appropriate antibiotics, such as vancomycin.We suggest that all IBD centers should test patients who present with an aggravation of underlying IBD for CDI and patients should be tested for recurrent CDI if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management-AAFP (...) [^b4a0756f]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Manifestations C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea—often mucoid stool with minimal blood—to severe disease with pseudo-membranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. Other possible symptoms include fever, abdominal pain or cramping, decreased appetite, and malaise. 17 Small studies have found that stool odor was neither sensitive nor specific for C. difficile infection.
18. In facilities that limit C. difficile testing to patients with three or more unformed stools per 24 hours, testing can begin with NAAT or EIAs for GDH and toxins A and B. If the facility does not limit C. difficile testing and evaluates patients who do not meet testing criteria, EIAs for GDH and toxins A and B can be performed initially; if results are inconclusive, NAAT alone or in combination with an EIA for toxins A and B can be ordered.

ADJUVANT TESTING The presence of peripheral leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, or hypoalbuminemia indicates more severe. Nonsevere C. difficile infection is further stratified by initial episode and number of recurrent infections, and the treatment strategy depends on how many episodes the patient has experienced. It is reasonable to start antibiotics empirically if diagnostic test results will take longer than 48 hours to obtain or if the patient presents with fulminant colitis. 6 Patients who are clinically stable can be treated on an outpatient basis after they have been counseled about infection control. SEVERE DISEASE AND FULMINANT COLITIS Patients with severe C. difficile infection or fulminant colitis should receive immediate antibiotic therapy, supportive care, and close monitoring in a hospital setting. Some may require surgery for toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, or necrotizing colitis.
6.

Antibiotics for fulminant colitis include enteral vancomycin and parenteral metronidazole. 8 If there is no clinical improvement within three to five days, fidaxomicin can be added. Patients who have delayed passage of oral antibiotics due to an ileus can be given intracolonic vancomycin rectally via retention enema every six hours with or without intravenous metronidazole every eight hours.

### Clostridium difficile [^670312bf]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. The incidence of infection with this organism is increasing in hospitals worldwide, consequent to the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pathogenic strains of C. difficile produce two protein exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, that cause colonic mucosal injury and inflammation. Many patients who are colonized are asymptomatic, and recent evidence indicates that diarrhea and colitis occur in those individuals who lack a protective antitoxin immune response. In patients who do develop symptoms, the spectrum of C. difficile disease ranges from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis. Prevention of nosocomial C. difficile infection involves judicious use of antibiotics and multidisciplinary infection control measures to reduce environmental contamination and patient cross-infection. Ultimately, active or passive immunization against C. difficile may be an effective means of controlling the growing problem of nosocomial C. difficile diarrhea and colitis.

### Diagnosis of colitis: making the initial diagnosis [^a3a58031]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with colitis of recent onset is a relatively common clinical challenge. The main considerations are infectious colitides, idiopathic IBD, ie, ulcerative and Crohn's colitis, and colonic ischemia. An initial risk assessment on the basis of such factors as concurrent symptoms in contacts, travel history, medications, and human immunodeficiency virus risk factors should be followed by a thorough clinical history, physical examination, stool studies, blood tests, and, in selected cases, endoscopic examination and serologic tests. Biopsies can be decisive in distinguishing among the different types of acute colitis and might help identify specific etiologies. The diagnostic yield of biopsies is maximized by appropriate sampling of the colonic mucosa and by sharing the clinical and endoscopic findings with the pathologist, eg, via a copy of the endoscopy report.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile (previously Clostridium difficile) is the most common pathogen implicated in healthcare-associated infections in the United States (US).Recent data suggest that ~40% of C. difficile infections (CDIs) in the US are community-associated, which often do not have risk factors such as antibiotic exposure or hospitalization commonly associated with healthcare-associated CDI.In Europe, the incidence of CDI is lower than in the US. It is the eighth most frequently reported microorganism in healthcare-associated infections, with increasing incidence in most countries; the majority of cases (76.4%) are healthcare-associated.

CDI classically presents with watery diarrhea (Bristol stool scale 6–7, three or more times a day) and crampy abdominal pain, with or without fever. In rare cases with ileus or a megacolon, diarrhea may not be present. Diagnosis is made by a positive stool test in the presence of typical clinical features. A gamut of tests is available, and the choice of test depends on the institutional protocol and test availability.

Management of CDI has changed significantly in the last few years, with several new treatment options available. In this article, we describe the treatment of primary and recurrent CDI in adults as recommended by recent guidelines along with investigational therapies for CDI.

ASCRS Clinical Practice Guidelines—statement of the problem for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) outlines organism features, transmission, burden, carriage, and risk factors, noting that Clostridioides difficile is “an anaerobic, gram-positive, bacillus bacterium” that “is most commonly transmitted via a fecal-oral route,” and that U.S. cases appear stable with “estimated 476,400 cases in 2011 associated with 29,000 deaths and 462,100 cases in 2017 associated with an estimated 20,500 deaths.” Asymptomatic carriage is frequent, with the bacterium “present in the stool of approximately 3% of healthy adults” and “up to 50% of those exposed to an inpatient facility may be asymptomatic carriers.” Antibiotic exposure and comorbidity are implicated, as “Alterations in the bacterial component of the microbiota, most often due to the use of antibiotics, can lead to ecological changes” and “Higher rates of CDI have been reported in patients after exposure to a prolonged duration of antibiotics including perioperative antibiotics and in patients with underlying comorbid conditions such as IBD or immunosuppression.”

### Renal failure and leukocytosis are predictors of a complicated course of Clostridium difficile infection if measured on day of diagnosis [^bfdb185c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become an increasing problem in many hospitals in the Western world during the past decade. C. difficile causes diarrhea and colitis, with a tendency to recur after initially successful antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, gut inflammation may be so severe that antimicrobial therapy is not effective; in such cases, complications such as hypotension, perforation, and toxic megacolon may develop. Several risk factors for CDI have been identified, of which the use of antibiotics is the most important. Predicting which patients are at risk for developing complications or recurrences can guide the choice and duration of therapy. In 2009, a prediction rule for recurrences, incorporating age, comorbid conditions, and the necessity to continue inciting antibiotic therapy, was published. This rule was derived from and was validated in 2 cohorts of 44 and 64 patients, respectively. The relatively small sample sizes challenge the credibility of this rule. Several risk factors for complications of CDI and prediction rules based on these factors have been described, but unfortunately, none of these prediction rules have been validated.

The choice of an appropriate end point for a prediction rule for complicated and/or recurrent CDI has been problematic. The clinical judgment of whether to attribute end points such as CDI-related mortality and intensive care unit admission may be highly subjective, especially for elderly patients, who are often admitted with severe illness and usually have significant comorbid conditions. End points concerning the resolution and recurrence of diarrhea need a precise definition of diarrhea and quantitative measurement of stool volume and frequency, which may be difficult to obtain. Furthermore, the parameters included in a prediction rule should be objective, routinely measured in clinical practice, and available at the moment the rule is applied (ie, when CDI is diagnosed).

A recent guideline by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that age, peak leukocyte count, and peak serum creatinine level be taken into account as potential indicators of a complicated course of CDI when treatment is started. The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has issued a guidance document for the treatment of CDI that also lists qualitative and quantitative symptoms, signs, laboratory parameters, and radiological findings that may reflect more severe disease with associated higher risk for complications and recurrences. Three quantitative parameters for diagnosing severe colitis were included: body temperature >38.5°C, leukocyte count >15 × 10 9 /L, and serum creatinine level >50% above baseline; however, these cutoffs have not been confirmed prospectively.

### Diagnostic utility of CT for suspected immune checkpoint inhibitor enterocolitis [^06fbab82]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of CT scan

The test performance of CT scan was evaluated in comparison to endoscopy with biopsy. Radiographic findings consistent with enterocolitis, including bowel wall thickening, mucosal or mural hyperenhancement, pericolonic stranding, fluid-filled loops of bowel and mesenteric hyperemia were correlated with a histological diagnosis of ICI enterocolitis. Based on radiology reports generated during standard care, the sensitivity and specificity for CT scan were 50% and 74%, respectively. The PPV was 73% and the NPV was 52%. Test characteristics were similar in the subgroups of patients treated with ICI targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, as well as those treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Expert radiology review identified 42 additional patients with imaging signs of enterocolitis, which increased the sensitivity of CT scan to 81%. The specificity decreased to 45% (table 4). When stratifying based on severity of diarrhea symptoms, CT scan had an improved PPV in those with high-grade symptoms (grades 3 and 4) compared with low-grade (grades 0–2) symptoms, both in real-world use and after expert review. However, sensitivity and specificity for both subgroups were similar to the overall sample (table 5).

Table 4 
Test performance of CT

Table 5 
Test performance of CT stratified by severity of diarrhea

We also evaluated the utility of CT scan in diagnosing enterocolitis of any etiology in this population. Findings of enterocolitis on imaging were correlated with a histological diagnosis of enterocolitis. Diagnoses included ICI enterocolitis, infectious enterocolitis, graft versus host disease and ischemic colitis. After expert review of imaging, the sensitivity and specificity for CT scan were 76% and 51%, respectively. The PPV was 86% and the NPV 37%.

Overall, of the 138 cases evaluated, 18 had a positive CT and signs of inflammation on biopsy without findings consistent with ICI enterocolitis. The most common diagnoses were viral enterocolitis (n=4) and ischemic colitis (n=3). Twelve cases had a positive CT and no signs of inflammation on biopsy; most commonly, symptoms and findings were non-specific, and the final diagnosis was not determined (n=7). Twelve patients were treated with at least one dose of steroids despite biopsies inconsistent with ICI enterocolitis.

Objective

The study aims to demonstrate risk factors for colitis in intensive care unit patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

Retrospective review was performed to identify intensive care unit (ICU) patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 with computed tomography (CT) between March 20 and December 31, 2020. ICU patients without COVID-19 diagnosis with CT between March 20 and May 10, 2020 were also identified. CT image findings of colitis or terminal ileitis as well as supportive treatment including ventilator, vasopressors, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if clinical factors differed in patients with and without positive CT finding.

Results

Total 61 ICU patients were selected, including 32 (52%) COVID-19-positive patients and 29 (48%) non-COVID-19 patients. CT findings of colitis or terminal ileitis were identified in 27 patients (44%). Seventy-four percent of the patients with positive CT findings (20/27) received supportive therapies prior to CT, while 56% of the patients without abnormal CT findings (19/34) received supportive therapies. Vasopressor treatment was significantly associated with development of colitis and/or terminal ileitis (p = 0.04) and COVID-19 status was not significantly different between these groups (p = 0.07).

Conclusions

In our study, there was significant correlation between prior vasopressor therapy and imaging findings of colitis or terminal ileitis in ICU patients, independent of COVID-19 status. Our observation raises a possibility that the reported COVID-19-related severe gastrointestinal complications and potential poor outcome could have been confounded by underlying severe critically ill status, and warrants a caution in diagnosis of gastrointestinal complication.

Methods

Study design and inclusion criteria

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients at the Mass General Brigham healthcare system between 2015 and 2019, following the adoption of a unified electronic health record (EHR). Patients were identified using a system-wide data warehouse, the Research Patient Database Registry. Inclusion criteria required patients receive at least one dose of ICI therapy including anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition±CTLA-4 antagonism and combination chemotherapy-ICI and targeted therapy-ICI combinations. Patients receiving these agents on clinical trials were included. Eligible patients underwent both endoscopy with biopsy (including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy) and abdominal CT scan within a 3-day period of each other and within a year of last ICI dose. Patients were excluded if they did not have both diagnostic tests, and if no tissue samples were collected during the upper or lower endoscopy. Repeat CT scans within the 3-day window were excluded from analysis if the imaging was not correlated with a clinical change to avoid duplicate data points.

Data extraction

We used the EHR to extract data on patient characteristics, including age, sex, tumor type and ICI treatment course. Diarrhea and colitis grade as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.5.0 was determined through provider documentation; where not recorded, grade was determined by maximum frequency of bowel movements and severity of colitis symptoms documented and resolution was determined by improvement in diarrhea and abdominal pain. Dates of symptom onset, resolution, as well as the colitis-specific treatments administered were extracted from the EHR. Data on the diagnostic workup performed—specifically endoscopy and imaging, including type of scope, date of procedure and date of CT scan—were collected.

Pathological analysis

Patients were determined to have signs of inflammation on endoscopy if the finding was documented in the endoscopic report in the EHR, as assessed by the evaluating gastroenterologist. Patients were considered to have biopsy-proven ICI enterocolitis if there was histological evidence consistent with ICI enterocolitis on the tissue sample obtained during endoscopy, as assessed by the evaluating pathologist. Patients were considered to have enterocolitis of any etiology if there was histologic evidence of inflammation, as assessed by the evaluating pathologist.

### Elevated lipase without pancreatitis in infectious colitis [^8e7f1383]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

An elevated lipase typically confirms the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Elevated lipase may be associated with other disorders, typically with some influence on the pancreas. The differential is more limited than elevated amylase secondary to the mostly unique production of lipase in pancreatic acinar cells. Elevated lipase has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but not previously reported in infectious colitis.

Case Report

A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to her left flank worsening over 2 days. She denied epigastric pain. She had occasional nausea and occasional nonbilious and nonbloody emesis, and also reported diarrhea and weight loss over the preceding months. Laboratory values were largely unremarkable except for a grossly elevated lipase level. Computed tomography scan of her abdomen was performed and revealed findings consistent with infectious colitis, without signs of pancreatic inflammation or other findings associated with pancreatitis. She was admitted to the hospital and treated for infectious colitis with antibiotics and improved over 2 days, and was subsequently discharged for follow-up with her gastroenterologist. This is the first reported case of elevated lipase without pancreatitis associated with infectious colitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should be aware of other potential causes of elevated lipase and not assume that all cases of elevated lipase are associated with pancreatitis. This may possibly avoid unnecessary admission in situations that are not clearly pancreatitis.

### Systematic review on inflammatory bowel disease patients with coronavirus disease 2019: It is time to take stock [^538f75e7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Data on the clinical characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19.

Results

Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes.

Conclusions

Diarrhea occurs more frequently in IBD patients with COVID-19 than in the non-IBD population. Further studies are needed to define the optimal diagnostic-therapeutic approach in IBD patients with COVID-19.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^38136f7b]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel deemed it uncertain whether a CT chest should be performed in all patients on admission. While a CT chest is more sensitive than a chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting signs of early or limited infection, the COVID-19 specialists advised that a CXR would suffice in asymptomatic patients on admission. However, the Royal College of Radiologists has advised a low-dose CT chest should be performed in patients who are having a CT abdomen as part of the investigation of an abdominal emergency.

It was considered appropriate to involve a COVID-19 specialist in all scenarios in the presence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab, regardless of signs or symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. The panel was uncertain whether this was required in patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 swab who required rescue therapy. During the meeting, concern was expressed by some panellists about the possible effects of corticosteroids and rescue therapies on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pneumonia driving the need to seek clarification from COVID-19 experts and highlighting the need for further research.

Diagnostic evaluation

In the setting of acute diarrhea, initial evaluation should exclude an infectious etiology (consider stool culture, Clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), stool ova and parasites). Inflammatory markers (fecal leukocytes/lactoferrin, fecal calprotectin) and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) may help indicate whether there is an inflammatory process underlying the diarrhea. Screening tests for tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis A and B should be considered if there is potential for use of systemic immunosuppression e.g. infliximab in the near future. Based on the IBD literature, risk of hepatitis C exacerbation is minimal; as a result, testing for hepatitis C is not recommended.

Colitis

Radiologically, two distinct patterns of anti-CTLA-4-associated colitis have been observed on computed tomography (CT) imaging: a more common diffuse colitis characterized by mesenteric vessel engorgement, and a segmental colitis with moderate wall thickening and associated pericolonic fat stranding in a segment of pre-existing diverticulosis. A fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT study can also demonstrate new FDG-avid diffuse colonic wall thickening in patients with immune-related colitis. Colonoscopy is the most accurate means of evaluating the extent and severity of colitis and is recommended in appropriate cases since recent data suggest that the presence of ulceration on endoscopy predicts steroid-refractory disease. For grade ≥ 2 diarrhea, systemic immunosuppression should be initiated promptly after ruling out infectious etiology. Colonoscopy can be considered if deemed clinically necessary, although it is worth noting that certain types of colitis may have a normal endoscopic appearance, with significant inflammatory features on histology. Therefore, routine mucosal biopsies should be performed for histological examination. In addition, pathology with immunohistochemical staining to rule out CMV infection is critical.

Histologically, colitis that follows treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is characterized by neutrophilic inflammation with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, crypt epithelial cell apoptosis and few or no features of chronicity. Similarly, anti-PD-1-related colitis typically follows one of two patterns: active colitis with apoptosis (active inflammation, neutrophilic crypt micro-abscesses, increased crypt epithelial cell apoptosis, and presence of crypt atrophy/dropout) or lymphocytic colitis (increased intraepithelial lymphocytes in surface epithelium, surface epithelial injury, and expansion of the lamina propria). Pathological changes may also be visible outside the colon in the duodenum, stomach and/or small bowel.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^b0ae6c74]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

### ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease [^6d02229e]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to management of pouchitis, antibiotics, ESPEN 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering ciprofloxacin (first-line choice) or metronidazole as initial therapy in patients with acute pouchitis.
