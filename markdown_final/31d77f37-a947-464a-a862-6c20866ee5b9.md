## Question

qsofa score

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the qSOFA score, including its definition, intended purpose, performance characteristics, limitations, and how to apply it in practice alongside alternatives and biomarkers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the Sepsis-3 context and the exact components of qSOFA. Then, I should verify its intended purpose versus common misuses. Next, I will review performance metrics and why they vary by setting. After that, I need to check guideline positions and competing tools like SIRS, NEWS, and MEWS. Then, I will examine special populations and the role of biomarkers. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, safety-focused approach and conclude with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the definition and components so I don't gloss over basics. The qSOFA is a three-item bedside score for suspected infection outside the ICU: assign one point each for respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, and altered mental status (GCS < 15), with a positive screen defined as two or more points, indicating higher risk of poor outcomes including mortality; importantly, it requires no labs and was designed for rapid, repeatable assessment in non-ICU settings [^115cvT42] [^112Zjkjc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what qSOFA does. I need to ensure I'm precise about its intended purpose. The Sepsis-3 task force framed qSOFA as a prognostic prompt to identify patients with suspected infection who are at increased risk of deterioration, not as a diagnostic definition of sepsis; it does not replace clinical judgment and should trigger evaluation for infection and organ dysfunction, consideration of escalation, and closer monitoring rather than serve as a stand-alone diagnostic gatekeeper [^115cvT42] [^112Zjkjc] [^116rLepk].

> Next, I should review performance characteristics and be careful with heterogeneity. Meta-analyses and large cohorts consistently show that qSOFA ≥ 2 has moderate-to-high specificity but low sensitivity for in-hospital mortality, roughly 0.48–0.60 sensitivity and 0.72–0.83 specificity outside the ICU, with pooled estimates around 0.51 sensitivity and 0.83 specificity; this trade-off means it will miss a meaningful fraction of deteriorating patients if used as a sole screening test [^111NhwKy] [^115R39oi] [^113AffCb].

> Wait, let me verify how setting modifies performance because I recall ICU data differ. In ICU cohorts, qSOFA's sensitivity tends to be higher but specificity falls, and SOFA generally outperforms qSOFA for mortality prediction; for example, a large ANZ ICU analysis showed AUROC ~0.75 for SOFA vs ~0.61 for qSOFA, reinforcing that qSOFA is not optimal for ICU prognostication and that SOFA should be preferred when labs are available [^112NV7fA] [^115ZuZmN].

> I should double-check ED-specific evidence and competing tools. Prospective ED data demonstrate that qSOFA predicts mortality better than SIRS or severe sepsis criteria, with AUROC ~0.80, but it remains insufficiently sensitive for screening. Early warning scores like NEWS and MEWS often outperform qSOFA for composite outcomes such as death or ICU transfer, with NEWS typically showing higher sensitivity at comparable workloads, which matters for timely triage and intervention [^111j4ViE] [^113AffCb] [^114SQ8nE].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, age-adapted qSOFA has poor sensitivity and limited utility for mortality prediction compared with age-adapted SOFA, PRISM, and PELOD-2, so it should not be relied upon as a standalone pediatric screening tool. In trauma, prehospital qSOFA correlates with mortality but again shows low sensitivity, and a threshold of ≥ 1 may better identify very low-risk patients rather than using ≥ 2 to rule in risk. In LMICs, prospective data show qSOFA ≥ 2 misses a substantial proportion of patients who die, with sensitivity near 54%, arguing for augmented strategies or lower thresholds [^112eRBQQ] [^11463YfY] [^112GtAtv] [^113NCT9T].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure alignment. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign issues a strong recommendation against using qSOFA alone as a single screening tool compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS, citing moderate-quality evidence; they emphasize that neither qSOFA nor SIRS are ideal screening instruments and that clinical judgment plus early action remain paramount, which reinforces a multimodal approach rather than reliance on any single score [^116zxaTK] [^112nYKpq] [^1112oaM3].

> But wait, what if we combine qSOFA with biomarkers to mitigate its low sensitivity. Recent ED studies show that adding procalcitonin to qSOFA improves early identification of incipient organ dysfunction and sepsis risk over qSOFA alone, with a PPV around 60% and NPV near 89% for a composite endpoint, suggesting a clinically meaningful role for biomarker-augmented risk stratification pending broader validation. SuPAR-guided strategies have also shown signal for improving early management decisions in selected ED populations [^116e9JmU] [^116QWS2x] [^114QQEtf].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-first approach and make sure I'm not overpromising. qSOFA can be used as a rapid, lab-free risk flag in non-ICU settings, but it should not be used to rule out sepsis; patients with qSOFA ≥ 2 warrant urgent evaluation for infection, organ dysfunction, and escalation of care, while patients with qSOFA = 1, especially with concerning clinical features or positive SIRS/NEWS, still merit prompt sepsis workup and close monitoring; integrating qSOFA with early warning scores and, when available, lactate or procalcitonin, improves sensitivity and timeliness of detection, aligning with the principle that no single tool suffices for sepsis screening [^112sLRUS] [^113AffCb] [^116e9JmU].

> Hold on, I should verify that my bottom line is consistent with the evidence. The qSOFA is a simple, prognostic triage adjunct that identifies high-risk patients with suspected infection outside the ICU, but its low sensitivity constrains its use as a standalone screening test; best practice is to pair qSOFA with broader early warning systems, clinical judgment, and, where feasible, biomarkers, while remembering that SOFA remains the reference for defining sepsis-related organ dysfunction and that guidelines advise against qSOFA-only screening strategies [^112Zjkjc] [^116zxaTK] [^112NV7fA].

---

The qSOFA score is a **three-item bedside tool** (respiratory rate ≥ 22, altered mentation, systolic BP ≤ 100 mmHg) for rapid risk stratification in suspected infection outside the ICU [^115cvT42]. A score of **≥ 2 predicts higher mortality** and ICU transfer, but it has low sensitivity and should not be used alone to screen for sepsis [^113AffCb] [^116zxaTK]. It is simple, requires no labs, and is best used with clinical judgment and other scores like NEWS or SIRS; adding lactate or procalcitonin can improve early detection [^116KU7Y8] [^116e9JmU].

---

## Components and calculation

The qSOFA score comprises **three clinical variables**, each assigned one point if present:

| **Variable** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory rate | ≥ 22 breaths per minute |
| Altered mentation | Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 15 |
| Hypotension | Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg |

---

A **score of 2 or more** indicates a higher risk of poor outcomes, including increased in-hospital mortality and ICU transfer [^113AffCb].

---

## Clinical utility and performance

The qSOFA score was designed for rapid, bedside risk stratification in non-ICU settings, including emergency departments and general wards [^1137daW6]. It is simple, requires no laboratory tests, and can be quickly calculated from vital signs and mental status assessment [^112Zjkjc]. Several studies have evaluated its **predictive accuracy**:

- **Mortality prediction**: qSOFA ≥ 2 is associated with higher in-hospital mortality in patients with suspected infection outside the ICU [^111j3G2u].
- **ICU transfer**: qSOFA ≥ 2 predicts ICU transfer and prolonged ICU stay [^113AffCb] [^1127mFTz].
- **Comparison with other scores**: qSOFA generally outperforms SIRS for predicting mortality but has lower sensitivity, making it less suitable as a standalone screening tool [^115R39oi] [^113AffCb].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite its simplicity and utility, the qSOFA score has several **limitations and controversies**:

- **Sensitivity concerns**: qSOFA has low sensitivity, potentially missing patients with sepsis who do not meet the ≥ 2 threshold [^111NhwKy].
- **Specificity concerns**: qSOFA may have lower specificity in certain populations, such as patients with chronic liver disease or immunocompromised states.
- **Not a diagnostic tool**: qSOFA is not intended to diagnose sepsis but to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes [^112Zjkjc].
- **Guideline recommendations**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021 guidelines recommend against using qSOFA alone as a screening tool for sepsis or septic shock, favoring other tools like SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS [^116zxaTK] [^112nYKpq].

---

## Integration with other clinical tools and biomarkers

To improve predictive accuracy, the qSOFA score can be integrated with other clinical tools and biomarkers. Combining qSOFA with **lactate levels** improves sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality and organ dysfunction [^notfound]. Adding **procalcitonin** to qSOFA enhances early detection of sepsis and improves prognostic accuracy [^116e9JmU]. Early warning scores such as NEWS and MEWS may outperform qSOFA in certain settings, particularly for predicting ICU admission and mortality [^113AffCb] [^114SQ8nE].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

The qSOFA score has been evaluated across various clinical scenarios and patient populations:

- **Emergency department**: Useful for rapid risk stratification of patients with suspected infection, guiding triage and management decisions [^111j4ViE].
- **General wards**: Helps identify patients at risk of deterioration, prompting early intervention and escalation of care [^116vYcDt].
- **Resource-limited settings**: Particularly valuable in low-resource settings where laboratory tests may not be readily available [^11359pQi] [^1114jTYv].
- **Pediatric populations**: Age-adjusted qSOFA scores have been developed, but their utility remains limited compared to adult populations [^11463YfY].

---

## Recent developments and modifications

Recent research has explored modifications to the qSOFA score to enhance its predictive performance. Age-adjusted qSOFA scores have been developed for pediatric populations, though their utility remains limited [^11463YfY]. Alternative thresholds, such as **qSOFA ≥ 1**, have been proposed to improve sensitivity, albeit at the cost of specificity [^116F4q9Y]. Integration with **biomarkers** — such as lactate and procalcitonin — has been shown to improve predictive accuracy and early detection of sepsis [^116KU7Y8] [^116e9JmU].

---

The qSOFA score is a simple, rapid tool for risk stratification in suspected infection outside the ICU, but its **low sensitivity limits standalone use**. It should be integrated with clinical judgment and other tools or biomarkers to improve early detection and outcomes.

### Comparison of qSOFA and hospital early warning scores for prognosis in suspected sepsis in emergency department patients: a systematic review [^114SQ8nE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many tools exist to facilitate early recognition. This review compares two tools: the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and Early Warning Scores (National/Modified Early Warning Scores (NEWS/MEWS)) for predicting intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality when applied in the emergency department.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, Embase and Cochrane Library, handsearching of references and a grey literature search with no language or date restrictions. Two authors selected studies and quality assessment completed using QUADAS-2. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivities and specificities were compared.

Results

13 studies were included, totalling 403 865 patients. All reported mortality and six reported ICU admission. The ranges for AUROC estimates varied from little better than chance to good prediction of mortality (NEWS: 0.59–0.88; qSOFA: 0.57–0.79; MEWS 0.56–0.75), however, individual papers generally reported higher AUROC values for NEWS than qSOFA. NEWS values demonstrated a tendency towards better sensitivity for ICU admission (NEWS ≥ 5, 46%-91%; qSOFA ≥ 2, 12%-53%) and mortality (NEWS ≥ 5, 51%-97%; qSOFA ≥ 2, 14%-71%) but lower specificity (ICU: NEWS ≥ 5, 25%-91%; qSOFA ≥ 2, 67%-99%; mortality: NEWS ≥ 5, 22%-91%; qSOFA ≥ 2, 58%-99%).

Conclusion

The wide range of AUROC estimates and high heterogeneity limit our conclusions. Allowing for this, the NEWS AUROC was consistently higher than qSOFA within individual papers. Both scores allow threshold setting, determined by the preferred compromise between sensitivity and specificity. At established thresholds NEWS tended to higher sensitivity while qSOFA tended to a higher specificity.

### Clinical scores and formal triage for screening of sepsis and adverse outcomes on arrival in an emergency department all-comer cohort [^114WNazQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Early recognition of sepsis remains a major challenge. The clinical utility of the Quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score is still undefined. Several studies have tested its prognostic value. However, its ability to diagnose sepsis is still unknown.

Objective

Our aim was to compare the performance of qSOFA, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and formal triage with the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) algorithm to identify patients with sepsis and predict adverse outcomes on arrival in an emergency department (ED) all-comer cohort.

Methods

We included all patients presenting consecutively to the ED during a 3-week period. We used vital signs recorded at triage to calculate the study scores. Two independent assessors retrospectively assigned the primary outcome of sepsis according to Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock criteria in a chart review process.

Results

There were 2523 cases included in the analysis and 39 (1.6%) had the primary outcome of sepsis. The area under the curve for sepsis was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–0.86) for qSOFA, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73–0.87) for SIRS, 0.85 (95% CI 0.77–0.92) for NEWS, and 0.77 (95% CI 0.70–0.83) for ESI.

Conclusions

qSOFA offered high specificity for the prediction of sepsis and adverse outcomes. However, its low sensitivity does not support widespread use as a screening tool for sepsis. NEWS outperformed qSOFA for prediction of adverse outcomes and screening for sepsis.

### QSOFA is a useful prognostic factor for 30-day mortality in infected patients fulfilling the SIRS criteria for sepsis [^1168ASrs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The "quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment" (qSOFA) score is a bedside risk-stratification tool to predict the likelihood of organ dysfunction. This study evaluated the qSOFA score as a prognostic factor for 30-day mortality in emergency department (ED) patients with sepsis identified by the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria.

Methods

A historical cohort study was conducted reviewing patients admitted to a single-center ED from November 1, 2013, to October 31, 2014. All patients with suspected or proven infections who fulfilled two or more SIRS criteria were included. Data of SIRS, qSOFA and baseline clinical data were obtained from triage forms and patient records.

Results

A total of 434 patients with sepsis of any severity were included. A total of 73 (16.8%) had a qSOFA score of ≥ 2 and were more frequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.0 vs. 6.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference 8.9–29.7%) and had increased 30-day mortality (32.9 vs. 9.1%, 95% CI of the difference 12.6–35.0%) compared to patients with a qSOFA score of < 2. In an adjusted logistic regression model, a qSOFA score of ≥ 2 was independently associated with 30-day mortality (odds ratio 4.83; 95% CI 2.11–11.02).

Conclusion

Almost one third of the patients with a qSOFA score of ≥ 2 had died within 30 days and a qSOFA score of ≥ 2 was independently associated with mortality. This study indicated that qSOFA score of at least two could provide useful prognostic information for septic patients defined by the SIRS criteria.

### Comparison of QSOFA score and SIRS criteria as screening mechanisms for emergency department sepsis [^116m3iXy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score has been shown to accurately predict mortality in septic patients and is part of recently proposed diagnostic criteria for sepsis. We sought to ascertain the sensitive of the score in diagnosing sepsis, as well as the diagnostic timeliness of the score when compared to traditional systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria in a population of emergency department (ED) patients treated in the ED, admitted, and subsequently discharged with a diagnosis of sepsis.

Methods

Electronic health records of 200 patients who were treated for suspected sepsis in our ED and ultimately discharged from our hospital with a diagnosis of sepsis were randomly selected for review from a population of adult ED patients (N = 1880). Data extracted included the presence of SIRS criteria and the qSOFA score as well as time required to meet said criteria.

Results

In this cohort, 94.5% met SIRS criteria while in the ED whereas only 58.3% met qSOFA. The mean time from arrival to SIRS documentation was 47.1min (95% CI: 36.5–57.8) compared to 84.0min (95% CI: 62.2–105.8) for qSOFA. The median ED "door" to positive SIRS criteria was 12min and 29min for qSOFA.

Conclusions

Although qSOFA may be valuable in predicting sepsis-related mortality, it performed poorly as a screening tool for identifying sepsis in the ED. As the time to meet qSOFA criteria was significantly longer than for SIRS, relying on qSOFA alone may delay initiation of evidence-based interventions known to improve sepsis-related outcomes.

### Quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and early warning scores for detecting clinical deterioration in infected patients outside the intensive care unit [^113AffCb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The 2016 definitions of sepsis included the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score to identify high-risk patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU).

Objectives

We sought to compare qSOFA with other commonly used early warning scores.

Methods

All admitted patients who first met the criteria for suspicion of infection in the emergency department (ED) or hospital wards from November 2008 until January 2016 were included. The qSOFA, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were compared for predicting death and ICU transfer.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 30,677 included patients, 1,649 (5.4%) died and 7,385 (24%) experienced the composite outcome (death or ICU transfer). Sixty percent (n = 18,523) first met the suspicion criteria in the ED. Discrimination for in-hospital mortality was highest for NEWS (area under the curve [AUC], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–0.79), followed by MEWS (AUC, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.71–0.74), qSOFA (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.67–0.70), and SIRS (AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.63–0.66) (P < 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons). Using the highest non-ICU score of patients, ≥ 2 SIRS had a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 13% for the composite outcome compared with 54% and 67% for qSOFA ≥ 2, 59% and 70% for MEWS ≥ 5, and 67% and 66% for NEWS ≥ 8, respectively. Most patients met ≥ 2 SIRS criteria 17 hours before the combined outcome compared with 5 hours for ≥ 2 and 17 hours for ≥ 1 qSOFA criteria.

Conclusions

Commonly used early warning scores are more accurate than the qSOFA score for predicting death and ICU transfer in non-ICU patients. These results suggest that the qSOFA score should not replace general early warning scores when risk-stratifying patients with suspected infection.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^116s6suo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In recent years, the SIRS criteria were criticized for being too non-specific. The current use of two or more SIRS criteria to identify sepsis was unanimously considered by the task force to be unhelpful.

However, the task force stated that, although SIRS was not helpful in identifying patients with organ dysfunction, non-specific SIRS criteria still might have utility in identifying patients having infection.

Sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The aim of this definition is to emphasize the primacy of the non-homeostatic host response to infection, the potential lethality, and the need for urgent recognition.

Organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more (Table 1) which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%.

Table 1
SOFA score

Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis and should be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/l (> 18 mg/dl) in the absence of hypovolemia. The term "severe sepsis" is now superfluous and has been removed from the current definitions.

The Sepsis-3 definitions suggest that patients with at least two of these three clinical variables may be prone for the poor outcome typical of sepsis: (1) low blood pressure (SBP ≤ 100 mmHg), (2) high respiratory rate (≥ 22 breaths per min), or (3) altered mentation (Glasgow coma scale < 15) (quick SOFA). It is supposed to be useful in out-of-hospital, emergency surgery (ED), or general hospital ward settings, and patients with positive qSOFA should be used to further investigate for organ dysfuntion. The qSOFA score should not be regarded as a diagnostic criterion for defining sepsis. Rather, it should be regarded as a warning for patients with suspected infection who are likely to have poor outcomes.

### Prognostic evaluation of quick sequential organ failure assessment score in ICU patients with sepsis across different income settings [^115Wv7BL]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies on qSOFA mortality prediction in ICU patients with sepsis have generally used all-cause hospital mortality as the endpoint. However, since calculation of qSOFA is based on physiological parameters alone, its predictive performance is likely more dependent on time from assessment than severity scores such as APACHE II that incorporate variables on chronic health. This has been demonstrated in a large retrospective study in Taiwan which showed that the association between qSOFA mortality was greater at 72 h than 28-days.

The Management of Severe sepsis in Asia's Intensive Care unitS (MOSAICS) II was a prospective, observational, cross-sectional point prevalence study on sepsis epidemiology in 386 ICUs from 22 Asian countries/regions across all income settings. Detailed admission physiological data was collected from a well-defined cohort of 4980 ICU patients admitted for sepsis. In this secondary analysis of MOSAICS II, our primary aim was to determine the association between qSOFA and 28-day mortality in ICU patients admitted for sepsis. Association of qSOFA with early (3-day), medium (28-day), late (90-day) mortality was assessed in low and lower middle income (LLMIC), upper middle income (UMIC) and high income (HIC) countries/regions. Predictive performance of qSOFA on 28-day mortality was compared to APACHE II, SIRS, SOFA. Additional value of lactate measurement on qSOFA sepsis mortality prediction was assessed. Lastly, we described the characteristics and outcomes of different clinical sepsis phenotypes in patients who met Sepsis-3 SOFA criteria and simultaneously fulfilled SIRS and qSOFA criteria.

### Rapid systematic review: the appropriate use of quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) in the emergency department [^114mD2o1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The concept of sepsis has recently been redefined by an International Task Force. The task force recommended the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score instead of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria to identify patients at high risk of mortality from sepsis outside of the intensive care unit, including in emergency departments (EDs). However, the primary outcome for qSOFA is prediction of risk for mortality, which is not the principal outcome measure considered in the ED. From the ED perspective, the priorities are the identification (diagnosis) of the septic patient and then the initiation of time-sensitive, life-saving interventions.

Method

We performed a structured review of PubMed from January 2012 to December 2018, limited to reports involving human subjects and written in English language and containing relevant keywords. The highest-quality studies were then reviewed in a structured format. We utilized these studies to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of SIRS and qSOFA for diagnosis of sepsis.

Results

Thirteen unique articles were identified for further review, and the 11 highest-grade articles (C and D) were determined to be appropriate for inclusion in this review, and the two low-grade articles were excluded (E).

Conclusions

Based on multiple retrospective and few prospective studies, it appears that qSOFA performs poorly in comparison with SIRS as a diagnostic tool for ED patients who may have sepsis or septic shock. However, qSOFA does have a strong prognostic accuracy for mortality in those ED patients already diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^113jnFLe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for peptic ulcer disease, more specifically with respect to risk and severity assessment (perforated ulcer), WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using the following scoring systems in patients with perforated peptic ulcer:

- the Boey, PULP and ASA score for risk stratification and prediction of outcomes

- the SOFA and qSOFA scores for the evaluation and assessment of the severity of the disease.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^1112oaM3]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) — variables, performance, and use as a screening tool are summarized as follows: The qSOFA uses three variables — a Glasgow Coma Score < 15, a respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths/min and a systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mm Hg — and when any two of these variables are present simultaneously, the patient is considered qSOFA positive. In the original derivation study, 24% of infected patients had a qSOFA score 2 or 3, but these patients accounted for 70% of poor outcomes. Although the presence of a positive qSOFA should alert the clinician to the possibility of sepsis in all resource settings; given the poor sensitivity of the qSOFA, the panel issued a strong recommendation against its use as a single screening tool, and neither SIRS nor qSOFA are ideal screening tools for sepsis.

### Predictive accuracy of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment score in brazil. A prospective multicenter study [^114uBNaa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is an important cause of death worldwide, including low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although mortality rates are decreasing in high-income countries, the burden is still high in LMICs, with mortality rates of 30% to 70%. Recently, the Sepsis-3 task force proposed a new score based on clinical parameters and designated as the Quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a strategy to identify among patients with suspected infection those with higher risk of poor outcomes. In large databases from high-income countries, qSOFA had adequate prediction for mortality and for longer ICU stays among non-ICU patients.

The Sepsis-3 task force suggested qSOFA as a simple tool to prompt clinicians "to further investigate for organ dysfunction, to initiate or escalate therapy as appropriate, and to consider referral to critical care or increase the frequency of monitoring". Although the authors clearly stated that failure to meet two or more qSOFA criteria should not delay in investigation or treatment of infection deemed necessary by the practitioners, qSOFA is often considered as a screening tool to "rule out" sepsis in many emergency departments (EDs) and wards. In LMICs, where rapid laboratory testing is often not readily available, healthcare personnel may be particularly tempted to use qSOFA as rule-out screening tool. This misuse of qSOFA use is questionable because recent publications have shown it has low sensitivity for predicting mortality. In LMICs, where sepsis awareness is low and mortality is high, the use of a low-sensitivity screening tool may delay diagnosis and endanger missed cases.

We hypothesized that qSOFA has a low sensitivity to predict mortality in sepsis when assessed at the moment the clinical suspicion of sepsis is made by the healthcare team. Under this hypothesis, mortality rates of patients with a qSOFA score less than or equal to 1 at the time suspicion of infection or sepsis would be high. We also hypothesized that alternative tools would have higher sensitivity. Thus, we designed this prospective study to assess the sensitivity of qSOFA assessed at the clinical suspicion of sepsis to predict mortality in ED and ward patients in Brazilian hospitals affiliated with the Instituto Latino-Americano de Sepsis (ILAS) network, compared with alternative tools.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1138QvVG]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The last few decades of sepsis research have helped clinicians better understand the importance of identifying sepsis early and treating aggressively. Nonetheless, there is still much debate about how to identify these patients and which criteria are most predictive for the development of sepsis and septic shock. The recent updates, particularly the recommendations regarding SOFA and qSOFA scores, operationalize the definitions of sepsis into a clinically useful model that can be used by clinicians to identify the patients most at risk of deterioration. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Performance of the quick sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment score as a prognostic tool in infected patients outside the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115R39oi]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The usefulness of the quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score in providing bedside criteria for early prediction of poor outcomes in patients with suspected infection remains controversial. We investigated the prognostic performance of a positive qSOFA score outside the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with positive systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data were pooled on the basis of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic OR. Overall test performance was summarized using a hierarchical summary ROC and the AUC. Meta-regression analysis was used to identify potential sources of bias.

Results

We identified 23 studies with a total of 146,551 patients. When predicting in-hospital mortality in our meta-analysis, we identified pooled sensitivities of 0.51 for a positive qSOFA score and 0.86 for positive SIRS criteria, as well as pooled specificities of 0.83 for a positive qSOFA score and 0.29 for positive SIRS criteria. Discrimination for in-hospital mortality had similar AUCs between the two tools (0.74 vs. 0.71; P = 0.816). Using meta-regression analysis, an overall mortality rate ≥ 10% and timing of qSOFA score measurement could be significant sources of heterogeneity. For predicting acute organ dysfunction, although the AUC for a positive qSOFA score was higher than that for positive SIRS criteria (0.87 vs. 0.76; P < 0.001), the pooled sensitivity of positive qSOFA score was very low (0.47). In addition, a positive qSOFA score tended to be inferior to positive SIRS criteria in predicting ICU admission (0.63 vs. 0.78; P = 0.121).

Conclusions

A positive qSOFA score had high specificity outside the ICU in early detection of in-hospital mortality, acute organ dysfunction, and ICU admission, but low sensitivity may have limitations as a predictive tool for adverse outcomes. Because between-study heterogeneity was highly represented among the studies, our results should be interpreted with caution.

### The prognostic utility of protein C as a biomarker for adult sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115psTom]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rationale

Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. With 48.9 million sepsis cases and 11 million sepsis-related deaths in 2017, the disease has a mortality rate of approximately 22% and represents 19.7% of deaths worldwide. To address the high mortality rate, the Surviving Sepsis campaign emphasizes the importance of early therapeutic interventions and improved screening for high-risk patients.

Diagnosing early-stage sepsis and identifying those at high-risk for mortality remain a challenge due to the disease's heterogeneous presentation. Sepsis presentation and outcome are affected by multiple factors, including patient characteristics, the causative microorganism and the site of infection. While the current Sepsis-3 definition uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale to diagnose patients, the use of a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarker could aid timely and appropriate treatment. In addition, the use of SOFA and quick SOFA (qSOFA), as risk stratification models, is limited by low specificity, and the sensitivity and specificity of qSOFA have been shown to vary widely across studies. These limitations drive the need for a new rapid and sensitive diagnostic and prognostic test.

### In search of the ideal risk score in sepsis [^115ZuZmN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

qSOFA was introduced as a mortality prediction tool on the basis of North American and European cohorts with an area under the curve of 0.81 for patients outside the ICU. However, in a large study in patients admitted to the ICU in Australia and New Zealand, in which investigators used the scores calculated within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, SOFA had the greatest prognostic accuracy (AUROC, 0.75), with qSOFA and SIRS having AUROCs of 0.61 and 0.59, respectively.

Early warning scores could also be more accurate than qSOFA scores for predicting mortality and ICU transfer. In a recent study by Churpek and colleagues, qSOFA was found to be less accurate than early warning scores for predicting in-hospital mortality in non-ICU patients with suspicion of infection. qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2 had a sensitivity of 68.7%, specificity of 63.5%, and AUROC of 0.69 (0.67–0.70), whereas the AUROC was 0.77 (0.76–0.79) for the National Early Warning Score and 0.73 (0.71–0.74) for MEWS.

Though the authors conducted a single-center study, together with the other studies, the accuracy of the qSOFA score as a risk score remains questionable. SOFA and early warning scores seem to be better mortality predictors.

### Comparison of qSOFA score, SOFA score, and SIRS criteria for the prediction of infection and mortality among surgical intermediate and intensive care patients [^117KE5mQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The rapid identification of sepsis serves as the basis for its successful management. According to the current recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, the SOFA score should be used as a predictive tool for the detection of sepsis as well as for the risk stratification of critically ill patients. In addition, the qSOFA score has been introduced for the identification of septic patients outside of the ICU. However, to our knowledge, both scores have not been evaluated in the context of surgical IMCU patients. Therefore, this is the first study comparing the predictive value for presumed sepsis of the SOFA and qSOFA scores, as well as the 1992 defined SIRS criteria, in a large cohort of 13,780 surgical IMCU and ICU patients of a tertiary university hospital.

Overall, among encounters with suspected infection in IMCU patients, none of the analyzed scoring tools showed sufficient predictive validity for severe infection (defined as the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics), whereas the qSOFA score was able to predict mortality in a sufficient manner. Interestingly, even though the assessment with the historical SIRS criteria does not meet the current practice guidelines, they were more predictive than the SOFA score within the IMCU patient cohort. Furthermore, among ICU patients as well as patients who underwent a combined IMCU and ICU treatment, all analyzed scoring systems failed to provide sufficient validity for the prediction of infection and mortality. Only in patients who underwent a combined IMCU and ICU treatment the SOFA score was able to adequately predict mortality.

### Sepsis prediction model for determining sepsis vs SIRS, qSOFA, and SOFA [^1173b4c9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of 60 507 hospital admissions, we found that although the SPM marginally outperformed existing prediction scores in balanced accuracy for classification of sepsis, it suffers from poor timeliness, limiting its clinical application for sepsis diagnosis and treatment. As with all questions of testing performance, the balance between missed true cases and overtreatment of false positives must be weighed. In the case of sepsis, prioritization of timely treatment is paramount, given the potentially severe consequences when the diagnosis is missed or delayed. Irrespective of the clinical utility of the SPM as a prediction model, sepsis remains an area that is underresearched and underdeveloped from the perspective of prediction modeling. The current tools continue to leave enormous gaps in our ability to fully determine which patients need urgent treatment for sepsis and reduce the high burden of associated negative health outcomes.

### Biomarkers improve diagnostics of sepsis in adult patients with suspected organ dysfunction based on the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score in the emergency department [^116QWS2x]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Can the combined use of biomarkers and clinical scores in the emergency department (ED) improve the early identification of patients at risk for sepsis?

Findings: Biomarkers of infection and organ dysfunction, most notably procalcitonin, substantially improved early prediction of sepsis over and above quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) alone.

Meanings: A combination of qSOFA and procalcitonin provides a simple screening tool to improve prediction of sepsis on ED admission. This may potentially impact upon patient management though this needs to be tested in prospective studies.

Sepsis is a potential life-threatening complication of an infectious disease. Development of acute organ dysfunction as a result of an inappropriate host response to the underlying infection is the hallmark of this syndrome. This remains the most frequent driver of death on ICUs worldwide. While infection is, in general, a commonplace and frequently self-limiting event, progression to organ dysfunction is relatively rare. As such, a broad range of patients with suspected or proven infection, most of which are benign, present to the emergency department (ED). Delayed identification of patients with overt or incipient organ dysfunction is a well-documented problem in the ED and may have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality.

In this context, biomarkers providing objective and measurable indicators of sepsis could offer considerable utility for diagnostic, prognostic, and theranostic enrichment. This is particularly relevant in view of the large numbers of patients presenting with fever or other nonspecific signs of infection to the ED, as well as those with a noninfectious mimic that can simulate sepsis. Many articles have addressed various biomarkers reflecting the host response in sepsis, early recognition of organ dysfunction, risk stratification, and patient management including biomarker-guided antibiotic stewardship. However, clear recommendations regarding use of biomarkers in guidelines such as the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign" are scarce. Only the incorporation of plasma lactate levels to diagnose septic shock and the use of procalcitonin to terminate anti-infective therapy in the context of antibiotic stewardship are supported by an evidence base and subsequent guideline recommendations. This paucity reflects the absence of adequately powered studies to assess any potential patient-centered benefit through measuring biomarkers, such as diagnosing sepsis in unselected patients presenting to an ED.

### Accuracy of quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for predicting mortality in hospitalized patients with suspected infection: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^111NhwKy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria to predict in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with suspected infection.

Methods

This meta-analysis followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group consensus statement for conducting and reporting the results of systematic review. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for the observational studies which reported predictive utility of qSOFA score for predicting mortality in patients with suspected or proven infection with the following search words: 'qSOFA', 'q-SOFA', 'quick-SOFA', 'Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment', 'quick SOFA'. Sensitivity, specificity, area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with 95% confidence interval (CI) of qSOFA and SIRS criteria for predicting in-hospital mortality was collected for each study and a 2 × 2 table was created for each study.

Results

Data of 406 802 patients from 45 observational studies were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) of qSOFA ≥ 2 for predicting mortality in patients who were not in an intensive care unit (ICU) was 0.48 (0.41–0.55) and 0.83 (0.78–0.87), respectively. Pooled sensitivity (95% CI) of qSOFA ≥ 2 for predicting mortality in patients (both ICU and non-ICU settings) with suspected infection was 0.56 (0.47–0.65) and pooled specificity (95% CI) was 0.78 (0.71–0.83).

Conclusion

qSOFA has been found to be a poorly sensitive predictive marker for in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with suspected infection. It is reasonable to recommend developing another scoring system with higher sensitivity to identify high-risk patients with infection.

### Use of sepsis-related diagnostic criteria in primary care: a survey among general practitioners [^111vZA2s]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated and disproportionate inflammatory response to an infection, causing life-threatening organ failure and annually affects around 49 million people worldwide. In the Netherlands, this results in around 13 000 hospital admissions per year. Sepsis is the leading cause of death worldwide with an in-hospital mortality rate of 21%, resulting in an estimate of 11 million deaths per year. Reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with sepsis remains a major health care challenge. Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in hospital settings, especially with the launch of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) in 2004. Early recognition and initiation of adequate treatment are crucial for successful treatment of a patient with sepsis. Measurement of vital signs is part of triage as performed in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), while abnormal vital signs included in 'sepsis-criteria' should trigger treatment guided by a sepsis protocol: a key step that is critical for the success of the SSC. Several tools support the assessment of a potentially septic patient in hospitals, of which the most well known are the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score. The current consensus definitions advise the use of the qSOFA, a clinical decision tool for bedside evaluation, to identify patients with sepsis out-of-hospital, in the ED and on general wards. The qSOFA consists of an altered mental status, a respiratory rate of ≥ 22/minute and a systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg. The qSOFA is positive when at least two of these items are present and implies an increased risk of sepsis-related mortality.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^114QUBUB]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Our main finding, that qSOFA predicts mortality better than SIRS criteria, was derived from comparison of AUCs. It should be emphasized that although AUCs are good to show that a test has overall better discriminatory capacity than another test, the real features of interest are the sensitivity and specificity of a given cutoff point, which is proposed for clinical use (e.g. for SIRS this point was two). In Table 2, it is showed that a SIRS score ≥ 3 would be a better discriminator than SIRS ≥ 2 for in-hospital mortality. In Table 2, we provided the sensitivity and specificity at different cutoff points of qSOFA and SIRS criteria for all outcomes.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the predictive accuracy of qSOFA versus SIRS criteria for outcomes other than mortality and ICU stay. The authors of the original qSOFA publication acknowledged it as a limitation that they focused to only two outcomes (namely, mortality and ICU stay) and they advocated for research on other outcomes. We found that qSOFA was not better than SIRS criteria for predicting adverse events other than mortality and ICU-free days, namely ventilator-free days, any organ dysfunction free-days, and renal dysfunction-free days. Although it could not be precluded that our study was not big enough to reveal a difference in such outcomes, another plausible explanation may be that qSOFA does not take into account signs of such organ failures as renal failure, hepatic failure, hypoxemia, or coagulopathy. Even proponents of qSOFA hinted at its potential weakness to capture forms of organ failure different than those assessed using qSOFA. Future research is needed to confirm or refute this interesting finding.

### Impact of a qSOFA-based triage procedure on antibiotic timing in ED patients with sepsis: a prospective interventional study [^116AUdfS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

It has not been investigated whether the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment score (qSOFA), a new bedside tool for early sepsis detection, may help accelerating antibiotic initiation in ED patients with sepsis.

Methods

In this prospective pre/post quasi-experimental single-ED study, patients admitted with a suspected bacterial infection were managed using standard triage procedures only (baseline) or in association with qSOFA (intervention, with prioritization of patients with a qSOFA ≥ 2).

Results

A total of 151/328 (46.0%) and 185/350 (52.8%) patients with definite bacterial infection met the criteria for sepsis in the baseline and intervention periods, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of a qSOFA ≥ 2 for sepsis prediction were 17.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.6%-21.7%) and 98.8% (95% CI, 97.0%-99.5%). Eleven (7.3%) and 28 (13.5%) patients with sepsis in the baseline and intervention periods received a first antibiotic dose within one hour following triage (primary endpoint, absolute difference 6.2%, 95% CI [-0.5%, 12.7%], P = 0.08). The proportions of patients with sepsis receiving a first antibiotic dose within three hours following triage (39.7% [50/151] versus 36.8% [68/185], absolute difference - 2.9%, 95% CI [-13.3%, 7.3%], P = 0.65), requiring ICU admission, or dying in the hospital were similar in both periods. The median ED occupation rate at triage was 104.3% (interquartile range [IQR], 80.4%-128.3%), with a median number of 157 ED visits per day (IQR, 147–169).

Conclusions

A qSOFA-based triage procedure does not improve antibiotic timing and outcomes in patients with sepsis admitted to a high-volume ED. The qSOFA value at triage was poorly sensitive for early sepsis detection. Trial registration (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT03299894.

### QSOFA combined with suPAR for early risk detection and guidance of antibiotic treatment in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial [^114QQEtf]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study following a two-stage process showed that combining qSOFA score with suPAR at the ED may guide early administration of meropenem and prevent early deterioration of the patient. Even if this trial ended prematurely due to the changes in ED functions during the pandemic, SUPERIOR managed to be successful in achieving the primary endpoint. In addition, four other main endpoints were met; ≥ 2-point increase of admission SOFA the first 24 h was prevented, the resolution of infection was increased and the time to infection resolution was shortened; and finally, the prognostic performance of the qSOFA/suPAR combination was validated. Following a post hoc analysis, the benefit from meropenem treatment on decrease of the SOFA score after 72 and 96 h was also shown.

Although the new Sepsis-3 definitions have reduced the rate of misclassification of critically ill patients, sepsis is still misdiagnosed or diagnosed late in the ED. The role of commonly used rapid assessment tools outside the ICU for the detection of sepsis or septic shock is controversial, even in the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 guidelines, in which the single use of qSOFA score is not recommended. Based on two previous validation analyses of the new Sepsis-3 definitions, the sensitivity of qSOFA score ≥ 2 to predict 28-day hospital mortality is close to 60%. This means that a substantial risk for death exists among patients with one point of qSOFA. The SUPERIOR trial showed how risk prediction in these patients may be improved with the use of suPAR guiding early intervention.

### Early identification of severe community-acquired pneumonia: a retrospective observational study [^115mmNDQ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide when combined with lower respiratory tract infections. It is associated with significant mortalityand frequently leads to sepsiswith mortality rates rising to 30%. Early identification of patients with severe CAP enables modification of management strategies and improves outcomes for patients.

To identify those at risk of poor outcomes, guidelines for management of CAP and sepsis suggest risk stratification tools should be used; however there is no consensus as to which tool should be used.

Severity assessment tools have been developed specifically for identifying patients at risk of deterioration due to sepsis. The quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment tool (qSOFA)is the recommended tool to screen patients with suspected infection outside the intensive care unit (ICU)(one point for each of altered mentation, respiratory rate (RR) ≥ 22 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 100 mm Hg, with a score ≥ 2 suggesting high risk for deterioration). More generic tools designed to predict deterioration regardless of aetiology have also been designed, such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), widely used in the English National Health Service.NEWS is a composite score assessing level of alertness, RR, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, oxygen saturation and temperature with increasing values for more abnormal measurements (see online supplementary eTable 1 for a full description). A score of ≥ 3 in any category or score ≥ 5 overall triggers urgent patient review.

### Assessment of clinical criteria for sepsis: for the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3) [^115cvT42]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA score)" for sepsis and septic shock.

The Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA score) is a clinical tool designed for rapid identification of patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk of poor outcomes, including in-hospital mortality. The qSOFA score is particularly useful in non-intensive care settings where it can guide clinicians in making decisions about patient management and potential need for intensive care.

The qSOFA score is determined based on three primary components: systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 100 mmHg, respiratory rate greater than or equal to 22/min, and altered mental status. Each of these components is associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with suspected infection.

The qSOFA score is calculated by assigning one point for each of the three components that are present. A higher score indicates a higher risk of mortality. The presence of two or more of these components (either systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg and respiratory rate ≥ 22/min, or respiratory rate ≥ 22/min and altered mental status, or systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg and altered mental status) meets the criteria for sepsis and indicates a high risk of mortality. If these criteria are not met, the risk of mortality is considered lower.

The qSOFA score does not replace clinical judgment but rather provides a simple, bedside tool to help clinicians identify patients with suspected infection who may require higher levels of care.

The Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score calculator evaluates three specific clinical criteria related to the patient's current health status. These criteria focus on indicators of organ dysfunction, which can suggest heightened risk of sepsis and increased mortality risk. There are three input options users need to consider:

1. Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg
2. Respiratory rate ≥ 22/min
3. Altered mental status

Each criterion functions as a potential marker of sepsis. The calculator does not assign numerical values; instead, it assesses whether any combination of two or more criteria is met to determine if the patient is at heightened risk. The assessment logic is as follows:

- Determine if any two or more of the criteria are satisfied.
- If both Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg and Respiratory rate ≥ 22/min are true, or if both Respiratory rate ≥ 22/min and Altered mental status are true, or if both Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg and Altered mental status are true, the result is interpreted as "Meets criteria for sepsis. Risk of mortality is high".
- If fewer than two criteria are true, the result is "Criteria not met".
- If no selection is made for all inputs, advise the user to complete the inputs with "Please make a selection for all inputs".

This calculator has binary evaluation criteria: either the conditions are met indicating a higher risk of sepsis and mortality, or they are not, meaning the criteria for suspected sepsis are not met. Here is a representation of the input-output logic in assessing the sepsis risk:

| **Criterion 1** | **Criterion 2** | **Criterion 3** | **Output** |
|-|-|-|-|
| True | True | Any | Meets criteria for sepsis. Risk of mortality is high. |
| Any | True | True | Meets criteria for sepsis. Risk of mortality is high. |
| True | Any | True | Meets criteria for sepsis. Risk of mortality is high. |
| False | False | False | Criteria not met |
| Partial Input | ∅ |Please make a selection for all inputs. |

### Prehospital quick sequential organ failure assessment score to predict in-hospital mortality among patients with trauma [^112GtAtv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score is calculated from three variables measured at the scene of trauma-systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate and consciousness. This study aimed to evaluate the discriminative ability of the prehospital qSOFA score for in-hospital mortality in patients with trauma.

Methods

This retrospective multicenter study used data from 42,722 patients with trauma included in a Japanese nationwide trauma registry. All included patients were aged ≥ 18 years old and transferred to hospitals from the scenes of injury. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.

Results

The included patients had a mean age of 59.4 ± 21.5 years and a male predominance (63%). In-hospital mortality occurred in 2612 patients (6%), while 2-day mortality occurred in 1189 of 42,339 patients (3%). When patients were stratified by qSOFA scores, in-hospital mortality rates of 0.9% (105/11783), 5% (941/17839), 12% (1280/11132) and 15% (286/1968) were associated with qSOFA scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P < 0.0001 for trend). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the qSOFA score for in-hospital mortality was 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.69–0.71). A qSOFA score cutoff value ≥ 1 yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 and 0.29, respectively, overall, and a sensitivity of 0.99 in patients younger than 65 years.

Conclusions

The prehospital qSOFA score was strongly associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with trauma. A prehospital qSOFA score cutoff of ≥ 1 can be used to identify patients at a very low risk of death, especially in younger age groups.

### QSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis [^116rLepk]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

We would like to stress that, although SIRS was part of the definition of sepsis in 1992, the qSOFA is not part of the new sepsis definitions. This important difference is illustrated in Fig. 1, with panel A showing that infection and sepsis (by the 1992 definition) are virtually the same — infection without SIRS can be found, but it is relatively rare. By contrast, panel B shows that sepsis (by the new SEPSIS-3 definition) represents only a minority of cases of infection. Moreover, panel B illustrates important aspects of the sepsis definition vis-à-vis infection and qSOFA. For example, sepsis can be present without a qSOFA score ≥ 2 because different forms of organ dysfunction may be present than are assessed using the qSOFA, such as hypoxemia, renal failure, coagulopathy, or hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, a patient may have a qSOFA ≥ 2 without infection; for example, in other acute conditions, such as hypovolemia, severe heart failure, or large pulmonary embolism. Further work remains to be done to determine the predictive validity of qSOFA in such patients. Finally, infected patients may have a qSOFA ≥ 2 and not be septic because the degree of hypotension, tachycardia, and/or altered mentation needed to fulfill qSOFA criteria is not the same as that needed to meet the SOFA organ dysfunction criteria necessary for a diagnosis of sepsis; the qSOFA criteria are thus clinically valuable but imperfect markers of sepsis. Nevertheless, in an analysis of a database of more than 74,000 patients, Seymour et al. recently reported that 75% of patients with suspected infection who had two or more qSOFA points also had at least two SOFA points.

We hope this editorial will clarify that the qSOFA is meant to be used to raise suspicion of sepsis and prompt further action — it is not a replacement for SIRS and is not part of the definition of sepsis.

### Performance of the quick sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment score as a prognostic tool in infected patients outside the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115MUY3K]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

However, we observed wide heterogeneity among the included studies. An important objective of meta-analysis is to investigate the evidence of heterogeneity among studies and to determine whether differences in study design explain the heterogeneity. We found that these findings could be explained partly by potential sources of bias. First, there is the timing of the qSOFA score measurement. Measurement of the qSOFA score at the time of initial suspicion of infection seemed to be easy and clear to apply in clinical practice. However, in pooled estimates, the diagnostic performance of positive qSOFA scores for predicting in-hospital mortality was low at the time of initial suspicion of infection. The use of the worst qSOFA score during the entire stay of the patient enhanced sensitivity. Considering that sepsis is a dynamic, heterogeneous disease, these findings highlight the importance of serial reassessment of the qSOFA score. Second, the severity of infection may affect diagnostic accuracy. When critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock were included in the meta-analysis, the sensitivity of a positive qSOFA score was enhanced. Otherwise, in pooled estimates targeting patients with common suspected or confirmed infections, the sensitivity of a positive qSOFA score was low. Similarly, pooled estimates for trials that included an overall mortality > 10% increased the sensitivity of a positive qSOFA score. Third, study location may be a factor in heterogeneity. The differences in the results between studies may be explained by differences in the healthcare systems of each country. Specifically, high health care accessibility is likely to be biased toward low disease severity.

### Prognostic accuracy of the quick sequential organ failure assessment for mortality in patients with suspected infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111j3G2u]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) has been proposed for prediction of mortality in patients with suspected infection.

Purpose

To summarize and compare the prognostic accuracy of qSOFA and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for prediction of mortality in adult patients with suspected infection.

Data Sources

Four databases from inception through November 2017.

Study Selection

English-language studies using qSOFA for prediction of mortality (in-hospital, 28-day, or 30-day) in adult patients with suspected infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), emergency department (ED), or hospital wards.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standard criteria.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-eight studies were included (n = 385 333). qSOFA was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 60.8% (95% CI, 51.4% to 69.4%) and a pooled specificity of 72.0% (CI, 63.4% to 79.2%) for mortality. The SIRS criteria were associated with a pooled sensitivity of 88.1% (CI, 82.3% to 92.1%) and a pooled specificity of 25.8% (CI, 17.1% to 36.9%). The pooled sensitivity of qSOFA was higher in the ICU population (87.2% [CI, 75.8% to 93.7%]) than the non-ICU population (51.2% [CI, 43.6% to 58.7%]). The pooled specificity of qSOFA was higher in the non-ICU population (79.6% [CI, 73.3% to 84.7%]) than the ICU population (33.3% [CI, 23.8% to 44.4%]).

Limitation

Potential risk of bias in included studies due to qSOFA interpretation and patient selection.

Conclusion

qSOFA had poor sensitivity and moderate specificity for short-term mortality. The SIRS criteria had sensitivity superior to that of qSOFA, supporting their use for screening of patients and as a prompt for treatment initiation.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^111bfaek]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our findings suggest that the newly introduced qSOFA provides better discrimination than SIRS for predicting mortality and ICU-free days. However, it may be less clear whether qSOFA is also better than SIRS criteria for predicting ventilator-free days and organ dysfunction-free days. These findings may help clinicians gain further insight into the usefulness of qSOFA.

### Pre-hospital qSOFA as a predictor of sepsis and mortality [^112X9AxK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The quick sequential organ failure assessment score (qSOFA) has been proposed as a simple tool to identify patients with sepsis who are at risk for poor outcomes. Its utility in the pre-hospital setting has not been fully elucidated.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study of adult patients arriving by ambulance in September 2016 to an academic emergency department in Fresno, California. The qSOFA score was calculated from pre-hospital vital signs. We investigated its association with sepsis, ED diagnosis of infection, and mortality.

Results

Of 2292 adult medical patients transported by ambulance during the study period, the sensitivity of qSOFA for sepsis and in-hospital mortality were 42.9% and 40.6%, respectively. Specificity of qSOFA for sepsis and mortality were 93.8% and 91.9%, respectively. Of those with an ED diagnosis of infection compared to all patients, qSOFA was more specific but less sensitive for sepsis. Increasing qSOFA score was associated with a discharge diagnosis of sepsis (OR 4.21, 95% CI 3.41–5.21, p < 0.001), in-hospital mortality (OR 3.30, 95% CI 2.28–4.78, p < 0.001), and ED diagnosis of infection (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.18–1.58, p < 0.001). Higher qSOFA score was associated with triage to a higher acuity zone and longer hospital and ICU length of stay, but not up-triage during ED stay.

Conclusions

Pre-hospital qSOFA is specific, but poorly sensitive, for sepsis and sepsis outcomes, especially among patients with an ED diagnosis of infection. Higher qSOFA score was associated with worse outcomes.

### Comparison of qSOFA score, SOFA score, and SIRS criteria for the prediction of infection and mortality among surgical intermediate and intensive care patients [^112LoBCV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, neither SOFA nor qSOFA score was able to distinguish for suspected sepsis (defined by the application of broad-spectrum antibiotics) in surgical patients, independently of IMCU, ICU, or IMCU/ICU stay. Nevertheless, the qSOFA score revealed sufficient prediction for mortality in the IMCU. Further, as the SOFA score showed the best results regarding mortality in IMCU/ICU patients, its predictive quality depended on the severity of the disease. Summarizing, it remains unclear whether qSOFA or SOFA score should be used in surgical IMCU patients for risk stratification.

### QSOFA, SIRS and NEWS for predicting inhospital mortality and ICU admission in emergency admissions treated as sepsis [^114rdPKY]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The third international consensus definition for sepsis recommended use of a new prognostic tool, the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), based on its ability to predict inhospital mortality and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay in patients with suspected infection. While several studies have compared the prognostic accuracy of qSOFA to the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in suspected sepsis, few have compared qSOFA and SIRS to the widely used National Early Warning Score (NEWS).

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study carried out in a UK tertiary centre. The study population comprised emergency admissions in whom sepsis was suspected and treated. The accuracy for predicting inhospital mortality and ICU admission was calculated and compared for qSOFA, SIRS and NEWS.

Results

Among 1818 patients, 53 were admitted to ICU (3%) and 265 died in hospital (15%). For predicting inhospital mortality, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for NEWS (0.65, 95%CI 0.61 to 0.68) was similar to qSOFA (0.62, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.66) (test for difference, P = 0.18) and superior to SIRS (P < 0.001), which was not predictive. The sensitivity of NEWS ≥ 5 (74%, 95%CI 68% to 79%) was similar to SIRS ≥ 2 (80%, 95%CI 74% to 84%) and higher than qSOFA ≥ 2 (37%, 95%CI 31% to 43%). The specificity of NEWS ≥ 5 (43%, 95%CI 41% to 46%) was higher than SIRS ≥ 2 (21%, 95%CI 19% to 23%) and lower than qSOFA ≥ 2 (79%, 95%CI 77% to 81%). The negative predictive value was 88% (86%-90%) for qSOFA, 86% (82%-89%) for SIRS and 91% (88%-93%) for NEWS. Results were similar for the secondary outcome of ICU admission.

Conclusion

NEWS has equivalent or superior value for most test characteristics relative to SIRS and qSOFA, calling into question the rationale of adopting qSOFA in institutions where NEWS is already in use.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^1164n5EB]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Assessment of qSOFA and SIRS

The qSOFA score included systolic blood pressure of ≤ 100 mmHg, respiratory rate of ≥ 22/minute, and altered mental status. The latter was not confined to a Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 15, but it included any altered mentation, such as disorientation and somnolence. One point was awarded for each of the above conditions and the score ranged from 0 to 3, as proposed by Seymour and colleagues.

SIRS score included temperature of > 38 °C or < 36 °C, heart rate of > 90 beats/minute, respiratory rate of > 20 breaths/minute, and white blood cell count of > 12,000/mm³ or < 4000/mm³ or > 10% immature forms (bands). One point was awarded for each of the above conditions and the score ranged from 0 to 4, as proposed by Bone and colleagues.

Assessment of qSOFA and SIRS was done within 8 hours before ICU admission. The maximum score during that time window was recorded. Only acute changes from baseline were taken into account while calculating the scores. For example, a patient with known chronically altered mentation (e.g. due to an underlying neurological disease) was not given one point for "altered mental status" when his/her qSOFA score was calculated. This approach differs from that of Seymour and colleagues, who awarded a point to any patient with an abnormal mental status, not only those patients in whom abnormality reflected a change from baseline. A sensitivity analysis was carried out by following the above approach of Seymour and colleagues.

Patients were categorized according to whether they had signs meeting two or more (qSOFA-positive) or less than two (qSOFA-negative) qSOFA criteria. They were also categorized according to whether they met two or more (SIRS-positive) or less than two (SIRS-negative) SIRS criteria.

### Predictive accuracy of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment score in brazil. A prospective multicenter study [^113NCT9T]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Although proposed as a clinical prompt to sepsis based on predictive validity for mortality, the Quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score is often used as a screening tool, which requires high sensitivity. Objectives: To assess the predictive accuracy of qSOFA for mortality in Brazil, focusing on sensitivity. Methods: We prospectively collected data from two cohorts of emergency department and ward patients. Cohort 1 included patients with suspected infection but without organ dysfunction or sepsis (22 hospitals: 3 public and 19 private). Cohort 2 included patients with sepsis (54 hospitals: 24 public and 28 private). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The predictive accuracy of qSOFA was examined considering only the worst values before the suspicion of infection or sepsis. Measurements and Main Results: Cohort 1 contained 5,460 patients (mortality rate, 14.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.1–15.0), among whom 78.3% had a qSOFA score less than or equal to 1 (mortality rate, 8.3%; 95% CI, 7.5–9.1). The sensitivity of a qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2 for predicting mortality was 53.9% and the 95% CI was 50.3 to 57.5. The sensitivity was higher for a qSOFA greater than or equal to 1 (84.9%; 95% CI, 82.1–87.3), a qSOFA score greater than or equal to 1 or lactate greater than 2 mmol/L (91.3%; 95% CI, 89.0–93.2), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome plus organ dysfunction (68.7%; 95% CI, 65.2–71.9). Cohort 2 contained 4,711 patients, among whom 62.3% had a qSOFA score less than or equal to 1 (mortality rate, 17.3%; 95% CI, 15.9–18.7), whereas in public hospitals the mortality rate was 39.3% (95% CI, 35.5–43.3). Conclusions: A qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2 has low sensitivity for predicting death in patients with suspected infection in a developing country. Using a qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2 as a screening tool for sepsis may miss patients who ultimately die. Using a qSOFA score greater than or equal to 1 or adding lactate to a qSOFA score greater than or equal to 1 may improve sensitivity.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1155TWWm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis remains a highly lethal entity resulting in more than 200 000 deaths in the USA each year. The in-hospital mortality approaches 30% despite advances in critical care during the last several decades. The direct health care costs in the USA exceed $24 billion dollars annually and continue to escalate each year especially as the population ages. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign published their initial clinical practice guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008, 2012 and most recently in 2016 following the convening of the Third International Consensus Definitions Task Force. This task force was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to address prior criticisms of the multiple definitions used clinically for sepsis-related illnesses. In the 2016 guidelines, sepsis is redefined by the taskforce as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In addition to using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to more rapidly identify patients with sepsis, the task force also proposed a novel scoring system to rapidly screen for patients outside the ICU who are at risk of developing sepsis: the 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score. To date, the largest reductions in mortality have been associated with early identification of sepsis, initiation of a 3-hour care bundle and rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial, and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### QSOFA combined with suPAR for early risk detection and guidance of antibiotic treatment in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial [^116XFtFU]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early recognition and start of antibiotics are the cornerstone of sepsis management. Since early recognition often fails, warning scores have been introduced to facilitate early recognition. qSOFA (quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score) is one simplistic approach which integrates mental confusion with increase in the respiratory rate and hypotension; patients with suspicion of infection and at least two of these clinical signs are at nearly threefold greater risk for death after 28 days. Early sepsis resuscitation is warranted for patients with 2 or 3 qSOFA points. However, there is ambivalence how to manage patients with one qSOFA point.

Previous studies of our group showed that blood concentrations of the biomarker suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) 12 ng/mL or more are an independent predictor of death the first 28 days for patients with infection. suPAR is the soluble form of the membrane-bound receptor uPAR on myeloid cells cleaved after an inflammatory stimulus which promotes chemotaxis and cell migration. We hypothesized that suPAR may improve the early detection of sepsis in patients with one sign of qSOFA.

Current guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign do not suggest in favor of qSOFA for the early detection of sepsis. The analysis of data coming from the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group (HSSG) indicates significant risk for death among infections with one qSOFA sign upon admission. This stimulated us to follow an investigational approach including two parts. In the first part, the risk of death was defined among patients with one qSOFA sign and increased suPAR in a retrospective analysis of one large-scale prospective study. In the second part, we designed and conducted the randomized controlled trial with the acronym SUPERIOR (SUPar-guided doublE-blind randomized controlled trial of Initiation Of antibiotics foR presumed infection at the emergency department). The aim of the SUPERIOR trial was to investigate whether early antibiotic treatment for patients with one qSOFA sign and increased suPAR may impact on patients' outcomes.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^116P7RyS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Sepsis was previously defined as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in a patient with an infection but now reflects a significantly greater degree of illness, characterized by organ dysfunction, de-emphasizing intervention at earlier stages when it is most treatable.

Definition of organ failure based on SOFA ≥ 2 may be accurate and safe in the ICU, although reliance on the SOFA score can make it more challenging to diagnose a patient with sepsis outside the ICU environment.

The SOFA score is not globally accessible and not well known by emergency or ward healthcare professionals, and its applicability is complex outside the ICU, as it might demand the calculation of SOFA for subsequent days to verify if the patients fulfill the strict criteria and require laboratory tests.

The qSOFA is a tool for risk stratification, and it seems necessary to look for options to improve its low sensitivity. Until then, SIRS will still be helpful as a screening tool in ED to identify patients with infections that will most likely benefit from earlier and more aggressive interventions.

Clinicians should keep in mind the difference between a screening tool and a risk-stratification tool. A screening tool aims to identify patients with a particular disease from a larger pool of patients. Once these patients are identified, a risk-stratification tool can be applied to determine their likelihood of meeting a particular outcome.

We probably still need a good screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing organ dysfunction. However, this is not addressed in Sepsis-3.

The Sepsis-3 authors concluded that "These updated definitions and clinical criteria should clarify long-used descriptors and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing it". However, it seems to us that Sepsis3 definitions have the opposite outcome.

Sepsis 3 definitions exclude from the concept of sepsis those patients who are in transition from infection to sepsis and who have a SOFA score of 2 or more points.

### Predictive performance of SOFA and qSOFA for in-hospital mortality in severe novel coronavirus disease [^113e2j3M]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The assessment of illness severity at admission can contribute to decreased mortality in patients with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scoring systems at admission for the prediction of mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

Methods

We included 140 critically ill COVID-19 patients. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings at admission were used to calculate SOFA and qSOFA against the in-hospital outcomes (survival or death) that were ascertained from the medical records. The predictive accuracy of both scoring systems was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Results

The area under the ROC curve for SOFA in predicting mortality was 0.890 (95% CI: 0.826–0.955), which was higher than that of qSOFA (0.742, 95% CI 0.657–0.816). An optimal cutoff of ≥ 3 for SOFA had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 90.00%, 83.18%, 50.00%, and 97.80%, respectively.

Conclusions

This novel report indicates that SOFA could function as an effective adjunctive risk-stratification tool at admission for critical COVID-19 patients. The performance of qSOFA is accepted but inferior to that of SOFA.

### Validation of the qSOFA score compared to the CRB-65 score for risk prediction in community-acquired pneumonia [^117Gxbbb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The qSOFA (quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment) score shows similarities to the CRB-65 pneumonia score, but its prognostic accuracy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has not been extensively evaluated. Our aim was to validate the qSOFA (-65) score in a large cohort of CAP patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study including all CAP cases hospitalized between 1st January 2014 and 31st December 2018 from the German nationwide mandatory quality assurance programme. We excluded cases transferred from another hospital, with mechanical ventilation present on admission, and without documented respiratory rate. Predefined outcomes were hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation.

Results

Among the 1,262,250 included cases, hospital mortality was 12.4% and the mechanical ventilation rate was 7.1%. All CRB and qSOFA criteria were associated with both outcomes, but the qSOFA had inferior sensitivity compared to the CRB-65 for mortality prediction. Including the age criterion ≥ 65 years, qSOFA-65 and CRB-65 performed similarly (AUC 0.69, 95%CI 0.69–0.69 versus 0.68, 95%CI 0.68–0.68). A qSOFA-65 of 0 was associated with fewer missed deaths (3328, 2.0%) compared to a CRB-65 of 0 (5480, 2.4%). The sensitivity of the suggested qSOFA cut-off of ≥ 2 for sepsis was low (mortality 25.8%, 95%CI 25.6–26.0%; mechanical ventilation 24.1%, 95%CI 23.8–24.4%). Results were similar when frail and palliative patients were excluded.

Conclusions

The qSOFA parameters show prognostic accuracy similar to the CRB parameters in CAP, but the sepsis cut-off of ≥ 2 lacked sensitivity. For sensitive mortality prediction, the age criterion ≥ 65 years should be added to the qSOFA.

### Performance of the quick sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment score as a prognostic tool in infected patients outside the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112m3J9T]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction that is caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is a common cause of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death. It is essential to differentiate sepsis from an uncomplicated infection because sepsis is associated with poorer outcomes. Early recognition of sepsis can improve outcomes of these patients through corresponding interventions, which include adequately administering fluids and appropriate antibiotics. However, because sepsis is a complex, heterogeneous disease, it is often difficult for clinicians to promptly identify patients with sepsis.

There are no gold standard tests or diagnostic criteria to detect patients with sepsis. For more than two decades, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria have been used in the diagnosis of sepsis. Researchers in several studies have reported controversies regarding the applicability of SIRS, and the SIRS criteria have also been criticized as a sepsis screening tool because of inadequate specificity and sensitivity. In 2016, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM)/European Society of Intensive Care Med (ESICM) task force released the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) as a new definition for sepsis. The consensus definition replaced the SIRS criteria with the Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. In addition, the quick SOFA (qSOFA) score was introduced as a bedside criterion to facilitate the identification of patients with suspected infection who are likely to have poor outcomes. Data published shortly after the establishment of Sepsis-3 demonstrated that the predictive validity of qSOFA for in-hospital mortality was statistically greater than either the original SOFA or SIRS criteria in encounters with suspected infection outside the ICU. Researchers in several studies have examined the predictive performance of the qSOFA score for in-hospital mortality in these patients. These studies have generated conflicting evidence, and it is currently unclear whether the qSOFA score has prognostic value for unfavorable outcomes in patients with a suspected infection.

There have been no published meta-analyses of the predictive performance of the qSOFA score. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of a positive qSOFA score compared with positive SIRS criteria for early identification of in-hospital mortality in patients with suspected infection outside the ICU. We also compared the discriminatory capacity between positive qSOFA score and positive SIRS criteria in predicting acute organ dysfunction and ICU admission.

### Comparison of qSOFA with current emergency department tools for screening of patients with sepsis for critical illness [^1175ncru]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to compare the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), severe sepsis criteria and lactate levels for their ability to identify ED patients with sepsis with critical illness.

Methods

We conducted this multicenter retrospective cohort study at five US hospitals, enrolling all adult patients admitted to these hospitals from their EDs with infectious disease-related illnesses from 1 January 2016 to 30 April 2016. We abstracted clinical variables for SIRS, severe sepsis and qSOFA scores, using values in the first 6hours of ED stay. Our primary outcome was critical illness, defined as one or more of the composite outcomes of death, vasopressor use or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 72hours of presentation. We determined diagnostic test characteristics for qSOFA scores, SIRS, severe sepsis criteria and lactate level thresholds.

Main Results

Of 3743 enrolled patients, 512 (13.7%) had the primary composite outcome. The qSOFA scores were ≥ 1, > 2 and 3 in 1839 (49.1%), 626 (16.7%) and 146 (3.9%) patients, respectively; 2202 (58.8%) met SIRS criteria and 1085 (29.0%) met severe sepsis criteria. qSOFA ≥ 1and SIRS had similarly high sensitivity [86.1% (95% CI 82.8% to 89.0%) vs 86.7% (95% CI 83.5% to 89.5%)], but qSOFA ≥ 1 had higher specificity [56.7% (95% CI 55.0% to 58.5%) vs 45.6% (43.9% to 47.3%); mean difference 11.1% (95% CI 8.7% to 13.6%)]. qSOFA ≥ 2 had higher specificity than severe sepsis criteria [89.1% (88.0% to 90.2%) vs 77.5% (76.0% to 78.9%); mean difference 11.6% (9.8% to 13.4%)]. qSOFA ≥ 1 had greater sensitivity than a lactate level ≥ 2 (mean difference 24.6% (19.2% to 29.9%)).

Conclusion

For patients admitted from the ED with infectious disease diagnoses, qSOFA criteria performed as well or better than SIRS criteria, severe sepsis criteria and lactate levels in predicting critical illness.

### The quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment score in Brazil: insights for future use in diverse settings [^114ML9WR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Machado and colleagues (pp.) report the predictive accuracy of the qSOFA score for hospital mortality in adult, non-ICU patients in Brazil from May 2016 to March 2017. This large, multicenter, prospective study evaluated two patient cohorts. Cohort 1 consisted of patients with suspected infection, and cohort 2 consisted of patients with a clinical diagnosis of sepsis, as defined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. The worst qSOFA score from the time of initial presentation until the time of suspected sepsis was recorded for patients in the emergency department, and the worst score in the 24 hours before suspected sepsis was recorded for patients in the hospital wards. Patients with missing data for any of the three score components were excluded from the study. The authors compared the prognostic accuracy of qSOFA score ≥ 2 to other commonly available prognostic tools, including modified qSOFA (qSOFA ≥ 1), qSOFA ≥ 1 or lactate > 2 mmol/L, SOFA score ≥ 2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria ≥ 2, and presence of any organ dysfunction.

### Validation of the new sepsis-3 definitions: proposal for improvement in early risk identification [^112K4J4E]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Sepsis-3 definitions generated controversies regarding their general applicability. The Sepsis-3 Task Force outlined the need for validation with emphasis on the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score. This was done in a prospective cohort from a different healthcare setting.

Methods

Patients with infections and at least two signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were analysed. Sepsis was defined as total SOFA ≥ 2 outside the intensive care unit (ICU) or as an increase of ICU admission SOFA ≥ 2. The primary endpoints were the sensitivity of qSOFA outside the ICU and sepsis definition both outside and within the ICU to predict mortality.

Results

In all, 3346 infections outside the ICU and 1058 infections in the ICU were analysed. Outside the ICU, respective mortality with ≥ 2 SIRS and qSOFA ≥ 2 was 25.3% and 41.2% (p < 0.0001); the sensitivities of qSOFA and of sepsis definition to predict death were 60.8% and 87.2%, respectively. This was 95.9% for sepsis definition in the ICU. The sensitivity of qSOFA and of ≥ 3 SIRS criteria for organ dysfunction outside the ICU was 48.7% and 72.5%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Misclassification outside the ICU with the 1991 and Sepsis-3 definitions into stages of lower severity was 21.4% and 3.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001) and 14.9% and 3.7%, respectively, in the ICU (p < 0.0001). Adding arterial pH ≤ 7.30 to qSOFA increased sensitivity for prediction of death to 67.5% (p 0.004).

Conclusions

Our analysis positively validated the use of SOFA score to predict unfavourable outcome and to limit misclassification into lower severity. However, qSOFA score had inadequate sensitivity for early risk assessment.

In addition, we retrieved data regarding prognostic performance according to the qSOFA score at other cutoff values from three studies. In pooled estimates, when qSOFA was ≥ 1 point, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of positive qSOFA scores for in-hospital mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92–0.94), 0.13 (95% CI, 0.12–0.13), and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72–0.84), respectively. In the cases with a cutoff value of 3 points, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of positive qSOFA scores were 0.17 (95% CI, 0.16–0.19), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96–0.96), and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.88–1.00), respectively.

### Determining outcomes in nonpenetrating trauma with qSOFA [^117GhJEc]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score identifies patients with suspected infection at high risk for adverse outcomes. The qSOFA score is the sum of three variables (respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Score) with binary thresholds. The role of qSOFA in predicting hospitalization outcomes in nonpenetrating trauma patients was determined at a level 1 and a level 2 trauma center.

Methods

The trauma registries at the two institutions were queried for adult (18+ y) and pediatric (0–17 y) nonpenetrating trauma hospitalizations between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2021.

Results

At institution A, there were 3720 adult hospitalizations (qSOFA = 0: 2906 patients, qSOFA = 1: 677, qSOFA = 2: 124, qSOFA = 3: 13) and 418 pediatric hospitalizations (qSOFA = 0: 238 patients, qSOFA = 1: 159, qSOFA = 2: 20, qSOFA = 3: 1). At institution B, there were 3579 adult hospitalizations (qSOFA = 0: 2638 patients, qSOFA = 1: 816, qSOFA = 2: 121, qSOFA = 3: 4) and 429 pediatric hospitalizations (qSOFA = 0: 273 patients, qSOFA = 1: 149, qSOFA = 2: 6, qSOFA = 3: 1). In adults at both institutions, increased qSOFA was significantly associated with higher mortality rates. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission increased at institution A and increased at institution B to qSOFA = 2. In multivariable analyses, qSOFA predicted ICU admission and mortality. Pediatric patients had low injury severity, morbidity, and mortality. Excluding the one early qSOFA = 3 mortality, higher qSOFA scores were associated with increased ICU admission in pediatric patients.

Conclusions

Elevated qSOFA scores are associated with ICU admission and mortality in adult nonpenetrating trauma patients. Further investigation on qSOFA for resource allocation is indicated.

In the California sample, the median number of elapsed hours between first reaching risk score thresholds and the composite outcome of ICU transfer or death was 5. 3 hours for a qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2,
6. 1 hours for a SIRS score greater than or equal to 2, and 5. 7 hours for a NEWS greater than or equal to
6. Intervals that were somewhat longer were observed in the Illinois sample of 8. 2 hours for a qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2,
9. 5 hours for a SIRS score greater than or equal to 2, and 9. 2 hours for a NEWS greater than or equal to
6.

At a similar high-specificity threshold to qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2, a NEWS greater than or equal to 8 threshold had a higher sensitivity than qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2 and required a similar percentage of the population to be screened. Findings were similar in patients with suspected infection. In the overall cohort, at a similar screening workload to the high-specificity qSOFA score greater than or equal to 2, a NEWS greater than or equal to 8 would have identified 4099 more patients who died overall and 2636 more in the suspected infection cohort than the qSOFA score. Model discrimination for the combined outcome of ICU transfer or death was lower in all scenarios, with the NEWS and MEWS showing similar performance. This result appeared to be associated with poor discrimination in the noninfected subgroups.

In all scenarios, NEWS outperformed infection-targeted scores, such as those calculated with qSOFA and SIRS, and may offer the opportunity to provide a single points-based score with efficiency characteristics suitable for identifying high-risk patients with and without infection.

### Association of the quick sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score with excess hospital mortality in adults with suspected infection in low-and middle-income countries [^11359pQi]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score has not been well-evaluated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Objective

To assess the association of qSOFA with excess hospital death among patients with suspected infection in LMICs and to compare qSOFA with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.

Design, Settings, and Participants

Retrospective secondary analysis of 8 cohort studies and 1 randomized clinical trial from 2003 to 2017. This study included 6569 hospitalized adults with suspected infection in emergency departments, inpatient wards, and intensive care units of 17 hospitals in 10 LMICs across sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

Exposures

Low (0), moderate (1), or high (≥ 2) qSOFA score (range, 0 [best] to 3 [worst]) or SIRS criteria (range, 0 [best] to 4 [worst]) within 24 hours of presentation to study hospital.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Predictive validity (measured as incremental hospital mortality beyond that predicted by baseline risk factors, as a marker of sepsis or analogous severe infectious course) of the qSOFA score (primary) and SIRS criteria (secondary).

Results

The cohorts were diverse in enrollment criteria, demographics (median ages, 29–54 years; males range, 36%-76%), HIV prevalence (range, 2%-43%), cause of infection, and hospital mortality (range, 1%-39%). Among 6218 patients with nonmissing outcome status in the combined cohort, 643 (10%) died. Compared with a low or moderate score, a high qSOFA score was associated with increased risk of death overall (19% vs 6%; difference, 13% [95% CI, 11%-14%]; odds ratio, 3.6 [95% CI, 3.0–4.2]) and across cohorts (P < .05 for 8 of 9 cohorts). Compared with a low qSOFA score, a moderate qSOFA score was also associated with increased risk of death overall (8% vs 3%; difference, 5% [95% CI, 4%-6%]; odds ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0–3.9]), but not in every cohort (P < .05 in 2 of 7 cohorts). High, vs low or moderate, SIRS criteria were associated with a smaller increase in risk of death overall (13% vs 8%; difference, 5% [95% CI, 3%-6%]; odds ratio, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.4–2.0]) and across cohorts (P < .05 for 4 of 9 cohorts). qSOFA discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.68–0.72]) was superior to that of both the baseline model (AUROC, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.53–0.58; P < .001) and SIRS (AUROC, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.57–0.62]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

When assessed among hospitalized adults with suspected infection in 9 LMIC cohorts, the qSOFA score identified infected patients at risk of death beyond that explained by baseline factors. However, the predictive validity varied among cohorts and settings, and further research is needed to better understand potential generalizability.

### Phoenix sepsis score and risk of attributable mortality in children with cancer… [^112Rv1a1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

PHO-Phoenix was the Phoenix Sepsis Score calculated excluding platelet count to account for possible confounding by chemotherapy-related thrombocytopenia. AUC indicates area under the curve; PELOD2, Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction 2; PRISM3, Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3; pSOFA, Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; qSOFA, quick SOFA. We used an existing retrospective cohort to evaluate the Phoenix Sepsis Score in children receiving treatment for cancer admitted to the intensive care unit with suspected infection; the performance of Pediatric Risk of Mortality 3, Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, quick SOFA.

4 We estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for classification of outcomes, including attributable mortality, definitely attributable mortality, all-cause mortality, and prolonged ICU stay. 1, 5 AUROCs were numerically compared with PRISM3, pSOFA, qSOFA, and PELOD2 scores. 1 Additional methods are included in the eMethods in Supplement 1. At a cutoff of 2 points or more, the Phoenix Sepsis Score cutoff classified 129 episodes as sepsis; the sensitivity and specificity were 77% and 25% for attributable mortality and 89% and 25% for definitely attributable mortality, respectively. A cutoff of 4 points or more, selected by inspection of data, had a sensitivity and specificity of 69% and 72% for attributable mortality, and 89% and 72% for definitely attributable mortality.

Positive predictive value for attributable mortality was 8% at the cutoff of 2 points or more and 17% at the cutoff of 4 points or more.

### Performance of the quick sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment score as a prognostic tool in infected patients outside the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112oorNs]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that positive qSOFA scores had high specificity but poor sensitivity for predicting in-hospital mortality, acute organ dysfunction, and ICU admission in patients with infection outside the ICU. Therefore, a positive qSOFA score seemed to be limited in the early identification of poor outcomes in these patients in routine clinical practice. Meanwhile, positive SIRS criteria were found to be too sensitive and insufficiently specific to predict in-hospital mortality. In the present study, between-study heterogeneity was highly represented, and an overall mortality rate ≥ 10% and timing of qSOFA score measurement could be significant factors in this heterogeneity. Our findings indicate that the development of enhanced or modified bedside tools may be necessary.

### QSOFA should replace SIRS as the screening tool for sepsis [^114Wyayv]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Vincent JL, Martin GS and Levy MM recently wrote an article in Critical Care entitled "qSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis". In this paper they specified that "the qSOFA is meant to be used to raise suspicion of sepsis and prompt further action but it is not a replacement for SIRS and is not part of the definition of sepsis".

One of the starting points that induced the Sepsis-3 consensus taskforce to set out in search of better entry criteria than the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria was precisely that SIRS criteria perform poorly on both "discriminant validity" and "convergent validity". In order to accomplish their task, they identified patients with suspected infection among 1.3 million health record cases and, after comparing the performance of several different clinical criteria, they came out with the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score, whose predictive validity for in-hospital mortality outside the ICU was statistically better than SIRS.

The fact that nonspecific SIRS criteria will "generally" continue to aid in the identification and diagnosis of infection was repeatedly affirmed in the Sepsis-3 consensus article. Besides, when the SIRS criteria were first proposed as a screening tool for sepsis, they were meant to be applied to patients with "suspected infection", just as the qSOFA is intended to be used now. However, while the SIRS criteria were essentially based only on expert-consensus, the qSOFA criteria were identified through large multivariate statistics and confirmatory analyses, where they proved to perform better than the SIRS criteria.

The qSOFA was derived and conceived on the basis of retrospective data, and thus, from now on, the clinical research should and will work hard to prospectively validate the soundness of this tool, in terms of its screening capacity. However, based at least on the currently available evidence, we believe that, although qSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis, it should indeed replace SIRS as the screening tool for sepsis.

We would like to know if Vincent and colleagues agree with this assumption, and we would also like to ask them if, after the Sepsis-3 consensus definitions, the SIRS criteria still retain a real operative role in the process of defining and/or screening sepsis or if they could be, at least operatively, dismissed.

### Predictive accuracy of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment score in brazil. A prospective multicenter study [^115bwsTc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Discrimination of the different tools for prediction of in-hospital mortality for cohort 1 (patients presenting outside of the ICU with infection but without organ dysfunction or sepsis). P < 0.001 between qSOFA and the other tools (DeLong method). qSOFA = Quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment; ROC = receiver operating characteristic; SIRS = systemic inflammatory response syndrome; SOFA = Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.

The qSOFA score predicted ICU admission within 24 hours well (AUROC, 73.3; 95% CI, 72.0–74.5; P < 0.001; see Table E4); however, the sensitivity was low at 39.7% (95% CI, 37.7–41.9). The use of a single positive component of qSOFA improved the sensitivity to 78.3% (95% CI, 76.5–80.0). We obtained similar results for prediction of the composite endpoint of early ICU admission and an ICU length of stay longer than 48 hours (see Table E4).

### Performance of the quick sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment score as a prognostic tool in infected patients outside the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UakTB]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

In the Sepsis-3 guidance, the 2016 SCCM/ESICM proposed the concept of the qSOFA score to predict poor outcomes in patients with suspected infection, and the SIRS criteria were no longer recommended as part of the clinical criteria for sepsis. From the introduction of the new concept, there has been a need to evaluate the prognostic value of qSOFA for predicting outcomes. Several validation studies have followed, and the ability of the qSOFA score to predict in-hospital mortality has been greater than that of the SIRS criteria among patients with suspected infection outside the ICU. We found that patients with positive qSOFA scores were associated with in-hospital mortality of 12.9%, acute organ dysfunction of 82.8%, and ICU admission of 37.0% after the initiation of therapy. In addition, our pooled estimates demonstrated that positive qSOFA scores had high specificity for early risk assessment but poor sensitivity. The qSOFA score would provide great value as a clinical tool to promptly identify patients with infection likely to develop adverse outcomes outside the ICU.

Figure 2
Forest plots for mortality by A qSOFA; B SIRS; C MEWS and D UVA scores.

In those studies simultaneously reporting the accuracy of a positive qSOFA score and positive SIRS criteria for predicting mortality, the qSOFA score was more specific but less sensitive than SIRS; qSOFA, MEWS, and UVA performed similarly (Table 2).

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^1121Q7iu]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The Sepsis-3 definitions recommend using an increase in the SOFA score of 2 or more points to represent organ dysfunction. The SOFA score is intended to be used in the ICU and, to a lesser extent, the ED. Outside the ICU, SOFA was found only as good as the previous SIRS criteria (AUROC = 0.79 vs. AUROC = 0.76). Moreover, it is a valuable predictor of unfavorable outcome. The SOFA score was proposed in 1996 by the Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine to objectively describe the degree of organ dysfunction over time and to evaluate morbidity in patients in the ICU with sepsis. It was demonstrated to be a good indicator of prognosis in critically ill patients during the first few days of ICU admission. The use of the SOFA score in research is commonly performed and constitutes a routine component of data collection for clinical trials in ICUs. However, the SOFA score is not universally accessible, especially for PaO₂, which would require an arterial blood gas measurement.

Recognizing these practical limitations, the task force described a simplified method termed the "quick SOFA" (qSOFA) score to facilitate easier identification of patients potentially at risk of dying outside of critical care settings. This instrument, which had not been validated in clinical practice at the time of Sepsis-3 publication, comprises three clinical parameters that are easy to assess outside the ICU.

The prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality of qSOFA is an area of great debate. A recent multicenter prospective cohort study involving 879 patients with suspected infection treated in the ED reported that qSOFA may be better than previous criteria at predicting in-hospital mortality among patients with suspected infection. Nevertheless, we calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) of qSOFA for in-hospital death in this study to be only 0.24. This indicates that only one-quarter of the patients who had a qSOFA equal or more than 2 died in the hospital.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Vq6gK]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^112sLRUS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Quick SOFA (qSOFA) — screening thresholds and limitations in the ED are as follows: The qSOFA score identifies infected patients at higher risk of death if 2 or more of the following features are present: respiratory rate of at least 22 breaths/min, altered mental status, and systolic blood pressure of at least 100 mm Hg. ED-based validation studies show that qSOFA is less sensitive and more specific for short-term mortality than the 2001 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, and screening with qSOFA is potentially useful for identifying patients at the highest risk for clinical deterioration and need for intensive care, but this tool is not sensitive enough to be used as the sole strategy for sepsis screening. It also was not intended to identify patients with infection, and only 1 of every 3 patients who are qSOFA-positive on admission has infection, and 1 in 6 has sepsis.

### Prognostic accuracy of sepsis-3 criteria for in-hospital mortality among patients with suspected infection presenting to the emergency department [^111j4ViE]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An international task force recently redefined the concept of sepsis. This task force recommended the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score instead of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria to identify patients at high risk of mortality. However, these new criteria have not been prospectively validated in some settings, and their added value in the emergency department remains unknown.

Objective

To prospectively validate qSOFA as a mortality predictor and compare the performances of the new sepsis criteria to the previous ones.

Design, Settings, and Participants

International prospective cohort study, conducted in France, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland between May and June 2016. In the 30 participating emergency departments, for a 4-week period, consecutive patients who visited the emergency departments with suspected infection were included. All variables from previous and new definitions of sepsis were collected. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death.

Exposures

Measurement of qSOFA, SOFA, and SIRS.

Main Outcomes and Measures

In-hospital mortality.

Results

Of 1088 patients screened, 879 were included in the analysis. Median age was 67 years (interquartile range, 47–81 years), 414 (47%) were women, and 379 (43%) had respiratory tract infection. Overall in-hospital mortality was 8%: 3% for patients with a qSOFA score lower than 2 vs 24% for those with qSOFA score of 2 or higher (absolute difference, 21%; 95% CI, 15%-26%). The qSOFA performed better than both SIRS and severe sepsis in predicting in-hospital mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74–0.85) vs 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59–0.70) for both SIRS and severe sepsis (P < .001; incremental AUROC, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09–0.22). The hazard ratio of qSOFA score for death was 6.2 (95% CI, 3.8–10.3) vs 3.5 (95% CI, 2.2–5.5) for severe sepsis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected infection, the use of qSOFA resulted in greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than did either SIRS or severe sepsis. These findings provide support for the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria in the emergency department setting.

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^1114jTYv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Appropriate diagnostics in adults with suspected infection in resource-limited settings, require clinical guidance that considers:

Using clinical scores to assess patients with sepsis, with quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score being a feasible score in most resource–limited settings.
In the absence of serum lactate, clinical parameters such as altered mental status and capillary refill time can be used to assess tissue perfusion.
Urine output should be monitored in all adult patients with sepsis.
An indwelling urinary catheter should be used to monitor urine output in all patients with septic shock.

Currently, there is no widely applicable standard sepsis score to prompt a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis or a tool to confirm the diagnosis across primary and acute healthcare settings. A variety of scores are used for sepsis screening, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, qSOFA score, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), but there is considerable variation between them in terms of sensitivity, specificity and ease of implementation. Use of qSOFA to screen for or diagnose sepsis is controversial with a body of evidence and guidelines questioning its specificity, sensitivity and utility in the early recognition of sepsis. The 2021 SSC Guidelines recommend using SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS in preference to qSOFA when screening for sepsis or septic shock. Feasibility of implementation is particularly relevant to resource-limited settings, and may have prompted the experts to select qSOFA.

### Enhanced bedside mortality prediction combining point-of-care lactate and the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score in patients hospitalised with suspected infection in southeast Asia: a cohort study [^116KU7Y8]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis — organ dysfunction from a dysregulated immune response to infection — is a major cause of death worldwide. Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly affected, as millions of sepsis-related deaths are likely to occur each year among LMICs. In southeast Asia, sepsis-associated mortality is particularly high, due to a variety of causes. Early and accurate assessment of the clinical trajectory during severe infection is imperative, particularly in settings with limited tertiary health care.

Clinical scoring systems, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), have been proposed for predicting sepsis-related outcomes, including mortality. Nonetheless, SOFA requires multiple laboratory and clinical data, which are potentially challenging to obtain in low-resource areas. Alternative scores developed for LMICs were derived in emergency room or intensive care settings, have not been widely validated, and have uncertain utility in populations with sepsis. – The quick SOFA (qSOFA), requiring only three clinical examination components (systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale), was initially developed to help clinicians identify patients at risk of sepsis, by assessing predictive validity using mortality as an outcome more likely to occur in patients with sepsis. The predictive validity of the qSOFA score for sepsis has been extended to low-resource settings. However, the discrimination of sepsis-related mortality by the qSOFA score is typically lower than more rigorous methodologies. Despite relatively low sensitivity for mortality prediction, the qSOFA score has been widely adopted as a screening tool for sepsis-related severity of illness, particularly in LMICs.

Data extraction, definitions, and outcomes

JUS and JL independently extracted potentially relevant studies and reviewed each study according to the predefined criteria for eligibility. We extracted data from the selected studies. Any disagreement in the process of study selection or data extraction was resolved by discussion. A predefined form was used to extract data from each study. Extracted information included details of patient demographics, the study design, and objectives.

The qSOFA score consists of three clinical variables: altered mentation, systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, and respiratory rate > 22 breaths/minute. The score ranges from 0 to 3, and a positive qSOFA score is defined as 2 or more points. The SIRS criteria were defined as a respiratory rate > 20 breaths/minute or partial pressure of carbon dioxide < 32 mmHg, a body temperature > 38 °C or < 36 °C, a heart rate > 90 beats/minute, and a white blood cell count > 12,000/mm³ or < 4000/mm³, or > 10% bands. A positive SIRS criterion was also defined as ≥ 2 points. Acute organ dysfunction was defined as an acute 2-point increase in the SOFA score following the proposed Sepsis-3 definitions. In case of studies using the Sepsis-2 definitions, the development of severe sepsis (two or more SIRS signs plus one additional sign of organ failure) was considered as acute organ dysfunction. Outside the ICU included out-of-hospital, emergency department (ED), or general hospital ward settings.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. For trials in which researchers did not investigate in-hospital mortality, we used the 28- or, 30-day mortality instead. In addition, we extracted the data for SIRS from the published materials for qSOFA, and a positive qSOFA score was used to assess the prognostic performance by comparing it with positive SIRS criteria. The secondary outcome was acute organ dysfunction and ICU admission.

Quality assessment

As recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool to assess the risk of bias in diagnostic test accuracy. A detailed quality assessment is provided in Additional file 1.

### Use of sepsis-related diagnostic criteria in primary care: a survey among general practitioners [^112isJNX]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Even though various screening tools exist to improve sepsis recognition, most GPs use gut feeling to diagnose sepsis. GPs are frequently not familiar with the 'sepsis-criteria' used in hospital settings and recognition of sepsis varied greatly between GPs. Nonetheless, GPs most strongly associated the individual signs of the qSOFA with sepsis as diagnosis in the test cases. Together, although GPs report to mostly rely on gut feeling to diagnose sepsis, clinical reasoning is based on specific factors that are most in line with the qSOFA score. In order to improve sepsis recognition in primary care, GPs should be educated in the use of available screening tools, like the qSOFA or the UK Sepsis Trust rules.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^111RnZ6A]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) Task Force recently introduced a new clinical score termed quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) for identification of patients at risk of sepsis outside the intensive care unit (ICU). We attempted to compare the discriminatory capacity of the qSOFA versus the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score for predicting mortality, ICU-free days, and organ dysfunction-free days in patients with suspicion of infection outside the ICU.

Methods

The Weill Cornell Medicine Registry and Biobank of Critically Ill Patients is an ongoing cohort of critically ill patients, for whom biological samples and clinical information (including vital signs before and during ICU hospitalization) are prospectively collected. Using such information, qSOFA and SIRS scores outside the ICU (specifically, within 8 hours before ICU admission) were calculated. This study population was therefore comprised of patients in the emergency department or the hospital wards who had suspected infection, were subsequently admitted to the medical ICU and were included in the Registry and Biobank.

Results

One hundred fifty-two patients (67% from the emergency department) were included in this study. Sixty-seven percent had positive cultures and 19% died in the hospital. Discrimination of in-hospital mortality using qSOFA [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.66–0.81] was significantly greater compared with SIRS criteria (AUC, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51–0.67; p = 0.03). The qSOFA performed better than SIRS regarding discrimination for ICU-free days (p = 0.04), but not for ventilator-free days (p = 0.19), any organ dysfunction-free days (p = 0.13), or renal dysfunction-free days (p = 0.17).

Conclusions

In patients with suspected infection who eventually required admission to the ICU, qSOFA calculated before their ICU admission had greater accuracy than SIRS for predicting mortality and ICU-free days. However, it may be less clear whether qSOFA is also better than SIRS criteria for predicting ventilator free-days and organ dysfunction-free days. These findings may help clinicians gain further insight into the usefulness of qSOFA.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^112Zjkjc]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The quickSOFA score

In addition to using the SOFA score to identify patients with sepsis, the task force also proposed a novel scoring system to rapidly screen for patients outside the ICU who are at risk of developing sepsis: the 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score (box 1).

Box 1
The 'quickSOFA' (qSOFA) score

Patients outside the ICU are at risk of sepsis development if two or more of the following are abnormal:

Elevated respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths per minute
Altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 15)
Systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less

The quickSOFA score was designed for use both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. On statistical review, it had predictive validity that was similar to that of the SOFA score for patients outside the ICU. It is not intended to substitute for good clinical judgment or as the sole criteria for ruling sepsis in or out, rather it is an adjunct to aid in early recognition of patients at high risk for sepsis. The SCCM SSC emphasizes that the qSOFA 'does not define sepsis', but is an indicator of increased risk for clinical deterioration. These patients should be assessed for the presence of infection and organ dysfunction, treatment of infection and organ dysfunction should be initiated early, and consideration should be given to transferring these patients to a higher level of care for closer monitoring. The key benefits of the qSOFA score are that it is simple to measure and does not require laboratory testing; thus it can be performed rapidly and repeatedly.

After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'. For patients identified with organ dysfunction, the group emphasizes adherence to the 3-hour and 6-hour bundles.

### Comparison of qSOFA score, SOFA score, and SIRS criteria for the prediction of infection and mortality among surgical intermediate and intensive care patients [^1137daW6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening disease complex characterized by severe organ dysfunction resulting from a dysbalanced host response to an infection. Despite modern treatment protocols, sepsis-related mortality remains highly associated with delays in adequate treatment. For this reason, modern clinical concepts have focused on the development of criteria aiming for the rapid identification of sepsis.

For 24 years, sepsis has been defined as suspected or proven infection, together with two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. However, during the last decade, clinical characteristics that serve to define sepsis changed due to an improved understanding of the underlying pathobiology. Therefore, in 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) introduced a significant change in the approach to the definition and diagnostic criteria of sepsis.

Nevertheless, a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic test for the detection of sepsis is currently still lacking. Among ICU encounters with suspected infection, the Sepsis-3 Task Force recommended the use of the Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for the identification of septic patients. For the rapid identification of patients with suspected infection outside of the ICU, on the other hand, Seymour et al. introduced the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score. The qSOFA score is a simple score consisting of three items: respiratory rate (RR) ≥ 22 breaths per minute, altered mentation (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] < 15), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 100 mmHg. A qSOFA score ≥ 2 was found to be significantly predictive of increased all-cause mortality in patients outside of the ICU. Therefore, the authors of the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) recommended the use of the qSOFA score for the identification of adult septic patients in out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider guiding the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected complicated UTI, including pyelonephritis, by the severity of illness, specifically whether the patient is in sepsis.
Use the Sepsis-3 definition, which defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Identify patients by an increase in the SOFA score of ≥ 2 points, indicating an in-hospital mortality risk > 10%, or presumptively identify using screening tools such as qSOFA or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

### Comparison of qSOFA score, SOFA score, and SIRS criteria for the prediction of infection and mortality among surgical intermediate and intensive care patients [^11162xBs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Even though qSOFA and SOFA scores are widely accepted as tools for the identification of septic patients, they failed to predict suspected infection in each individual group of patients in our study. These findings are supported by Krebs et al. who also evaluated the qSOFA and SOFA scores as well as the SIRS criteria in 1942 prospective patient days within a cohort of surgical trauma ICU patients, concluding that all scores failed to predict the development of new infections. But, also in an out-of-ICU setting, a failure of the qSOFA score (and SIRS criteria) has already been described in a collective of patients attending the emergency room (n = 1045). Moreover, another large retrospective analysis failed to prove a high predictive power of the qSOFA score and the SIRS criteria in patients admitted to the emergency department.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^111H7Fxy]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Key messages

In patients with suspected infection who eventually required admission to the ICU, qSOFA calculated before their ICU admission provided better discrimination than SIRS criteria for predicting mortality and ICU-free days.
It may be less clear whether qSOFA is better than SIRS criteria for predicting ventilator-free days and organ dysfunction-free days.
These findings may help clinicians gain further insight into the usefulness of qSOFA.

### Prognostic performance of age-adapted SOFA and qSOFA in septic children [^112eRBQQ]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Dear editors:

The criteria used to define pediatric sepsis have not been updated for nearly 15 years since the establishment of the 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus. Some investigators adapted the Sepsis 3.0 criteria to pediatric sepsis definition.

Between January 2018 and July 2019, we prospectively enrolled 342 children from PICU (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03598127) with sepsis on admission according to the 2005 Pediatric Sepsis Consensus. Age-adapted SOFA and quick SOFA (qSOFA) were used as described in a previous study. We assessed the performance of age-adapted SOFA and qSOFA, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM), and pediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD)-2 scores on predicting mortality among septic children by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

The median age was 9 months, and 192 children (56.14%) were boys (Table 1); 20 children died in hospital, with a mortality rate of almost 6%. Performances of the four tools on discriminating survival are showed in Fig. 1: the PELOD-2 scores and PRISM scores had good discrimination (0.871, 95%CI 0.831–0.905 and 0.868, 95%CI 0.828–0.902 respectively), better than age-adapted SOFA scores (0.790, 95% CI 0.743–0.832). Age-adapted qSOFA had the smallest AUROC (0.639, 95% CI 0.586–0.690).

Our data revealed that age-adapted qSOFA may not be a good predictor of mortality for pediatric sepsis. Quick SOFA has a range from 0 to 3. It is possible that four variations may be insufficient to describe various severity of sepsis. In addition, scoring of Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score may be inaccurate in children, especially in young infants.

### Comparison of qSOFA score, SOFA score, and SIRS criteria for the prediction of infection and mortality among surgical intermediate and intensive care patients [^116TmPc3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

It is crucial to rapidly identify sepsis so that adequate treatment may be initiated. Accordingly, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the quick SOFA (qSOFA) scores are used to evaluate intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients, respectively. As demand for ICU beds rises, the intermediate care unit (IMCU) carries greater importance as a bridge between the ICU and the regular ward. This study aimed to examine the ability of SOFA and qSOFA scores to predict suspected infection and mortality in IMCU patients.

Methods

Retrospective data analysis included 13,780 surgical patients treated at the IMCU, ICU, or both between January 01, 2012, and September 30, 2018. Patients were screened for suspected infection (i.e., the commencement of broad-spectrum antibiotics) and then evaluated for the SOFA score, qSOFA score, and the 1992 defined systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.

Results

Suspected infection was detected in 1306 (18.3%) of IMCU, 1365 (35.5%) of ICU, and 1734 (62.0%) of IMCU/ICU encounters. Overall, 458 (3.3%) patients died (IMCU 45 [0.6%]; ICU 250 [6.5%]; IMCU/ICU 163 [5.8%]). All investigated scores failed to predict suspected infection independently of the analyzed subgroup. Regarding mortality prediction, the qSOFA score performed sufficiently within the IMCU cohort (AUCROC SIRS 0.72 [0.71–0.72]; SOFA 0.52 [0.51–0.53]; qSOFA 0.82 [0.79–0.84]), while the SOFA score was predictive in patients of the IMCU/ICU cohort (AUCROC SIRS 0.54 [0.53–0.54]; SOFA 0.73 [0.70–0.77]; qSOFA 0.59 [0.58–0.59]).

Conclusions

None of the assessed scores was sufficiently able to predict suspected infection in surgical ICU or IMCU patients. While the qSOFA score is appropriate for mortality prediction in IMCU patients, SOFA score prediction quality is increased in critically ill patients.

### Prognostic performance of age-adapted SOFA and qSOFA in septic children [^1125oX4K]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Age-adapted qSOFA may be sensitive in recognizing patients with sepsis and facilitates clinicians to quickly find out children who are at high risk for sepsis. However, when considering the limited specificity, promoting qSOFA in children with sepsis may have little benefit. It was reported that the mortality in pediatric sepsis was 3.5–4.4%, which is similar to or even lower than the general mortality in PICU but much lower than the mortality in adult sepsis. Should we urge to adapt qSOFA to pediatric sepsis, in which the mortality is not higher than that in general ICU population? Maybe we could focus our attention on the patients with septic shock in whom the mortality is higher than 30%, as this may be more helpful to improve outcomes in children with sepsis.

### Biomarkers improve diagnostics of sepsis in adult patients with suspected organ dysfunction based on the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score in the emergency department [^116e9JmU]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this prospective, multicenter, observational study enrolling 1477 patients, biomarkers of inflammation, most notably procalcitonin, were able to substantially improve early identification of incipient organ dysfunction within the first 96 hours after presentation to the ED. These added value to qSOFA as a simple screening tool for early identification of life-threatening complications of infection.

The studied biomarkers were selected as they complementarily reflect injury to typically affected organs, that is, kidneys (proenkephalin A) and cardiovascular system (adrenomedullin), or pathophysiologic mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction (adrenomedullin), or cell death (DPP3). While the qSOFA score is no longer recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign as a screening tool for sepsis, our data lend support to the notion that addition of procalcitonin with a cutoff of 0.25 µg/L can substantially improve diagnostic accuracy. The combined metric of procalcitonin-supported qSOFA outperformed the lactate-enhanced qSOFA metric proposed by Liu et al (eFig. 5). This combination of qSOFA and procalcitonin could potentially support decision making in the ED, assuming that delayed identification of organ dysfunction in infected patients may negatively affect outcomes. It should be acknowledged that PPV was moderate at 60.7% (95% CI, 56.3–65.0%) though NPV was high at 88.7% (95% CI, 86.4–90.8%).

### Prognostic accuracy of SOFA and qSOFA for mortality among children with infection: a meta-analysis [^11463YfY]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Age-adjusted Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and age-adjusted quick SOFA (qSOFA) scores have been developed to predict poor outcomes in children with infection. We investigated the prognostic performance of age-adjusted SOFA and age-adjusted qSOFA scores and compared them with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for predicting mortality in children with infection.

Methods

A bivariate random-effects regression model was used for synthesis of diagnostic test data.

Results

A total of 14 studies invoing 70,194 participants were included. The pooled sensitivity for age-adjusted SOFA, age-adjusted qSOFA, and SIRS were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74–0.88), 0.46 (95% CI, 0.22–0.71), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66–0.88), respectively. The pooled specificity for age-adjusted SOFA, age-adjusted qSOFA, and SIRS were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.45–0.77), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.66–0.98), and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.26–0.54), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUSROC) for age-adjusted SOFA, age-adjusted qSOFA, and SIRS were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79–0.85), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.62–0.70), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.60–0.68), respectively. Different baseline populations, different SOFA adaptation methods and different cut-offs used for age-adjusted SOFA may be potential sources of heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Age adjusted SOFA score is a useful tool for predicting mortality in children with sepsis/suspected sepsis.

Impact

First study to investigate the prognostic performance of age-adjusted sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and age adjusted quick SOFA (qSOFA) scores in comparison to the systemic inflammatory response criteria (SIRS) for the prediction of mortality in children with sepsis. The age-adjusted SOFA score predicts poor outcomes with high sensitivity in children with sepsis Low sensitivity limits the utility of age-adjusted qSOFA as a simple predictive tool for adverse outcomes. Developing another enhanced or modified bedside tool with higher sensitivity may be necessary.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^114WmMnJ]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Our results seem to justify the concern that qSOFA may be less sensitive (albeit more specific) than SIRS for predicting clinical deterioration in patients at risk of sepsis. Indeed, we found that qSOFA ≥ 2 had a 76% sensitivity for ICU-free days compared to 92% for SIRS ≥ 2. The same applied for outcomes, such as ventilator-free days (74% versus 93%), any organ dysfunction-free days (68% versus 89%), and renal dysfunction-free days (70% versus 88%) (Table 2). It has been supported that the high sensitivity of SIRS may make its usage for screening of sepsis impractical, because it identifies many patients who are likely to have normal regulated responses as opposed to the dysregulated response that defines sepsis. On the other hand, 6% of qSOFA-negative patients in our cohort died in the hospital. All those qSOFA-negative patients had one point suggesting that a negative qSOFA score, especially if borderline (i.e. qSOFA score of one) and combined with a positive SIRS score, might not be reassuring. A similar conclusion was reached by Churpek and colleagues, who found that half of their study patients did not meet ≥ 2 qSOFA criteria at the time of their death or ICU transfer. In contrast, Freund and colleagues showed a very low mortality rate of qSOFA-negative patients and they therefore inferred that qSOFA could replace SIRS without the risk of missing critically ill patients.

### QSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis [^1127mFTz]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

We all agree on the fundamental importance of identifying sepsis early and of applying effective and complete treatment to minimize complications. However, the SIRS criteria were too sensitive and not sufficiently specific for this purpose. Rangel-Frausto et al. reported that 68% of patients admitted to three intensive care units (ICUs) and three general wards met the SIRS criteria; in 198 ICUs in 24 European countries, Sprung et al. reported that 93% of ICU patients had at least two SIRS criteria at some point during their ICU stay; and in a database of patients in 23 Australian and New Zealand ICUs, Dulhunty et al. reported that 88.4% of patients had at least two SIRS criteria on ICU admission. In a recent analysis of a large US database, Churpek et al. reported that almost half of the 270,000 patients hospitalized on regular wards met the SIRS criteria at one time or another. Our consensus definition paper suggested the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) as an effective way of raising suspicion of sepsis on the regular floor. Evaluating all six components of the SOFA score can be time consuming, and some require laboratory measurements. By analyzing a large database of hospitalized patients, three clinical elements (hypotension, altered mentation, and tachypnea) were identified that could be used at the bedside to recognize those infected patients who are at risk of deteriorating or having a complicated course (death or ICU stay ≥ 3 days). The presence of two or more of these criteria can be used to prompt clinicians to further evaluate the patient for the presence of infection and/or organ dysfunction, to start or adapt treatment, and to consider transfer to an ICU. Importantly, this approach is designed to be an early warning system, and a patient with less than two qSOFA criteria may still raise concern. Clinical judgment should always supersede tools designed to help improve patient care, such as qSOFA.

### Application of the third international consensus definitions for sepsis (sepsis-3) classification: a retrospective population-based cohort study [^114iHXrQ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) present clinical criteria for the classification of patients with sepsis. We investigated incidence and long-term outcomes of patients diagnosed with these classifications, which are currently unknown.

Methods

We did a retrospective analysis using data from 30239 participants from the USA who were aged at least 45 years and enrolled in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Patients were enrolled between Jan 25, 2003, and Oct 30, 2007, and we identified hospital admissions from Feb 5, 2003, to Dec 31, 2012, and applied three classifications: infection and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, elevated sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score from Sepsis-3, and elevated quick SOFA (qSOFA) score from Sepsis-3. We estimated incidence during the study period, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality.

Findings

Of 2593 first infection events, 1526 met SIRS criteria, 1080 met SOFA criteria, and 378 met qSOFA criteria. Incidence was 8.2 events (95% CI 7.8–8.7) per 1000 person-years for SIRS, 5.8 events (5.4–6.1) per 1000 person-years for SOFA, and 2.0 events (1.8–2.2) per 1000 person-years for qSOFA. In-hospital mortality was higher for patients with an elevated qSOFA score (67 [23%] of 295 patients died) than for those with an elevated SOFA score (125 [13%] of 960 patients died) or who met SIRS criteria (128 [9%] of 1392 patients died). Mortality at 1 year after discharge was also highest for patients with an elevated qSOFA score (29.4 deaths [95% CI 22.3–38.7] per 100 person-years) compared with those with an elevated SOFA score (22.6 deaths [19.2–26.6] per 100 person-years) or those who met SIRS criteria (14.7 deaths [12.5–17.2] per 100 person-years).

Interpretation

SIRS, SOFA, and qSOFA classifications identified different incidences and mortality. Our findings support the use of the SOFA and qSOFA classifications to identify patients with infection who are at elevated risk of poor outcomes. These classifications could be used in future epidemiological assessments and studies of patients with infection.

### Low accuracy of positive qSOFA criteria for predicting 28-day mortality in critically ill septic patients during the early period after emergency department presentation [^112K6DJ6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine the diagnostic performance of positive Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores for predicting 28-day mortality among critically ill septic patients during the early period after emergency department (ED) presentation.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care academic center. We reviewed a registry of adult (≥ 18 years) patients who received a diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock during an ED stay from August 2008 through September 2014. We identified the point at which patients met 2 or more of the 3 qSOFA criteria (indicating a positive qSOFA score) simultaneously during the initial 24 hours. The diagnostic performance of positive qSOFA score for predicting 28-day mortality was assessed (on ED arrival and within 3, 6, and 24 hours after ED presentation).

Results

A total of 1,395 patients were included, and the overall 28-day mortality was 15%. For patients with positive qSOFA score, 28-day mortality was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19% to 28%) on ED arrival, 20% (95% CI 17% to 23%) at 3 hours, 20% (95% CI 17% to 22%) at 6 hours, and 17% (95% CI 15% to 20%) at 24 hours. Positive qSOFA score for predicting 28-day mortality had a sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve, respectively, of 39% (95% CI 32% to 46%), 77% (95% CI 75% to 80%), and 0.58 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.62) on ED arrival; 68% (95% CI 62% to 75%), 52% (95% CI 49% to 55%), and 0.60 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.63) within 3 hours; 82% (95% CI 76% to 87%), 41% (95% CI 38% to 44%), and 0.61 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.64) within 6 hours; and 91% (95% CI 86% to 94%), 23% (95% CI 21% to 25%), and 0.57 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.59) within 24 hours.

Conclusion

The diagnostic performance of positive qSOFA score for predicting 28-day mortality was low in critically ill septic patients, particularly during the early period after ED presentation. The study requires further prospective validation because of limitations with its retrospective design and use of single-center data.

### The quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment score in Brazil: insights for future use in diverse settings [^114uZ1gn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a common and deadly disease that poses a global threat, with nearly 20 million estimated cases annually. The burden of sepsis is highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Brazil, with mortality as high as 55% in some LMIC settings. Early recognition and resuscitation are both cornerstones of sepsis management. However, in the absence of a gold-standard diagnostic test, how best to recognize patients who are likely to be septic, and those who are at high risk of poor outcome, remains unclear. In 2016, the Sepsis-3 Task Force introduced the Quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score, a tool comprised of three clinical variables: respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Score. The qSOFA score had an equivalent predictive validity for sepsis compared with the more complex SOFA score in patients outside of the ICU and was thus recommended as a tool with which to identify, from among non-ICU patients with suspected infection, those more likely to be septic.

Since the release of the qSOFA score in 2016, there has been a high level of interest in the "who", "where", and "how" of its application, and there have been over 300 publications on its performance in a variety of settings and disease states. Retrospective studies in both high- and low-income settings, as well as prospective studies in high-income areas, have evaluated the predictive validity of the qSOFA score for the identification of sepsis, as measured by excessive hospital mortality beyond baseline risk factors. Although the qSOFA score generally performed well in both high-income settings and LMICs, the predictive validity varied widely among LMIC cohorts. Other retrospective studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the qSOFA score's prognostic accuracy for mortality both inside and outside the ICU and have found it to have variable accuracy. However, the prognostic accuracy of the qSOFA score for mortality in LMICs has never before been studied prospectively. Given the simplicity of the score and its potential usefulness in low-resource settings, better understanding of its performance in a range of LMIC settings is vital. In addition, it is critical to evaluate a variety of potential applications of the qSOFA score, including adjustment of the cut-point used to define a positive test, or combination of the score with additional test.

### Biomarkers improve diagnostics of sepsis in adult patients with suspected organ dysfunction based on the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score in the emergency department [^114aThYm]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Biomarkers of inflammation and organ dysfunction taken at ED presentation, most notably procalcitonin, improve the early prediction of sepsis and provide added value over qSOFA alone. Their performance to inform triage decision warrants further evaluation, preferentially by applying POC testing.

### Prognostic evaluation of quick sequential organ failure assessment score in ICU patients with sepsis across different income settings [^116JxNNu]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis-3 consensus definitions introduced quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a sepsis screening tool to identify patients with higher hospital mortality. The original Sepsis-3 derivation cohort showed that Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) was superior when compared to qSOFA or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) for prediction of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Subsequent early validation studies on qSOFA from ICUs in high income settings have confirmed these limitations. Thus, its potential role as a simple sepsis diagnostic and outcome prediction tool has been mostly evaluated in the Emergency Department.

Whether qSOFA has prognostic value for patients with sepsis in low resourced ICUs where Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score or SOFA may not be practical has not been robustly assessed. Recent evidence from low resource settings does suggest qSOFA is associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with infection. The addition of lactate has also been shown to improve qSOFA sepsis mortality prediction in all income settings.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^1174RbVX]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Finally, all included patients were eventually admitted to the ICU and therefore our study differs from the original qSOFA publication in that ICU transfer could not serve as its outcome. The decision for ICU transfer depends on the availability of ICU beds and varies across countries. Also, the nature of our dataset precluded determining if either score identified patients who, despite suspected infection, were not admitted to the ICU; indeed, patients with low qSOFA and/or low SIRS score might not be admitted to the ICU and subsequently they would not be included in our analysis. Taken together, our study population was more selected (i.e. more likely to have poor prognosis) compared to those of previous relevant studies. However, we calculated qSOFA and SIRS criteria while the patients were still outside the ICU and before the initiation of interventions (such as sedation, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors) which affect the scores.

### Comparison of qSOFA and SIRS for predicting adverse outcomes of patients with suspicion of sepsis outside the intensive care unit [^113o2AtW]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

More than two decades ago, sepsis was defined as the combination of infection and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). However, subsequent research revealed that sepsis is not an exclusively pro-inflammatory condition; rather, it may involve early anti-inflammatory responses. Moreover, SIRS criteria were found to be too sensitive and insufficiently specific to identify infected patients at risk for a complicated course. In the light of such developments, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) Task Force recently redefined sepsis. Sepsis is accordingly viewed as a "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection". Organ dysfunction was characterized by the acute increase of at least two points in the Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Given that SOFA requires laboratory testing and is rarely performed outside the intensive care unit (ICU), for patients in a non-ICU setting, the Sepsis-3 Task Force introduced a simpler algorithm, named quick SOFA (qSOFA).

The qSOFA has merits according to its proponents. It is simple (consisting of three clinical elements, namely hypotension, tachypnea and altered consciousness), it can be easily and repeatedly assessed, it was generated through a data-driven approach, and in a large retrospective study it was more accurate than SIRS score for predicting death and ICU transfer of patients with suspected sepsis outside the ICU. However, thoughtful criticisms have also been articulated. It has been stressed that the increased specificity of qSOFA over SIRS score for predicting poor prognosis may come at the expense of lower sensitivity, which may lead to delays in initiation of treatment. Others pointed that it was not endorsed by key scientific societies or they were skeptical about its misapplication as a clinical decision tool. The Sepsis-3 Task Force itself has strongly encouraged independent validation in multiple health care settings to confirm its robustness and suggested that qSOFA should also be evaluated for outcomes other than mortality and ICU stay.

Having the above considerations into mind, we endeavored to evaluate the discriminatory capacity of qSOFA versus SIRS criteria for predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU-free days in patients with suspected infection. In addition, we sought to assess the comparative accuracy of qSOFA and SIRS criteria for predicting other important clinical outcomes, such as ventilator-free days and organ dysfunction-free days.

---

### How well does qSOFA correspond to underlying systemic inflammatory response? [^113AFr34]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Need for prompt recognition and management of sepsis recently led to the introduction of qSOFA score. However, its association with underlying host inflammatory response remains unclear, while previous studies have challenged its performance in non - intensive care unit (ICU) patients comparing to previously used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Between June 2016 and April 2017, we performed a prospective observational study in the medical ward of a tertiary hospital to explore the relation of qSOFA ≥ 2 and < 2 to underlying inflammatory response, as this is mirrored in levels of serum pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators i.e. IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. A total of 100 consecutive patients were finally included in this study. Comparable levels [(pg/ml) median (IQR)] of IL-6 [200 (53–200) vs 65.1 (17.3–200)], IL-10 [7 (2.3–170.6) vs 2.3 (2.3–27.7)], and TNF-α [4 (4–46.1) vs 46.06 (4–227.2)] were noted between group of patients with qSOFA ≥ 2 or < 2. Nevertheless, prognosis was worse in patients with qSOFA ≥ 2 showing longer length of stay [10 (7–25) vs 5 (3–7) days, p = .03] and lower recovery rates (41 vs 93%, p < .0001). Our results underline the need for prompt management of critically ill patients in presence of systemic inflammatory response regardless of qSOFA score, partly reflecting its low sensitivity comparing to previously used SIRS criteria.

### Prognostic accuracy of the SOFA score, SIRS criteria, and qSOFA score for in-hospital mortality among adults with suspected infection admitted to the intensive care unit [^112NV7fA]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The Sepsis-3 Criteria emphasized the value of a change of 2 or more points in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, introduced quick SOFA (qSOFA), and removed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria from the sepsis definition.

Objective

Externally validate and assess the discriminatory capacities of an increase in SOFA score by 2 or more points, 2 or more SIRS criteria, or a qSOFA score of 2 or more points for outcomes among patients who are critically ill with suspected infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort analysis of 184 875 patients with an infection-related primary admission diagnosis in 182 Australian and New Zealand intensive care units (ICUs) from 2000 through 2015.

Exposures

SOFA, qSOFA, and SIRS criteria applied to data collected within 24 hours of ICU admission.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality or ICU length of stay (LOS) of 3 days or more was a composite secondary outcome. Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Adjusted analyses were performed using a model of baseline risk determined using variables independent of the scoring systems.

Results

Among 184 875 patients (mean age, 62.9 years [SD, 17.4]; women, 82 540 [44.6%]; most common diagnosis bacterial pneumonia, 32 634 [17.7%]), a total of 34 578 patients (18.7%) died in the hospital, and 102 976 patients (55.7%) died or experienced an ICU LOS of 3 days or more. SOFA score increased by 2 or more points in 90.1%; 86.7% manifested 2 or more SIRS criteria, and 54.4% had a qSOFA score of 2 or more points. SOFA demonstrated significantly greater discrimination for in-hospital mortality (crude AUROC, 0.753 [99% CI, 0.750–0.757]) than SIRS criteria (crude AUROC, 0.589 [99% CI, 0.585–0.593]) or qSOFA (crude AUROC, 0.607 [99% CI, 0.603–0.611]). Incremental improvements were 0.164 (99% CI, 0.159–0.169) for SOFA vs SIRS criteria and 0.146 (99% CI, 0.142–0.151) for SOFA vs qSOFA (P < .001). SOFA (AUROC, 0.736 [99% CI, 0.733–0.739]) outperformed the other scores for the secondary end point (SIRS criteria: AUROC, 0.609 [99% CI, 0.606–0.612]; qSOFA: AUROC, 0.606 [99% CI, 0.602–0.609]). Incremental improvements were 0.127 (99% CI, 0.123–0.131) for SOFA vs SIRS criteria and 0.131 (99% CI, 0.127–0.134) for SOFA vs qSOFA (P < .001). Findings were consistent for both outcomes in multiple sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with suspected infection admitted to an ICU, an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more had greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than SIRS criteria or the qSOFA score. These findings suggest that SIRS criteria and qSOFA may have limited utility for predicting mortality in an ICU setting.

### Prognostic evaluation of quick sequential organ failure assessment score in ICU patients with sepsis across different income settings [^1174bHgC]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, APACHE II and qSOFA both had poor specificity for 28-day mortality, although APACHE II was slightly higher [0.566 (95%CI 0.547–0.584) vs 0.490 (95%CI 0.471–0.508), p < 0.001]. Similarly, the sensitivity of either APACHE II or qSOFA for 28-day mortality was poor for 28-day mortality [0.608 (95%CI 0.577–0.638) vs. 0.625 (95%CI 0.595–0.655), p = 0.363]. Comparatively, qSOFA had higher sensitivity (p = 0.048) but lower specificity (p < 0.001) compared to SOFA which had sensitivity of 0.586 (95%CI 0.555–0.617) and specificity of 0.549 (95%CI 0.531–0.567) to predict 28-day mortality. Predictive performance of different scores for 3-day, 28-day and 90-day mortality are shown in Tables S5–S8, Additional file 2. The predictive performances of different scores for hospital mortality in subgroup analysis excluding patients who remained in hospital by day 90 were similar to the performances of the scores for 90-day mortality in the whole study cohort (see Additional file 2: Tables S9–S12).

### Identifying patients with sepsis on the hospital wards [^116vYcDt]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis contributes to up to half of all deaths in hospitalized patients, and early interventions, such as appropriate antibiotics, have been shown to improve outcomes. Most research has focused on early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis in the ED and the ICU; however, many patients acquire sepsis on the general wards. The goal of this review is to discuss recent advances in the detection of sepsis in patients on the hospital wards. We discuss data highlighting the benefits and limitations of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for screening patients with sepsis, such as its low specificity, as well as newly described scoring systems, including the proposed role of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score. Challenges specific to detecting sepsis on the wards are discussed, and future directions that use big data approaches and automated alert systems are highlighted.

### Comparison of qSOFA score, SOFA score, and SIRS criteria for the prediction of infection and mortality among surgical intermediate and intensive care patients [^112xKbs6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

At first glance, these study results might be surprising. However, in comparison to previous findings, the performance of the qSOFA score and the SIRS criteria remain agreeable. The qSOFA score was first developed and validated by Seymour et al. who analyzed 148,907 unselected patient encounters with suspected infection, consisting of a validation cohort of 7932 ICU and 66,522 non-ICU patients. With the exception of the SOFA score, the predictive value of the qSOFA and SIRS criteria could be matched to our study results within the ICU cohort (AUCROC SOFA 0.74 vs. 0.52; AUCROC qSOFA 0.66 vs. 0.63; AUCROC SIRS 0.64 vs. 0.63). Their findings have been validated in several studies featuring large numbers of patients (Table 4), resulting in a varying performance of the mentioned scores. However, it has to be stressed that originally Seymour et al. aimed to validate the qSOFA and SOFA scores as predictors for mortality and not for the identification of sepsis. The Sepsis-3 definition indicates that, due to their predictive value for mortality, both scores can be used for sepsis risk stratification (either at the ICU or non-ICU), but also emphasizes that the underlying data was derived from retrospective studies and requires further validation. However, until now, no prospective data, with sufficient numbers of patients, is available.
