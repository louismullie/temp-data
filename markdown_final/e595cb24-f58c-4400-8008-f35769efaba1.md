## Question

This information seems outdated. What do the IDSA guidelines say

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the current IDSA guidelines say and how to interpret their strength and applicability. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which IDSA guidelines in the provided corpus are truly the most recent and methodologically rigorous. Then, I should verify which of these are "living" or frequently updated versus static. Next, I will examine how IDSA grades recommendations and what that means for clinical decision-making. After that, I should identify the highest-credibility, most actionable guidelines by topic. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary and note any caveats or controversies that might influence practice.

> Let me first confirm the most recent and authoritative IDSA guidelines in the set. The 2021 IDSA/SHEA focused update on Clostridioides difficile infection is the most current CDI guidance and uses GRADE with explicit strength and certainty ratings, including a conditional recommendation favoring fidaxomicin over vancomycin for initial episodes and a conditional recommendation for bezlotoxumab in patients at high risk of recurrence, which I should double-check against the original 2017 guideline to ensure consistency with the broader framework [^112hFwfJ] [^115UuvKB] [^116DeuNS] [^114KrSoM].

> Wait, let me verify the COVID-19 guidance status because recommendations evolve rapidly. The IDSA COVID-19 treatment and management guideline is a living document with multiple version updates, including version 8.0.0 that added new recommendations on inhaled glucocorticoids and bebtelovimab, and version 5.4.0 that revised baricitinib remarks and corrected the certainty rating for hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure prophylaxis; this living approach means clinicians should check the website for the latest version rather than relying on a static citation, so I need to ensure I flag that explicitly [^111tirQm] [^113smNbk] [^117BAQxT].

> I should confirm the diagnostic testing guidance for COVID-19 as well. The IDSA has separate, frequently updated diagnostic guidelines covering molecular testing, antigen testing, and serology, with the most recent molecular testing update in December 2023 and serology updates in 2024; these documents use GRADE and emphasize test performance nuances and implementation, so I need to note that diagnostic guidance is dynamic and setting-dependent [^113V39u3] [^11381q74] [^115WLr3S] [^111o97UM] [^115ZksYm].

> Next, I should review pediatric musculoskeletal infection guidance. The 2023 PIDS/IDSA guideline on acute bacterial arthritis and the 2021 PIDS/IDSA guideline on acute hematogenous osteomyelitis are the most current pediatric specialty guidelines, both using GRADE and providing duration-of-therapy recommendations tailored to clinical response and source control, which I should highlight as particularly actionable for inpatient and outpatient pediatric care [^112SXrgK] [^115ammvr] [^114TxEvG].

> Hold on, I should verify the status of community-acquired pneumonia guidance. The 2019 ATS/IDSA CAP guideline is the most recent comprehensive update and is frequently referenced internationally; an expert appraisal highlights both widely accepted changes and areas of controversy, so clinicians should apply local epidemiology and resistance patterns when following its recommendations, especially regarding macrolide use thresholds and fluoroquinolone alternatives [^115NsVZp].

> Let me consider other high-priority IDSA guidelines that remain current and influential. The 2018 seasonal influenza guideline update addresses diagnostics, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and outbreak management, and it remains the most recent comprehensive IDSA influenza guidance; the 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria update refines screening and treatment indications across multiple populations; the 2016 aspergillosis and candidiasis guidelines are still widely used for invasive fungal disease management; and the 2017 infectious diarrhea guideline provides practical diagnostic and management pathways, though clinicians should cross-reference CDI-specific guidance for C. difficile–related diarrhea [^113n46vt] [^1144LTVC] [^115cn9bG] [^1166Ldjg] [^1157Fhk9] [^1178TecL].

> I need to check the tuberculosis diagnostics guidance. The 2017 ATS/IDSA/CDC TB diagnosis guideline offers strong and conditional recommendations on IGRA versus TST and on specimen testing for extrapulmonary TB, including smear, culture, NAAT, and histology, with explicit cautions about test performance and the need for integrated clinical judgment, which is essential when ruling in or out extrapulmonary disease [^114NykMY] [^113rqvNi].

> But wait, what about methodological rigor and how to interpret "strong" versus "conditional" recommendations. IDSA adopted GRADE broadly, and across these documents "strong" recommendations imply most patients would want the intervention and that policies can generally align, whereas "conditional" recommendations mean many patients may reasonably choose an alternative and shared decision-making is warranted; importantly, strong recommendations can occasionally be made despite low certainty when benefits clearly outweigh harms, so I should caution against equating strength solely with evidence quality [^1155wsr5] [^112sZGka] [^113V39u3].

> Let me synthesize the most current, highest-credibility IDSA guidelines by topic, while noting living status where relevant. For CDI, the 2021 IDSA/SHEA focused update is the definitive source and should be prioritized over the 2017 full guideline for treatment decisions. For COVID-19, the IDSA living treatment and diagnostic guidelines are the authoritative sources and require checking the website for the latest version. For pediatric musculoskeletal infections, the 2023 acute bacterial arthritis and 2021 acute hematogenous osteomyelitis guidelines are the most current. For CAP, the 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline remains the most recent comprehensive update. For influenza, the 2018 IDSA update is current. For aspergillosis and candidiasis, the 2016 IDSA guidelines remain the standard references pending future updates. For TB diagnostics, the 2017 ATS/IDSA/CDC guideline is the most recent. For infectious diarrhea, the 2017 IDSA guideline is the most recent comprehensive update, with CDI-specific guidance addressed separately [^112hFwfJ] [^111tirQm] [^112SXrgK] [^114TxEvG] [^115NsVZp] [^113n46vt] [^1166Ldjg] [^1157Fhk9] [^114NykMY] [^1178TecL].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought the 2017 CDI guideline might be the most current because it is comprehensive, but the 2021 focused update specifically supersedes treatment recommendations for initial episodes and first recurrence, so clinicians should rely on the 2021 focused update for therapy decisions even though the 2017 document remains useful for diagnostic and infection-prevention context [^113AuykV] [^114KrSoM].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate how to keep up with changes. For COVID-19, the IDSA explicitly uses a living guideline process with versioned updates and endorsements, so bookmarking the IDSA COVID-19 page and checking for new versions is prudent; for other IDSA guidelines, panels typically reassess at defined intervals, but major updates are announced, and clinicians can monitor IDSA communications or journal alerts for revisions, especially in rapidly evolving areas like diagnostics and therapeutics [^111tirQm] [^117BAQxT] [^112CrECK].

---

The IDSA guidelines are **current and evidence-based**, with regular updates using GRADE methodology [^112CrECK] and multidisciplinary expert panels [^113V39u3]. Key recent updates include:

- **COVID-19**: Living guidelines on diagnosis [^113V39u3] and treatment [^113P1VF3], updated frequently as evidence evolves [^111tirQm].
- **Clostridioides difficile**: 2021 focused update recommending fidaxomicin over vancomycin for initial episodes [^115YTVZK] and bezlotoxumab for high-risk patients [^115UuvKB].
- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline emphasizing narrower empiric therapy and enhanced diagnostics [^115NsVZp].
- **Seasonal influenza**: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, and outbreak management [^113n46vt] [^1144LTVC].
- **Hepatitis C**: 2023 AASLD/IDSA guidance expanding simplified treatment and pediatric eligibility [^111gTVzA].

IDSA guidelines are **widely adopted** and intended to support clinical decision-making, not replace clinician judgment [^114qefkc].

### Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) POSITION STATEMENT: why IDSA did not endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [^116FQvVP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

IDSA did not endorse the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines despite being represented in the working group that drafted the guidelines document. Leadership from the IDSA, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, and the Society of Critical Care Medicine had numerous amicable discussions primarily regarding the bolded, rated guidelines recommendations. Our societies had different perspectives, however, regarding the interpretation of the major studies that informed the guidelines' recommendations, thus leading us to different conclusions and different perspectives on the recommendations. IDSA consequently elected not to endorse the guidelines. IDSA nonetheless hopes to be able to continue collaborating with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Society of Critical Care Medicine to resolve our differences and to develop further strategies together to prevent sepsis and septic shock as well as reduce death and disability from these conditions both nationally and globally.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112bsb6y]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report updates and combines earlier versions of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) in HIV-infected adults (i.e., persons aged ≥ 18 years) and adolescents (i.e., persons aged 13–17 years), last published in 2002 and 2004, respectively. It has been prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care providers, HIV-infected patients, and policy makers in the United States. These guidelines address several OIs that occur in the United States and five OIs that might be acquired during international travel. Topic areas covered for each OI include epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; and special considerations during pregnancy. These guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists from the United States government and academic institutions. For each OI, a small group of specialists with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the guidelines were last published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting held at NIH in June 2007. After these presentations and discussion, the revised guidelines were further reviewed by the co-editors; by the Office of AIDS Research, NIH; by specialists at CDC; and by HIVMA of IDSA before final approval and publication. The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation, so that readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information regarding the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information regarding the use of interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection; 4) updated information concerning drug interactions that affect the use of rifamycin drugs for prevention and treatment of TB; 5) the addition of a section on hepatitis B virus infection; and 6) the addition of malaria to the list of OIs that might be acquired during international travel. This report includes eleven tables pertinent to the prevention and treatment of OIs, a figure that pertains to the diagnois of tuberculosis, a figure that describes immunization recommendations, and an appendix that summarizes recommendations for prevention of exposure to opportunistic pathogens.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA): 2021 focused update guidelines on management of Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^112hFwfJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is a focused update on management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in adults specifically addressing the use of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab for the treatment of CDI. This guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA). This guideline is intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for adults with CDI, including specialists in infectious diseases, gastroenterologists, hospitalists, pharmacists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for these patients. The panel's recommendations for the management CDI are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews. Summarized below are the recommendations for the management of CDI in adults. The panel followed a systematic process which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendation using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary and rationale that support each recommendation, and knowledge gaps can be found online in the full text.

### Quality and strength of evidence of the Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines [^112vEAXU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the distribution and temporal trends of the quality and strength of evidence supporting recommendations in the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines.

Methods

Guidelines either issued or endorsed by IDSA from March 1994 to July 2009 were evaluated using the IDSA-US Public Health Service Grading System. In this system, the letters A-E signify the strength of the recommendation, and numerals I-III indicate the quality of evidence supporting these recommendations. The distribution of the guideline recommendations among strength of recommendation and quality of evidence classes was quantified. Temporal changes between the first and current guideline version were evaluated.

Results

Approximately one-half (median, 50.0%; interquartile range [IQR], 38.1%-58.6%) of the recommendations in the current guidelines are supported by level III evidence (derived from expert opinion). Evidence from observational studies (level II) supports 31% of recommendations (median, 30.9%; IQR, 23.3%-43.2%), whereas evidence based on ≥ 1 randomized clinical trial (level I) constitutes 16% of the recommendations (median, 15.8%; IQR, 5.8%-28.3%). The strength of recommendation was mainly distributed among classes A (median, 41.5%; IQR, 28.7%-55.6%) and B (median, 40.3%; IQR, 27.1%-47.9%). Among guidelines with ≥ 1 revised version, the recommendations moved proportionately toward more level I evidence (+12.4%). Consequently, there was a proportional increase in class A recommendations (+11.1%) with a decrease in class C recommendations (-23.5%).

Conclusions

The IDSA guideline recommendations are primarily based on low-quality evidence derived from nonrandomized studies or expert opinion. These findings highlight the limitations of current clinical infectious diseases research that can provide high-quality evidence. There is an urgent need to support high-quality research to strengthen the evidence available for the formulation of guidelines.

### Charting the path forward: development, goals and initiatives of the 2019 Infectious Diseases Society of America strategic plan [^1146SYSZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In October 2018, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Board of Directors (BOD) decided to develop a 2019 IDSA Strategic Plan. The IDSA BOD has invested in strategic planning at regular intervals as part of an ongoing process to review and to renew the vision and direction of IDSA. Herein, the 2018–2019 strategic planning process and outcomes are described. The 2019 IDSA Strategic Plan presents 4 key initiatives: (1) optimize the development, dissemination, and adoption of timely and relevant ID guidance and guidelines that improve the outcomes of clinical care; (2) quantify, communicate, and advocate for the value of ID physicians to increase professional fulfillment and compensation; (3) facilitate the growth and development of the ID workforce to meet emerging scientific, clinical, and leadership needs; and (4) develop and position a new tool to serve as the leading US benchmark to measure and drive national progress on antimicrobial resistance. The BOD looks forward to developing, implementing, assessing, and advancing the 2019 IDSA Strategic Plan working with member volunteers, Society partners, and IDSA staff.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^114KrSoM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

A panel of experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) to update the 2010 clinical practice guideline on Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in adults. The update, which has incorporated recommendations for children (following the adult recommendations for epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment), includes significant changes in the management of this infection and reflects the evolving controversy over best methods for diagnosis. Clostridium difficile remains the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and has become the most commonly identified cause of healthcare-associated infection in adults in the United States. Moreover, C. difficile has established itself as an important community pathogen. Although the prevalence of the epidemic and virulent ribotype 027 strain has declined markedly along with overall CDI rates in parts of Europe, it remains one of the most commonly identified strains in the United States where it causes a sizable minority of CDIs, especially healthcare-associated CDIs. This guideline updates recommendations regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, infection prevention, and environmental management.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^115phoP8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance.

Objective

The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space.

Methods

IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations.

Conclusions

Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113P1VF3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2018 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114VbAbL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Recognizing the importance of timely guidance regarding the rapidly evolving field of hepatitis C management, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed a web-based process for the expeditious formulation and dissemination of evidence-based recommendations. Launched in 2014, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance website undergoes periodic updates as necessitated by availability of new therapeutic agents and/or research data. A major update was released electronically in September 2017, prompted primarily by approval of new direct-acting antiviral agents and expansion of the guidance's scope. This update summarizes the latest release of the HCV guidance and focuses on new or amended recommendations since the previous September 2015 print publication. The recommendations herein were developed by volunteer hepatology and infectious disease experts representing AASLD and IDSA and have been peer reviewed and approved by each society's governing board.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111gTVzA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases have collaboratively developed evidence-based guidance regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection since 2013. A panel of clinicians and investigators with extensive infectious diseases or hepatology expertise specific to HCV infection periodically review evidence from the field and update existing recommendations or introduce new recommendations as evidence warrants. This update focuses on changes to the guidance since the previous 2020 published update, including ongoing emphasis on recommended universal screening; management recommendations for incomplete treatment adherence; expanded eligibility for simplified chronic HCV infection treatment in adults with minimal monitoring; updated treatment and retreatment recommendations for children as young as 3 years old; management and treatment recommendations in the transplantation setting; and screening, treatment, and management recommendations for unique and key populations.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^111o97UM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has evolved during the pandemic as seroprevalence in global populations has increased. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct updated best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is an update to the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations and identify unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, decisions related to vaccination and administration of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma in immunocompromised patients, and identification of a serologic correlate of immunity.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature reviewed, identified, and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel recommends against serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first two weeks after symptom onset (strong recommendations, low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing should not be used to provide evidence of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients with a high clinical suspicion and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification test results (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing may assist with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). To seek evidence for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the panel suggests testing for IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies to nucleocapsid protein three to five weeks after symptom onset (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, we suggest against routine serologic testing given no demonstrated benefit to improving patient outcomes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence.) The panel acknowledges further that a negative spike antibody test may be a useful metric to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy.

Conclusions

The high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide limits the utility of detecting anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for diagnosis was graded as very low to low. Future studies should use serologic assays calibrated to a common reference standard.

Conflicts of interests.

Members of the expert panel complied with the IDSA policy regarding conflicts of interest, which requires disclosure of any financial or other interest that might be construed as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict. IDSA provided a conflict of interest disclosure statement to panel members and asked them to identify ties to companies manufacturing or developing products that might be affected by promulgation of the guideline. Information was requested regarding employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, research funding, expert testimony, and membership on company advisory committees. Regular updates of information pertaining to conflicts of interest were requested from each panel member after scheduled teleconference meetings. The panel made decisions on a case-by-case basis as to whether an individual's role should be limited as a result of a conflict. No limiting conflicts were identified. Complying with IDSA policy, most of the panel members were free of conflicts and one of the chairs was free of all conflicts.

Review and approval process.

The panel obtained feedback from three external peer reviewers. The final document was reviewed and approved by the entire panel. The contents of the guidelines and manuscript was reviewed and approved by the IDSA Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee and the Board of Directors of the IDSA and ASTMH before dissemination.

Future guideline revisions.

At annual intervals, the panel chairs will be asked for their input on the need to update the guideline based on an examination of the present literature. The Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee of the IDSA will consider this input and determine the necessity and timing of an update. If warranted, the entire panel or a subset thereof will be convened to discuss potential changes.

METHODOLOGY

Panel composition.

The IDSA and the ASTMH convened experts in the diagnosis and management of NCC from the fields of tropical and infectious diseases, neurology, and neurosurgery, including experts coming from endemic areas as well as from North America. All panel members were selected on the basis of their clinical expertise in NCC and their expertise in the disciplines of infectious diseases, tropical medicine, neurology, and neurosurgery.

Evidence review — the GRADE method.

GRADE is a systematic approach to guideline development that has been described in detail elsewhere. The IDSA adopted GRADE in 2008. In the GRADE system, the guideline panel assigns each recommendation with separate ratings for the underlying quality of evidence supporting the recommendation and for the strength with which the recommendation is made (Figure 1). Data from randomized controlled trials begin as "high" quality, and data from observational studies begin as "low" quality. However, the panel may judge that specific features of the data warrant decreasing or increasing the quality of evidence rating, and GRADE provides guidance on how such factors should be weighed. The strength assigned to a recommendation chiefly reflects the panel's confidence that the benefits of following the recommendation are likely to outweigh potential harms. Although the quality of evidence is an important factor in choosing recommendation strength, it is not prescriptive.

Process overview.

Panel members were each assigned to review the recent literature for at least one topic, evaluate the evidence, determine the strength of recommendations, and develop written evidence in support of these recommendations. The panel had several in-person meetings and conducted most of its work through monthly teleconferences and electronically based discussion during 2011–2017. Recommendations and grading of evidence were developed by the panel members based on GRADE criteria. All members of the panel participated in the preparation and/or review of the draft guidelines.

Executive Summary

Guidelines for the clinical management of persons with leishmaniasis were prepared by a Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). The guidelines are intended for internists, pediatricians, family practitioners, and dermatologists, as well as infectious disease specialists, practicing in the United States and Canada (for simplicity, referred to here as North America). The Panel followed a guideline development process that has been adopted by IDSA, which includes a systematic method of grading both the quality of evidence (very low, low, moderate, or high) and the strength of the recommendation (weak or strong) (Figure 1

### Clinical practice guideline by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA): 2021 focused update guidelines on management of Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^1155wsr5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA Clostridioides difficile infection guideline — recommendation strength and wording are defined using the GRADE approach: all recommendations are labeled as either "strong" or "conditional", with the words "we recommend" indicating strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicating conditional recommendations, and Figure 1 provides the suggested interpretation for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policymakers. A "strong" recommendation implies that most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas a "conditional" recommendation means that the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action but many would not. For recommendations where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention". "Research Needs" were noted for recommendations as deemed appropriate by the panel.

IDSA babesiosis guideline — recommendation grading and revision process explains methodological conventions: "All recommendations were labeled as either 'strong' or 'weak' according to the GRADE approach". When comparators are not specified, "the comparison of interest is implicitly referred to as 'not using the intervention' (either not using a specific treatment or diagnostic test)". "The strength of recommendations was established by informal consensus". Governance and updates are noted, including external peer review and approvals, and that "Approximately every 2 years, but more frequently if needed, IDSA will determine the need for revisions to the guideline by an examination of the current literature and the likelihood that any new data will have an impact on the recommendations".

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^116NNXUH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA babesiosis guideline methodology — panel composition, question development, and evidence review are detailed as follows: Clinical Practice Guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care and are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of benefits and risks. A total of 17 panelists comprised the full panel, and patient representatives participated with confidentiality maintained. An initial list of relevant clinical questions was created by the whole panel, all outcomes of interest were identified a priori and explicitly rated for importance, and each clinical question was assigned to a pair of panelists. The Tufts Medical Center technical team consisted of 3 experts in systematic reviews who designed the literature searches, and a technical review team performed the systematic reviews using the PICO question format (Patient/Population [P]; Intervention/Indicator [I]; Comparator/Control [C]; Outcome [O]). Searches were limited to studies published in English with no restriction on the year of publication, databases searched included Ovid Medline, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, Scopus, and EMBASE, and studies published up to April 2019 were included if pertinent. Conference abstracts or proceedings, letters to the editor, editorials, review articles, and unpublished data were excluded from the evidence base for graded recommendations. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for nonrandomized studies, and the QUADAS-2 tool for diagnostic test accuracy studies.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^113V39u3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guidelines — recommendation strength and interpretation state that, as per GRADE methodology, recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", with the words "we recommend" indicating strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicating conditional recommendations; when comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the test". The guideline notes that rarely, low certainty evidence may lead to strong recommendations, defines a "good practice statement" as a message necessary to health care practice supported by a large body of indirect evidence with large net positive consequences, and explains that some recommendations acknowledge a current "knowledge gap" to avoid premature favorable recommendations and rapid diffusion of potentially inaccurate tests.

### Policy statement on antimicrobial stewardship by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) [^116D6YAw]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Research on antimicrobial stewardship — significant knowledge gaps exist, and SHEA, IDSA, and PIDS believe that we must refocus translational research efforts. All areas of the translational research paradigm must be addressed, and two primary issues of equal importance must be considered: the benchmarking of antimicrobial use and the development of clear, well-defined, and validated process and outcome measures to assess stewardship impact. Initial research proposals should focus on standardized definitions and measures of appropriate and inappropriate antimicrobial use, standardized data collection tools, and delineation of drivers and risk factors for inappropriate use. Patient-centered outcomes research is needed to determine the most effective and cost-efficient deployment of antimicrobial stewardship interventions across settings, and the societies recommend using robust study designs that include multicenter randomized-cluster-designed studies that compare stewardship interventions across various health-care settings.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^112AUogF]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Fever is frequently an early indicator of infection and often requires rigorous diagnostic evaluation.

Objectives

This is an update of the 2008 Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society (IDSA) and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guideline for the evaluation of new-onset fever in adult ICU patients without severe immunocompromise, now using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Panel Design

The SCCM and IDSA convened a taskforce to update the 2008 version of the guideline for the evaluation of new fever in critically ill adult patients, which included expert clinicians as well as methodologists from the Guidelines in Intensive Care, Development and Evaluation Group. The guidelines committee consisted of 12 experts in critical care, infectious diseases, clinical microbiology, organ transplantation, public health, clinical research, and health policy and administration. All task force members followed all conflict-of-interest procedures as documented in the American College of Critical Care Medicine/SCCM Standard Operating Procedures Manual and the IDSA. There was no industry input or funding to produce this guideline.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review for each population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak or as best-practice statements.

Results

The panel issued 12 recommendations and 9 best practice statements. The panel recommended using central temperature monitoring methods, including thermistors for pulmonary artery catheters, bladder catheters, or esophageal balloon thermistors when these devices are in place or accurate temperature measurements are critical for diagnosis and management. For patients without these devices in place, oral or rectal temperatures over other temperature measurement methods that are less reliable such as axillary or tympanic membrane temperatures, noninvasive temporal artery thermometers, or chemical dot thermometers were recommended. Imaging studies including ultrasonography were recommended in addition to microbiological evaluation using rapid diagnostic testing strategies. Biomarkers were recommended to assist in guiding the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. All recommendations issued were weak based on the quality of data.

Conclusions

The guidelines panel was able to formulate several recommendations for the evaluation of new fever in a critically ill adult patient, acknowledging that most recommendations were based on weak evidence. This highlights the need for the rapid advancement of research in all aspects of this issue-including better noninvasive methods to measure core body temperature, the use of diagnostic imaging, advances in microbiology including molecular testing, and the use of biomarkers.

### Final report of the Lyme disease review panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115A6WHN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

In April 2008, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) entered into an agreement with Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to voluntarily undertake a special review of its 2006 Lyme disease guidelines. This agreement ended the Attorney General's investigation into the process by which the guidelines were developed. The IDSA agreed to convene an independent panel to conduct a one-time review of the guidelines. The Review Panel members, vetted by an ombudsman for potential conflicts of interest, reviewed the entirety of the 2006 guidelines, with particular attention to the recommendations devoted to post-Lyme disease syndromes. After multiple meetings, a public hearing, and extensive review of research and other information, the Review Panel concluded that the recommendations contained in the 2006 guidelines were medically and scientifically justified on the basis of all of the available evidence and that no changes to the guidelines were necessary.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Guidelines for the clinical management of patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC) were prepared by a panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). The guidelines are intended for infectious disease specialists, neurologists, neurological surgeons, internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners.

These guidelines present our approaches to the diagnosis and management of patients with the different forms of NCC, including viable parenchymal NCC (VPN), single enhancing lesions (SEL), calcified parenchymal NCC (CPN), ventricular NCC (IVN), and subarachnoid NCC (SAN). Our recommendations are based on the best evidence available. Because of the complex variations in clinical manifestations and the limitations of the literature, many of the recommendations are based on observational studies, anecdotal data, or expert opinion rather than randomized clinical trials. The approaches we describe are intended to be both applicable and feasible in the United States and Canada (for simplicity, referred to here as North America). The recommendations may not apply for settings where resource constraints may limit their applicability. The executive summary in the following paragraphs lists the recommendations for the diagnosis and clinical management of NCC. A detailed description of the methods, background, and evidence summaries that support each of the recommendations can be found online in the full text of the guidelines. A criterion for grading evidence is presented in Figure 1. Note that diagnosis and management of patients with NCC can be challenging even with expert guidelines. Because of this complexity, clinicians with little experience with this disease should have a low threshold for consultation with an expert in the disease.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cn9bG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

Aspergillosis guideline methodology — panel composition, evidence grading, and process: The panel consisted of 27 members of the IDSA, including 16 adult infectious diseases physicians and 1 pediatric infectious diseases physician. The IDSA/HIV Medicine Association adopted GRADE in 2008, and in the GRADE system the panel assigns each recommendation separate ratings for the underlying quality of evidence and the strength with which the recommendation is made, with data from randomized controlled trials beginning as "high" quality and data from observational studies beginning as "low" quality. Panel members were each assigned to review the recent literature for at least one topic, and the panel met face-to-face once and held conference calls over a 10-month period. Searches were restricted to English-language publications and covered January 2008 through December 2014, with abstracts from international conferences within the past 2 years also reviewed. The expert panel complied with the IDSA policy on conflicts of interest. The panel obtained feedback from 2 external peer reviewers, and the guideline was reviewed and approved by the IDSA Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee and the IDSA Board of Directors prior to dissemination. At annual intervals, the panel chairs will be asked for their input on the need to update the guideline based on an examination of the current literature.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^112es1Uf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Babesiosis serology confirmation and diagnostic thresholds — single positive antibody tests require confirmatory testing: For patients with a positive Babesia antibody test, we recommend confirmation with blood smear or PCR before treatment is considered (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A single positive antibody test is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of babesiosis because Babesia antibodies can persist in blood for a year or more following apparent clearance of infection, with or without treatment. For serologic interpretation, a B. microti IgG antibody titer of ≥ 1:1024 or the presence of B. microti IgM antibody are suggestive of active or recent B. microti infection, while a 4-fold rise in Babesia IgG antibody from acute illness to convalescence confirms the diagnosis.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^115ZksYm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serology — Recommendation 5 states that when evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is desired, the IDSA panel suggests using serologic assays that target nucleocapsid protein rather than spike protein (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). This is supported by remarks that most available vaccines result in formation of only anti-spike antibodies, that some inactivated whole virus vaccines can also result in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and that detection of anti-spike antibodies has low positive predictive value for diagnosis of recent COVID-19 in most individuals.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^114tvbH1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, "80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation", and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, "50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option". Recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; "we recommend" indicates strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention", and the recommendations acknowledge the current "knowledge gap" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Guidelines development process for HIV-related opportunistic infection recommendations provides guidance to HIV care practitioners and others on the optimal prevention and management of HIV-related opportunistic infections (OIs) for adults and adolescents in the United States. The Panel is composed of co-editors who represent the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Disease Society of America (HIVMA/IDSA), and members serve on the Panel for a 3-year term. All members of the Panel submit a written financial disclosure annually, and the co-editors review each reported association for potential conflicts of interest and determine the appropriate action: disqualification from the Panel, disqualification or recusal from topic review and discussion, or no disqualification needed. The developer is the Panel on Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV — a working group of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (OARAC), and the funding source is The Office of AIDS Research (OAR), NIH. Recommendations are based on studies published in peer-reviewed journals, with unpublished data from major conferences or information prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or manufacturers possibly used to revise the guidelines when new information may affect patient safety, and panel members of each working group are responsible for identifying relevant literature, conducting a systematic comprehensive review, and proposing updates. Each section is assigned to a working group of Panel members with expertise, the members synthesize available data, and all proposed recommendations and supporting evidence are reviewed by the co-editors, OAR, and subject matter experts at CDC and HIVMA/IDSA before final approval and publication. Recommendations are rated according to the information in the table "Rating System for Prevention and Treatment Recommendations", and accompanied, as needed, by explanatory text that reviews the evidence and the working group's assessment.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^11381q74]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline — abstract states that accurate molecular diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are necessary to confirm coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in respiratory specimens informs decision-making at patient, healthcare institution, and public health levels. The guideline's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests, with IDSA convening a multidisciplinary panel and using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations, and access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is described as critical for patient care and hospital infection prevention.

### Executive summary: 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^117QoooE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. Coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, is a systemic infection endemic to parts of the southwestern United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. Residence in and recent travel to these areas are critical elements for the accurate recognition of patients who develop this infection. In this practice guideline, we have organized our recommendations to address actionable questions concerning the entire spectrum of clinical syndromes. These can range from initial pulmonary infection, which eventually resolves whether or not antifungal therapy is administered, to a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Additional recommendations address management of coccidioidomycosis occurring for special at-risk populations. Finally, preemptive management strategies are outlined in certain at-risk populations and after unintentional laboratory exposure.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^117XoVfu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: The American Thoracic Society, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Respiratory Society, and Infectious Diseases Society of America jointly sponsored this new practice guideline on the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). The document includes recommendations on the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) as well as isoniazid-resistant but rifampin-susceptible TB. Methods: Published systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and a new individual patient data meta-analysis from 12,030 patients, in 50 studies, across 25 countries with confirmed pulmonary rifampin-resistant TB were used for this guideline. Meta-analytic approaches included propensity score matching to reduce confounding. Each recommendation was discussed by an expert committee, screened for conflicts of interest, according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Results: Twenty-one Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes questions were addressed, generating 25 GRADE-based recommendations. Certainty in the evidence was judged to be very low, because the data came from observational studies with significant loss to follow-up and imbalance in background regimens between comparator groups. Good practices in the management of MDR-TB are described. On the basis of the evidence review, a clinical strategy tool for building a treatment regimen for MDR-TB is also provided. Conclusions: New recommendations are made for the choice and number of drugs in a regimen, the duration of intensive and continuation phases, and the role of injectable drugs for MDR-TB. On the basis of these recommendations, an effective all-oral regimen for MDR-TB can be assembled. Recommendations are also provided on the role of surgery in treatment of MDR-TB and for treatment of contacts exposed to MDR-TB and treatment of isoniazid-resistant TB.

### Community-acquired pneumonia guideline recommendations-impact of a consensus-based process versus systematic reviews [^112t2huR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP) guidelines were developed using systematic reviews to inform every recommendation, as suggested by the Institute of Medicine Standards for Trustworthy Guidelines. Recent studies suggest that an expert consensus-based approach, called the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process, can produce recommendations that are concordant with recommendations informed by systematic reviews.

Purpose

The goal of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the CORE process had it been used to develop the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines.

Methods

Experts in CAP who were not on the guideline panel and had no knowledge of the guideline's systematic reviews or recommendations were recruited to participate in the CORE process, addressing the same questions asked by the guideline panel. Recommendations derived from the CORE process were compared to the guideline recommendations. Concordance of the course of action, strength of recommendation, and quality of evidence were determined.

Results

Using a threshold of 70% of experts selecting the same course of action to make a recommendation, the CORE process yielded a recommendation for 20 of 31 (65%) questions. Among the 20 CORE-derived recommendations, 19 (95%) were concordant with the guideline recommendations (kappa agreement 0.88, 95% CI .64–1.00). There was less agreement among the strength of recommendations (58%) and quality of evidence (42%).

Conclusions

If the CORE process had been used, 11 systematic reviews would have been necessary rather than 31, with minimal impact on the recommended courses of action.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^111Y7cMq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — recommendations for pregnant women: For initial nonmeningeal infection in the first trimester, intravenous AmB is recommended (strong, moderate); other options include no therapy with close monitoring (weak, low) or an azole antifungal after educating the mother (weak, low). After the first trimester, an azole antifungal can be considered (strong, low), with the alternative of intravenous AmB throughout pregnancy (weak, moderate). For CM in the first trimester, intrathecal AmB is recommended (strong, moderate); after the first trimester, an azole antifungal, such as fluconazole or itraconazole, can be prescribed (strong, low). Among women with prior coccidioidomycosis not on therapy, the risk of reactivation is low and antifungal therapy is not recommended (strong, moderate); for such women, close follow-up with coccidioidal serologic testing at the initial visit and every 6–12 weeks throughout pregnancy should be performed (strong, moderate). For nonmeningeal disease in remission on an azole when pregnancy begins, azole therapy may be discontinued with clinical and serological monitoring every 4–6 weeks (weak, low), or azole therapy may be stopped and intravenous AmB started in the first trimester, changing back to an azole after the first trimester (strong, low). For pregnant women with CM already on an azole, azole therapy should be stopped for the first trimester due to teratogenicity risk (strong, moderate) and intrathecal AmB can be initiated, especially if meningeal signs and symptoms are present (strong, moderate); azole therapy may then be restarted in the second trimester (weak, low) or intrathecal AmB continued throughout gestation (weak, low). An alternative is to continue azole therapy throughout with informed maternal agreement (weak, low), and a final alternative is to stop all therapy during pregnancy and restart in the second or third trimester (weak, very low), though some experts do not recommend it because of relapse risk. Febrile pulmonary illness in pregnancy in endemic or appropriately traveled women should be evaluated for active coccidioidomycosis, including chest radiograph and coccidioidal serology and cultures (strong, moderate).

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Rationale for recommendation — The panel states that the balance of benefits and harms "favors adding bezlotoxumab to SOC antibiotics for patients with a CDI episode and at least 1 risk factor for recurrence (recurrent CDI episode within the last 6 months, age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised host, and severe CDI on presentation)", and notes it "seems more favorable in patients with multiple risk factors for recurrent CDI and especially in patients with a prior CDI in the last 6 months". The certainty of evidence is described as "moderate overall, but very low in subpopulations at high risk of CDI recurrence".

IDSA 2018 influenza — bacterial coinfection evaluation and empiric therapy recommendations: In patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza who present initially with severe disease, clinicians "should investigate and empirically treat bacterial coinfection… in addition to antiviral treatment for influenza (A-II)". Clinicians "should investigate and empirically treat bacterial coinfection in patients who deteriorate after initial improvement, particularly in those treated with antivirals (A-III)". Clinicians "can consider investigating bacterial coinfection in patients who fail to improve after 3–5 days of antiviral treatment (C-III)".

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — whom to test: Clinicians should test for influenza in all patients who, while hospitalized, develop acute onset of respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, or respiratory distress, without a clear alternative diagnosis (A-III). During periods of low influenza activity: Clinicians should test for influenza on admission in all patients requiring hospitalization with acute respiratory illness, with or without fever, who have an epidemiological link to a person diagnosed with influenza, an influenza outbreak or outbreak of acute febrile respiratory illness of uncertain cause, or who recently traveled from an area with known influenza activity (A-II). Clinicians can consider testing for influenza in patients with acute, febrile respiratory tract illness, especially children and adults who are immunocompromised or at high risk of complications, or if the results might influence antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions for high-risk household contacts.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^117RDwGm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — vaccination status, immunocompromised hosts, and treatment initiation — Annual influenza vaccination can prevent influenza, but influenza vaccine effectiveness has ranged from low to moderate in preventing medically attended outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and may have lower effectiveness in immunocompromised patients, who may also experience prolonged influenza viral replication. A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. Therefore, antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible in hospitalized patients, high-risk persons, and those with severe or progressive disease if influenza is suspected, irrespective of receipt of influenza vaccine.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Clinical questions and evidence review — search strategy, time frames, and inclusion criteria are detailed: The clinical practice guideline development started in 2011 and a first iteration was nearly completed by 2017, after which the methodology was revisited to fulfill National Academy of Medicine standards; in line with these standards, the GRADE approach for the assessment of the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendation was integrated, and a new set of clinical questions was developed with outcomes identified a priori and explicitly rated. The Health Sciences Library System at the University of Pittsburgh and the William H. Welch Medical Library of Johns Hopkins University designed literature searches and MeSH terms for Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Reviews. Searches were limited to studies published in English and restricted to year of publication from January 2005 to January 2022, with an initial internal search in August 2017 and updates in May 2019, February 2021, and January 2022. Screening used predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria with all potentially relevant citations undergoing full-text review; abstracts and conference proceedings, letters to the editor, editorials, review articles, and unpublished data were excluded, and a minimum of 10 reported confirmed ABA cases was required for published manuscripts to be included in the pooled analysis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117CmmmT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Executive summary — background and scope defines chronic kidney disease (CKD) as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3 months, with implications for health, specifies that the scope is CKD in HIV-infected adults and children in the United States, and notes that screening, evaluation, or management of HIV-related kidney disease in resource-constrained settings are not addressed. The document is an update of the 2005 version and summarizes the 2014 revised recommendations for the management of CKD in HIV-infected persons. The panel followed a guideline development process adopted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA), including grading of the quality of evidence (very low, low, moderate, and high) and the strength of the recommendation (weak or strong). The guidelines are not intended to replace clinical judgment in the management of individual patients, and "IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances".

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guideline — initial episode treatment with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin — recommendation and pooled outcomes: For patients with an initial CDI episode, the guideline states, "we suggest using fidaxomicin rather than a standard course of vancomycin (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence)". The comment notes implementation "depends upon available resources" and that "Vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative". Trials compared fidaxomicin with vancomycin "(125 mg orally 4 times daily for 10 days)", and one study used an extended regimen "(200 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, followed by once daily on alternate days on days 7–25)… rather than a standard regimen (200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days)". In pooled analysis, fidaxomicin increased sustained response at 4 weeks versus standard vancomycin with "risk ratio [RR]: 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.24", while initial clinical cure was comparable "(RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96–1.04)" and mortality was not reduced "(RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.66–1.23)". Drug-related adverse events were not increased "(RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.76–1.36)", and "The overall certainty in the evidence was rated as moderate" due to study design and imprecision.

IDSA/SHEA CDI guideline — PICO 3 (bezlotoxumab plus standard-of-care [SOC] antibiotics vs SOC antibiotics alone): For CDI recurrence after initial clinical cure at 12 weeks, Certainty of the Evidence (GRADE): Moderate, with RR .62 (.51 to .75), Risk With SOC Antibiotics 326 per 1000, and Risk Difference With Bezlotoxumab 125 fewer per 1000 (174 fewer to 77 fewer). For CDI-associated hospital readmission at 30 days, Certainty of the Evidence (GRADE): Very low, with RR .46 (.29 to .71), Risk With SOC Antibiotics 112 per 1000, and Risk Difference 61 fewer per 1000 (83 fewer to 28 fewer). For drug-related adverse events at 4 weeks, Certainty of the Evidence (GRADE): Low, with RR 1.27 (.88 to 1.85), Risk With SOC Antibiotics 59 per 1000, and Risk Difference 16 more per 1000 (9 fewer to 41 more). For all-cause mortality at 12 weeks, Certainty of the Evidence (GRADE): Low, with RR .94 (.66 to 1.34), Risk With SOC Antibiotics 76 per 1000, and Risk Difference 4 fewer per 1000 (30 fewer to 22 more).

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^117TLwH2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship program — definition, benefits, leadership, and terminology are outlined as follows: Antibiotic stewardship is defined as "coordinated interventions designed to improve and measure the appropriate use of [antibiotic] agents by promoting the selection of the optimal [antibiotic] drug regimen including dosing, duration of therapy, and route of administration". The benefits "include improved patient outcomes, reduced adverse events including Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), improvement in rates of antibiotic susceptibilities to targeted antibiotics, and optimization of resource utilization across the continuum of care". Leadership expectations are stated as "IDSA and SHEA strongly believe that antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) are best led by infectious disease physicians with additional stewardship training". Terminology is specified: "the term antibiotic will be used instead of antimicrobial and should be considered synonymous".

IDSA/SHEA 2017 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — Initiating and escalating contact isolation: "Patients with suspected CDI should be placed on preemptive contact precautions pending the C. difficile test results if test results cannot be obtained the same day" (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence includes delayed availability of results ("were not available for 2.07 days") and substantial transient contamination risk ("was 69%"). For persistent transmission despite standard measures, "Prolong contact precautions until discharge if CDI rates remain high despite implementation of standard infection control measures against CDI" (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), consistent with "Prolonging contact precautions until discharge remains a special control measure if CDI rates remain high despite implementation of standard infection control measures against CDI".

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — IGRA vs TST recommendations for individuals ≥ 5 years: We recommend performing an IGRA rather than a TST in individuals 5 years or older who are likely to be infected with Mtb, have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, it has been decided that testing for LTBI is warranted, and either have a history of BCG vaccination or are unlikely to return to have their TST read (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); remarks note that a TST is an acceptable alternative, especially where an IGRA is not available, too costly, or too burdensome. For all other individuals 5 years or older who are likely to be infected with Mtb and have a low or intermediate risk of disease progression, We suggest performing an IGRA rather than a TST (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), with remarks again stating that a TST is an acceptable alternative in settings where an IGRA is not available, too costly, or too burdensome.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — extrapulmonary specimen testing recommendations: We suggest that AFB smear microscopy be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and remarks state that a positive result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making because false-positive results are unlikely; however, a negative result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common. We recommend that mycobacterial cultures be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), with remarks that a positive result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making because false-positive results are unlikely; however, a negative result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common. We suggest that NAAT be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting in remarks that a positive NAAT result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making because false-positive results are unlikely; however, a negative NAAT result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common and the test is an off-label use of the test. We suggest that histological examination be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with remarks that both positive and negative results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario because neither false-positive nor false-negative results are rare. We recommend one culture isolate from each mycobacterial culture-positive patient be submitted to a regional genotyping laboratory for genotyping (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach — study design determines initial confidence, with "Randomized trials ➔ High confidence" and "Observational studies ➔ Low confidence"; confidence can be lowered for "Risk of Bias", "Inconsistency", "Indirectness", "Imprecision", and "Publication bias", or raised for "Large effect", "Dose response", and when "All plausible confounding & bias would reduce a demonstrated effect or would suggest a spurious effect if no effect was observed"; final confidence ratings include "High", "Moderate", "Low", and "Very low". For a Strong recommendation, "Healthcare workers: Most people should receive the recommended course of action" and "Policy makers: The recommendation can be adopted as a policy in most situations", whereas for a Weak recommendation the population is described as "The majority of people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not" and healthcare workers should "Be prepared to help people to make a decision that is consistent with their own values/decision aids and shared decision making".

### Outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline update [^112t4QcX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) guideline on outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in patients with cancer. Methods ASCO and IDSA convened an Update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel. Results Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review. Recommendation Clinical judgment is recommended when determining which patients are candidates for outpatient management, using clinical criteria or a validated tool such as the Multinational Association of Support Care in Cancer risk index. In addition, psychosocial and logistic considerations are outlined within the guideline. The panel continued to endorse consensus recommendations from the previous version of this guideline that patients with febrile neutropenia receive initial doses of empirical antibacterial therapy within 1 hour of triage and be monitored for ≥ 4 hours before discharge. An oral fluoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or clindamycin, if penicillin allergic) is recommended as empirical outpatient therapy, unless fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before fever developed. Patients who do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen should be re-evaluated and considered as candidates for inpatient treatment. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^116wHVJg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112cLfcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Acute bacterial skin infections: developments since the 2005 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines [^114maJKF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) commonly present to Emergency Departments (EDs) where physicians encounter a wide spectrum of disease severity. The prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has increased in the past decade, and CA-MRSA is now a predominant cause of purulent ABSSSI in the United States (US).

Objectives

This article reviews significant developments since the most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the management of ABSSSI in the CA-MRSA era, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CA-MRSA, newer antimicrobials with improved MRSA activity, new diagnostic technologies, and options for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT).

Discussion

The increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has led the IDSA and other organizations to recommend empiric coverage of CA-MRSA for purulent ABSSSI. The availability of rapid MRSA detection assays from skin and soft tissue swabs could potentially facilitate earlier selection of targeted antimicrobial therapy. Several newer intravenous antibiotics with expanded MRSA coverage, including ceftaroline fosamil, daptomycin, linezolid, and telavancin, may be utilized for treatment of ABSSSI. OPAT may be an option for intravenous administration of antibiotics in selected patients and may prevent or shorten hospitalizations, decrease readmission rates, and reduce nosocomial infections and complications.

Conclusion

The growing prevalence of CA-MRSA associated with ABSSSI in the US has a significant impact on clinical management decisions in the ED. Recent availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options may help meet the demand for effective antistaphylococcal agents.

Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America joint guidelines

In 2010, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) put forward joint guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CDI in the US (Table 3). These guidelines focused their recommendations on triaging disease severity, choosing WBC > 15,000 × 10⁹/l and a creatinine > 1.5 times baseline value as two thresholds to define severe disease. This was different from the European guidelines as this allowed for more definitive simplistic criteria to triage severity.

Table 3.
IDSA and SHEA joint guidelines.

The IDSA/SHEA followed the findings of Zar et al. for treatment of initial infection, recommending oral metronidazole for "mild or moderate" CDI and vancomycin for severe disease. They chose to define 'severe, complicated' as those who have hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon, and that cohort would receive the higher dose vancomycin 500 mg by mouth (PO) QID with intravenous metronidazole 500 mg TID. For those with an ileus or unable to take oral intake, rectal instillation of vancomycin was recommended. Their recommendations for the first recurrence, and two or more recurrences, were similar to the European guidelines from 2009 as well.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111TbwBp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA/HIVMA chronic kidney disease (CKD) in HIV guideline methodology — GRADE framework, development process, evidence review, and approvals: The panel "adopted GRADE in 2008" and "assigns each recommendation with separate ratings for the underlying quality of evidence supporting the recommendation and for the strength with which the recommendation is made"; "Data from randomized controlled trials begin as 'high' quality", the recommendation strength "chiefly reflects the panel's confidence that the benefits of following the recommendation are likely to outweigh potential harms", and quality ratings are "not prescriptive". Development steps included an initial teleconference "in August 2010", teleconferences "approximately every 3–4 months", and face-to-face meetings "in February 2011 and in March 2012". Searches were "restricted to English-language publications and covered the period of 1990 to September 2013", conference abstracts "within the past 2 years" were reviewed, and sources included "PubMed and the Cochrane library"; panel input used "A Web-based survey was used to allow panel members to indicate agreement or disagreement with the recommendations in each section and to suggest revisions", after which the panel "reached consensus on recommendation substance and wording" and circulated a complete draft. Conflicts reporting notes "No limiting conflicts were identified". External review involved "3 external peer reviewers", the guideline was "reviewed and approved by the IDSA Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee and the Board of Directors of the IDSA and HIVMA prior to dissemination", and "At annual intervals, the panel chairs will be asked" for input on whether an update is needed.

Recommendation strength labeling — GRADE approach: "All recommendations were labeled as either "strong" or "conditional" according to the GRADE approach". "The words "we recommend" indicate strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicate conditional recommendations". The guideline states that "High certainty of evidence was lacking for many recommendations" and that "strong recommendations in the setting of lower certainty of evidence were only assigned when the panelists believed they conformed to one of the five accepted paradigmatic conditions".

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^114U8Zuk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

IDSA native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) guideline methodology — panel composition, literature review, evidence grading, consensus development, and conflicts of interest — are described as follows: A panel of 11 experts, including specialists in infectious diseases, spine orthopedic surgery, and neuroradiology, was convened, and among the 11 panel members, 9 are from the United States, 1 is from Europe, and 1 is from the Middle East. The panel identified 13 clinical questions and assigned 3 different groups, divided into the Diagnosis, Management, and Follow-up sections, to draft responses. The search looked at publications from 1970 to December 2014. The guideline followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system recommended by IDSA, in which the assigned strength of a recommendation is either "strong" or "weak", and high-quality evidence does not necessarily lead to strong recommendations; conversely, strong recommendations can arise from low-quality evidence if one can be confident that the desired benefits clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences. For consensus development, panel members met in person twice during the 2010 and 2012 IDSA annual meetings and participated in 9 teleconferences. All members complied with the IDSA policy regarding conflicts of interest, and no limiting conflicts were identified.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^115ammvr]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA 2023 pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) without adjacent osteomyelitis — duration of therapy recommendations: In children with presumed primary ABA without adjacent osteomyelitis with rapid clinical improvement and consistent, progressive decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) by the end of the first week of treatment, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days rather than for longer courses (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). For children with slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred. These treatment recommendations apply to children with ABA who do not have adjacent osteomyelitis; when osteomyelitis is present, treatment recommendations for it, which frequently include longer treatment duration, supersede these recommendations.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease guideline — clinical questions and evidence review methods included assigning each clinical question to a pair of panelists and conducting database searches of Ovid Medline, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, Scopus, and EMBASE, with initial searches performed in March 2016 and updates in August 2017 and in April 2019; all new relevant studies were incorporated. Panelists could supplement electronic searches by manually searching journals, conference proceedings' reference lists, and regulatory agency websites. Trial data or other evidence from non–peer-reviewed sources such as abstracts, conference proceedings, letters to the editor, editorials, review articles, and unpublished data were excluded a priori. Evidence summaries were prepared by the technical team from Tufts Medical Center, and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for nonrandomized studies, and the QUADAS-2 tool for diagnostic test accuracy studies; the technical team with panelists and methodologists decided if qualitative and/or quantitative analyses were appropriate.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^114suyQN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — studies assessing natural infection found no direct evidence to correlate serologic testing with improved outcomes, but cohorts showed lower reinfection among those seropositive. The guideline identified 6 studies, 5 cohort and 1 case control, that evaluated relationships between antibody level and decreased SARS-CoV-2 reinfection; 5 studies assessed binding antibodies and 1 assessed neutralizing antibodies. Across the cohort studies, subjects with a seropositive result after infection appeared to have a lower likelihood of developing reinfection, and in the case control study, doubling of the antibody level was associated with reduced odds of reinfection, though study definitions, timing, tests used, and comparison groups varied.

My coauthors and I developed the Infectious Diseases Society of America 's Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis in Children and Adults to help physicians make sense of how to best diagnose and treat rhinosinusitis. Our goals for the guideline are to inform physicians regarding the appropriate diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis and to reduce inappropriate and unnecessary use of antibiotics. Inappropriate use can cause harm by fostering antibiotic resistance, unnecessarily exposing patients to drug side effects and adding cost.

### Infectious diarrhea: IDSA updates guidelines for diagnosis and… [^1148QjvQ]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

- Clinicians should evaluate patients with diarrhea for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections. From the AFP Editors. The Infectious Diseases Society of America has updated its 2001 guidelines for the management of children and adults with suspected or confirmed infectious diarrhea. The main points are highlighted here. Other topics can be found in the original guideline. Recommendations CLINICAL, DEMOGRAPHIC, AND EPIDEMIOLOGIC FEATURES A detailed history should be obtained from any patient with diarrhea. Diarrhea caused by foodborne and waterborne illness is especially important to identify to help prevent outbreaks. Local reporting recommendations should be followed if a patient with diarrhea works in a child care center, long-term care facility, health care center, food service, or recreational water venues. All patients with diarrhea should be assessed for dehydration.

Dehydration increases the risk of serious illness, especially in very young and very old patients. Early detection of Shiga toxin–producing. Testing may be considered for C. difficile infection in patients older than two years who have a history of diarrhea following antimicrobial use and in those with health-care–associated diarrhea. One stool specimen is suggested for testing because multiple specimens do not increase diagnostic yield. C. difficile should also be considered in patients with diarrhea occurring in hospitals. Colonization is common in hospitalized patients and residents of long-term care facilities, although patients without diarrhea should not be tested or treated. Antimicrobial therapy should be avoided in patients infected with STEC O157, Shiga toxin 2, or STEC of unknown genotype. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for patients with other STEC infections.

Shigella infection, or the patient has recently traveled internationally and has a body temperature of at least 101. 3°F or has signs of sepsis. Asymptomatic contacts of patients with bloody diarrhea should not be treated. However, they should be advised on proper infection prevention and control measures.
