## Question

what is maalox?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Maalox is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core identity and classification of Maalox. Then, I should verify the active ingredients and their strengths. Next, I will review the labeled indications and any off-label or common uses. After that, I need to check key drug interactions, especially with gabapentin, and confirm dosing separation. Finally, I should distinguish Maalox from similarly named products and summarize safety considerations and practical counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the identity and classification. Maalox is an over-the-counter oral antacid product indicated for acid-related gastrointestinal symptoms; it is not a prescription medication and is regulated under OTC monograph provisions, which means it is marketed without FDA pre-approval but must comply with applicable regulations, so I should be careful not to overstate regulatory status [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf].

> I need to verify the active ingredients and strengths. The traditional Maalox liquid formulation contains aluminum hydroxide 200 mg per 5 mL, magnesium hydroxide 200 mg per 5 mL, and simethicone 20 mg per 5 mL; simethicone provides antigas effects, while the hydroxides provide acid neutralization, so this is a combination antacid plus antigas product rather than a single-ingredient antacid [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uses beyond the label. The FDA labeling indicates relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach, upset stomach, and pressure and bloating commonly referred to as gas; clinically, it is also used as a component of "magic mouthwash" for oral mucositis or stomatitis pain, though that is off-label and evidence quality varies, so I should frame that as common practice rather than FDA-approved indication [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf] [^d753b69e] [^eddf9e99].

> Next, I should review clinically important drug interactions. I need to ensure I emphasize the gabapentin interaction: coadministration with Maalox reduces gabapentin bioavailability by about 20%, and this reduction is attenuated to about 10% if gabapentin is given 2 hours after Maalox; therefore, patients should separate gabapentin dosing by at least 2 hours from Maalox to minimize the interaction, and I should double-check that this is consistently reported across FDA sources, which it is [^4d5d2380] [^96908269] [^0414b8c2] [^906dab6e] [^57846b81] [^31d21106].

> Wait, let me verify whether Maalox meaningfully alters the pharmacokinetics of other common drugs. Studies show no significant PK interaction with amlodipine or olmesartan when coadministered with Maalox, which supports that not all agents are affected similarly; still, as a general principle, antacids can alter absorption of some drugs, so spacing remains prudent when uncertainty exists or when interacting drugs are involved [^1370ed29] [^bd3212f7] [^6c9b3517].

> I should confirm product differentiation because name confusion can cause errors. Maalox Total Relief contains bismuth subsalicylate and is used for diarrhea and upset stomach; it is not an antacid and should not be interchanged with traditional Maalox antacid liquids, especially in patients with bleeding risk or ulcer disease, so I need to explicitly counsel on reading active ingredients and avoiding mix-ups [^2169fccf].

> Let me consider safety and special populations. Chronic or excessive use of aluminum-containing antacids can pose risks in patients with renal impairment due to potential aluminum accumulation; in pregnancy, magnesium–aluminum antacids are commonly used for heartburn, and a randomized trial in pregnant women showed similar efficacy between an alginate-antacid and a magnesium–aluminum antacid gel, though product-specific Maalox data in pregnancy are limited, so individualized risk–benefit discussion is warranted [^3b061c81] [^396c9724].

> I will now examine practical counseling points. For symptom relief, typical dosing follows product labeling, and shaking the bottle and using the provided dosing device improves accuracy; for patients on gabapentin, separate doses by at least 2 hours; for oral mucositis, Maalox is often mixed with viscous lidocaine and/or diphenhydramine as part of a "magic mouthwash", recognizing variable evidence and the need to monitor for aspiration or anesthetic toxicity, especially in children [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf] [^d753b69e] [^eddf9e99].

> In summary, Maalox is a traditional OTC combination antacid containing aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone, used for acid indigestion, heartburn, sour/upset stomach, and gas; it has a clinically meaningful interaction with gabapentin requiring a 2-hour separation, minimal impact on amlodipine or olmesartan PK, and should not be confused with Maalox Total Relief, which contains bismuth subsalicylate and has different indications and risks [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf] [^4d5d2380] [^96908269] [^1370ed29] [^bd3212f7] [^2169fccf].

Maalox is an **over-the-counter antacid** containing aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf]. It is used to relieve **heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach, and gas** by neutralizing stomach acid and reducing bloating [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf]. Maalox is generally safe for short-term use, but chronic use can cause constipation or diarrhea and may lead to aluminum toxicity in patients with renal impairment [^3b061c81]. It can reduce the absorption of some medications, such as gabapentin, so doses should be separated by at least 2 hours [^4d5d2380] [^96908269]. Maalox Total Relief, which contains bismuth subsalicylate, is not interchangeable with traditional Maalox and should not be used by patients with bleeding disorders or aspirin sensitivity [^2169fccf].

---

## Composition and formulation

Maalox is a **combination antacid** with the following active ingredients per 5 mL:

| **Active ingredient** | **Amount per 5 ml** | **Function** |
|-|-|-|
| Aluminum hydroxide | 200 mg | Antacid |
| Magnesium hydroxide | 200 mg | Antacid |
| Simethicone | 20 mg | Antifoaming agent |

---

Inactive ingredients include **butylparaben, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, flavoring agents, hypromelloses, microcrystalline cellulose, propylparaben, purified water, saccharin sodium, simethicone emulsion, sorbitol, and silicon dioxide** [^54d7e1ff] [^577e2cbf].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of action

Maalox exerts its therapeutic effects through the following **mechanisms**:

- **Aluminum hydroxide**: Neutralizes gastric acid, forming aluminum chloride and water, thereby increasing gastric pH and reducing acidity [^notfound].
- **Magnesium hydroxide**: Neutralizes gastric acid, forming magnesium chloride and water, further increasing gastric pH and alleviating acid-related symptoms [^notfound].
- **Simethicone**: Reduces surface tension of gas bubbles, facilitating their coalescence and expulsion, thereby relieving bloating and discomfort [^notfound].

---

## Clinical indications

Maalox is indicated for the **relief of symptoms** associated with excess gastric acid, including:

- Heartburn
- Acid indigestion
- Sour stomach
- Upset stomach
- Gas and bloating

---

## Dosage and administration

The **recommended dosage** for adults and children over 12 years of age is 10–20 mL (2–4 teaspoons) between meals and at bedtime, not to exceed 60 mL in 24 hours. Shake well before use and measure with the provided dosing device.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Maalox is generally well tolerated when used as directed. Common **adverse effects** include:

- Constipation (due to aluminum hydroxide)
- Diarrhea (due to magnesium hydroxide)
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal cramps

Chronic or excessive use may lead to **aluminum toxicity**, particularly in patients with renal impairment, causing neurological symptoms and bone disorders [^3b061c81]. Hypermagnesemia may occur with prolonged use, especially in patients with renal insufficiency.

---

## Drug interactions

Maalox can interact with several medications, potentially altering their absorption or efficacy. Notable interactions include:

- **Gabapentin**: Maalox reduces gabapentin bioavailability by approximately 20%. It is recommended to administer gabapentin at least 2 hours after Maalox [^4d5d2380] [^96908269].
- **Tetracycline antibiotics**: Antacids can chelate tetracyclines, reducing their absorption and efficacy.
- **Fluoroquinolone antibiotics**: Antacids can reduce absorption of fluoroquinolones, necessitating dose separation.
- **Iron supplements**: Antacids can reduce iron absorption, leading to reduced efficacy.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Maalox is contraindicated in patients with **hypersensitivity** to any of its components. Caution is advised in patients with:

- Renal impairment (due to risk of aluminum or magnesium accumulation)
- Chronic constipation or diarrhea
- Electrolyte disturbances

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Maalox is generally considered safe for short-term use during pregnancy, but prolonged or excessive use should be avoided.
- **Lactation**: Maalox is considered compatible with breastfeeding, but caution is advised with chronic use.
- **Pediatric use**: Maalox is not recommended for children under 12 years of age without medical supervision.

---

## Product variations and confusion

Maalox Total Relief, which contains bismuth subsalicylate, is **not interchangeable** with traditional Maalox products. It is used for diarrhea, upset stomach, and nausea, but should not be used by individuals with bleeding disorders or aspirin sensitivity due to the salicylate component [^2169fccf].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Maalox is supported by clinical evidence and guidelines for symptomatic relief of acid-related gastrointestinal symptoms. It is commonly recommended as a first-line antacid therapy due to its efficacy, safety, and affordability.

---

Maalox is a **combination antacid** that effectively relieves heartburn, acid indigestion, and gas. It is generally safe for short-term use, but chronic use can cause adverse effects, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Care should be taken to avoid drug interactions by separating doses from interacting medications.

Mavacamten, the first drug in the class of β-cardiac myosin modulator, is used for the treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This orally administered drug demonstrates wide interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics parameters, due in part to variant CYP2C19 alleles. Individuals who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers have increased exposure and are at increased risk of reduced cardiac hypercontractility. To ensure the safety of all patients, European Medicines Agency recommends CYP2C19 preemptive genotyping, and consecutively, to adapt maintenance and initial mavacamten doses, and to manage drug-drug interactions, according to CYP2C19 phenotype. In this article, we summarize evidence from the literature supporting the association between CYP2C19 phenotype and pharmacological features of mavacamten and provide, beyond biologic guidelines, therapeutic recommendations for the use of mavacamten based on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/CYP3A5 genotype.

### Gabapentin [^4d5d2380]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Concentrations increased by morphine; may need dose adjustment (5.4, 7.1)

7.1 Opioids

Respiratory depression and sedation, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported following coadministration of gabapentin with opioids (e.g., morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, buprenorphine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

 Hydrocodone

Coadministration of gabapentin with hydrocodone decreases hydrocodone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The potential for alteration in hydrocodone exposure and effect should be considered when gabapentin is started or discontinued in a patient taking hydrocodone.

 Morphine

When gabapentin is administered with morphine, patients should be observed for signs of CNS depression, such as somnolence, sedation and respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Other Antiepileptic Drugs

Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly coadministered antiepileptic drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Maalox®(aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide)

The mean bioavailability of gabapentin was reduced by about 20% with concomitant use of an antacid (Maalox) containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides. It is recommended that gabapentin be taken at least 2 hours following Maalox administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SGdipstick test for urinary protein when gabapentin was added to other antiepileptic drugs, the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein.

Mavacamten pharmacokinetics

Mavacamten is highly metabolized in the liver, predominantly via the cytochromes (CYP) 2C19 (74%), 3A4 (18%), and 2C9 (8%), with only 3% of the drug eliminated unchanged. The metabolites exhibit very low plasma levels (3–4% of that of mavacamten). This metabolization leads to high inter‐individual drug exposure variability. The CYP2C19 gene has 35 haplotypes described in PharmVar, resulting in different levels of phenotype. In Caucasian 2% are poor metabolizer, 26% intermediate, 40% normal or extensive, 27% rapid, and 5% ultrarapid. Elimination half‐life of mavacamten strongly depends on CYP2C19 phenotype: 23 days for poor metabolizer comparedto 10 days for CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers, 9 days for normal metabolizers, 8 days for CYP2C19 rapid metabolizers and 6 days for CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. Clearance is affected by CYP2C19 phenotype: AUC/dose was 4.6‐fold higher in poor metabolizers and 1.6‐fold lower in ultra‐rapid metabolizers compared with normal metabolizers.

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^7b292129]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

There are some data from adult ulcerative mouth conditions and patients with cancer related mucositis. In a double blind RCT Saxen et al randomised 60 adults with aphthous ulcers to one of 3 treatment groups - 3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronan, 2.5% hyaluronan or 3% viscous lidocaine. For spontaneous and stimulated pain a significant reduction in pain was shown in all 3 groups (p < 0.01) with no demonstrable difference between the 3 topical agents. Akhionbare and Ojehanon randomised 30 patients with aphthous ulcers to either 2% plain lidocaine or 2% lidocaine with adrenaline. 87% of patients experienced a complete relief of pain after application of either solution. Although different etiologically, oral mucositis often results in unrelenting pain causing an inability to eat and drink with subsequent risk of malnutrition and dehydration. In this respect it is similar to severe infectious mouth conditions. Yet, a review of the literature on the management of mucositis demonstrates a lack of consensus of scientific opinion on optimal treatment for relieving painful mucositis and the use of a large variety of different topical agents including diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide (Maalox), nystatin and corticosteroids has been described. RCT data are limited and a Cochrane review found that there was "no proven and satisfactory treatment available" for oral mucositis in the adult population. Similarly, a paediatric review revealed a paucity of controlled trials in children, highlighting that current practice is governed more by clinical experience rather than scientific evidence.

### Magnesium-aluminum hydroxide suspension for the treatment of dermal capsaicin exposures [^4500e346]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether magnesium-aluminum-hydroxide-simethicone suspension (MgAl) is an effective treatment for dermal capsaicin exposures.

Methods

The authors performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled, pilot study comparing the effect of MgAl with that of saline in the treatment of dermal capsaicin exposures. Ten volunteers were sprayed with a commercial defensive spray containing 10% capsaicin on the flexor surface of both forearms. A dressing embedded with MgAl (Maalox) suspension was randomly applied to one arm and a saline-embedded dressing was applied to the other arm. Pain was assessed on a 10-cm visual analog scale at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.

Results

Mean pain scores were significantly lower in the MgAl group as compared with the saline (S) group at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Differences in pain scores were not statistically significant at times 60, 90, and 120 minutes.

Conclusions

During the initial 30 minutes of treatment, there was a statistically significant decrease in pain scores with MgAl as compared with saline treatments. Although the difference in means may have questionable clinical significance, MgAl is cheap and readily available, and has minimal side effects. Thus, MgAl may be an appropriate treatment for dermal capsaicin exposure.

### Gabapentin (Gabarone) [^906dab6e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral Contraceptive

Based on AUC and half-life, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of tablets containing 2.5 mg of norethindrone acetate and 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were similar with and without coadministration of gabapentin (400 mg three times a day; N = 13). The Cmaxof norethindrone was 13% higher when it was coadministered with gabapentin; this interaction is not expected to be of clinical importance.

Antacid (Maalox) (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide)

Antacid (Maalox) containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides reduced the mean bioavailability of gabapentin (N = 16) by about 20%. This decrease in bioavailability was about 10% when gabapentin was administered 2 hours after Maalox.

Probenecid

Probenecid is a blocker of renal tubular secretion. Gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters without and with probenecid were comparable. This indicates that gabapentin does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by probenecid.

### Management of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis in young children [^eddf9e99]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the treatment of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis at a children's hospital.

Methods

A review of charts from 1999 to 2003.

Results

Forty-eight cases were identified. They ranged in age from 8 months to 12 years, with a median age of 2 years 7 months. All children were treated with fluids and analgesics; 11 children were treated with fluids and analgesics exclusively. Thirty-five children were treated with a mixture of Maalox and diphenhydramine, 8 with acyclovir, and 7 with viscous lidocaine; 11 children were treated with 2 or more of these regimens. Both the Maalox and diphenhydramine mixture and the viscous lidocaine were administered as swish and swallow, swish and spit, or by application with a swab as frequently as every hour or as infrequently as every 8 hours.

Conclusions

Topical therapy with Maalox and diphenhydramine or viscous lidocaine was administered to 73% and 15% of the patients, respectively, whereas acyclovir was administered to only 17%. Dosing and administration of topical agents in the treatment of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis in preschoolers were problematic. Acyclovir was not being used as often as it could have been.

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^0f4be2a1]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The mainstay of care for children with gingivostomatitis is supportive and expectant. The primary goal of therapy in acute care is directed towards pain relief from ulcerative lesions and inflamed mucosa, thus facilitating oral fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Often, routine oral analgesia is the first mode of therapy attempted by parents at home. However, it may have little effect in the relief of pain and is often refused by the patient. If oral intake cannot be improved, there is a subsequent risk of admission to hospital for intravenous (IV) or nasogastric (NG) fluids. Amir et al found that 3 out of 36 (8%) children presenting with herpes gingivostomatitis experienced dehydration and required hospitalisation for IV rehydration.

Treatment trials for painful infectious mouth conditions have focussed on the efficacy of acyclovir and similar antiviral agents for treating PHGS with controversy about the strength and weakness of the evidence of its efficacy. Regardless, acyclovir use is of limited relevance where acute fluid intake of a child in the ED is concerned and the exact diagnosis is often not known. Many agents have been described for painful ulcerative mouth conditions in adults and children including gingivostomatitis, oral candidiasis and aphthous ulcers. Agents used for one or a number of conditions include viscous lidocaine, benzocaine preparations, diphenhydramine elixir, coating agents including Maalox, milk of magnesia and Kaopectate, antibiotics particularly chlorhexidine and tetracycline and topical steroids. In a retrospective chart review of 48 non immune suppressed paediatric patients presenting with PHGS at the Children's Hospital in Buffalo, United States, all were treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, 35 were treated with a mixture of Maalox and diphenhydramine, 8 with acyclovir, 7 with viscous lidocaine and 11 received two or more of these therapies. A major textbook of Paediatric Emergency Medicine mentions rinsing with viscous lidocaine, as well as "magic mouthwash" (a mixture of Kaopectate and Benadryl) as treatment options. 2% viscous lidocaine has been recommended in the study hospital ED Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the treatment of herpes gingivostomatitis for many years. To date, however, there have been no RCTs investigating any topical anaesthetic for painful ulcerative conditions of the mouth in previously health children.

No studies were found evaluating the impact of reduced gastric acid on capecitabine absorption. However, co-administration of aluminum hydroxide (Maalox) with capecitabine resulted in a moderate increase in the Cmax and AUC of capecitabine and DFCR, where 10–31% increase was observed. Despite the elevation of capecitabine and DFCR, the changes mediated by aluminum hydroxide did not reach statistical significance. As aluminum hydroxide was only administered once in this study, it is difficult to determine what effects persistent neutralisation of gastric acid may have on capecitabine and DFCR disposition. It is conceivable that reduced gastric acid production in the elderly may provide a similar scenario, where the reduction in acid would reduce the breakdown of capecitabine. Enhanced capecitabine absorption may be further facilitated by slower intestinal transit time; however, studies are necessary to verify this hypothesis.

A two-fold increase in capecitabine AUC was detected in patients ⩾70 years, which corresponded to a reduction of total capecitabine clearance. Despite an increase in capecitabine AUC, DFCR formation (Cmax) and total levels detected was similar between the two age groups, which may suggest that carboxylesterase-mediated metabolism may be able to accommodate for the addition capecitabine. In one study, 1645 mg m⁻² capecitabine was given twice a day, where the DFCR AUC was similar to that seen in this study and the dosage was 1000 mg m⁻². This suggests that there is sufficient carboxylesterase activity to accommodate additional capecitabine. In addition, aging has little impact on expression and activity of carboxylesterase I and II. This was demonstrated in a study where carboxylesterase enzymatic activity derived from subjects who were 75–85 years was not significantly different from microsomes derived from children.

### Esomeprazole for the treatment of erosive esophagitis in children: an international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind (for dose) study [^95fcc550]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and patients

The study design, methodology, eligibility criteria, patient characteristics, and safety assessments have been described in detail previously. Children aged 1–11 years with endoscopically confirmed GERD (determined by endoscopy with or without biopsies) were screened and eligible to be enrolled in an international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind (for dose) study evaluating once-daily esomeprazole during 8 weeks of treatment. Patients with allergic or eosinophilic esophagitis, gastric ulcers, bleeding lesions, strictures, and Barrett's esophagus were excluded from the study. Erosive or histologic GERD was documented; however, EE was not required. Endoscopic findings were classified using the LA Classification System for EE (Table 1). As described in the literature, macroscopic evidence for GERD seen on endoscopy was documented and included hyperemia, ulcers, and nodularity. Patients with no visible or definitive lesions underwent a mucosal biopsy during baseline endoscopy for histologic confirmation of reflux esophagitis. Valid pediatric indicators of histologic reflux esophagitis were recorded, including the presence of intraepithelial eosinophils or neutrophils and increased basal cell layer thickness and papillary height. Criteria for establishing and documenting a clinical diagnosis of GERD were consistent with the NASPGHAN guidelines.

Table 1
Los Angeles Classification System for erosive esophagitis

LA: Los Angeles.

Patients were assigned randomly to esomeprazole (Nexium ®; AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE) 5 or 10 mg (children ≥ 8 kg and < 20 kg) or 10 or 20 mg (children ≥ 20 kg) once daily for 8 weeks. For children aged < 6 years or for those who had difficulty swallowing the capsules, capsule contents could be mixed with 1 tablespoon of applesauce. Age-appropriate liquid antacid medication, MAALOX ® (aluminum hydroxide 225 mg/magnesium hydroxide 200 mg per 5 mL; Novartis Consumer, Parsippany, NJ) or equivalent, was allowed as rescue medication. Parents or guardians were instructed to administer rescue medication according to product labeling or as prescribed by the physician. Rescue medication use was recorded; when applicable, use in excess of the prescribed amount was reviewed with the parent or guardian at each visit and documented.

### Prospective randomized study of viscous lidocaine versus benzocaine in a GI cocktail for dyspepsia [^d753b69e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that Benzocaine (Hurricaine) would work as quickly and effectively as viscous Lidocaine in this preparation. This was a prospective randomized, single-blinded comparison between Benzocaine and Lidocaine as the topical anesthetic in a gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail. Patients 18 years or older were approached for participation when a GI cocktail was ordered by the Emergency Physician. Patients were randomized to equivalent doses of either Benzocaine or viscous Lidocaine in addition to 30 cc of Maalox and 10 cc of Donnatal. Assessment using a visual analog pain scale occurred at time intervals of 0, 5, 15, and 30 min. Eighty-two patients were enrolled (44 to Benzocaine, 38 to viscous Lidocaine), with each group having a statistically significant improvement in pain (p < 0.001). There were no statistical differences between the Benzocaine and viscous Lidocaine groups in terms of the relief of symptoms at each of the assessment times. There were no adverse outcomes in either group.

### Gabapentin (Neurontin) [^0414b8c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

 Morphine

A literature article reported that when a 60 mg controlled-release morphine capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600 mg NEURONTIN capsule (N = 12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine. Morphine pharmacokinetic parameter values were not affected by administration of NEURONTIN 2 hours after morphine. The magnitude of interaction at other doses is not known.

 Cimetidine

In the presence of cimetidine at 300 mg four times a day (N = 12), the mean apparent oral clearance of gabapentin fell by 14% and creatinine clearance fell by 10%. Thus, cimetidine appeared to alter the renal excretion of both gabapentin and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function. This decrease in excretion of gabapentin by cimetidine is not expected to be of clinical importance. The effect of gabapentin on cimetidine was not evaluated.

 Oral Contraceptive

Based on AUC and half-life, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of tablets containing 2.5 mg of norethindrone acetate and 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were similar with and without coadministration of gabapentin (400 mg three times a day; N = 13). The Cmaxof norethindrone was 13% higher when it was coadministered with gabapentin; this interaction is not expected to be of clinical importance.

 Antacid (Maalox) (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide)

Antacid (Maalox®) containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides reduced the mean bioavailability of gabapentin (N = 16) by about 20%. This decrease in bioavailability was about 10% when gabapentin was administered 2 hours after Maalox.

 Probenecid

Probenecid is a blocker of renal tubular secretion. Gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters without and with probenecid were comparable. This indicates that gabapentin does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by probenecid.

### Expert consensus on the management of adverse events and prescribing practices associated with the treatment of patients taking pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a Delphi consensus study [^5be852f1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Dyspepsia

Patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to take their dose with a meal and advised to spread their pills out over the course of the meal. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and antacids like Maalox®, and TUMS® may be prescribed. Dose reductions are recommended for patients with dyspepsia. After exhausting all remedies, pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe dyspepsia occurs and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Education on diet and positional approaches, as well as ensuring that patients take their dose with meals is recommended for patients with GERD. PPIs and H2 (histamine 2) blockers should be prescribed for GERD with dose reductions and drug holidays as additional suggestions. After all remedies are exhausted, pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe GERD occurs and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Nausea

Patients who experience nausea should be advised to take their dose with food and advised to take their pills separately throughout the duration of their meal. Prescribe/add 5-Hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5HT3) receptor antagonists such as ondansetron for patients with nausea, with dose reductions and drug holidays as further suggestions. After all remedies are exhausted, pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe nausea occurs and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Vomiting

PPIs and 5HT3 receptor antagonists are recommended for patients who experience vomiting. Dose reductions and drug holidays are suggested and pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe vomiting occurs. In such situations, treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Weight loss

Encouraging eating, discussing eating habits, and increasing the frequency and size of meals are recommended for patients with decreased weight. Fatty meals are recommended as well as dietary supplements. Dose reductions are recommended for patients with decreased weight. Pirfenidone could be discontinued if after exhausting all remedies severe weight loss occurs, and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

### Sodium thiosulfate solution spray for relief of irritation caused by lugol's stain in chromoendoscopy [^c7a6d052]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Mucosal iodine staining is known to improve the endoscopic visualization of esophageal squamous dysplasia and cancer. However, it often causes mucosal irritation leading to retrosternal discomfort. The clinical usefulness of sodium thiosulfate solution (STS) for easing symptoms induced by mucosal staining with Lugol's solution was evaluated in this study.

Methods

One hundred twenty healthy men over 50 years of age were enrolled in the study. They each underwent esophagogastroscopy including the spraying of Lugol's iodine solution (10 mL) on the mid and distal esophagus and were subsequently randomized into three groups: (I) no treatment (n = 40), (II) spraying of 20 mL of aluminum-magnesium hydroxide gel (Maalox) by means of endoscopic catheter (n = 40), and (III) spraying of 20 mL of 5% sodium thiosulfate solution by means of endoscopic catheter (n = 40). An hour after the endoscopic examination the subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire that addressed adverse symptoms induced by Lugol's iodine staining.

Results

Sodium thiosulfate solution spray substantially reduced adverse symptoms that lasted more than 30 minutes after chromoendoscopy, compared with the no-treatment group. There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects with symptoms between the Maalox and no-treatment groups. Cost of sodium thiosulfate solution spray per use was $0.15 (15 yen).

Conclusions

Sodium thiosulfate solution is recommended for routine use after Lugol's staining.

### Towards an understanding of the adjuvant action of aluminium [^07c935ec]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2009). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of vaccines depends on the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the antigen. Of these adjuvants, the ones that contain aluminium, which were first discovered empirically in 1926, are currently the most widely used. However, a detailed understanding of their mechanism of action has only started to be revealed. In this Timeline article, we briefly describe the initial discovery of aluminium adjuvants and discuss historically important advances. We also summarize recent progress in the field and discuss their implications and the remaining questions on how these adjuvants work.

 Sildenafil: A single 100 mg dose of sildenafil in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine. When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect.

 Atorvastatin: Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine with 80 mg of atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin.

Digoxin: Co-administration of amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers.

No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which olmesartan medoxomil was coadministered with digoxin in healthy volunteers.

 Ethanol (alcohol): Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol.

 Warfarin: Co-administration of amlodipine with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time. No significant drug interactions were reported in studies in which olmesartan medoxomil was coadministered with warfarin in healthy volunteers.

 Antacids: The bioavailability of olmesartan medoxomil was not significantly altered by the co-administration of antacids [Al(OH)3/Mg(OH)2].

### Review of recent evidence on the management of heartburn in pregnant and breastfeeding women [^396c9724]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alginates

Alginates are natural polysaccharide polymers which polymerise into a gel upon contact with gastric acid. Alginate formulations for GERD treatment are frequently combined with antacids such as sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate component in the alginate formulation releases carbon dioxide within the alginate gel; this causes the gel to float to the top of the stomach contents to form a raft structure. The alginate-antacid raft forms a non-systemic barrier over the postprandial acid pocket to reduce postprandial acid reflux (Fig. 1). In an alginate/antacid combination, the rapid antacid action works concurrently with the long-lasting alginate reflux suppression.

Fig. 1
Diagram of alginate raft structure formation following ingestion of an alginate-containing formulation. Alginates react with the stomach acid to form a gel-like substance with neutral pH (A). Sodium bicarbonate contained in the formulation releases carbon dioxide gas, which becomes trapped in the gel. The trapped carbon dioxide gas allows the gel to float to the surface of the stomach content (B), effectively forming a raft structure (C) which acts as a barrier over the gastric acid pocket, and blocks against upward reflux.

Adapted from Bor et al.

A double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of an alginate-based reflux suppressant, Liquid Gaviscon® (Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Ltd, Hull, UK; Liquid Gaviscon® contains 500 mg sodium alginate, 267 mg sodium bicarbonate and 160 mg calcium carbonate per 10 mL) vs. a magnesium–aluminium antacid gel (Maalox® Olic (Thailand) Co. Ltd. Thailand; 5 mL contains 120 mg magnesium hydroxide and 220 mg aluminium hydroxide) in 100 pregnant women at < 36 weeks' gestation who had ≥ 2 episodes of heartburn a week. The treatment dose was 15 mL orally three times after meal and before bedtime, continued for 2 weeks. Both treatments similarly improved heartburn frequency (80% vs. 88%, p = 0.275) and heartburn intensity (92% vs. 92%, p = 1.000). Alginate-based reflux suppressant was shown no different from magnesium–aluminium antacid gel in the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy.

### Role of vitamin dcombined to alginates in preventing acid and oxidative injury in cultured gastric epithelial cells [^ccc67131]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Agents preparations

Grisù® is a dietary supplement that combines the properties of calcium alginate in a buffer solution, resulting from alkaline salts useful to counteract situations of high acidity, with a tyndalized probiotic (Pylopass®) and an extract of prickly pear and olive leaves (Mucosave®): the extract of prickly pear is useful for its emollient and soothing characteristics at the level of the digestive system.

Grisù®, composed by Mucosave® (0.83 mg/ml), calcium alginate (1.66 mg/ml), magnesium hydroxide (2.66 mg/ml), potassium citrate (4.66 mg/ml) and Pylopass™ (0.66 mg/ml), was dissolved according to solubility reported in manufacturer's instructions, directly in the DMEM without red phenol and FBS but supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate when used for the adhesion study. Instead for the second set of experiments Grisù®, Maalox®, Gaviscon® and PPI were dissolved directly in the medium used for stimulations respecting the solubility reported in manufacturer's instructions. In both sets of experiments, the solutions were used without dilutions. The active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3, catalog number: D1530, Sigma-Aldirch, Milan, Italy) was prepared in absolute ethanol at 10⁻³ M and used at final concentration of 100 nM prepared directly in medium. The percentage of ethanol was less than 0.001%. HCl was used to prepare an acidified medium (pH 4) and added to the cells without dilution.

MTT test

At the end of each stimulation, MTT-based In Vitro Toxicology Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to determine cell viability, as previously described. Cells were incubated with 1% MTT dye for 2 h at 37 °C in incubator, and then, the purple formazan crystals were dissolved in equal volume of MTT Solubilization Solution. Cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance through a spectrometer (VICTORX3 Multilabel Plate Reader) at 570 nm with correction at 690 nm, and calculated by comparing results to control cells (100% viable).

### Heavy hematuria requiring cystectomy in a patient with hemophilia A: a case report and literature review [^795903ed]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in factor VIII. Hemophilia A affects 1 in 5,000–10,000 males. Hematuria is frequent in hemophilia. Hematuria in hemophilia is generally considered benign and manageable with conservative therapy; however, severe hematuria requiring surgical therapy has rarely been reported.

Case presentation

A 60-year-old male with hemophilia A presented with persistent gross hematuria of unknown cause. He was treated with recombinant factor VIII products, followed by several conservative therapies as follows: clot evacuation by vesicoclysis, continuous bladder irrigation with normal saline, and intravesical instillation of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (Maalox); however, these failed to resolve the hemorrhaging. The patient was offered and consented to cystectomy with an ileal conduit. Intraoperative clotting was normal with the infusion of adequate recombinant factor VIII products and transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma, and the procedure was performed safely. After surgery, the patient had blood in his stool several times. No bleeding site was demonstrated in the colon by colonoscopy and 99m Technetium-human serum albumin-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid scintigraphy demonstrated that the extravasation of radioactive isotope was detected at the anal side of terminal ileum but not at the oral side. These findings were suspected to be bleeding from the ileoileal anastomosis. However, the bleeding was managed with recombinant factor VIII products.

Conclusions

Cystectomy in hemophilia may be safe, if monitored appropriately. Urinary diversion using the intestine may be avoided because anastomotic hemorrhage may become a problem.

### Role of vitamin dcombined to alginates in preventing acid and oxidative injury in cultured gastric epithelial cells [^d578ab23]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In some additional tests, vitD 3 was added to other gastroprotective agents (Maalox®, Gaviscon® and PPI) and the effects have been compared to those induced by Grisù® combined with vitD 3. As shown in Fig. 7, Grisù® with vitD 3 showed greater effectiveness to counteract the negative effects of oxidative stress and acidity condition on cell viability and ROS release compared to other gastroprotectants.

Similar data were also observed in primary gastric cell cultures, where Grisù® with vitD 3 was able to counteract more effectively than other gastroprotectants, the negative effects of oxidative and acidic stress.

Validation in primary epithelial cells

Further experiments were carried out in primary gastric epithelial cells, in order to confirm previously obtained results about the protective effects exerted by Grisù® alone or combined with vitD 3 during oxidative and acidity injury. Method used to isolate the primary cell cultures is described in Additional file 2. Other methods were the same used in GTL-16 cells experiments. Some results on primary gastric cells were reported in Additional file 2. Particularly, the improvement of adhesion properties induced by Grisù® combined with vitD 3; the beneficial effects on cell viability and ROS production in counteracting H 2 O 2 or HCl oxidative injury; the involvement of survival kinase in preventing apoptosis, are shown.

Here are reported two of most important effects of Grisù alone and combined with vitD 3 on cell viability and ROS production. As reported in Fig. 8a the time-course study confirms that Grisù® alone and Grisù® combined with vitD 3 are able to enhance cell viability in similar manner to what observed in GTL-16. The maximum effect was observed after 1 h 30 min (p < 0.05). So, time of stimulation was maintained for all subsequent experiments. Finally, in primary gastric cells have been also confirmed the efficacy of Grisù® alone and combined with vitD 3 compared to others gastroprotectants to prevent the damage induced by oxidative stress and acidity. As reported in Fig. 8b, vitD 3 can modulate the negative effects on ROS production only in presence of Grisù®. This effect was also observed in GTL-16 cells. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that Grisù® could act like a substrate capable of promoting the effects of vitD 3.

### Role of vitamin dcombined to alginates in preventing acid and oxidative injury in cultured gastric epithelial cells [^743c3c75]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Experimental protocol

The cells were used to study two different biological aspects. In the first set of experiments, the influence of a new alginate preparation (Grisù®) alone or in combination with 100 nM vitD 3 on cellular adhesion was analyzed by measuring adhesion time through crystal violet assay and vitronectin/fibronectin staining by Western Blot. In this case the agents were used to coat the plates or chamber-slides for 20 min in incubator at 37 °C before seeding the cells. The adhesion time of GTL-16 (a specific number of cells) was checked from 2 min to 720 min (2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 240 min, 720 min). In the absence of coating, the cells were adherent until 3–5 h.

In the second set of experiments the same agents were added directly in the cells plated for the experimental protocol without coating. Maalox®, Gaviscon® and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) were tested in the preliminary experiments alone or in combination with 100 nM vitD 3 to compare the efficacy to Grisù® alone or in combination with 100 nM vitD 3 on cell viability. In addition, all these agents were also tested in presence of 200 μM H 2 O 2 or HCl to determine the effects during oxidative stress or gastric acidity. The time of stimulation was from 15 min to 24 h (15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 3 h, 24 h). Since the maximum effect was observed after 1 h of treatment this condition was maintained for all successive experiments. Moreover, Maalox®, Gaviscon® and PPI had negative effects on cell viability which were more important in presence of H 2 O 2 or HCl. In the successive experiments these agents were not tested.

### Testing the effects of topical skin care products on tumor treating fields (TTFields) adhesiveness of arrays and delivery of electric currents [^c93abe31]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Feasibility testing of topical skin care products in rats

We examined thirty-four common topical skin care products for their feasibility of use together with TTFields treatment (Table S1 for list of ingredients). Since good skin adherence is required for efficient treatment delivery, we first tested the effect of the topical skin care products on array attachment strength, by measuring the change in the force needed to peel off the arrays from the shaved rat back when applying the skin care product relative to that needed when no topical product was applied (Table 1). Ten of the tested compounds substantially reduced the required force by 40% or more (Baby Pasta, Bepanthen Plus, Calendula, Cicaplast, Fucidin, Gillette, Maalox, NewGel + E, Silverol, U Lactin). These products were therefore considered to interfere with array adherence to the skin, and were not tested for electrical functionality. For the twenty-four compounds that passed the peeling test, we next tested their effect on current delivery via the arrays, by measuring the change in current when applying the skin care product relative to that when no topical product was applied (Table 1). Four products significantly reduced the current delivered via the arrays (Cicalfate, Desitin, Kelo Cote, Staquis). Interestingly, these four compounds reduced the peeling force by 20–40%. Overall, twenty of the tested compounds were identified as passing the feasibility tests.

Table 1
Force and current change for the topical skin care products tested on rats

Force change – Change in force required for array peeling with and without topical product applied to the skin

Current change – Change in current generated by application of 200 kHz TTFields with and without topical product applied to the skin

### Paraneoplastic pemphigus secondary to neuroendocrine carcinoma [^2ebcb074]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Successful treatment of the underlying malignancy is the primary factor related to the improvement of PNP. Solid tumor malignancies, such as benign thymomas or localized Castleman disease, have a high chance of remission with surgical resection, whereas cases associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are more difficult to treat and have poor outcomes. Reducing the tumor burden does not necessarily stop autoimmune disease progression, and the resolution of cutaneous disease is variable, with oral mucositis generally being more refractory to treatment. Treating the dermatologic manifestations of PNP is complex and requires coordination with oncology in order to ensure that there is no interference with the treatment of the associated malignancy. In this case, the patient was treated topically with triamcinolone 0.1% ointment for his cutaneous lesions; dexamethasone oral solution, nystatin, and magic mouthwash (lidocaine 2%, Maalox, and diphenhydramine) for intraoral erosions; and oral prednisone 80 mg daily. He had a dramatic improvement in his cutaneous and oral manifestations with this regimen. The oral prednisone was gradually tapered to 20 mg daily over 3 months with continued disease control and a plan to transition to a longer-term immunomodulating agent. He also started chemotherapy with capecitabine and temozolomide for the treatment of his underlying malignancy. Although rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins were considered, they were not started due to the patient's preference and improvement on the abovementioned regimen. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to his NEC 8 months after diagnosis. This case demonstrates a novel association of PNP with NEC and highlights potential treatment considerations.

### Role of vitamin dcombined to alginates in preventing acid and oxidative injury in cultured gastric epithelial cells [^d00b384b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, the involvement of VDR in the beneficial effects above described was also confirmed by immunocytochemical staining (Fig. 6) and by Western Blot analysis (Additional file 1).

Fig. 6
Study of VDR by immunocytochemistry staining. G = Grisù®; V = vitD 3; G + V = co-stimulation with Grisù® and vitD 3. b, c, d p < 0.05 vs control; b, c p < 0.05 vs d. The images were taken by optical microscopy at original magnification 20X. Data reported are expressed as means ± (SD) (%) of 5 biological replicates

The effects of combination of Grisù® and vitD 3 were compared to other gastroprotective agents on cell viability and ROS production, to confirm their ability to protect the epithelial gastric cells from oxidative stress or acidity injury. As reported in Fig. 7, the combination of Grisù® with vitD 3 was able to induce the maximal beneficial effects on cell viability and ROS production compared to other gastroprotective agents alone (Maalox®, Gaviscon® or PPI, p < 0.05). In addition, in presence of oxidative stress caused by H 2 O 2 or HCl acidified medium, the combination of Grisù® with vitD 3 was able to positively modulate these negative conditions and significantly reduce ROS production. This effect was significantly better if compared to Maalox®, Gaviscon® and PPI.

### Role of vitamin dcombined to alginates in preventing acid and oxidative injury in cultured gastric epithelial cells [^d2ba8177]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gastric diseases are a worldwide problem in modern society, as reported in the USA, in the range of 0.5–2 episodes/year/person and an incidence of 5–100 episodes/1000/week according to seasons and age. There is convincing evidence that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of acute gastric injury. Acid secreted from gastric parietal cells determines mucosal injuries which in turn cause inflammation and oxidative stress. Consequent inflammation produces free radicals by mitochondria thus causing lipid peroxidation, oxidative and acidic stress, which can lead to cell apoptosis. Vitamin D 3, the active form of vitamin D, may counteract intracellular cell death and improve epithelial regeneration.

Methods

This study was planned to assess whether vitamin D 3 is a protective factor against acid injury and oxidative stress in gastric epithelial cells. Primary epithelial cells and GTL-16 cells have been used to test the effects of Grisù® alone or in combination with vitamin D 3 during oxidative stress or high acid exposition measuring cell viability, ROS production, cellular adhesion time along with apoptotic, autophagic and survival pathways. The combined effect of Grisù® and vitamin D 3 was found more effective in counteracting the negative consequences of oxidative stress and acidity conditions than some other gastroprotective agents, such as Maalox® or Gaviscon®.

Results

In case of oxidative stress or acidity condition the stimulation with Grisù® alone caused an improvement of cell viability and a reduction of ROS production on epithelial gastric cells. In addition, the adhesion time of the cells was improved. All these effects were increased by the presence of vitamin D 3. Similar data were also observed in primary gastric epithelial cells confirming the results obtained in GTL-16 cells.

Conclusions

These results suggest that Grisù® in combination with vitamin D 3 may exert a gastroprotective effect to maintain or restore the integrity of gastric epithelium through an antioxidant pathway, inhibiting apoptosis and activating survival kinases. Moreover, the combination of Grisù® and vitamin D 3 improves cell viability and decreases ROS production compared to other gastroprotective agents combined with vitamin D 3. All these data were validated using primary cells isolated from gastric tissue.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^03a57210]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Another aluminum-containing adjuvant that is commonly used in preclinical experimental studies is Imject TM Alum (ThermoFisher Scientific). However, this adjuvant is composed of amorphous aluminum hydroxycarbonate and crystalline magnesium hydroxide. In a direct comparison, the immune response induced by a vaccine formulated with AH was significantly stronger than that by a vaccine containing Imject TM Alum. Because it has a different composition from AH and AP in licensed vaccines, Imject TM Alum should not be used when the goal of the experiments is to formulate vaccines for preclinical evaluation, or even to evaluate mechanisms of adsorption. Moreover, it should be avoided entirely if the objective of the studies is to determine the mechanism of action of aluminum-based adjuvants.

### What are excipients doing in medicinal products? [^6b8075eb]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Medicinal products contain not only active drugs but also other ingredients included for a variety of purposes and collectively known as excipients (from the Latin word excipere, meaning 'to take out or receive'). Prescribers may wrongly overlook or dismiss excipients on the assumption that these are inactive. In reality, such substances are not always inert and may have risks. Here we consider why excipients are present in medicines, their potential unwanted effects, how they are regulated and where to find out more about them.

### Molecularly targeted radiation therapy using mTOR inhibition for the management of malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa): a case report and review [^d93ea6f2]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Initial treatment plan (1) for palliative radiation therapy of left lung tumor burden using a 3-field technique compared with replan for final 4 fractions of treatment (2) after tumor response during treatment, shown in the axial (a) and coronal (b) views.

The patient tolerated his course of radiation therapy well with grade 1 in-field dermatitis managed with a topical moisturizing and anti-inflammatory skin care regimen and grade 2 esophagitis noted at his final treatment fraction managed with a 1:1:1 solution of Benadryl, Maalox, and xylocaine (Magic Mouthwash) and a proton pump inhibitor. At 1-month posttreatment follow-up, he was found to be doing well overall, with complete resolution of all symptoms noted during his treatment course. He was re-evaluated again at 4 months posttreatment and noted an intermittent cough without evidence of low-grade fever or dyspnea. The patient's imaging demonstrated excellent radiographic response to treatment with significant reduction in the size of the intrathoracic disease at his initial posttreatment follow-up, with further resolution of intrathoracic disease noted on imaging obtained 4 months after treatment (Fig 2). Additionally, there was no radiographic evidence of pneumonitis noted at 4 months (Fig 2). After radiation therapy, the patient continued on sirolimus; although his intrathoracic disease responded dramatically to the combination of radiation therapy with sirolimus, the patient was noted to have a mixed response elsewhere (Fig 2), with resolution of his right adrenal metastasis and left gluteal metastasis noted at 1-month postradiation but development of a new splenic lesion and new right gluteal metastasis noted at 4 months postradiation.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^9b64fc6b]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanism of action of aluminum adjuvants

Although aluminum adjuvants have been used for over 70 years in human vaccines, the mechanism by which they enhance the immune response remains not fully understood. This probably reflects the fact that several mechanisms are operating simultaneously, rather than a lack of awareness of an individual mechanism. Studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms by which aluminum adjuvants enhance the immune response have recently been reviewed in detail. Here, we will provide a brief interpretive summary with updates from recent studies. A satisfactory explanation of the mechanisms that underlie the immune-enhancing effect of aluminum adjuvants should take into account that adsorption of antigen, although not always, usually enhances the immune response. Adsorption is probably important for three reasons: (1) it makes soluble antigens particulate, which enhances uptake through phagocytosis by dendritic cells;, (2) it targets antigen to antigen-presenting cells, while enhancing antigen-presentation, as indicated by increased expression of MHC II-peptide complexes and increased activation of CD4 T cells; – and (3) it retains antigen at the injection site, allowing time for recruitment of antigen-presenting cells through the release of cytokines and the induction of a local inflammatory reaction. – It has been suggested that a short-term depot is not necessary for the effect of aluminum adjuvants. This was based on the intradermal injection of protein adsorbed to aluminum adjuvant in the ear of mice (the ear of mice does not have muscle or subcutaneous tissue) followed by surgical resection of the ear at different time points. Removal of the ear as early as 2 h after injection had no effect on the immune response. However, although the study was a sincere attempt to examine the need for a depot effect, the authors could not exclude the possibility that tissue damage from the resection of the ear resulted in sufficient inflammatory signals to enhance the immune response. An early study showed that removal of the injection site after subcutaneous injection of an aluminum-adjuvanted vaccine within 4 days after injection interfered with the immune response. Thus, it seems likely that a short-term depot is generally needed for the immunostimulatory effect of aluminum adjuvants.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^6c1bd714]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Aluminum-containing adjuvants have been used for over 90 years to enhance the immune response to vaccines. Recent work has significantly advanced our understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of these adjuvants, offering key insights on underlying mechanisms. Given the long-term success of aluminum adjuvants, we believe that they should continue to represent the "gold standard" against which all new adjuvants should be compared. New vaccine candidates that require adjuvants to induce a protective immune responses should first be evaluated with aluminum adjuvants before other more experimental approaches are considered, since use of established adjuvants would facilitate both clinical development and the regulatory pathway. However, the continued use of aluminum adjuvants requires an appreciation of their complexities, in combination with access to the necessary expertise to optimize vaccine formulations. In this article, we will review the properties of aluminum adjuvants and highlight those elements that are critical to optimize vaccine performance. We will discuss how other components (excipients, TLR ligands, etc.) can affect the interaction between adjuvants and antigens, and impact the potency of vaccines. This review provides a resource and guide, which will ultimately contribute to the successful development of newer, more effective and safer vaccines.

### What place is there for tramadol / dexketoprofen? [^3a1a88c0]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

No single analgesic provides effective pain relief in all patients and increasing the dose of an analgesic may increase its unwanted effects.1 In addition, pain frequently results from multiple mechanisms that may respond to different pharmacological interventions.2 One suggested approach is to combine analgesics with different modes of action, with the aim of delivering better analgesia using lower doses of each drug.1 Skudexa (A. Menarini Farmaceutica Internazionale SRL), a combination of tramadol hydrochloride (a synthetic opioid analgesic that is a partial agonist at the μ, δ and κ opioid receptors) and dexketoprofen (a NSAID), is licensed for short term treatment of moderate to severe acute pain in adults.1–4 Here, we consider the evidence for this product and how it fits with current guidance on the management of pain.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^a4b297f3]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

A key message we would like to deliver is that there is a lot of science around the use of aluminum-based adjuvants that is too often underappreciated, or even ignored. Too often aluminum adjuvants appear to be considered as a "fixed" material to which antigens can be simply added (mix and inject approach), while we contend that this is not the case. There are many considerations that need to be brought into play when considering how to evaluate aluminum salts as an adjuvant, which could result in a significantly improved performance. Unfortunately, too often an aluminum adjuvant is used without optimization, resulting in it being dismissed too readily in favor of newer, more exploratory, approaches, with uncertain paths to development. Hence, we will attempt to offer clarity on why formulations with aluminum adjuvants need to be optimized to get a clearer picture of potential performance, while highlighting in broad terms how this might be accomplished.

### Heavy hematuria requiring cystectomy in a patient with hemophilia A: a case report and literature review [^c0153d2a]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 60-year-old male with a mild factor VIII deficiency presented to the hematology clinic at our hospital with a 1-week history of asymptomatic gross hematuria. He had suffered a hemorrhagic gastric ulcer at the age of 48 and was diagnosed with mild hemophilia A (his factor VIII levels were 6% of normal) at that time. He had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 59. For several years beginning at the age of 50, the patient had experienced mild hematuria, and he had experienced one episode of intramuscular and subcutaneous hemorrhage; both conditions were managed with recombinant factor VIII products.

A physical examination revealed no abnormal signs. Laboratory tests revealed that the patient's activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was prolonged to 74.6 s (normal range, 28.5–40.9 s), but his prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, platelet count, serum creatinine level, and prostate-specific antigen level were unremarkable. The patient's urinalysis results were normal, except for the gross hematuria, and urine cytology revealed no cancer cells. The patient was treated with a third-generation recombinant factor VIII product (Advate). However, he had persistent hematuria, followed by clot retention. Thus, he was referred to the Department of Urology. Computed tomography demonstrated that his bladder was filled with a blood clot (Fig. 1), but his prostate and upper urinary tract were apparently normal.

Fig. 1
Computed tomography demonstrated that the bladder was filled with a blood clot (arrow)

He was admitted to our hospital and received the following therapy: clot evacuation by vesicoclysis, continuous bladder irrigation with normal saline, and intravesical instillation of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (Maalox) concurrent with the administration of Advate, which failed to resolve the hemorrhage. Consequently, the patient had repeated transfusions of packed red cells. Although the patient also underwent transurethral coagulation of the bladder mucosa under anesthesia, the bleeding presented with oozing throughout the mucosa and was not controlled. Subsequently, the patient developed pyelonephritis in his left kidney with a severe reduction (< 50 mL) in his bladder capacity. Conservative management for 2 months failed to resolve the patient's symptoms, so he was offered a cystectomy with ileal conduit and consented to it after a detailed discussion.

### Mavacamten for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: rationale for clinically guided dose titration to optimize individual response [^7ab0e49f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In the pivotal phase 3, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled EXPLORER‐HCM trial (Clinical Study to Evaluate Mavacamten in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; NCT03470545), mavacamten dose was titrated to 1 of 4 strengths (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg) based on each patient's clinical status over 30 weeks of treatment, with administration of a 5 mg oral capsule once daily (QD) being the uniform starting dosage. Mavacamten plasma concentration ≥ 1000 ng/mL or LVEF < 50% were used as temporary treatment interruption criteria. Patients could resume treatment at the next lowest available dose if mavacamten plasma concentration was < 1000 ng/mL and LVEF was ≥ 50% at the follow‐up visit. The goal of the dosing regimen used in EXPLORER‐HCM was to achieve Valsalva LVOT gradient < 30 mm Hg and maintain LVEF > 50% while adjusting mavacamten dose when the drug exposure was outside the range of 350 to 700 ng/mL (with the expectation that the regimen would maintain exposures between 350 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL). Mavacamten was shown to be superior to placebo in achieving the composite functional primary end point and all secondary end points, including changes from baseline in peak oxygen consumption, New York Heart Association class, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire‐Clinical Summary Score after 30 weeks of treatment. These changes were concomitant with a sustained improvement in resting, Valsalva, and postexercise LVOT gradient. Consistent with its mechanism of action, mavacamten treatment resulted in a mean LVEF decrease of 3.9% compared with 0.01% with placebo, from a hyperdynamic mean baseline of 74%. Despite this, mean LVEF remained within normal range (> 50%) throughout the study period with few individual instances of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (7 patients in the mavacamten group with transient reductions in LVEF < 50% compared with 2 patients in the placebo group). Safety and tolerability with treatment were similar to placebo, and adverse events were mostly mild. In the EXPLORER‐HCM cardiac magnetic resonance substudy, patients in the mavacamten group experienced significant reductions from baseline to week 30 in LV mass index, LV mass, maximum LV wall thickness, left atrial volume index, and absolute intracellular myocardial mass index compared with placebo. The change from baseline to week 30 in late gadolinium enhancement (6 SDs), a marker of myocardial fibrosis, was similar between treatment groups.

### PPI use in the OTC era: who to treat, with what, and for how long? [^5cc5313f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to be the most effective class of medication to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The availability of over-the-counter (OTC) and generic PPIs provides consumers with options other than antacids and histamine 2 -receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for self-medication of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Medical concerns arising from these developments include management of patients in whom symptoms persist despite OTC PPI, proper administration of PPIs, and potential masking of more serious pathology, such as malignancy. Current studies indicate that it is likely that different forms of PPI administration will become more acceptable, such as on-demand and intermittent therapy. Prospective clinical trials show the efficacy of these strategies of noncontinuous PPI administration, and the potential for cost reduction in GERD management. Newer agents such as reversible acid pump antagonists will compete for selected markets in the future, further expanding the role of alternative dosing regimens. Ultimately, therapy should be tailored to individual patients because no single strategy will be optimal for the entire population with GERD symptoms.

### Product confusion with maalox total relief and maalox liquid… [^2169fccf]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Maaloxbrand, including how to select the appropriate Maaloxbrand product.
- Active safety monitoring and reporting of adverse events associated with the use of Maaloxbrand products. The company expects to begin selling the renamed product in September 2010. Until that time, healthcare professionals and consumers should be aware of the following: Maalox Total Reliefand the traditional Maaloxproducts are both liquid medications available without a prescription, but are NOTinterchangeable. These products are intended to treat different medical conditions. Maalox Total Reliefis not appropriate for individuals who want to use an antacid, especially if they have a history of gastrointestinal ulcer disease or a bleeding disorder. Maalox Total Reliefcontains the active ingredient bismuth subsalicylate and is used to treat diarrhea, upset stomach associated with nausea, heartburn, and gas due to overindulgence in food.

Bismuth subsalicylate is chemically related to aspirin and may cause similar adverse effects such as bleeding.
- The traditional Maaloxliquid products including Maalox Advanced Regular Strengthand Maalox Advanced Maximum Strengthare well-recognized antacid drug products that contain aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone. Both are OTC products and are used for the relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach, upset stomach, and pressure and bloating commonly referred to as gas. Maalox Total Reliefshould not be confused with traditional Maalox liquid antacid products. FDA is concerned about the public health impact of medication mix-ups with products that have the same names or portions of the same name but contain different active ingredients. The agency encourages drug companies to consider the potential for name confusion when choosing OTC product names.

### Is the aluminum hypothesis dead? [^16791bd5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The Aluminum Hypothesis, the idea that aluminum exposure is involved in the etiology of Alzheimer disease, dates back to a 1965 demonstration that aluminum causes neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of rabbits. Initially the focus of intensive research, the Aluminum Hypothesis has gradually been abandoned by most researchers. Yet, despite this current indifference, the Aluminum Hypothesis continues to attract the attention of a small group of scientists and aluminum continues to be viewed with concern by some of the public. This review article discusses reasons that mainstream science has largely abandoned the Aluminum Hypothesis and explores a possible reason for some in the general public continuing to view aluminum with mistrust.

### Was amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate adequately evaluated before authorisation in Europe? [^c5a18b8b]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Aluminium is considered an effective adjuvant in vaccines, but its safety may not have been sufficiently in focus. Aluminium is a known neurotoxin and inflammagen, and interferes with several biomolecules and biochemical pathways, for example, disturbs calcium metabolism, increases oxidative stress, binds to phosphate groups of nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates such as ATP, and competes with iron and magnesium. Several research groups have raised concerns about the health effects of using aluminium in vaccines. However, both the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry concluded that traditional aluminium adjuvants are safe.

Aluminium adjuvants have been associated with a number of adverse effects, including injection site pain and tenderness, persistent lumps, granulomas, contact dermatitis and postimmunisation headache, but also more severe adverse events such as macrophagic myofasciitisand the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. Animal models have demonstrated the toxicity of aluminium adjuvantsand their translocation away from the injection site.

Criticisms have been raised of the prelicensure randomised clinical trials, that forms the body of evidence for the approval of Gardasil, a Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp manufactured human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine made of recombinant HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 L1 virus-like particles. One criticism is the use of amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAHS) as a comparator in the prelicensure trials. However, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the WHO conclude high vaccine safety and efficacy. AAHS produced by Merck has a short history prior to the use in the Gardasil vaccine. A recent study by Doshi et al found that participants in Gardasil trials were not adequately informed that the placebo was AAHS. As AAHS is both physically and functionally distinct from all previously used aluminium adjuvants, it is crucial to know the body of evidence regarding safety that constitutes the basis of approval of randomised clinical trials using AAHS by medicines agencies. Here we describe some discrepancies in the documents that constitute the foundation for authorisation of two Gardasil randomised clinical trials in Denmark.

It is important to stress that we are not against safe vaccines in general. However, inadequacies in the regulation of vaccine adjuvants may fuel concerns — rightly or wrongly — in the highly polarised environment that surrounds vaccine sciences. It is therefore imperative to ensure transparent documentation and adequate informed consent in randomised clinical trials.

Two phase III trials of resmetirom, MAESTRO-NASH and MAESTRO-NAFLD1, are currently recruiting patients. MAESTRO-NASH (NCT03900429) is estimated to be completed in 2024. It will include 2000 adults with biopsy-proven, non-cirrhotic NASH and fibrosis and will test resmetirom at a dose of 80 mg or 100 mg daily compared to placebo. In addition, the trial will evaluate the effect of resmetirom on a composite long-term outcome measured by the number of patients with new onset of cirrhosis, liver-related clinical outcomes and all-cause mortality up to 54 months. MAESTRO-NAFLD1 (NCT04197479) has recently started and will include 700 adults with MRI-PDFF liver fat fraction 8% or greater and suspected NASH, randomized into 4 arms: open label, placebo (double blind), resmetirom 80 mg (double blind), and resmetirom 100 mg (double blind). The primary outcome of this non-biopsy study is the incidence of adverse events after 52 weeks of treatment.

### Use of JYNNEOS (smallpox and mpox vaccine, live, nonreplicating) for persons aged ≥ 18 years at risk for mpox during an mpox outbreak: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^4b791287]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Future research priorities — JYNNEOS: Because the proportion of immunocompromised persons has increased in the United States, information about VE of JYNNEOS among severely immunocompromised persons (e.g., persons with advanced HIV) will be critical to guiding future recommendations. If more mpox outbreaks occur, priorities include establishing whether there is durable protection after JYNNEOS vaccination or after resolved infection and, if not, when a booster dose might be needed. Because JYNNEOS behaves like a nonlive virus vaccine and is recommended as a 2-dose series, its role as postexposure prophylaxis is poorly understood, and studies are ongoing to understand VE of JYNNEOS postexposure vaccination.

### The phosphate binder equivalent dose [^92e5885a]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Phosphate binders include calcium acetate or carbonate, sevelamer hydrochloride or carbonate, magnesium and lanthanum carbonate, and aluminum carbonate or hydroxide. Their relative phosphate-binding capacity has been assessed in human, in vivo studies that have measured phosphate recovery from stool and/or changes in urinary phosphate excretion or that have compared pairs of different binders where dose of binder in each group was titrated to a target level of serum phosphate. The relative phosphate-binding coefficient (RPBC) based on weight of each binder can be estimated relative to calcium carbonate, the latter being set to 1.0. A systematic review of these studies gave the following estimated RPBC: for elemental lanthanum, 2.0, for sevelamer hydrochloride or carbonate 0.75, for calcium acetate 1.0, for anhydrous magnesium carbonate 1.7, and for "heavy" or hydrated, magnesium carbonate 1.3. Estimated RPBC for aluminum-containing binders were 1.5 for aluminum hydroxide and 1.9 for aluminum carbonate. The phosphate-binding equivalent dose was then defined as the dose of each binder in g × its RPBC, which would be the binding ability of an equivalent weight of calcium carbonate. The phosphate-binding equivalent dose may be useful in comparing changes in phosphate binder prescription over time when multiple binders are being prescribed, when estimating an initial binder prescription, and also in phosphate kinetic modeling.

### Why arent't lower, effective, OTC doses available earlier by prescription? [^d888a8ab]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Many popular oral over-the-counter (OTC) drugs were originally available only by prescription, but not at the low doses contained in their OTC counterparts. Yet, if OTC doses are effective for treating mild symptoms, why weren't these low, often safer doses made available at least by prescription when the drugs were first approved?

Objective

To examine issues surrounding the delayed approval of OTC doses by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Methods

Information reviewed included package inserts, data obtained from manufacturers, and articles published in MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001). Medications examined included presently available and potentially approved OTC antiinflammatory, gastrointestinal, and antihistamine drugs.

Results

Considerable data demonstrate the effectiveness of ibuprofen, naproxen, ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, diphenhydramine, and clemastine at OTC doses. Published studies also show the effectiveness of celecoxib, omeprazole, and fexofenadine at doses 33–50% lower than currently recommended for prescription use.

Conclusions

OTC doses are effective for many patients with mild symptoms and for some with serious symptoms. However, OTC-like doses are usually not offered when drugs are approved for prescription use because new drugs are usually studied in patients with serious conditions requiring higher doses; manufacturers and the FDA seem to prefer a middle-dose approach; > 75% of subjects in premarketing dose studies are male; and averaging the responses of study subjects may obscure a wide range of interindividual variation in drug response. Simplistic dosage guidelines make therapeutic decisions easier. Because dose-related adverse effects frequently diminish quality-of-life and reduce adherence, the early availability of OTC-like doses, at least by prescription, would allow healthcare professionals greater flexibility in matching medication doses to patients' widely differing needs.

Mavacamten synthesis

Mava was synthesized in H.-J. Knölker's lab (see procedure below) and also purchased from Selleck Chemicals. The Mava powder was dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 50 mM.

1-Isopropylbarbituric acid (1-isopropylpyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione) (1)

Dimethyl malonate (19.6 g, 148 mmol) and then sodium methanolate (18.2 g, 337 mmol) were added under continuous stirring to a solution of 1-isopropylurea (14.4 g, 141 mmol) in methanol (500 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 18 h. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled first to room temperature, then to 0 °C, and acidified with hydrochloric acid (pH = 3). After the removal of the solvent in a vacuum, the residue was treated with ethanol (200 mL), and the resulting mixture was filtered. The filtrate was evaporated in a vacuum and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane/methanol, 20:1) to afford 1-isopropylbarbituric acid (13.9 g, 58%) as a light yellow oil.

6-Chloro-3-isopropylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (2)

Phosphorus oxychloride (37 mL) and benzyltriethylammonium chloride (26.1 g, 115 mmol) was added to 1-isopropylbarbituric acid (13.9 g, 81.7 mmol) under an argon atmosphere. The resulting mixture was heated at 50 °C for 18 h under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the excess phosphorus oxychloride was evaporated in a vacuum. The residual red oil was dissolved in dichloromethane (185 mL) and water (120 mL) was added slowly over a period of 1.5 h. The layers were separated, and the organic layer was washed with water (120 mL), and dried with sodium sulfate. After removal of the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (gradient elution with isohexane/ethyl acetate, from 5:1 to 1:1) to provide 6-chloro-3-isopropylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (3.05 g, 20%) as a colorless solid.
