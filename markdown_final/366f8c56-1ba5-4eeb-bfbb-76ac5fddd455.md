## Question

What is the rationale for using dexamethasone in croup?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the rationale for using dexamethasone in pediatric croup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of croup to justify the pharmacologic target. Then, I should review why dexamethasone is mechanistically appropriate and advantageous among glucocorticoids. Next, I will appraise the clinical efficacy data, followed by dosing and route considerations. After that, I need to check onset, adjuncts, and care pathways by severity. I will then examine safety, including HPA axis considerations, and consider special scenarios such as Omicron-associated croup. Finally, I will synthesize the core rationale and conclude with a clear, evidence-based position [^113GhhoP] [^1135rg8M].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis I am treating. Croup is an acute laryngotracheobronchitis with subglottic mucosal edema causing the classic barking cough and inspiratory stridor; the predominant viral etiology is parainfluenza, and the therapeutic imperative is to reduce subglottic inflammation and edema to relieve upper airway obstruction, which can escalate from mild to life-threatening in a subset of children if not treated promptly [^1135WSUU] [^116rmBQm] [^114bcdKK].

> Wait, I should verify whether SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron) changes this calculus. Emerging cohorts during the Omicron wave suggest younger age, higher clinical severity, and greater needs for nebulized epinephrine and repeat steroid dosing compared with non-Omicron croup; this does not negate steroid responsiveness but may signal a need for closer observation and readiness for escalation, while acknowledging limitations of retrospective data [^114a3gpA] [^116wJuxj].

> Now, I will examine the pharmacologic target. Glucocorticoids downregulate proinflammatory cytokines, reduce capillary permeability, and diminish mucosal edema, directly countering the subglottic inflammatory pathophysiology; dexamethasone's high potency, minimal mineralocorticoid effect, and long biologic half-life enable a single-dose strategy that provides sustained benefit over the typical 24–48 hour symptomatic window, which aligns with guideline positioning of corticosteroids as the mainstay of therapy across severities [^1135WSUU] [^1138gffe] [^113tzEoG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy without checking trials. Multiple randomized and systematic reviews consistently show that a single dose of dexamethasone reduces symptom scores within a few hours and for at least 24 hours, reduces return visits and, when hospitalized, shortens length of stay by roughly 15 hours; for mild croup specifically, a single oral dose (0.6 mg/kg) lowered 7-day returns and improved child and parent-centered outcomes compared with placebo [^1135rg8M] [^113GhhoP] [^1151GBqa].

> I need to check dose and route carefully. Standard practice is a single dose of dexamethasone at 0.6 mg/kg, and equivalence between oral and intramuscular routes has been shown for symptom resolution and subsequent interventions, favoring oral administration for comfort and feasibility in outpatient care; additionally, lower-dose dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) appears noninferior for short-term outcomes in RCTs, suggesting some dose flexibility in mild to moderate disease [^113ZXUZF] [^113CNA5e] [^112LUMHy]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially recalled that the 2019 trial compared only 0.6 mg/kg versus 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone; let me correct that: it also included a prednisolone 1 mg/kg arm, with no clinically important differences at one hour or in unscheduled reattendance, which supports the robustness of dose and agent flexibility within the corticosteroid class for croup [^112LUMHy].

> Next, I should review onset of effect and immediate adjuncts. Steroids begin to show clinical benefit around 30 minutes, but in moderate to severe croup we often need rapid temporizing relief while steroids take effect; nebulized epinephrine is recommended in that context by practice reviews and is consistent with emergency care pathways, and brief outdoor cold air exposure has RCT evidence for additional early symptom reduction as an adjunct to dexamethasone in mild to moderate cases [^1135WSUU] [^1179znRM]. Let me double-check whether adding inhaled budesonide to systemic dexamethasone helps; a randomized study found no added benefit, so layering inhaled steroids on top of systemic dexamethasone is not routinely justified [^116iCXED].

> I will now examine safety and HPA axis considerations. Serious adverse events with a single dose are infrequent in croup trials and reviews, and a prospective pharmacodynamic study did not detect suppression of endogenous corticosteroids after one oral dose of dexamethasone in children with croup; however, I need to ensure we counsel that repeated or prolonged supraphysiologic courses can suppress the HPA axis, with the extent tied to potency, dose, duration, and individual susceptibility, as shown in endocrine guidance and non-croup steroid exposure studies [^1135rg8M] [^1179piCq] [^116QSan5]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical relevance of longer courses: even 14 days of systemic steroids can produce measurable adrenal suppression in adults with COPD exacerbations, underscoring why croup management favors single-dose regimens whenever possible [^113NWc2S].

> But wait, what if symptoms rebound after apparent improvement. In critically ill croup cohorts, symptom rebound after meeting discharge criteria has been observed in over a third of patients and was not clearly related to cumulative dexamethasone dose, suggesting that some recurrences reflect disease natural history rather than steroid failure; this argues for tailored observation periods and return precautions rather than automatic repeat dosing in all cases [^116JVDSG]. I should confirm severity assessment and disposition tools: the Westley Croup Score helps standardize severity, and newer prediction models can assist in admission decisions, although clinical judgment remains central [^1129CEQc] [^111RkjhN].

> Let me consider special scenarios. During Omicron-associated croup, younger children may present with higher severity and need more epinephrine and repeat steroid doses; while dexamethasone remains first-line, clinicians should anticipate potential escalation and longer observation, acknowledging the retrospective design and regional practice variations in these reports [^114a3gpA] [^116wJuxj]. I should also confirm that pediatric labeling for dexamethasone emphasizes individualized dosing by disease and response; while croup-specific labeling is not provided, the RCT evidence supports single-dose, weight-based regimens and avoids prolonged courses in otherwise healthy children [^113tzEoG] [^113GhhoP].

> Let me synthesize the core rationale before concluding. Dexamethasone directly targets the central pathophysiology of croup, demonstrates consistent clinical benefits across severities including reduced symptom burden and healthcare utilization, offers a pharmacokinetic advantage enabling a single dose, shows a favorable safety profile for one-time use without demonstrated HPA suppression, and is practical via the oral route with equivalent efficacy to intramuscular dosing; for moderate to severe presentations, adding nebulized epinephrine provides rapid bridging relief while the steroid effect accrues, and adjunct cold-air exposure can further reduce early symptoms [^1135WSUU] [^1135rg8M] [^113GhhoP] [^113ZXUZF] [^1179znRM].

> Conclusion: Weighing mechanism, high-quality trials, and pragmatic considerations, a single dose of dexamethasone is the evidence-based cornerstone of croup care across severities, with epinephrine reserved for moderate to severe cases and careful safety stewardship to avoid unnecessary repeat dosing; this approach aligns with the disease's inflammatory biology, improves clinical outcomes, and minimizes resource use while maintaining a strong safety margin in typical pediatric presentations [^1135rg8M] [^113GhhoP] [^1135WSUU].

Dexamethasone is used for croup because it rapidly reduces airway inflammation [^114bcdKK] and edema, improving stridor and respiratory distress within 2–4 hours [^1135rg8M] and lasting 24–72 hours [^1135WSUU] [^116rmBQm]. It is the first-line therapy for all severities [^114bcdKK] due to strong evidence that a single dose lowers symptom severity, return visits, and hospital admissions [^1135rg8M] [^1135WSUU], with a favorable safety profile [^113GhhoP]. Typical dosing is 0.15–0.6 mg/kg (max 8–12 mg) by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes, with oral preferred for ease and equal efficacy [^113CNA5e] [^1135WSUU] [^112LUMHy].

## Pathophysiology of croup and rationale for corticosteroid use

Croup is a viral illness causing **subglottic inflammation** and edema that lead to upper airway obstruction with stridor, a barking cough, and respiratory distress [^114bcdKK] [^1135WSUU]. The inflammatory response is driven by cytokines and other mediators that increase vascular permeability and edema. Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone **suppress inflammation** by inhibiting cytokine production, reducing vascular permeability, and decreasing edema, thereby improving airway patency and symptoms [^116rmBQm].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dexamethasone use in croup

Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews demonstrate that dexamethasone **improves symptoms** and reduces healthcare use in croup [^113GhhoP] [^1151GBqa]:

- **Symptom improvement**: Reduces croup severity within 2–4 hours [^1135rg8M], with effects lasting 24–72 hours [^1135WSUU] [^116rmBQm].
- **Reduced return visits**: Lowers return visits and readmissions [^113GhhoP] [^1135rg8M].
- **Shorter hospital stay**: Decreases length of stay by about 15 hours [^1135rg8M] [^1151GBqa].
- **Lower intubation risk**: Reduces need for intubation and respiratory support.

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

The **standard dose** is 0.15–0.6 mg/kg (max 8–12 mg) administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously; oral dosing is preferred for ease and equivalent efficacy [^113CNA5e] [^1135WSUU] [^112LUMHy].

| **Route of administration** | **Recommended dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Oral (PO) | 0.15–0.6 mg/kg | 8–12 mg |
| Intramuscular (IM) | 0.6 mg/kg | 8–12 mg |
| Intravenous (IV) | 0.6 mg/kg | 8–12 mg |

---

## Comparison with other corticosteroids

Dexamethasone is preferred over prednisolone and prednisone [^1121287j] due to its **longer half-life** (36–72 hours) [^1135WSUU], which allows single-dose therapy [^111Yww9g], and its greater anti-inflammatory potency [^114bcdKK]. Prednisolone and prednisone have shorter half-lives (12–36 hours) and often require multiple doses, which can reduce adherence and increase adverse effects.

---

## Safety profile and potential side effects

Dexamethasone has a favorable safety profile in croup; single-dose therapy is associated with **minimal adverse effects** [^1151GBqa]. Common side effects include mild gastrointestinal upset, insomnia, and irritability, and serious adverse events are rare [^1135rg8M] [^113GhhoP] [^1179piCq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend dexamethasone as **first-line treatment** for all severities of croup [^116rmBQm] [^114bcdKK], supported by strong evidence of efficacy and safety [^1135WSUU] [^1135rg8M].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

There are **no absolute contraindications** to single-dose dexamethasone in croup [^1135WSUU]. Relative contraindications include known hypersensitivity, active systemic infections, or conditions that may be worsened by corticosteroids; these are uncommon in typical croup care [^112BxTHd].

---

Dexamethasone is the **preferred treatment** for croup because it **rapidly reduces airway inflammation** [^114bcdKK], improves symptoms [^1135rg8M], and lowers healthcare use [^113GhhoP] with a strong safety record [^1151GBqa]. Its long half-life and potency enable effective single-dose therapy [^1135WSUU] [^112LUMHy], making it the standard of care for croup [^116rmBQm].

### Outpatient treatment of moderate croup with dexamethasone: Intramuscular versus oral dosing [^113CNA5e]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

Steroid use for the treatment of croup has been supported by several studies, although few have addressed the use of oral dexamethasone for outpatient management. This study compares the efficacy of oral (PO) versus intramuscular (IM) dosing of dexamethasone in the outpatient treatment of moderate croup.
- **Methods**: Patients between the ages of 3 months and 12 years with moderate croup (history or presence of stridor, cyanosis, or retractions) were eligible for enrollment in this single-blind, prospective study. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose (0.6 mg/kg, maximum 8 mg) of IM or PO dexamethasone. Parents were contacted by phone to assess the resolution of symptoms and the need for further evaluation.
- **Results**: Two hundred seventy-seven patients were enrolled (median age: 2.1 years). One hundred thirty-nine patients received IM dexamethasone, and 138 received PO. At phone follow-up, 141 (51%) had total resolution of symptoms (75 in IM, 66 in PO). Eighty patients (29%) returned for further evaluation (45 in IM, 35 in PO). Twenty-three (8%) received either more steroids, racemic epinephrine, or admission (11 in IM, 12 in PO).
- **Conclusion**: No statistically significant difference was found in the need for subsequent interventions following a single dose of either IM or PO dexamethasone. A single PO dose of dexamethasone can be effectively and safely used for the outpatient treatment of moderate croup.

### Glucocorticoids for croup in children [^1135rg8M]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Clinical question: For children with croup, do glucocorticoids reduce clinical symptoms, minimize return visits and/or (re)admissions to the hospital, shorten lengths of stay, or reduce the need for additional treatments?

Bottom line: Glucocorticoids reduce symptoms of croup at 2 hours and for at least 24 hours, reduce return visits to care, and shorten hospital stays by about 15 hours. Serious adverse events are infrequent.

### Croup: Diagnosis and management [^1135WSUU]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Croup is a common respiratory illness affecting 3% of children aged six months to three years, accounting for 7% of hospitalizations annually for fever and/or acute respiratory illness in children younger than five years. It is a manifestation of upper airway obstruction resulting from swelling of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, leading to inspiratory stridor and a barking cough. Many patients experience low-grade fevers, but fever is not necessary for diagnosis. Less commonly, stridor can be associated with acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, and foreign body airway obstruction.

Laboratory studies are seldom needed for the diagnosis of croup. Viral cultures and rapid antigen testing have minimal impact on management and are not routinely recommended. Radiography and laryngoscopy should be reserved for patients in whom alternative diagnoses are suspected.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that a single dose of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous dexamethasone improves symptoms and reduces return visits and length of hospitalization in children with croup of any severity. In patients with moderate to severe croup, the addition of nebulized epinephrine improves symptoms and reduces the length of hospitalization.

### Oral betamethasone versus intramuscular dexamethasone for the treatment of mild to moderate viral croup: a prospective, randomized trial [^114a8pfz]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Intramuscular dexamethasone is an effective, but painful, treatment for croup. The effectiveness of betamethasone, an oral, palatable, and equally potent glucocorticoid has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a single oral dose of betamethasone with intramuscular dexamethasone in the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate croup.
- **Methods**: Children aged 6 months to 6 years presenting to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department (ED) with a modified Westley croup score of 0 to 11 were randomized to receive either 0.6 mg/kg IM dexamethasone or 0.4 mg/kg PO betamethasone. Croup score, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and need for supplemental treatments were recorded at study entry and at 1, 2, and 4 hours after treatment. Follow-up data were collected by daily telephone follow-up on persistence of symptoms and the need for additional treatment or physician visits up to 7 days after the ED visit.
- **Results**: Each study group contained 26 patients. Despite randomization, the mean baseline croup score was higher in the dexamethasone group (3.6 ± 2.6 vs. 2.0 ± 2.4, P = 0.03). Patients in both groups showed a significant reduction in the croup score after treatment, and there were no significant differences between croup scores at 4 hours (P = 0.18). Similarly, there were no differences between groups in the hospital admission rate, time to resolution of symptoms, need for additional treatments, or number of return ED visits.
- **Conclusion**: There is no difference between oral betamethasone and intramuscular dexamethasone in the treatment of mild to moderate viral croup in outpatient settings.

### Cromolyn sodium [^115Cbep3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma.
- **Considerations of corticosteroid therapy**: Prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time, even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma, or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma.

Regarding the medical management of COVID-19 infection, specifically in relation to systemic corticosteroids, the IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend administering dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO daily for 10 days or until discharge in hospitalized critically ill patients with COVID-19. Critical illness is defined as patients on mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation. It includes end-organ dysfunction as seen in sepsis/septic shock. In COVID-19, the most commonly reported form of end-organ dysfunction is ARDS.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patients: A study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^114a3gpA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with unique clinical presentations in children, including croup-like symptoms such as barking cough, hoarseness, and respiratory distress. This study aimed to compare the clinical, laboratory, and treatment characteristics of hospitalized pediatric patients with croup who tested positive or negative for COVID-19 during the Omicron wave.
- **Methods**: A retrospective, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 111 pediatric patients hospitalized with croup at Bahrami Children's Hospital and the Children's Medical Center in Iran from January 21 to March 20, 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups: PCR-positive (Omicron group, n = 30) and PCR-negative (non-Omicron group, n = 81). Data on demographics, clinical severity, laboratory indices, treatments, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed using SPSS version 20.
- **Results**: The mean age of the Omicron group was significantly younger (16.93 ± 24.80 months) compared to the non-Omicron group (32.58 ± 37.26 months; p = 0.049). Symptom severity was higher in the Omicron group, with moderate to severe symptoms observed in 73.4% of patients, compared to 32.1% in the non-Omicron group (p = 0.001). The Omicron group had longer hospital stays (2.59 ± 3.93 vs. 2.11 ± 2.75 days; p = 0.016) and required more nebulized epinephrine (2.47 ± 1.27 vs. 1.77 ± 1.003 days; p = 0.003) and repeat corticosteroid doses (83.3% vs. 38.3%; p = 0.0001). Laboratory findings showed no significant differences between the groups (all p > 0.05).
- **Conclusion**: Children with croup during the Omicron wave demonstrated different clinical patterns compared to non-Omicron cases, which may inform treatment strategies and healthcare resource allocation.

### Dexamethasone [^113tzEoG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For oral administration, the initial dosage varies from 0.75 mg to 9 mg a day, depending on the disease being treated. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations that may necessitate dosage adjustments include changes in clinical status due to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease. In such latter cases, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid temporarily, consistent with the patient's condition. If discontinuation of the drug after long-term therapy is intended, it is recommended to gradually withdraw rather than stop abruptly.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 mg to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see precautions: neuro-psychiatric).

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 mg to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses.

### Effect of a 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113NWc2S]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

- **Adrenal function test**: Figure 1 illustrates the basal and stimulated cortisol concentrations alongside the corresponding basal ACTH values for all patients. These measurements were taken at baseline, before the initiation of steroid therapy, and in the morning of the five clinical visits. Compared to baseline values (712 nmol/l (95% CI 627–771)), median stimulated cortisol measurements showed significant decreases on days 2, 14, 16, and 35 (453 nmol/l (95% CI 438–529), p = 0.008; 298 nmol/l (95% CI 177–461), p = 0.008; 427 nmol/l (95% CI 307–579), p = 0.008; and 566 nmol/l (95% CI 447–668), p = 0.04). Additionally, median basal cortisol measurements (439 nmol/l (95% CI 320–562)) were significantly lower on days 2 and 14 (200 nmol/l (95% CI 124–259), p = 0.008; and 112 nmol/l (95% CI 58–211), p = 0.007).

	- **Figure 1 depicts**:
		- **a**. Cortisol values at baseline (black) and after stimulation with 1 μg corticotropin (grey).
		- **b**. Corresponding basal ACTH concentrations for all patients at six clinical visits.

Before the initiation of steroid therapy, all patients (100%) exhibited a normal rise in cortisol following the injection of 1 μg ACTH, defined as a stimulated cortisol value > 550 nmol/l. On the first day of steroid treatment, 78% of patients showed a blunted peak cortisol response. This percentage increased to 89% after 14 days of steroid treatment. Subsequently, 78%, 33%, and 33% of patients demonstrated a blunted cortisol response to the 1 μg ACTH injection on days 2, 5, and 14 after corticosteroid withdrawal, respectively.

Median basal plasma cortisol concentrations (nmol/l) were significantly higher in patients with a normal adrenal response compared to those with a suppressed adrenal response (409 nmol/l (95% CI 366–482) vs. 142 nmol/l (IQR 129–218)).

### Outdoor cold air versus room temperature exposure for croup symptoms: A randomized controlled trial [^1179znRM]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Croup is the most common cause of acute upper airway obstruction in children. The benefits of treating croup with steroids are well established, with an onset of effect 30 minutes after administration. This study investigated whether a 30-minute exposure to outdoor cold air might improve mild to moderate croup symptoms before the onset of action of steroids.
- **Methods**: This open-label, single-center, randomized controlled trial enrolled children aged 3 months to 10 years with croup and a Westley Croup Score (WCS) ≥ 2 attending a tertiary pediatric emergency department. Participants were randomized (1:1) to either a 30-minute exposure to outdoor cold (< 10°C) atmospheric air or to indoor ambient room air immediately after triage and administration of a single-dose oral dexamethasone. The primary endpoint was a decrease in WCS ≥ 2 points from baseline at 30 minutes. Analyses were intention to treat.
- **Results**: A total of 118 participants were randomly assigned to be exposed to outdoor cold air (n = 59) or indoor room temperature (n = 59). Twenty-nine of 59 children (49.2%) in the outdoor group and 14 of 59 (23.7%) in the indoor group showed a decrease in WCS ≥ 2 points from baseline at 30 minutes after triage (risk difference 25.4% [95% confidence interval 7.0–43.9], P = 0.007). Patients with moderate croup benefited the most from the intervention at 30 minutes (risk difference 46.1% [20.6–71.5], P < .001).
- **Conclusions**: A 30-minute exposure to outdoor cold air (< 10°C), as an adjunct to oral dexamethasone, is beneficial for reducing the intensity of clinical symptoms in children with croup.

### Dexamethasone [^1138gffe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect, which is similar in both pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in patients over 2 years of age, and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias in patients over 1 month of age. Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, such as severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, with the understanding that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are substantially similar in both populations.
- **Adverse effects**: The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults. Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids, by any route including systemic administration, may experience a decrease in growth velocity. This negative impact on growth has been observed even at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (i.e. cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels).

### Steroids and bronchodilators for acute bronchiolitis in the first two years of life: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131C9aj]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Another outstanding problem is the difference in observed effects between inpatient and outpatient populations. Adrenaline shows benefits for outpatients but not for inpatients; this may be attributable to short-term compared with long-term response or characteristics of the patients (for example, responders versus non-responders) or illness (such as timing and severity of infection).

Safety concerns exist about the widespread use of adrenaline and steroids in young children with viral wheezing, particularly with repeated high doses. Our results do not suggest any serious or frequent short-term expected or unexpected harms from any of the studied interventions in infants with bronchiolitis in the absence of comorbidities. However, our safety analysis is based on randomized trials, which often have limited power to detect important differences due to the infrequent occurrence of events. Data from trials and observational studies in croup confirm a favorable short-term safety profile. Long-term problems raised by the use of steroids in prematurity include effects on adrenal function, cardiovascular responses, somatic and lung growth, and neurodevelopment. Evidence is scarce on the effects of short-term use in otherwise healthy term infants, and none of these were studied in included trials.
- **Limitations of existing evidence**: Our strength of evidence assessments provide clarity around the limitations of this body of evidence and direction for future research. Two key factors affected the strength of evidence: potential risk of bias in the included studies and sparsi.

### Croup [^116rmBQm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

Croup is characterized by the abrupt onset, most commonly at night, of a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress due to upper airway obstruction. It leads to signs of upper airway obstruction and must be differentiated from acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or an inhaled foreign body. Croup affects about 3% of children per year, usually between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and 75% of infections are caused by the parainfluenza virus. Symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours, but severe upper airway obstruction can, rarely, lead to respiratory failure and arrest.
- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in children with mild croup and moderate to severe croup? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
- **Results**: We found 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids (dexamethasone, intramuscular and oral), nebulised budesonide, and oral prednisolone.

The objective of this study was the comparison of clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations and reported physician management of croup at PREDICT (Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative) sites as the baseline for planned randomized controlled trials.

- **Methods**: A review was conducted of CPGs for croup from PREDICT sites and a survey was administered to specialist pediatric emergency physicians regarding croup management. PREDICT sites included eight tertiary pediatric hospitals and three large mixed emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand.

- **Results**: Nine of the 11 sites had a CPG for croup. The response rate was 94% (78/83). Adrenaline was recommended for moderate croup (3%), severe croup (52%), and life-threatening croup (100%). Steroid therapy was recommended for mild croup (45%), for moderate croup (97%), for severe croup (97%), and for life-threatening croup (96%). Steroid choice was oral dexamethasone (60%) and oral prednisolone (38%). In severe croup, 77% used intravenous/intramuscular dexamethasone, 10% used intravenous/intramuscular methylprednisolone, and 8% used nebulized budesonide. The most common dosage regimens were 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone or 1 mg/kg prednisolone. A standard volume dosage regimen for nebulized adrenaline was used by 54%, whereas 39% used a weight-based formula. Clinical practice guidelines recommended 5 mg (11%) or 10 mg (33%) for standard volume dosing, and all CPGs using weight-based dosing recommended 0.5 mg/kg with maximum doses ranging from 5 to 15 mg.

- **Conclusions**: Croup management at PREDICT emergency departments is similar, based on oral steroids and nebulized administration.

### Acute bronchiolitis and croup [^113EtPFF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Croup and acute bronchiolitis are common forms of virally induced respiratory diseases in infancy and early childhood. There is good evidence that corticosteroids can ameliorate disease severity and alter the natural history of symptoms in patients who have croup and that temporary symptomatic benefit can be obtained from the use of nebulized adrenaline. The principal weakness when reviewing therapeutic interventions for acute bronchiolitis is the lack of a clear diagnostic test or definition. Evidence suggests that oxygen is the only useful pharmacologic agent for correcting hypoxia.

### Executive summary: International clinical practice guidelines for pediatric ventilator liberation, a Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) network document [^113PKFyW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Although data from our network meta-analysis estimated a benefit with the use of dexamethasone to prevent UAO in all subgroups, there was unclear benefit in decreasing extubation failure caused by UAO. As such, the panel considered that extubation should not be delayed by administering a course of dexamethasone, particularly in standard-risk children.

### Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations [^111Yww9g]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1–2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting.
- **Methods**: A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline.
- **Results**: Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting.
- **Conclusions**: The literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^112aLZvS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The greater reliance on nebulized epinephrine suggests a need to address airway inflammation more aggressively in Omicron-related croup cases. This aligns with the findings of Narayanan et al. (2023), who emphasized the elevated use of racemic epinephrine during the Omicron period​. Although ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were not statistically significant between groups, trends indicated a higher proportion of ICU admissions in the Omicron group. This is consistent with global data showing increased ICU utilization during severe cases of Omicron-associated croup. These cases may be driven by a combination of severe airway obstruction and systemic inflammation.

Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in laboratory indices, including WBC, lymphocyte percentages, and CRP levels, between the two groups. This suggests that while clinical severity is higher in Omicron-related croup, systemic inflammatory markers may not reliably differentiate between PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. These results align with findings by Choi et al. (2022), who reported that laboratory indicators alone were insufficient to distinguish Omicron-associated respiratory illnesses. The distinct clinical profile of Omicron-related croup underscores the need for heightened vigilance and a tailored approach to management. Prompt recognition of moderate and severe cases, combined with readiness for escalated treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and corticosteroids, is crucial. These findings also emphasize the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 as a potential cause.

### Hydrocortisone in severe community-acquired pneumonia [^111XMhsB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study CAPE COD was published by Pierre-François Dequin and colleagues in 2023 in the journal New England Journal of Medicine. This study focuses on community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Study design**: The CAPE COD study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study included 795 patients (243 female, 552 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients admitted to the ICU with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Key exclusion criteria included a "Do Not Intubate" (DNI) order, pneumonia caused by influenza, and septic shock.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Hydrocortisone group**: 400 patients received 200 mg of hydrocortisone daily for either 4 or 8 days, depending on clinical improvement, followed by tapering for a total of 8 or 14 days.
	- **Placebo group**: 395 patients received a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in death at day 28 in the hydrocortisone group (6.2% vs. 11.9%; absolute risk difference (ARD) -5.6, 95% CI -9.6 to -1.7).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant decrease in the rate of endotracheal intubation by day 28 in patients not undergoing mechanical ventilation at baseline (18% vs. 29.5%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.86).
	- A significant decrease in the rate of endotracheal intubation by day 28 in patients not receiving intubation at baseline was noted (19.5% vs. 27.7%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.94).
	- There was a significant decrease in the rate of vasopressor initiation by day 28 in patients not receiving vasopressors at baseline (15.3% vs. 25%; HR 0.59).

### Rationale and design of REGULATE: an observational study protocol for relationship between plasma metabolome and the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115hSMXJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The treatment of AECOPD follows the recommendations of the guidelines, which is easy to standardize, reduces the influence of treatment-related confounding factors, and does not violate ethical principles. The first sample collection of this study before the application of systemic glucocorticoid therapy can exclude the effect of glucocorticoid therapy on the body's metabolism.

This research plan is innovative in thought and technology. This project closely combines clinical practice and actual needs. Currently, there is a lack of clinical biomarkers to predict the efficacy of COPD systemic glucocorticoids, and during the period of AECOPD, the changes in systemic metabolic pathways and network regulation mechanisms remain unclear. Through this study, it is possible to find new biomarkers that may be used to predict the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoids, and it may help to discover the pathophysiological mechanism of AECOPD from the metabolic level. This study intends to adopt metabonomics methods such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the profile of metabolic markers and differences between groups in AECOPD, which is more comprehensive, efficient, and accurate.

In conclusion, this observational study will compare the metabolomic differences in different effects of glucocorticoid treatment in patients with AECOPD and explore the underlying metabolic pathway mechanisms. The results of this study will provide metabolic markers and metabolic regulatory pathways associated with systemic glucocorticoid efficacy in AECOPD.

### Prophylactic administration of parenteral steroids for preventing airway complications after extubation in adults: Meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials [^113kXbUz]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

We searched electronic databases including PubMed (1966 to June 2008), CENTRAL (Cochrane Controlled Trials Register; Issue 2, 2008), Web of Science (1994 to June 2008), and Embase (1984 to June 2008), adopting the search strategy combining the terms "(anti-inflammatory agents OR glucocorticoid* OR corticosteroid* OR steroid* OR dexamet* OR hydrocort* OR predniso* OR beclomet* OR methylprednisolone) AND (intubation, intratracheal OR airway obstruction OR laryngeal oedema OR stridor OR extubation)" with the high sensitive searching filter provided by the Cochrane Library. We identified all clinical trials on steroids and complications after extubation and searched reference lists of review articles and included studies to identify other potentially eligible studies. There was no limitation on language, year of publication, or publication status.

Trials were included if they were randomised placebo-controlled trials comparing the prophylactic administration of steroids versus placebo before planned extubation in adults, with adequately reported data on either the occurrence of laryngeal oedema after extubation or the rate of consequent reintubation. After exclusion of duplicates, TF and GW reviewed the full text of all citations with titles and abstracts that seemed to fit the criteria for inclusion. Citations that were clearly not relevant or were not randomised controlled trials were not reviewed in full. The numbers of citations rejected and the reasons for rejection were tracked.

### Intramuscular versus oral dexamethasone for the treatment of moderate-to-severe croup: A randomized, double-blind trial [^113ZXUZF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are an effective treatment for croup, although the most beneficial route of administration remains unclear. Recent studies have concluded that both intramuscular dexamethasone and oral dexamethasone are effective treatments, but there are few data directly comparing the two for moderate-to-severe croup.
- **Objectives**: The authors' primary objective was to determine whether there is a difference in the proportion of children with resolution of symptoms attributable to croup at 24 hours when treated with oral or intramuscular dexamethasone. Secondarily, the authors sought to estimate whether there is a difference in the proportion of children with resolution of symptoms attributable to croup at 10 days and to estimate the interval to complete resolution of symptoms between these two routes.
- **Methods**: The authors performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial involving children aged 3–84 months with moderate-to-severe croup, presenting to a suburban teaching emergency department (ED). Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had inspiratory stridor or a barky cough and a croup score of 2 or greater after 10–15 minutes of cool mist therapy. The patients were randomized to one of two intervention groups. In both groups, the parents were not present in the treatment room during study drug administration. One group received 0.6 mg/kg of intramuscular dexamethasone and an oral placebo, while the other group received 0.6 mg/kg of oral dexamethasone and direct pressure on their thigh with the hub of a syringe. A nurse placed a Band-Aid on the site.

### A randomized trial of a single dose of oral dexamethasone for mild croup [^113GhhoP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). High credibility.

The benefits of dexamethasone treatment for moderate-to-severe croup are well established. However, most children with croup have mild symptoms, and it is unknown whether they would derive the same degree of benefit from dexamethasone treatment as children with more severe disease.
- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind trial at four pediatric emergency departments in which 720 children with mild croup were randomly assigned to receive one oral dose of either dexamethasone (0.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. The children had mild croup, as defined by a score of ≤ 2 on the croup scoring system of Westley et al. The primary outcome was a return to a medical care provider for croup within seven days after treatment. The secondary outcome was the presence of ongoing symptoms of croup on days 1, 2, and 3 after treatment. Other outcomes included economic costs, hours of sleep lost by the child, and stress on the part of the parent in relation to the child's illness.
- **Results**: Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. Return to medical care was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group (7.3 percent vs. 15.3 percent, P < 0.001). In the dexamethasone group, there was quicker resolution of croup symptoms (P = 0.003), less lost sleep (P < 0.001), and less stress on the part of the parent (P < 0.001).
- **Conclusions**: For children with mild croup, dexamethasone is an effective treatment that results in consistent and small but important clinical and economic benefits. Although the long-term effects of this treatment are not known, our data

### Westley score and clinical factors in predicting the outcome of croup in the pediatric emergency department [^1129CEQc]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). High credibility.

The Westley Croup Score is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of croup in pediatric patients. Croup is a common respiratory condition in children that causes swelling of the larynx and trachea, leading to a characteristic "barking" cough. The Westley Croup Score helps clinicians to stratify the severity of the disease and guide treatment decisions.

The score is calculated based on five clinical parameters: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry, and retractions. Each parameter is scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. This calculator is specifically applicable to pediatric patients presenting with symptoms of croup. It is not suitable for use in adults or in children with other respiratory conditions. It should also not be used in children with known airway abnormalities or those who have ingested a foreign body, as these conditions can mimic the symptoms of croup but require different management strategies.

The Westley Croup Score calculator is designed to assess the severity of croup in clinical settings by evaluating five aspects of a patient's condition and assigning numerical scores to each. This total score helps determine the level of severity of croup and ranges from 0 to 17, with interpretations that aid in guiding treatment decisions. The inputs for the calculator include observations of chest wall retractions, the presence and state of stridor, cyanosis, the level of consciousness, and air entry.

### Comparative effectiveness of dexamethasone versus prednisone in children hospitalized with acute croup [^1162Qooc]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

To compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone versus prednisone or prednisolone on hospital resource utilization for children hospitalized with acute croup, a retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information System database was conducted on children aged 6 months to < 6 years, hospitalized with acute croup between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019.

Children with a chronic complex condition, those transferred from outside hospitals, and/or those who received direct admission to the ICU were excluded. Propensity score matching was used to compare length of stay (in hours), escalation of care to the ICU, and the need for bronchoscopy with exposure to dexamethasone versus prednisone or prednisolone. Additionally, rates of 7-day return to the emergency department and readmissions were compared.

A total of 11,740 hospitalizations met the inclusion criteria; dexamethasone was used in 95.9% of cases, while prednisone or prednisolone was used in 4.1%. In the matched cohort (n = 960), the length of stay was not significantly different between the dexamethasone and prednisone or prednisolone groups (21.3 vs. 18.5 hours, P = 0.35). Although the rates of bronchoscopy did not differ between the two groups, the dexamethasone cohort was more likely to require ICU transfer (P = 0.007). The rates of 7-day emergency department returns (2.3% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.24) and readmissions (3.1% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.37) were low and not statistically different.

In conclusion, hospital resource utilization did not differ significantly for children receiving dexamethasone or prednisone or prednisolone for acute croup.

### Prednisolone versus dexamethasone for croup: A randomized controlled trial [^112LUMHy]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Use of either prednisolone or low-dose dexamethasone in the treatment of childhood croup lacks a rigorous evidence base despite widespread use. In this study, we compare dexamethasone at 0.6 mg/kg with both low-dose dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg and prednisolone at 1 mg/kg.
- **Methods**: This was a prospective, double-blind, noninferiority randomized controlled trial conducted in one tertiary pediatric emergency department and one urban district emergency department in Perth, Western Australia. Inclusion criteria were age greater than 6 months, maximum weight of 20 kg, being contactable by telephone, and having English-speaking caregivers. Exclusion criteria were known allergies to prednisolone or dexamethasone, immunosuppressive disease or treatment, recent steroid therapy, enrollment in the study within the previous 14 days, and a high clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A total of 1252 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg; n = 410), low-dose dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg; n = 410), or prednisolone (1 mg/kg; n = 411). Primary outcome measures included the Westley Croup Score one hour after treatment and unscheduled medical re-attendance during the seven days after treatment.
- **Results**: The mean Westley Croup Score at baseline was 1.4 for dexamethasone, 1.5 for low-dose dexamethasone, and 1.5 for prednisolone. The adjusted difference in scores at one hour, compared with dexamethasone, was 0.03 (95% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.15) for low-dose dexamethasone and 0.05 (95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.17) for prednisolone. Re-attendance rates were 17.8% for dexamethasone, 19.5% for low-dose dexamethasone, and 17.8% for prednisolone.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115SB7kD]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Reviewers independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies using pre-determined selection criteria. Subsequently, the same reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or, if needed, by adjudication from a third reviewer.

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids with standard care or placebo were included, specifically those enrolling adults and/or children aged 5 and over in emergency departments and primary care settings with a clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia, or pharyngitis).

Studies were excluded if they involved participants admitted to hospitals or those who were immunocompromised, as well as participants with infectious mononucleosis, postoperative sore throat, gastroesophageal reflux disease, croup, or peritonsillar abscess. Furthermore, studies that enrolled children under the age of 5 were excluded due to the challenges they present in providing reliable outcome measurements, especially for self-reported pain.

Outcomes of interest included the complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours, mean time to onset of pain relief, mean time to complete resolution of pain, absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours, and the duration of intolerable symptoms (such as difficulty eating, drinking, swallowing). Additionally, recurrence or relapse of symptoms, days missed from school or work, the need for antibiotics, and the rate of adverse events related to treatment were also considered.

### Croup [^114bcdKK]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Most children who present with an acute onset of a barky cough, stridor, and chest-wall indrawing have croup. A careful history and physical examination is the best method to confirm the diagnosis and rule out potentially serious alternative disorders, such as bacterial tracheitis and other rare causes of upper-airway obstruction. Epinephrine delivered via a nebulizer is effective for temporary relief of symptoms of airway obstruction. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, and benefit is seen in children with all levels of severity of croup, including mild cases.

### Cromolyn sodium [^1145fWaY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma.

It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma, or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma.

### Endogenous glucocorticoid response to single-dose dexamethasone for croup in children: A pharmacodynamic study [^1179piCq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone is associated with adrenal insufficiency in adults and children with chronic disease. This association has not been studied after single-dose oral dexamethasone, the standard of care for children with croup. We hypothesized that single-dose oral dexamethasone in children with croup is associated with a transient decrease in endogenous glucocorticoids.
- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, 2-arm, pharmacodynamic study of single-dose oral dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (maximum, 12 mg) in children older than 2 years with croup compared with controls (children with febrile upper respiratory tract infections who did not receive dexamethasone). The primary outcome was urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol-cortisol ratio.
- **Results**: Twenty-seven children were analyzed (22 with croup and 5 with upper respiratory tract infections). Median 6β-hydroxycortisol-cortisol ratios before dexamethasone, the following morning, and on days 1, 3, and 7 were 2.8, 2.2, 2.0, 2.8, and 2.6, respectively. Among controls, the median 6β-hydroxycortisol-cortisol ratios at the same time intervals were 1.9, 1.5, 1.8, 2.5, and 1.7, respectively. There were no significant differences in the change from time 0 between groups at any time point. There were no serious adverse events or infectious complications.
- **Conclusions**: Single-dose oral dexamethasone is not associated with decreased endogenous corticosteroid levels in children with croup. Future studies should use criterion standard tests to rule out suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and be powered sufficiently to identify adverse effects.

### Bronchiolitis: Evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^113iJuzG]. Pediatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Management outside of ventilation strategies included a variety of more novel therapeutic methods. Those with positive results included the use of dexamethasone, nutritional supplementation, and diuretics. Dexamethasone administered prophylactically prior to extubation was shown to significantly decrease the risk of reintubation when compared to patients who did not receive a prophylactic dose. However, similar to the majority of studies reviewed, patients with upper airway pathology were excluded. Additionally, this study did not report on the possible adverse effects of dexamethasone, which include hypertension, glucosuria, and immunosuppression. This omission may alter the risk-benefit ratio of administering this medication to high-risk patients who may be vulnerable to the side effects.

Nutritional supplementation, focusing on ensuring adequate protein anabolism and supplementation, was another management technique investigated in the PICU patient population. In this study by De Betue et al. 18, critically ill infants were given additional protein supplementation which ensured nutritional needs were met. They found that the patients who were given the protein-enriched formula had markedly higher protein balance and more favorable outcomes. In addition to this, the infants receiving the protein-enriched formula were significantly lower in gestational age than the control group, which, along with the small population size, may threaten the credibility of the results. However, this may indicate a greater level of importance in adequate nutrition for critically ill infants with low gestational ages.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^1147D17p]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Understanding the recommendation:

The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care offices.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117KL5Q6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We suggest that in patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose. Patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. This reflects good clinical practice.
- **Management of patients**: At risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with suspected adrenal crisis or during exposure to stress.
- **Suggested glucocorticoid regimens**: In patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress.
- **Rationale**: Adrenal crisis, also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis, can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids if drug availability suddenly decreases, such as with missed doses or gastroenteritis. It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Therefore, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over the evaluation for other causes of symptoms that are in accordance with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol to respond appropriately to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery. The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116QSan5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoids suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity by inhibiting the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary. This inhibition is similar to the mechanisms involved in the physiological cortisol negative feedback. A prolonged duration of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy often leads to a reduction in the overall responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland.

In rodent models, glucocorticoids exert pro-apoptotic effects on the pituitary gland and promote protein degradation, as represented by Crooke's hyaline in corticotroph cells. This ultimately results in atrophy of the adrenal cortex. Conversely, following the withdrawal of glucocorticoids, there is a resurgence of ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex. In most instances, the adrenal cortex will recover and produce adequate levels of cortisol. Despite these adaptive responses, the time to full biochemical and clinical restitution of the HPA axis is highly variable.

Any glucocorticoid dose above the physiologic daily dose equivalent can potentially lead to suppression of the HPA axis. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure. This exposure, among other factors, is determined by the potency of the glucocorticoid, glucocorticoid dose, length of therapy, and individual susceptibility. Notably, any route of administration has the potential to suppress the HPA axis.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^116wJuxj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides valuable insights into the clinical presentation, severity, and management outcomes of children hospitalized with croup during the peak of the Omicron variant surge. By comparing PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases, we identified several critical differences that underscore the unique impact of the Omicron variant on pediatric croup.

The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the Omicron group, which also required more intensive treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and repeat corticosteroid doses. This observation may reflect the increased severity of symptoms in the Omicron group, as indicated by their higher need for interventions. However, due to the retrospective nature of this study, it is not possible to determine whether the longer hospital stay was influenced by government-mandated quarantine policies or solely due to symptom persistence requiring prolonged medical care. This uncertainty is acknowledged as a limitation of our study, and future prospective studies should explore the impact of quarantine advisories on hospitalization duration to better delineate this relationship.

Our findings demonstrated that children in the Omicron group were significantly younger than those in the non-Omicron group. This observation aligns with global reports suggesting that younger children, particularly those under five years old, are at higher risk of hospitalization during the Omicron wave. The Omicron variant's tropism for the upper respiratory tract may exacerbate airway inflammation in this vulnerable age group.

### Predictors of symptom rebound in critically ill patients with croup [^116JVDSG]. Hospital Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

There are no data to inform the ideal length of in-hospital observation after symptom improvement or the ideal dexamethasone dose in critically ill children with croup. We describe a cohort of critically ill children with croup who rebound (have return of symptoms after meeting hospital discharge criteria) and examine the association between the cumulative dexamethasone dose before PICU discharge and both the odds and timing of rebound.

In this single-center retrospective cohort study of subjects 6 months to 13 years of age admitted to the PICU with a primary diagnosis of croup, we employed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between cumulative pre-PICU discharge dexamethasone dose and rebound. In the model, we controlled for subject age and sex, insurance, season, and history of prematurity, croup, or intubation. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare time to rebound between subjects receiving ≤ 2 standard (0.6 mg/kg) doses and those receiving > 2 standard doses of dexamethasone before PICU discharge.

Data were analyzed over 69 months (January 2011-October 2016), and 275 unique subjects met the inclusion criteria. The median cumulative dose of dexamethasone in the hospital was 1.57 mg/kg (interquartile range 0.98–2.63). Thirty-seven percent (n = 102) of subjects developed rebound croup symptoms after meeting hospital discharge criteria. The median time to rebound was 13.1 hours (interquartile range 6.1–23.7). There was no association between cumulative pre-PICU discharge dexamethasone dose and the odds…

### Lower mortality risk associated with remdesivir + dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone for the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^117Wv1Xk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Findings from this research suggest that more effort is needed to update guidelines recommending the use of remdesivir + dexamethasone in patients requiring supplemental oxygen, according to best practice guidelines for oxygen use. There is a strong clinical rationale to avoid dexamethasone monotherapy in all levels of respiratory support, especially in those not receiving supplemental oxygen. Furthermore, these findings reinforce recent evidence from real-world data (RWD) supporting the use of antiviral treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients across all oxygen levels and highlight the need to update and clarify clinical treatment guidelines. The ambiguities in COVID-19 guidelines may, in part, lead to underutilization of antiviral treatment in situations where RWD suggests it reduces mortality risk, despite underpowered data earlier in the pandemic (e.g. patients on IMV/ECMO).

In summary, our study highlights that the addition of remdesivir to dexamethasone is associated with a significant survival benefit compared to dexamethasone without remdesivir use. This finding is observed in patients without supplemental oxygen requirements (a group for whom dexamethasone usage is contraindicated unless for a pre-existing condition or for the treatment of a non-COVID-19 condition) as well as in patients with hypoxemia across the spectrum of oxygen support requirements, for whom the addition of remdesivir further improves outcomes.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117EQMdg]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

We explored and were able to dismiss subgroup effects, with one exception: the reduction in mean time to complete resolution of pain was greater with intramuscular than with oral corticosteroids. The subgroup effect and its direction was specified a priori, the difference between subgroups was relatively large (about 21 hours), and chance seems an unlikely explanation (P < 0.001). Credibility of the effect, however, is undermined as the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies, and we found no similar difference in any other outcome. In addition, the only randomised controlled trial that compared oral and intramuscular treatment with dexamethasone reported no significant difference in any outcome.

The few serious adverse effects in the included trials occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups, although some minor adverse effects reported by patients might not always have been noted. Potential adverse effects that appear later are more likely to occur after repeated use or are rare and would not have been captured in the trials. Recent observational studies have raised the possibility of extremely rare but serious adverse effects after short courses of corticosteroids. The quality of this evidence is, for several reasons, low with respect to the question. The studies used observational designs from large databases with suboptimal verification of diagnoses; serious confounding by indication raises the possibility that the association is a result of the underlying disease process (such as acute inflammation).

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^115EYNaV]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

- **Absolute benefits and harms**: Although the evidence indicates that the treatment works on average, it did not reduce the severity of pain dramatically and failed to improve several other patient-important outcomes. The infographic explains the recommendation and provides an overview (GRADE summary of findings) of the absolute benefits and harms of corticosteroids. Estimates of baseline risk for effects come from the control arms of the trials. The infographic also leads to point-of-care formats in the MAGICapp, including consultation decision aids designed to support shared decision-making with patients.

Considering the evidence and its certainty, the panel was confident that corticosteroids increase the chance of complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours, reduce the severity of pain, and shorten the time to onset of pain relief (GRADE high to moderate quality evidence). Corticosteroids are unlikely to reduce recurrence or relapse of symptoms or days missed from school or work (GRADE moderate quality evidence). A single dose of corticosteroids is unlikely to cause serious adverse events. The randomized trials did not report any major events attributable to a single dose of corticosteroids (GRADE moderate quality evidence). The panel also considered evidence from observational studies that used higher doses of steroids. A large retrospective US cohort study of private insurance claims assessed adverse events in 327,452 adults who received an outpatient prescription of corticosteroids. There was a small absolute increase in the rate of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture.

### Budesonide offers no advantage when added to oral dexamethasone in the treatment of croup [^116iCXED]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of adding inhaled budesonide (2 mg) to oral dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) in children hospitalized with croup. The study was conducted in the observation ward of a tertiary pediatric hospital emergency department, with seventy-two children (aged 3 to 126 months) as subjects.

In this intervention, children were randomized to receive either 2 mg of nebulized budesonide or a placebo, with all children receiving a single oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone. The primary outcome measure was the duration of hospital stay. Other measures included croup scores from 0 to 12 hours, use of nebulized epinephrine, duration of croup symptoms, duration of viral symptoms, and return to medical care for croup or for any other reason following discharge from hospital.

The results indicated that the baseline characteristics for the two groups were similar. There was no difference in time to discharge between the two groups or for other outcome measures, with a risk ratio of 1.3 (95% confidence intervals of 0.82 and 2.1).

In conclusion, the addition of inhaled budesonide (2 mg) to oral dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) offers no advantage in the treatment of children hospitalized with croup.

### New horizons: Does mineralocorticoid receptor activation by cortisol cause ATP release and COVID-19 complications [^1113tYAM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

A recent meta-analysis of seven trials of corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 patients suggests that corticosteroids are effective in reducing 28-day mortality in critically ill patients. There was no evidence that high-dose corticosteroid therapy provided greater benefit than low dose. Two major trials have shown that dexamethasone benefits patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These results contrast with a meta-analysis of ten previous studies on corticosteroids for influenza pneumonia (the majority of patients on methylprednisolone), which indicated increased mortality. A meta-analysis of 14 studies from Chinese literature, focusing on patients treated with corticosteroids during the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak, found that 12 were inconclusive, and two indicated possible harm.

In the Villar et al. randomized controlled trial with dexamethasone in ARDS, the rationale was its increased potency, prolonged duration of action, and weak mineralocorticoid effect. Causes of ARDS included pneumonia, sepsis, and aspiration. They found that at 60 days, 21% of patients in the dexamethasone-treated group had died, compared to 36% in the control group. The most common adverse effect of high-dose dexamethasone (20 mg intravenously [IV] daily for 5 days, followed by 10 mg IV daily for 5 days) was hyperglycemia (76%).

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^113qrGFA]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time it takes for improvement to be achieved, along with a substantial increase in the chance of complete pain resolution at 48 hours. The panel, including patient representatives, noted that values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation.

For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who are less busy, have a higher tolerance for pain, or whose symptoms are not severe. Conversely, it could be important for those whose ability to attend school or work is compromised, caregivers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing severe pain.

The panel believes there is significant variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete pain resolution, the more likely typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value on reducing symptoms, such as those with lower pain tolerance or severe symptoms, are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the panel's concerns with acceptability, specifically regarding how acceptable it is to treat a condition that is usually self-limiting with corticosteroids.

### Prediction model for croup admission need [^111RkjhN]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This study aims to generate a predictive model to stratify the probability of requiring hospitalization and inpatient respiratory intervention for croup patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) and to compare the model's performance with that of ED providers.

Retrospective data was collected on croup patients presenting to the EDs of two pediatric and one community hospital from 2019 to 2020, including demographics, preexisting conditions, and history of croup. The ED length of stay, previous dexamethasone administration, time to ED dexamethasone, number of ED racemic epinephrine doses, viral testing, and ED revisits were also recorded. Westley croup scores were derived at ED presentation and final disposition. For admitted patients, any respiratory interventions were recorded. Admission need was defined as either admitted and required an inpatient intervention or not admitted with ED revisit. A prediction model for admission need was fit using L1-penalized logistic regression.

We included 2951 patients in the study, 68 (2.3%) of whom needed admission. The model's predictors were disposition Westley croup scores, number of ED racemic epinephrine doses, previous dexamethasone administration, and history of intubation. The model's sensitivity was 66%, specificity was 91%, positive predictive value was 15%, and negative predictive value was 99%. ED providers' performance had a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 94%, a positive predictive value of 23%, and a negative predictive value of 99%.

The croup admission prediction model presents a valuable tool, potentially augmenting clinical assessments in predicting admission needs for patients presenting with croup.

### State of the evidence for standard-of-care treatments for croup: Are we where we need to be [^113rysuv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Croup is a term that groups several different clinical syndromes with inspiratory stridor. The failure to delineate the specific syndromes has led to suboptimal treatment in many instances.
- **Methods**: A literature review and personal experience have been analyzed.
- **Results**: Specific croup syndromes have been identified. Most croup steroid-treatment studies have failed to adequately identify the specific illness being treated. With two exceptions, all studies done at the time of writing have been too small to sufficiently evaluate risks of steroids if the risk is 1% or less.
- **Conclusions**: Three conclusions were reached: (1) no steroid treatment studies of moderate or severe laryngotracheitis have been of adequate size to determine the risk of progressive viral infection or secondary bacterial infection; (2) single-dose steroid treatment or limited nebulized use is probably safe; and (3) we should encourage better clinical diagnosis of croup illnesses.

### Viral croup [^116bTUvz]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Viral croup is the most common form of airway obstruction in children six months to six years of age. The frightening nature of croup often prompts parents and caregivers to seek physician consultation. For children with mild croup, symptomatic care and mist therapy may be all that is necessary. Epinephrine has been used for decades to treat more severe cases of croup, but recent meta-analyses have found that glucocorticoid use is associated with shorter hospital stays, improvement in croup scores, and less use of epinephrine.

Studies have shown that treatment with 0.6 mg per kg of oral dexamethasone is as effective as intramuscular dexamethasone or 2 mg of nebulized budesonide. Oral dexamethasone in dosages as low as 0.15 mg per kg also may be effective. While more studies are needed to establish guidelines, oral dexamethasone can be used to treat mild to moderate croup with close follow-up and instructions for further care if needed.

### Crenessity [^115L8y2B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of CRENESSITY was assessed by the least-squares (LS) mean (SEM) percent change from baseline in the total glucocorticoid daily dose while androstenedione was controlled (≤ 120% of baseline or ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN]) after 24 weeks. The LS mean percent change from baseline in daily glucocorticoid dose was statistically significantly greater in the CRENESSITY group at -27% compared to -10% in the placebo group, as shown in Table 7.
- **Primary change from baseline**: Table 7: This table displays the primary change from baseline in glucocorticoid daily dose while maintaining androstenedione control at Week 24 in adults with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Study 1).

	- CI = confidence interval; LS mean = least-squares mean; SD = standard deviation; SEM = standard error of the mean.

	- In hydrocortisone equivalents (4x equivalency factor for (methyl)predniso(lo)ne, 60x for dexamethasone) adjusted for body surface area.

At Week 24, there was a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieving a reduction to a physiologic glucocorticoid daily dose (≤ 11 mg/m²/day hydrocortisone equivalents) while androstenedione was controlled (≤ 120% of baseline or ≤ ULN) with CRENESSITY compared to placebo (63% vs. 18%, p < 0.0001).

At Week 4, following a treatment period at a stable glucocorticoid dose regimen, the LS mean change from baseline in serum androstenedione in the CRENESSITY group was statistically significantly different at -299 ng/dL compared to the LS mean increase from baseline in the placebo group of 46 ng/dL, as shown in Table 8.

### Glucocorticoids for croup [^1151GBqa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Since the initial version of this systematic review in 1997, a number of randomized trials examining the benefit of glucocorticoids have been published, reflecting a continued interest in the use of glucocorticoids to treat patients with croup. The objective of this review was to provide evidence to guide clinicians in their treatment of patients with croup by determining the effectiveness of glucocorticoids and to identify areas of uncertainty for future research.
- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of glucocorticoids for children with croup.
- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2003), and Excerpta Medica/EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003). We also contacted authors of identified croup trials published in the last ten years to inquire about additional published or unpublished trials.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials that examine children with croup and objectively measure the effectiveness of glucocorticoid treatment.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Based on review of the title and abstract (when available), two researchers identified studies for potential relevance. The complete text was retrieved and using a priori inclusion criteria, the studies were independently reviewed for relevance by two reviewers. Two observers independently assessed quality. Differences with respect to inclusion status and quality assessment were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted using a structured form by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer.

### Potential health and economic impacts of dexamethasone treatment for patients with COVID-19 [^113xbuRR]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and is either asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms in most individuals. However, a significant number of individuals, especially among the elderly, develop a more severe form of the disease and require hospital care. A further subset of these patients requires oxygen therapy or ventilatory assistance, creating a high demand for long-term hospital care in intensive care units (ICUs).

In the UK, between 6 February and 18 April 2020, the case fatality rate among those admitted to hospital with COVID-19 was more than 26%; this increased to more than 37% in patients who required mechanical ventilation. An extensive search for potential drugs with which to treat COVID-19 is underway. Dexamethasone has emerged as a standout therapeutic candidate, reducing mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients needing oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively. Thus, the adoption of a dexamethasone treatment protocol for patients requiring respiratory support could potentially lead to a significant number of lives saved over the course of the pandemic between July and December 2020.
