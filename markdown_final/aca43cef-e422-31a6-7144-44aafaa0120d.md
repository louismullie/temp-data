## Question

Scenario:
 A 56-year-old male presented to the internist complaining of headache and fatigue.
 He smokes 1 packet of cigarette daily for the last 40 years.
 Examination revealed an arterial blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg, lower limbs oedema
and bilateral fine basal crepitations over the lung bases.
 Bedside ECG showed manifestations of old anterior myocardial infarction.
 The internist suspected pulmonary edema. But another list of DD is present. He
wondered which to use; chest X-ray or echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis.
 The patient asked whether cessation of smoking would help hem control his symptoms.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging test to choose to confirm pulmonary edema in a 56-year-old man with dyspnea, edema, and suspected heart failure, and whether smoking cessation will help his symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and pretest probability of acute decompensated heart failure. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance of chest radiography versus lung ultrasound and echocardiography. Next, I will align the choice with contemporary guidelines and the patient's hemodynamic context. After that, I need to consider practical implementation and what to do if results are discordant. Finally, I will address the smoking cessation question with evidence and counseling points, and close with a clear recommendation and rationale.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and pretest probability. A middle-aged man with a 40 pack-year smoking history, marked hypertension, bilateral leg edema, and fine basal crackles, plus ECG evidence of prior anterior MI, has a high likelihood of acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary congestion, so the pretest probability is high and the diagnostic threshold for confirming cardiogenic pulmonary edema is correspondingly lower [^0d75641a] [^11d407fc].

> Now, I should review chest radiography performance. Wait, let me verify sensitivity and specificity before concluding. High-quality meta-analytic data show CXR has pooled sensitivity around 0.73 and specificity around 0.90 for cardiogenic pulmonary edema, meaning it can miss a substantial fraction of cases, particularly early or mild edema, and its findings are relatively insensitive in acute HF presentations [^3956e55e] [^11d407fc]. Hold on, I should also confirm guideline positioning: major guidelines still recommend CXR as an initial test in suspected HF to assess heart size, pulmonary congestion, and alternative diagnoses, but they caution against relying on CXR alone to confirm or exclude HF due to limited sensitivity and specificity [^0d75641a] [^7056ffdd] [^21528c26].

> Next, I will examine lung ultrasound. I need to check pooled accuracy and likelihood ratios. Multiple meta-analyses show lung ultrasound has sensitivity around 0.88–0.94 and specificity around 0.90–0.92 for cardiogenic pulmonary edema, with positive likelihood ratios of roughly 4.8–12.4 and negative likelihood ratios around 0.06–0.19, indicating strong rule-in and rule-out performance at the bedside [^3956e55e] [^f55b1e08] [^dd8ebce3]. Let me consider mechanism and scoring: the presence of three or more B-lines in two or more bilateral intercostal spaces is diagnostic for pulmonary edema, correlates with natriuretic peptide levels, and can be performed rapidly at the point of care, which is particularly valuable in acute settings [^936f88b3] [^4143c1d0].

> I will now examine echocardiography. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should separate screening from definitive etiologic assessment. Echocardiography does not directly visualize alveolar edema, but it establishes the cardiac cause by assessing ventricular function, wall motion, diastolic filling, and hemodynamics, and it is recommended early in suspected new-onset or decompensated HF to define etiology and guide therapy, especially when the patient is unstable or the diagnosis is uncertain [^0d75641a] [^c94d6be1]. Let me reconsider: while echo can show elevated filling pressures and cardiomegaly, it won't show interstitial edema like lung ultrasound will, so I should pair echo with LUS when I need both mechanism and extravascular lung water confirmation [^936f88b3].

> But wait, what if I prioritize only one test right now? Given the high pretest probability and the need for rapid, accurate confirmation of pulmonary edema, lung ultrasound is the superior first-line test to confirm cardiogenic pulmonary edema at the bedside, whereas echocardiography should follow immediately to determine the cardiac cause, severity, and guide therapy. This sequence aligns with contemporary emergency care and HF imaging strategies that integrate LUS early and mandate early TTE in suspected HF [^c94d6be1] [^0d75641a] [^7905b732]. I should double-check that this approach also respects the evidence hierarchy: multiple high-credibility meta-analyses support LUS outperforming CXR for edema detection, while guidelines endorse early TTE for HF evaluation, which supports a dual-modality pathway rather than choosing one over the other in this scenario [^3956e55e] [^0d75641a].

> Next, I should review practical implementation and what to do if results conflict. Lung ultrasound can be performed in under five minutes at the bedside, is repeatable for serial monitoring, and is not hindered by fluid overload or obesity in the same way that CXR can be limited by patient factors and timing of edema. If LUS is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, I should proceed to TTE to evaluate for HFpEF, valvular disease, or other cardiac causes, and if both are discordant with the clinical picture, I should reassess for alternative diagnoses such as COPD exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, or noncardiogenic edema using clinical scores, biomarkers, and targeted imaging as indicated [^936f88b3] [^0d75641a] [^7eeeb390]. Hold on, I should verify that this staged approach is consistent with acute dyspnea algorithms: yes, integrating LUS and TTE with natriuretic peptides and clinical assessment is recommended to reduce diagnostic delay and misclassification in acute HF and mimics [^c94d6be1] [^0d75641a].

> I will now address smoking cessation. Let me think about the magnitude of benefit and timing. Smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular risk substantially, with risk of coronary heart disease and stroke falling by about 2–4 fold over time, and within 1–2 years the risk of coronary events declines meaningfully, with stroke risk approaching that of never-smokers by 4 years. These benefits accrue even in patients with established CVD and translate into improved dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and reduced hospitalizations [^36da51d4] [^2432c083]. I should confirm counseling and pharmacotherapy options: combining behavioral support with pharmacotherapy such as nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline increases quit rates, and clinicians should offer these at every visit given the dose–response benefit of cessation on cardiovascular outcomes [^2e9daea4].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows. First, perform bedside lung ultrasound now to confirm cardiogenic pulmonary edema given its superior sensitivity and rapid turnaround, and document bilateral B-lines to establish the presence of extravascular lung water. Second, obtain transthoracic echocardiography as soon as feasible to define the cardiac etiology, quantify ventricular function, and guide acute management. Third, use chest radiography adjunctively to screen for alternative cardiopulmonary processes and to document baseline findings, but do not rely on CXR alone to confirm or exclude pulmonary edema. Finally, initiate aggressive smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy today, as cessation will improve symptoms, reduce future cardiovascular events, and enhance the effectiveness of HF therapy [^3956e55e] [^0d75641a] [^36da51d4].

For a 56-year-old male with suspected pulmonary edema, **lung ultrasound is superior to chest X-ray** for confirming pulmonary edema, with sensitivity 88–97% and specificity 84–98% [^3956e55e] [^dd8ebce3], and it can detect interstitial edema even when the chest X-ray is normal [^936f88b3]. Echocardiography is essential to determine the **cardiac cause and guide therapy**, but it does not directly visualize alveolar edema [^0d75641a]. Use lung ultrasound first for rapid, accurate confirmation of edema, then add echocardiography to assess cardiac function and etiology [^c94d6be1].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of chest X-ray and echocardiography

### Chest X-ray

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Chest X-ray has moderate sensitivity (about 73%) and specificity (about 90%) for detecting cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^3956e55e].
- **Limitations**: CXR can miss early or mild edema, especially in obese patients or those with chronic lung disease; findings like cardiomegaly, interstitial edema, or alveolar edema are relatively insensitive in acute HF [^11d407fc].
- **Guideline role**: CXR is recommended initially to assess heart size, pulmonary congestion, and alternative diagnoses, but should not be the sole determinant of HF or edema [^0d75641a] [^11d407fc].

---

### Echocardiography

- **Role**: Echocardiography is the gold standard for assessing cardiac structure and function, identifying systolic/diastolic dysfunction, valvular disease, and elevated filling pressures that cause edema [^0d75641a] [^2d9b50c6].
- **Limitations**: It does not directly visualize alveolar edema; edema is inferred from hemodynamics and indirect signs.
- **Guideline role**: TTE is recommended early in suspected HF to define etiology, severity, and guide therapy [^0d75641a] [^c94d6be1].

## Lung ultrasound: a superior alternative

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a **point-of-care modality** that detects B-lines — vertical artifacts from increased interstitial density — and is highly sensitive and specific for pulmonary edema [^3956e55e] [^936f88b3].

| **Metric** | **Lung ultrasound** | **Chest x-ray** |
|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 88–97% | ~73% |
| Specificity | 84–98% | ~90% |
| Positive likelihood ratio | 4.8–12.4 | Lower |
| Negative likelihood ratio | 0.06–0.189 | Higher |

---

LUS **outperforms CXR** for detecting cardiogenic pulmonary edema and can reveal edema even when CXR is normal [^3956e55e] [^936f88b3]. It is fast, repeatable, and radiation-free, making it ideal at the bedside [^4143c1d0].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus support a **stepwise approach**: use LUS first to confirm pulmonary edema, then add echocardiography to determine the cardiac cause and guide therapy [^c94d6be1] [^0d75641a]. LUS is particularly valuable in acute settings where rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical [^c94d6be1] [^7905b732].

---

## Practical clinical approach

Given the patient's presentation, the **recommended approach** is:

- **Step 1**: Perform lung ultrasound at the bedside to confirm pulmonary edema with bilateral B-lines [^3956e55e] [^936f88b3].
- **Step 2**: If LUS confirms edema, proceed to transthoracic echocardiography to assess cardiac function, valves, and filling pressures to identify the cause and guide therapy [^0d75641a] [^c94d6be1].
- **Step 3**: Use chest X-ray adjunctively to evaluate alternative diagnoses or complications, but do not rely on it to confirm edema [^0d75641a] [^11d407fc].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Lung ultrasound is the **preferred first-line test** to confirm pulmonary edema because of its superior sensitivity and specificity compared with chest X-ray [^3956e55e]. Echocardiography should follow to define the cardiac cause and direct management [^0d75641a]. This strategy ensures rapid, accurate diagnosis and timely, targeted therapy.

Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and complex clinical syndrome with no single reference standard diagnostic test. Imaging has a supportive role in patients with suspected and known HF, including initial imaging assessment of an adult with suspected HF, but without history of HF, including evaluation of pulmonary edema and detection of left ventricular dysfunction (Variant 1). In adults with established diagnosis of HF but unknown etiology, imaging also has an important role in the assessment of the underlying disease process, including ischemic and nonischemic etiologies (Variant 2). In the course of continuing care for adult patients with an established diagnosis of HF without new symptoms, follow-up imaging is performed to assess for longitudinal changes in ventricular function, response to therapy and prognostication (Variant 3).

### Health effects of cigarettes: cardiovascular disease… [^36da51d4]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease overview Cardiovascular diseases are diseases of the heart and blood vessels. CVDs include heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.
- Chest pain
- Heart attack
- Heart failure
- Arrhythmia. Peripheral artery disease is the narrowing or blocking of peripheral arteries. These arteries carry blood from the heart to other parts of the body. Similar to CHD, plaque in the arteries can cause this narrowing or blockage. PAD most commonly affects the legs and lower body. But it can also occur in the arms and upper body. Symptoms of PAD can include:

- Muscle pain during physical activity, like walking, that quickly gets better after resting.
- Feelings of weakness or numbness in the legs that make it feel harder to walk.
- Having one arm or leg feel colder than the other. Smoking and cardiovascular disease Smoking is a major cause of CVD, causing one in every four deaths from CVD. Smoking can:

- Raise triglycerides
- Lower "good" cholesterol
- Make blood sticky and more likely to clot, which can block blood flow to the heart and brain
- Damage cells that line the blood vessels
- Increase the buildup of plaque in blood vessels
- Cause thickening and narrowing of blood vessels. Smoking increases the risk of many CVDs including:

- Atherosclerosis
- Coronary heart disease, including heart attack and sudden cardiac death
- Stroke
- Peripheral arterial disease
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm Estimates show that smoking increases the risk for coronary heart disease by 2 to 4 times and for stroke by 2 to 4 times compared to not smoking.

Even people who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day can have early signs of cardiovascular disease.
- Secondhand smoke increases the risk for stroke by 20%−30%.
- Breathing secondhand smoke, even for a short time, can damage blood vessels and cause blood to become stickier. These changes can increase the risk of having a heart attack.
- Reduces the risk of stroke
- Reduces the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm *.

Acute pulmonary embolism — reducing repeat CT use in those with prior scans: Physicians, hospitals, and emergency departments (EDs) should develop diagnostic and treatment pathways for patients with a history of multiple CTs for PE, and at least 1 study has demonstrated that patients evaluated for PE by using CT had a significant probability of having another CT performed for PE within 5 years; in fact, 5% of the patients in this study had 5 or more CTs for PE. Preventing this frequent use of repeated CT requires thoughtful planning, clinicians should educate these patients about the risk of radiation from multiple CTs, and an individualized approach to testing is reasonable, including lower-extremity venous ultrasonography or V/Q scanning when appropriate (although V/Q scanning may not be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema).

### Patient satisfaction with coronary CT angiography versus invasive coronary angiography: results of a single-center randomized trial [^a12b29e6]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This prospective randomized study and the study protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00844220) were approved by the Charité ethics board and authorized by the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection. The funder of the study, the German Research Foundation, was not involved in any stage of the study design, data acquisition, data analysis, or manuscript preparation. The study's principal investigator (M.D.) had full control of the data.

Study design

This study is a prespecified secondary analysis of the CAD-Man trial and is included in the published study protocol. To be eligible for the study and randomization to coronary CT or ICA, patients needed to have suspected CAD and a clinical indication for ICA. In addition, patients had to have a maximum of two of the three criteria for typical angina pectoris (retrosternal chest discomfort, precipitation by exertion, and prompt relief within 30 s to 10 min by rest or nitroglycerine). The following exclusion criteria were used for the trial: two or more positive tests indicating ischemia, no sinus rhythm, signs of myocardial infarction (persistent ST segment elevation, creatine phosphokinase-MB > 24 U/L, or pulmonary edema due to ischemia), refusal or were incapability of providing informed consent, inability to hold the breath for 5 s, younger than 30 years, or history of or receiving dialysis. The coronary CT procedure included both a non-contrast coronary artery calcium acquisition and a post-contrast CT angiography. No patients had prior coronary CT or ICA. After study enrollment and provision of informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to initial evaluation with either CT or ICA as previously described. If CT was positive for CAD on non-invasive angiographic assessment, patients were then recommended to undergo ICA to confirm the diagnosis before initiation of treatment. Explanations about the imaging tests to the patients prior to their performance were provided by clinical staff. Images were shown during the ICA using on-site monitors by the interventional cardiologists in charge and after the CT procedure using workstations by the radiologists in charge using curved multiplanar reformations and three-dimensional renderings (Fig. 1).

### Diagnosis: pulmonary hypertension. next steps [^0228960a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease that is generally first encountered by primary care physicians. Usually, patients present with dyspnea on exertion and a loss of exercise tolerance, although they can have symptoms of chest discomfort, syncope, or edema. Most patients are diagnosed with 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography although echo is not 100% sensitive or specific in making this diagnosis. Note that the diagnostic criteria for this disease have changed recently. Most patients develop PH secondary to left heart failure, or to pulmonary disease with or without hypoxemia. Ultimately, many patients require right heart catheterization for diagnosis and for proper treatment. This is best performed by those that specialize in management of this disease. It is important to diagnose patients who have PH due to pulmonary artery hypertension and patients with chronic thromboembolic PH as these patients require specialized treatment that is most effective if started early in the disease course. This review discusses issues related to diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with PH.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care lung ultrasonography and chest radiography in adults with symptoms suggestive of acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3956e55e]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Standard tools used to diagnose pulmonary edema in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), including chest radiography (CXR), lack adequate sensitivity, which may delay appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Point-of-care lung ultrasonography (LUS) may be more accurate than CXR, but no meta-analysis of studies directly comparing the 2 tools was previously available.

Objective

To compare the accuracy of LUS with the accuracy of CXR in the diagnosis of cardiogenic pulmonary edema in adult patients presenting with dyspnea.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases and the gray literature was performed in May 2018. No language or year limits were applied.

Study Selection

Study inclusion criteria were a prospective adult cohort of patients presenting to any clinical setting with dyspnea who underwent both LUS and CXR on initial assessment with imaging results compared with a reference standard ADHF diagnosis by a clinical expert after either a medical record review or a combination of echocardiography findings and brain-type natriuretic peptide criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion criteria, and disagreements were resolved with discussion.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Reporting adhered to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using a customized QUADAS-2 tool. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of LUS and CXR were determined using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic approach.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The comparative accuracy of LUS and CXR in diagnosing ADHF as measured by the differences between the 2 modalities in pooled sensitivity and specificity.

Results

The literature search yielded 1377 nonduplicate titles that were screened, of which 43 articles (3.1%) underwent full-text review. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, representing a total of 1827 patients. Pooled estimates for LUS were 0.88 (95% Cl, 0.75–0.95) for sensitivity and 0.90 (95% Cl, 0.88–0.92) for specificity. Pooled estimates for CXR were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.70–0.76) for sensitivity and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.75–0.97) for specificity. The relative sensitivity ratio of LUS, compared with CXR, was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.08–1.34; P < .001), but no difference was found in specificity between tests (relative specificity ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.90–1.11; P = 0.96).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that LUS is more sensitive than CXR in detecting pulmonary edema in ADHF; LUS should be considered as an adjunct imaging modality in the evaluation of patients with dyspnea at risk of ADHF.

### An uncommon cause of dyspnea in the emergency department [^92eb92f1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain and shortness of breath are chief complaints frequently evaluated in the emergency department. ACS, pulmonary embolism, and disorders involving the lung parenchyma are some of the disease processes commonly screened for. Occasionally, patients presenting with histories and clinical exams consistent with these common illnesses may end up having more rare pathology. We present the case of a young patient who presented with chest pain and dyspnea with ECG changes and history concerning for pulmonary embolism who was ultimately diagnosed with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension. The importance of a prompt diagnosis of this condition along with emergency department management of complications related to the disease is discussed in this report.

Cardiovascular Morbidities

Cardiovascular morbidities are frequently present in patients experiencing ECOPDs, and thus a patient history is important to assess their presence or impact. Chest pain/discomfort, fluid retention, or irregular pulse suggest a cardiovascular cause as an alternative or contributing diagnosis to an ECOPD.

Acute HF

Acute HF is defined by worsening of dyspnea at rest (particularly while supine) or during exertion and/or fatigue, together with signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion, increased jugular vein distension, or ankle swelling, with objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart. Some of these clinical findings can make distinguishing ECOPD from acute HF difficult. In addition, COPD is present in up to 50% of patients with HF, and HF occurs in roughly 20% of individuals with COPD because of overlapping risk factors (aging and smoking) and underlying mechanisms (systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and muscular atrophy). Furthermore, an HF diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in patients with preserved ejection fraction, which is common in patients with COPD. Hypoxemia and tachycardia in ECOPD can promote decompensation in HF, whereas pulmonary fluid retention in HF can worsen airway obstruction. In addition, wheezing is common in acute HF (approximately 30%), whereas COPD can mask the presence of basilar crackles. However, their presence, coupled with evidence of leg edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a third heart sound increases the likelihood of HF being the cause of, or a contributor to, the acute event.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

General indications for imaging in constrictive pericarditis (CP) emphasize that "The suspicion for CP is based on clinical history and examination, which require subsequent evaluation and confirmation by imaging and hemodynamic data," and that referrals often stem from "heart failure, shortness of breath, evaluation of cardiac function, and peripheral edema." In unsuspected cases, "abnormal ventricular septal motion and/or increased pericardial thickness suggests the possibility of CP, which can be confirmed by diagnostic hemodynamic features." In suspected constriction, imaging focuses on "pericardial thickness, interventricular dependence, other associated abnormalities (valvular, myocardial, or coronary artery disease), and evidence of alternative pathologies, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, RV dysfunction, or severe tricuspid regurgitation." Echocardiography "remains the initial imaging test, and can provide a definite diagnosis of CP for most patients," but when findings are equivocal, "additional imaging testing (CT or CMR) is needed to make the diagnosis with more confidence," and "hemodynamic cardiac catheterization may be necessary to establish the diagnosis." Even if CP is certain after echocardiography, "other imaging tests are often necessary to evaluate pericardial inflammation, coexisting myocardial disease, or comprehensive pericardial as well as cardiovascular anatomy for subsequent management decisions."

AHF: a diagnostic and management challenge

AHF is a syndrome rather than a diagnosis per se, caused by a wide array of pathologies that result in a spectrum of disease severity ranging from breathlessness to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. AHF is a highly lethal condition, and studies have shown that minimizing the 'time to appropriate therapy' — the initiation of treatment as soon as possible, including in the prehospital setting — is potentially beneficial in improving outcomes. AHF is variably defined as the rapid onset or acute worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure that is associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. However, substantial diagnostic uncertainty is inevitable when relying only on traditional clinical findings, and currently a lack of specificity exists in routine investigations for this condition. Indeed, although patients often present with a suggestive history, clinical features (such as shock, and pulmonary or peripheral congestion), and/or symptoms related to the underlying potential cause, these traditional clinical features are frequently absent; over-reliance on these factors might delay diagnosis and implementation of appropriate therapy, or contribute to a missed diagnosis in up to 20% of patients. Furthermore, patients' clinical features might vary according to the site of initial medical contact and the management strategies employed.

The majority of patients with AHF present to emergency departments; however, many patient are also assessed and managed in other acute care settings such as in intensive care and inpatient cardiology units. Patients with AHF usually present with symptoms of congestion and breathlessness rather than cardiac arrest or shock. Symptoms of breathlessness account for 3–5% of emergency department attendances in Europe and the USA, and the major causes of breathlessness and their prevalence include AHF (50%), pneumonia or bronchitis (20%), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (20%), and pulmonary embolism (5–10%). Current guidelines recommend that clinical examination and investigations should be integrated to form the diagnosis, including the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiograph, and biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides, troponin, and D-dimer as indicated. Unfortunately, these data can be challenging to interpret, in particular in the 10–15% of patients in whom two concomitant diagnoses exist. Specifically, although included in the current definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic peptides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other acute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and anaemia –.

### What cardiovascular… [^2432c083]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Does Smoking Contribute to Heart Disease. Yes, smoking cigarettes can harm nearly any part of your body, including your heart and blood vessels. When breathed in, the toxic mix of more than 7, 000 chemicals 1 in cigarette smoke can interfere with important processes in your body that keep it functioning normally. One of these processes is the delivery of oxygen-rich blood to your heart and the rest of your body. What Cardiovascular Conditions Can Result from Smoking. Smoking cigarettes can permanently damage your heart and blood vessels. This can lead to cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease refers to multiple conditions affecting the heart and/or blood vessels. 3 Some of these conditions include:

- Coronary heart disease, or the narrowing of blood vessels carrying blood to the heart.
- Hypertension.
- Heart attack.
- Stroke.
- Aneurysms.
- Peripheral artery disease.

1, 2 Smoking cigarettes can also cause CVD by changing your blood chemistry. 1, 2 These changes in blood chemistry can cause plaque — a waxy substance comprised of cholesterol, scar tissue, calcium, fat, and other material 3 — to build up in your arteries, the major blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body. This plaque buildup can lead to a disease called atherosclerosis. When the chemicals in cigarette smoke cause atherosclerosis and thickened blood in the arteries, it becomes more difficult for blood cells to move through arteries and other blood vessels to get to vital organs like the heart and brain. 4 This can create blood clots and ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke, even death. 1, 2. Other rare but serious cardiovascular conditions that can be caused by smoking include: Peripheral artery disease: A condition in which the narrowing of blood vessels results in insufficient blood flow to arms, legs, hands, and feet.

Smoking is the leading preventable cause of this condition, which can result in amputation. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: A bulge that is formed in an area of the aorta — the main artery that distributes blood through the body — that sits in the abdomen. 8
- Just 12 hours after quitting smoking, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal, allowing more oxygen to vital organs like your heart. 8
- Within four years of quitting, your risk of stroke drops to that of lifetime nonsmokers. 9.

### Diagnosis of acute heart failure in CT pulmonary angiography: feasibility and accuracy [^291367bd]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (HF) is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome being associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, with reported 1-year mortality rates reaching 10 to 30%. HF is characterized by typical symptoms and signs including dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality reducing cardiac output and/or increasing intracardiac pressures. Acute HF is defined as new or worsening of symptoms and signs of HF representing the most frequent cause of unplanned hospital admission in patients over 65 years of age.

Pulmonary embolism is another life-threatening condition and the third leading cause of cardiovascular-related death with an all-cause 30-day mortality rate of 5% in treated patients. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism remains challenging due to often non-specific clinical signs and symptoms, of which the most common is dyspnea. Some authors therefore suggested that pulmonary embolism should be suspected in all patients presenting to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea, chest pain, or sustained hypotension and no obvious alternate cause. Because of the overlap of the main symptoms of HF and pulmonary embolism, the distinction of these two entities may be hampered in the emergency setting.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), owing to its high sensitivity and specificity as well as wide availability, represents the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis or exclusion of pulmonary embolism. The scan initiation of CTPA is usually performed with the bolus tracking technique which enables an individualized optimization of the scan start in relation to the contrast arrival in the pulmonary artery circulation. Still, there are numerous factors affecting the timing of contrast enhancement in CTPA which are not being taken into account entirely with bolus tracking. One of the most relevant patient-related factors is the cardiac output which determines the time of contrast arrival and the time to peak attenuation of the contrast bolus. For example, in patients with reduced cardiac output, the time to reach the attenuation threshold for starting the scan is delayed, similar to the time to peak attenuation which may not be covered optimally with a fixed post-trigger delay as it is standard for bolus tracking.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of diagnosing HF using attenuation measurements in the right and left ventricles (RV and LV) in patients with negative CTPA for pulmonary embolism. Our hypothesis was that a high contrast attenuation in the right heart on CTPA examinations may indicate acute HF owing to the reduced cardiac function.

### Appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^732541ea]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for POCUS in acute dyspnea — applicability, exclusions, device scope, training, and diagnostic uncertainty: The included studies enrolled adult patients presenting in EDs and inpatient settings with dyspnea as a primary symptom (unspecified acute dyspnea) and who were later confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest (congestive heart failure [including pulmonary edema], pleural effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax). The systematic review excluded studies that included patients with other medical conditions that can cause dyspnea (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute coronary symptoms, and trauma) if the patients were not also confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest. This recommendation does not apply to handheld devices; evidence from 1 high risk of bias study is very uncertain (insufficient) about the effect of handheld POCUS devices in addition to the standard pathway on health, diagnostic, and treatment outcomes. Clinicians who use POCUS should be trained in the use and interpretation of findings and ongoing care quality assessment. As with any diagnostic test, this recommendation applies to clinical scenarios where there is diagnostic uncertainty, and clinicians should understand and consider that the test accuracy of POCUS varies according to the likelihood of underlying diseases. Figure 2 shows that, using the prevalence estimates of various conditions reported in the studies, the rate of false-positive test results for pneumonia and pulmonary embolism may be higher than what many clinicians and patients are comfortable with, and clinicians can also review Figure 2 and consider that the severity of consequences of false-negative or false-positive test results may differ according to disease.

### Is the mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary oedema in a heart-lung interaction? [^65ce8d55]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Congestive heart failure — echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis, enabled to estimate elevated heart filling pressures with further impact on therapy. The ultrasound examination also helped diagnose and quantify a large fluidothorax with an implication for a safe drainage.
Acute myocardial infarction — excluded by repeatedly negative cardiac biochemistry (troponin I and CK-MB mass) taken in a patient with a non-diagnostic 12-lead ECG due to VVI pacing and not changing regional wall motion abnormalities seen on echocardiography.
Pulmonary embolism — the patient showed a dilated RV with preserved contractility throughout this episode, without any signs of acute cor pulmonale or changes in the elimination of CO 2. After the drainage of pleural fluid which was performed on systemic anticoagulation, the mild increase of pulmonary artery pressure could be ascribed to the parallel increase of LAP, that is, presence of postcapillary pulmonary hypertension in heart failure. This deterioration after drainage was reversed swiftly with improvement of the LV function on dobutamine. All of this renders a possible diagnosis of a significant pulmonary embolism very unlikely as a cause of his transient deterioration.
Respiratory insufficiency due to tracheobronchitis or pneumonia — diagnosed with the help of positive inflammatory markers and clinical signs of increased bronchial secretions. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of tracheobronchitis and excluded atelectasis.
Pneumothorax — excluded predrainage and postdrainage by the presence of pleural sliding, B lines and a lung pulse. A large pneumothorax was also excluded by the chest X-ray taken after admission to the ICU and again after pleural drainage.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the principal means of evaluating dyspnea in the emergency department. As its use has increased, the number of studies positive for pulmonary embolism (PE) has decreased to less than 20%. Many of the negative PE studies provide an alternative explanation for dyspnea, most commonly pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or atelectasis. Nonthrombotic emboli may also be suggested. Airway and obstructive lung disease may be detected on CTPA. Pleural and pericardial disease may also explain the dyspnea, but more detailed evaluation of the serosal surfaces may be limited on the arterial phase of a CTPA.

Interstitial fluid and pulmonary oedema

Quantification of B-lines (vertical artefacts that result from an increase in interstitial density; FIG. 1b) has been shown to be useful for the diagnosis, monitoring, and risk assessment of patients with known or suspected AHF –. Either curvilinear or phased array transducers can be used, typically at an imaging depth of 18 cm. Although the assessment of eight or more anterior and lateral thoracic zones (four on each hemithorax) has been recommended in a consensus statement, a subsequent study demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with examination of only six thoracic regions. The visualization of three or more B-lines in two or more intercostal spaces bilaterally should be considered diagnostic for pulmonary oedema, with sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 81–98%) and specificity of 92% (95% CI 84–96%). By contrast, physical examination and chest radiography have a sensitivity of only 62% (95% CI 61–64%) and 57% (95% CI 55–59%), and a specificity of 68% (95% CI 67–69%) and 89% (95% CI 88–90%) for a diagnosis of pulmonary oedema, respectively. The presence of multiple bilateral B-lines in AHF has been well-correlated with natriuretic peptide levels, and only variably correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and measures of extravascular lung water. Given that studies to assess the incremental diagnostic value of LUS compared with natriuretic peptides for the identification of AHF in patients with dyspnoea reported variable results in different cohorts, this topic warrants further investigation. The number of B-lines is thought to decrease with treatment for AHF and, therefore, this technique is potentially useful in the monitoring of pulmonary oedema in response to therapy. For serial assessments, patient positioning (sitting versus supine) should be kept consistent. Importantly, a higher number of B-lines on LUS at the time of discharge from hospital might help to identify patients with heart failure who have a worse prognosis.

Pleural effusion

Similarly to B-lines, the presence of pleural effusions can be assessed using curvilinear or phased array transducers in the posterior–axillary line(FIG. 1d). Current data regarding the diagnostic utility of pleural effusions identified on ultrasonography in patients with AHF are less robust, but have been reported with sensitivities of 79–84% and specificities of 83–98% in small studies of patients with dyspnoea.

### Smoking cessation interventions… [^2e9daea4]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Common adverse effects of NRT include headache, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and sleep disturbance. NRT dependence is uncommon and outweighed by the overall benefits of smoking cessation. 5 Side effect profiles by type of NRT are detailed in Table 3. 8, 14, 15 Some NRTs are available over the counter, and some are prescription only. BUPROPION SUSTAINED-RELEASE Bupropion was the first non–nicotine-based pharmacotherapy approved for smoking cessation. Initially designed and marketed as an antidepressant, bupropion acts by weakly inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and partially blocking nicotine receptors, which reduce nicotine cravings. Common adverse effects of e-cigarettes include throat irritation, coughing, nausea, and sleep disruption; adverse effects and serious adverse events do not differ between nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarettes.

43 In 2019, an outbreak of lung injury associated with vaping emerged, with chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms, fever, and chills. These lung injuries were likely caused by vitamin E acetate and other additives, mostly found in e-cigarettes containing tetrahydrocannabinol. Since 2019, cases of vaping-associated lung injury have significantly declined secondary to increased public awareness and the removal of vitamin E acetate from most products.
46. 6, 47 Repeat screening may be useful, with recent studies showing a significant discordance between reported smoking and biomarkers to assess smoking. 48 Smoking increases rates of ectopic pregnancy, low birth weight, preterm birth, miscarriage, placental abruption, and orofacial clefts. 2, 49 Smoking cessation during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy reduces the risk of low-birth-weight infants to that of never smokers.

47 Pregnant people with fewer resources, lower education levels, and no support at home are least likely to quit smoking, suggesting that more resources are needed to help pregnant patients succeed.
50. MENTAL HEALTH Patients with mental health disorders are twice as likely to smoke. The more severe the psychiatric diagnosis, the higher the prevalence of smoking. Moreover, smokers with mental illness smoke more heavily than other smokers.
9. Lung Cancer Screening The USPSTF recommends annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography for adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^669e5b28]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing, Risk Factors, and Extrapulmonary Factors

The committee agreed that the current time frame for the diagnosis of ARDS should be retained: acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as occurring within 1 week of the onset of the predisposing risk factor or within 1 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Prolonging the time to onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure was considered, as protracted symptoms may precede progression to frank respiratory failure, as in the case of COVID-19; however, expanding the definition to include HFNO (detailed below) should allow earlier diagnosis, so the time frame of 1 week for acute onset of respiratory failure was maintained. The acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema should not be exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload, atelectasis or lung collapse, pleural effusion, or pulmonary embolism. ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions if a predisposing risk factor for ARDS is also present, and the clinician believes that these other conditions (e.g. fluid overload, atelectasis) are unlikely to be the primary causes of the hypoxemia. ARDS also can be diagnosed in the presence of chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension, providing that acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not primarily attributable to these underlying conditions. Further rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E2 and Tables E1 and E2.

Chest Imaging

The committee agreed that chest imaging criteria should include bilateral radiologic (chest radiography or computed tomography) or ultrasound findings suggestive of loss of lung aeration that are not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses. Although the identification of bilateral opacities by chest radiography has poor interrater reliability, chest radiography is the most common imaging modality in critically ill patients, which contributed to the recommendation to retain it in the definition despite its limitations. In addition, the committee recommended that ultrasound be accepted as a modality for identifying signs of loss of lung aeration consistent with (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or lung consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available. There is evidence that ultrasound can be reliable if the operator is trained to detect bilateral consolidations and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, an approach that should have value, especially in resource-limited areas. Further discussion of the rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E3.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary infarction – A retrospective review [^cc4979aa]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary infarction is an infrequent complication of pulmonary embolism. Traditionally, it has been regarded as a sign of worse outcome because ischemia can only occur by the simultaneous failure of all oxygenation sources to the area of infarct, but supporting evidence is limited.

Methods

We identified 74 cases of pulmonary infarction over 5 years at a single academic center via review of radiographic reports. Contrast-enhanced chest CT scans were examined to confirm evidence of pulmonary infarction, and patient clinical characteristics and imaging results were studied.

Results

Survival to discharge was high (97%). Patients most commonly presented with dyspnea (69%), chest pain (46%), and swelling or pain in the lower extremities (31%), while underlying risk factors included history of malignancy (41%) and surgery within 30 days (24%). Many patients had concurrent cardiovascular (59%) and pulmonary disease (22%). Infarction disproportionately affected the lower lobes.

Conclusions

Survival after diagnosis of pulmonary infarction is comparable to uncomplicated pulmonary embolism, suggesting that outcome is not worse. While emboli occurred in multiple lobar sites, pulmonary infarction occurred most commonly in the lower lobes, suggesting unique underlying physiological mechanisms in pulmonary infarction development.

### Critical care ultrasonography in acute respiratory failure [^6acced03]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) is a frequent cause of ARF. Although congestive heart failure remains commonly encountered in this clinical setting, CPE is increasingly attributed to heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (EF). Since CPE develops secondary to pulmonary venous congestion, its diagnosis relies on the identification of elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures, irrespective of systolic function. Accordingly, patients with LV diastolic dysfunction are at risk of developing CPE. CCE is ideally suited to identify a causative cardiomyopathy while chest ultrasonography depicts lung and pleural consequences of fluid overload.

### Chest CT diagnosis and clinical management of drug-related pneumonitis in patients receiving molecular targeting agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors: a position paper from the Fleischner society [^e5a203cf]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Clinical features of drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) — Incidence was estimated at 1.2 per 100,000 per year with a prevalence of 2.6 per 100,000, and DRP accounts for 2.5% to 5% of prevalent cases of interstitial lung disease; cancer drugs (eg, bleomycin) are the most common cause, followed by drugs for autoimmune diseases (eg, methotrexate), amiodarone, and antibiotics (eg, nitrofurantoin). The onset may be acute, insidious, and sometimes delayed with a long latent period (eg, beyond 10 years in some cases of carmustine-induced pulmonary fibrosis) following completion of drug treatment, and symptoms are generally nonspecific, including dyspnea, cough, malaise, and low-grade fever, though some patients may be asymptomatic even in the presence of diffuse pulmonary opacities and lung auscultation often reveals crackles but may be normal. It is difficult to clinically distinguish DRP from infections, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, radiation-induced pneumonitis, and metastases, and evaluation for cardiovascular etiologies including heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary venoclusive disease, and other forms of pulmonary hypertension needs to be considered. The clinical suspicion for DRP arises from the temporal relationship between drug exposure and the onset of clinical presentation, and in most patients the diagnosis is unlikely to be made with certainty even after extensive clinical evaluation, including lung biopsy. The increasing use of molecular targeting agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has broadened the spectrum of lung toxicity encountered clinically, exemplified by immune-related adverse effects in patients treated with ICIs that include pneumonitis and are thought to result from general immunologic activation, including autoimmune response.

### Imaging in patients with suspected acute heart failure: timeline approach position statement on behalf of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^c94d6be1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure is one of the main diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in clinical practice due to a non-specific clinical manifestation and the urgent need for timely and tailored management at the same time. In this position statement, the Heart Failure Association aims to systematize the use of various imaging methods in accordance with the timeline of acute heart failure care proposed in the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. During the first hours of admission the point-of-care focused cardiac and lung ultrasound examination is an invaluable tool for rapid differential diagnosis of acute dyspnoea, which is highly feasible and relatively easy to learn. Several portable and stationary imaging modalities are being increasingly used for the evaluation of cardiac structure and function, haemodynamic and volume status, precipitating myocardial ischaemia or valvular abnormalities, and systemic and pulmonary congestion. This paper emphasizes the central role of the full echocardiographic examination in the identification of heart failure aetiology, severity of cardiac dysfunction, indications for specific heart failure therapy, and risk stratification. Correct evaluation of cardiac filling pressures and accurate prognostication may help to prevent unscheduled short-term readmission. Alternative advanced imaging modalities should be considered to assist patient management in the pre- and post-discharge phase, including cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, nuclear studies, and coronary angiography. The Heart Failure Association addresses this paper to the wide spectrum of acute care and heart failure specialists, highlighting the value of all available imaging techniques at specific stages and in common clinical scenarios of acute heart failure.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^ccea2c17]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A chest X-ray can help distinguish an ECOPD from acute HF, with cardiomegaly supporting structural heart damage and HF likely present if there is pulmonary edema. The best laboratory markers of HF are elevation of natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), with thresholds supportive of acute HF, consistent with European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on HF, shown in Figure 3. Importantly, natriuretic peptides are commonly elevated in patients with stable COPD or pneumonia and increase further in patients with ECOPD even without acute HF. As such, higher thresholds are needed to accurately diagnose concomitant acute HF and ECOPD. More informative is the presence of low peptide concentrations, which have excellent negative predictive value for acute HF, even in patients with an ECOPD. Patients with elevated natriuretic peptides during an ECOPD have a worse prognosis, including a risk of death. Finally, point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate ECOPD from acute HF, although more research is required to establish their impact on health outcome benefits. A diagnostic algorithm to evaluate a patient with suspected acute HF is shown in Figure 3.

Algorithm reflecting the clinical features of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with increased respiratory symptoms and suspected acute heart failure. Recommendations are on the basis of the most recent European and American Guidelines on heart failure. *The thresholds for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and BNP are intended for the diagnosis of acute heart failure (HF) and may need correction with age. Thresholds for new onset stable HF are much lower (i.e. NT-proBNP > 125 pg/ml and BNP > 35 pg/ml) and should be used outside the context of an exacerbation of COPD. Note that the presence of COPD may raise these values. Please see text for further details.

### Multimodality imaging in evaluation of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19: JACC scientific expert panel [^4bcd4c72]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Standard evaluation and management of the patient with suspected or proven cardiovascular complications of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome related-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is challenging. Routine history, physical examination, laboratory testing, electrocardiography, and plain x-ray imaging may often suffice for such patients, but given overlap between COVID-19 and typical cardiovascular diagnoses such as heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, need frequently arises for advanced imaging techniques to assist in differential diagnosis and management. This document provides guidance in several common scenarios among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection and possible cardiovascular involvement, including chest discomfort with electrocardiographic changes, acute hemodynamic instability, newly recognized left ventricular dysfunction, as well as imaging during the subacute/chronic phase of COVID-19. For each, the authors consider the role of biomarker testing to guide imaging decision-making, provide differential diagnostic considerations, and offer general suggestions regarding application of various advanced imaging techniques.

Lung imaging in COVID-19 — ultrasound, chest x-ray, and computed tomography findings and limitations: Lung ultrasound has emerged as a rapid, reliable, point-of-care imaging modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly in the setting of significant limitations in current radiographic imaging technologies. Ground-glass opacification, linear opacities, and consolidation are the major chest x-ray (CXR) findings in patients with COVID-19; however, these findings are not specific, and a large proportion of patients with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed disease will have a normal CXR, particularly in the early stages of disease. Chest computed tomography (CT) has also played a central role in the early diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19, with initial findings that include bilateral multilobe ground-glass opacification with a peripheral or posterior distribution, but because the CT findings in COVID-19 infection can overlap with other diseases including influenza, organizing pneumonia, and pulmonary edema, it is not recommended as a sole diagnostic technique. Normal ultrasound evaluation of the lungs demonstrates smooth, regular, contiguous pleural lines, the presence of lung sliding, and A-line artifacts that occur at multiples of the distance between the transducer and the pleural line.

### Combination of lung ultrasound (a comet-tail sign) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in differentiating acute heart failure from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as cause of acute dyspnea in prehospital emergency setting [^5c853ec4]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Diagnosis of severe, acute dyspnea in the prehospital arena and/or the emergency department can be challenging, but lung ultrasound is proving to be an accurate new diagnostic tool by itself or in combination with other diagnostic modalities.

- Pulmonary edema gives specific, diffusely vertical artefact line (B lines and comet-tail signs) patterns on ultrasound, unlike the results found in patients with obstructive diseases or pulmonary emboli (generally A lines in both cases).

- The question remains how well specific patterns of diffuse B lines on ultrasound scans correlate with levels of NT-pro-BNP and how they help in making the correct diagnosis.

- In our study, the combination of ultrasound examination and NT-proBNP had 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% NPV and 100% PPV for differentiating heart failure as the cause of acute dyspnea compared to pulmonary causes in the prehospital setting.

- Both ultrasound examinations and NT-pro-BNP point-of-care assays are quick, accurate and feasible, with high diagnostic accuracy, in the prehospital arena.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^0d75641a]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — evaluation with cardiac imaging states that in patients with suspected or new-onset heart failure (HF) or acute decompensated HF, a chest x-ray should be performed to assess heart size, pulmonary congestion, and alternative causes, and in patients with suspected or newly diagnosed HF, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed during initial evaluation to assess cardiac structure and function. In patients with HF who have had a significant clinical change or who have received guideline-directed medical therapy and are being considered for invasive procedures or device therapy, repeat measurement of ejection fraction (EF), degree of structural remodeling, and valvular function are useful to inform therapeutic interventions. If echocardiography is inadequate, alternative imaging such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), cardiac computed tomography (CT), or radionuclide imaging is recommended for assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In patients with HF or cardiomyopathy, CMR can be useful for diagnosis or management, and in patients with HF, an evaluation for possible ischemic heart disease can be useful to identify the cause and guide management. In patients with HF and coronary artery disease who are candidates for coronary revascularization, noninvasive stress imaging (stress echocardiography, single-photon emission CT [SPECT], CMR, or positron emission tomography [PET]) may be considered for detection of myocardial ischemia to help guide coronary revascularization. In patients with HF without clinical status change, treatment interventions likely to affect cardiac function, or candidacy for invasive procedures or device therapy, routine repeat assessment of left ventricular (LV) function is not indicated.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^57933209]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

LV ejection fraction has been the main parameter used for the diagnosis, treatment, and stratification of patients with heart failure. However, this parameter has several limitations that are particularly relevant in the acute setting, such as load-dependency and inotropydependency. Even in the absence of high-quality 2D images, Doppler abnormalities in transmitral filling might provide an early indicator of important pathology.

Unlike LUS, echocardiography might be challenging to perform well and interpret accurately, as a number of considerations add to the complexity of its application in the acute setting. First, in all parameters described for LAP estimation, the confounding factors imposed by critical illness (changes in heart rate, cardiac output, LV compliance, and volume and ventilatory status) have not been fully evaluated. Second, not only might patients with a relatively normal LAP have radiographic and sonographic evidence of pulmonary oedema, but conversely, patients with chronically elevated LAP might have no evidence of pulmonary oedema. Similarly to LUS, however, the echocardiographic findings should be integrated with those from clinical examination, laboratory investigations, and lung imaging data (radiographic and/or sonographic), and be assessed within the clinical context. The main value of echocardiography in this setting is to diagnose or exclude an underlying cardiac cause for dyspnoea and guide subsequent interventions.

### Unilateral pulmonary edema: unusual presentation of acute rheumatic fever [^e38f683e]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiogenic unilateral pulmonary edema (UPE) is a rare clinical condition and not readily recognized early and managed accordingly. Acute rheumatic fever, which is a common disease in developing countries, does not commonly present with UPE. We report a 13-year-old girl presenting with UPE following acute rheumatic fever mimicking pneumonia. We conclude that UPE should be considered in the differential diagnosis for the patient with clinical criteria of rheumatic fever who presents with unilateral lung opacification. With early recognition and antifailure treatment, it is possible to reduce morbidity and mortality in such patients.

### A structured diagnostic algorithm for patients with ARDS [^6dc7fa69]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of ARDS

The diagnosis of ARDS is largely based on hypoxic respiratory failure and the detection of pulmonary edema, from which hydrostatic cardiogenic pulmonary edema must be excluded. It is therefore essential that false positive results are excluded as much as possible by means of non-invasive imaging. Ultrasound of the lungs is superior to chest X-ray for detecting and ruling out pleural effusion. The chest X-ray can give the illusion that the lung is consolidated when there is a large effusion and this can result in a false positive diagnosis, but the treatment differs. Transthoracic ultrasound of the heart can facilitate the diagnosis of acute heart failure. In general, acute heart failure is sufficient explanation for pulmonary edema and treatment should be focused on decongestion. However, a complicating factor is that cardiomyopathy due to a hyperinflammatory state can be associated with ARDS (and thus non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Usually, these are patients with sepsis, with a high a priori risk of ARDS who should also be diagnosed with ARDS.

Practical steps

Determine that the patient meets the ARDS criteria according to the 'Berlin definition' and report the diagnosis of ARDS in the status (Table 1), both when the cause is evident and when the cause is unclear, as ARDS is a descriptive — and not causal — diagnosis. The presence of ARDS should trigger both a standardized set of evidence-based interventions (e.g. lung protective ventilation, restrictive fluid therapy) and, importantly, an investigation into the cause of the pulmonary injury.
Perform ultrasound of the lungs to rule out pulmonary effusion as the cause for the bilateral consolidations. Finding pleural abnormalities with lung ultrasound strongly suggests an inflammatory cause of the pulmonary edema.
Perform transthoracic cardiac ultrasound to exclude acute heart failure as a cause of pulmonary edema. Ultrasound evidence of cardiomyopathy does not exclude ARDS in an underlying condition with a high pre-probability of ARDS (such as sepsis) and in this case ARDS should be diagnosed despite the contribution of acute heart failure to the onset of pulmonary edema.

### Diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of natriuretic peptides in emergency department patients with dyspnea [^3a177666]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

More than 4.5 million Americans have congestive heart failure (CHF), close to 550,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, and one third of known patients with CHF are annually admitted to the hospital. Emergency department diagnosis of CHF is often based on history and physical examination findings along with results of ancillary tests, such as chest radiography and ECG. Although signs and symptoms of fluid overload, such as lower extremity edema and dyspnea, raise the suspicion of CHF, their lack of sensitivity makes them poor screening tools. The natriuretic peptides are promising markers of myocardial dysfunction and heart failure. Because of their relationship to myocardial pressure and stretching, natriuretic peptides have been investigated over the past 5 decades as both diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndromes and CHF. This article discusses each of the natriuretic peptides and attempts to delineate their potential diagnostic and prognostic roles in the ED.

Lung ultrasonography

Based on the interpretation of a number of artefacts, specific ultrasonography appearances, and their distribution (FIG. 1), LUS allows for a rapid point-of-care evaluation of a number of conditions, including pulmonary oedema, lung consolidation, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. High intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility, ease of learning, short exam duration (< 5 min), and the noninvasive nature of this technique makes it an advantageous point-of-care tool –. LUS is increasingly used in the acute care setting, and has improved diagnostic accuracy compared with clinical assessment and chest radiography for the identification of a cardiac aetiology in patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated dyspnoea.

### A 55-year-old woman with frequent pulmonary exacerbations and endobronchial lesions [^f1f30823]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 55-year-old woman with COPD, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (congestive heart failure), diabetes mellitus, and hypertension presented with baseline dyspnea at rest that had worsened over the last week. She reported associated runny nose, congestion, and cough productive of green sputum. She smoked six cigarettes per day and denied alcohol, drugs, or occupational exposure. She was admitted and initiated on treatment for acute exacerbation of COPD; however, her condition did not improve with steroid, ceftriaxone, and nebulized albuterol and budesonide treatments. She had been diagnosed with asthma and COPD without ever undergoing pulmonary function testing. She presented 11 times to the ED with six hospital admissions in the last 1.5 years for worsening dyspnea at rest, wheezing, and lower extremity edema deemed secondary to exacerbation of her COPD or congestive heart failure. She reported medication compliance, which included fluticasone-vilanterol, tiotropium bromide, and furosemide. She repeatedly demonstrated mild vascular congestion on imaging without hyperinflation, a normal to mildly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (< 10 to 200 pg/mL), and dyspnea without hypoxia. She was treated normally for both COPD and congestive heart failure exacerbations simultaneously with methylprednisolone, albuterol, and furosemide with rapid improvement over the course of 1 to 2 days. No significant improvement was noted with steroid therapy, despite receiving them as an inpatient and outpatient. At the time of discharge, her symptoms would be at her baseline.

### A practical approach to goal-directed echocardiography in the critical care setting [^5630c1cd]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

RESP-F

Patients presenting with acute respiratory failure may share etiology and echocardiographic findings of SHOCK conditions. Hemodynamic instability may not yet be manifest in the patient who presents with acute respiratory failure, due, in part, to the increase in sympathetic tone that generally accompanies severe dyspneic states. There are substantial limitations using goal-directed echocardiography. In the absence of Doppler assessment, LV diastolic properties and filling pressures cannot be properly determined. This may require a more comprehensive echocardiographic examination.

Patients with acute exacerbation of an obstructive airways disease, such as COPD or asthma, may be hyperinflated so that most echocardiographic views are obstructed and often the heart is best visualized from a subcostal view. Features on goal-directed echocardiography that support the diagnosis of chronic COPD include evidence of RV hypertrophy and failure. Acute respiratory causes, such as asthma and pneumonia, may have few specific findings on echocardiographic examination. Pulmonary embolism leads to evidence of obstruction and right heart failure, as discussed above. Pericardial disease may be associated with ST changes and becomes important when it contributes to obstructive physiology. Acute ventricular dysfunction can result in chest discomfort, dyspnea, and pulmonary edema with hypoxemic respiratory failure and even ventilator failure. Myocardial infarction (ST changes) must be considered as a treatable and potentially very responsive cause. Ventricular dysfunction leading to heart failure is important in the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory failure and may be manifested in a goal-directed echocardiographic examination by the same findings that characterize cardiogenic shock.

Initial Evaluation

A careful medical history and physical examination complemented by the rational measurement of objective variables can help establish, with a degree of certainty, that an ECOPD is the most likely diagnosis (Table 1), particularly in patients with mild events seen in the outpatient setting. However, in many patients, the signs and symptoms of an ECOPD (especially if more severe) are not specific, and other diseases may mimic an ECOPD and/or aggravate its clinical presentation (Figure 1). Most of these patients are seen in an acute care setting, and we developed an initial practical algorithm to help reach a more precise diagnosis (Figure 2).

### Right upper lobe pulmonary edema after mitral valve replacement caused by paravalvular leakage recognized by bedside transesophageal echocardiography [^aeb594b7]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an unusual case of right upper lobe pulmonary edema caused by acute paravalvular leakage that was identified by the use of bedside transesophageal echocardiography.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University-affiliated hospital.

Patient

A 59-yr-old male patient underwent prosthetic mitral valve replacement (St. Jude valve) for severe mitral regurgitation and developed sudden onset of dyspnea and change in consciousness with blood pressure decreased to 70/30 mm Hg. Elevation of central venous pressure and images of transthoracic echocardiography led to the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.

Conclusion

Acute paravalvular leakage after mitral valvular replacement should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses for unilateral pulmonary edema. Physical findings of a holosystolic murmur and findings from bedside transesophageal echocardiography can confirm the diagnosis, avoiding delay in management.

Echocardiography in AHF

Driven by progressive advances in ultrasonography technology and an expanding evidence base, the use of echocardiography has extended beyond the traditional application in stable patients to become widespread in the acute and emergency settings. Mirroring the concept of critical care, echocardiography is increasingly used as a tool to guide management of the most acutely unwell patients wherever they present along the management pathway. Pocket-sized devices have been recommended in the emergency department, intensive care unit, and coronary units for fast initial qualitative screening of ventricular and valvular function, pericardial and pleural effusion, or extravascular lung water. However, owing to the known limitations of this technique, they are not intended as a substitution for comprehensive echocardiography. Remote expert review of images is now a possibility, and in the future, telemedicine will probably have an important role in guiding the assessment and management of these acutely unwell patients.

Echocardiography is used in AHF to help to confirm diagnosis, delineate potential underlying causes, identify associated pathophysiology, and monitor the response to therapy. Echocardiography can also be used to guide specialist interventions in the catheter laboratory or operating room –. Furthermore, echocardiography can address several major questions, including whether a patient has a cardiac cause for their symptoms and signs, the severity of the cardiac impairment and its physiological effect, whether there is an underlying reversible cause, what the most appropriate initial treatment is, and how the patient responds to treatment.

Guidelines recommend immediate echocardiographic assessment for patients with suspected AHF with haemodynamic instability; however, interpretation of echocardiographic data in these acutely unwell patients can be extremely complex (TABLE 1). First, the finding of a structurally or functionally abnormal heart does not necessarily mean the cause of dyspnoea is cardiac-related. Second, patients might be misdiagnosed as having primary respiratory disease, even in the presence of very severe cardiac pathology. Third, substantial cardiac and respiratory disease might coexist, and determining the degree of cardiac contribution is frequently challenging in this setting. These considerations are further compounded by the relative paucity of high-quality evidence to support the use of echocardiography techniques in the acute arena, as they have been predominantly validated in the outpatient clinic.
