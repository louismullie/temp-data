## Question

indications for bipap

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for BiPAP across acute and chronic settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and mechanism of BiPAP to anchor when it is physiologically useful. Then, I should verify the strongest evidence-based acute indications, especially COPD with hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute heart failure syndromes. Next, I will examine pediatric and neonatal contexts, including asthma, bronchiolitis, and RDS. After that, I should review chronic indications such as OSA, OHS, and neuromuscular disease. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like post-extubation support, COVID-19, and airway clearance, and close with contraindications, safety considerations, and a concise synthesis of where BiPAP fits relative to CPAP and HFNC.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't misapply the modality. BiPAP delivers two pressure levels, a higher inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and a lower expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), thereby augmenting tidal ventilation and reducing work of breathing while maintaining airway patency; this is distinct from CPAP's single pressure and is particularly relevant when ventilatory support, not just oxygenation, is needed [^115cYVbb] [^116jVaRW].

> Now, I should verify the strongest acute indication. In acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, multiple high-quality guidelines and meta-analyses show that adding BiPAP to usual care reduces mortality and intubation rates and shortens hospital stay; I initially thought the mortality reduction was 46% and intubation reduction 65%, but wait, let me verify the exact figures from the Cochrane review: yes, mortality RR 0.54 and intubation RR 0.36, with benefits seen across pH strata and settings, which supports BiPAP as first-line unless the patient is immediately deteriorating or contraindicated [^115GNgHM] [^112iKm5c] [^116TSPc6].

> Next, I will examine acute heart failure syndromes with pulmonary edema. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about BiPAP superiority; the emergency care policy gives a Level B recommendation for CPAP 5–10 cm H2O and a Level C recommendation to consider BiPAP as an alternative, with mixed signals on myocardial infarction risk in earlier studies, so BiPAP is reasonable when CPAP is unavailable or poorly tolerated, but CPAP remains the default in many protocols [^114fNVow] [^115Lposv] [^113QxcPv].

> I need to check pediatric critical asthma because practice varies. The 2025 AARC/PALISI guideline suggests considering BiPAP over conventional oxygen in children with critical asthma who have persistent hypoxemia and/or respiratory distress, while noting insufficient evidence versus HFNC; earlier Cochrane reviews found very low-certainty signals of symptom improvement and reduced intubation, so BiPAP can be justified in selected PICU cases with close monitoring [^11138XAH] [^116HWzCT] [^115FcTuZ].

> Let me consider bronchiolitis in infants. A recent RCT suggests HFNC may be noninferior to NIV (CPAP/BiPAP) for mild-to-moderate distress, and a network meta-analysis ranks CPAP highest for preventing extubation and treatment failure, with HFNC and BiPAP also outperforming conventional oxygen; thus, BiPAP remains an option, but CPAP or HFNC are often preferred first-line depending on local expertise and tolerance [^113hd2KF] [^111QXUsS].

> I should confirm neonatal RDS guidance. European consensus recommends CPAP or synchronized NIPPV as first-line for at-risk preterm infants, and explicitly notes that BiPAP devices confer no advantage over CPAP; synchronized NIPPV may reduce reintubation and BPD, so if BiPAP is used, it should be framed as a variant of NIPPV rather than inherently superior to CPAP [^115yNSow] [^111HSXqf] [^111X9AiW].

> Turning to chronic indications, I need to ensure I align with sleep guidelines. For adult OSA, first-line therapy is CPAP or APAP; BiPAP is reserved for CPAP intolerance, very high pressure needs, or specific phenotypes, so routine BiPAP initiation for OSA is not recommended, though it remains an effective PAP modality when appropriately indicated [^113V56sM] [^116REiLS] [^113yVmTx].

> For obesity hypoventilation syndrome, let me verify the guidance. The ATS recommends initiating positive airway pressure during sleep in stable ambulatory patients with OHS; BiPAP is commonly chosen to augment ventilation and unload the respiratory muscles, with AVAPS as an option to target minute ventilation, so BiPAP is a key modality here rather than a second choice [^115QStBe] [^111gm8k9] [^1174cN7X].

> I will now examine neuromuscular respiratory failure. Small studies and reviews suggest that early BiPAP can prevent intubation in myasthenic crisis, particularly before overt hypercapnia develops, and that AVAPS may help stabilize ventilation; predictors of failure include higher APACHE II, bicarbonate above 30 mEq/L, and PaCO2 above 50 mmHg, so careful selection and early initiation matter [^113MRw5i] [^1113FTvw] [^116tMACo].

> Post-extubation support deserves a careful look. Routine post-extubation NIV in all adults is not recommended, but in high-risk patients, particularly those with COPD or hypercapnia, a short course of NIV can reduce reintubation; in infants, extubation to NIPPV reduces failure versus CPAP, and in adults after cardiothoracic surgery, HFNC was noninferior to intermittent BiPAP for treatment failure, so modality choice should be individualized [^1174ttMC] [^113hd2KF] [^112r15Gb].

> But wait, what about COVID-19 hypoxemic failure. Observational and trial data suggest that NIV, including BiPAP, can be used selectively to avoid early intubation, with attention to aerosol mitigation and close monitoring; however, prolonged unprotected NIV may risk patient self-inflicted lung injury, so escalation thresholds and interface selection must be explicit and dynamic [^1145z2Cj] [^113eR9Et].

> I should double-check airway clearance and secretion management. Combining BiPAP with high-frequency chest wall oscillation has been explored to augment tidal volumes and facilitate mucus clearance in obstructive diseases and pneumonia; while evidence is limited and retrospective, the physiologic rationale is sound and may be reasonable in selected patients with copious secretions and poor cough mechanics [^112PY4Zu] [^112o5HNn].

> Next, I should review contraindications and safety so I don't overextend use. Absolute or strong relative contraindications include hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled arrhythmias, facial trauma or deformity precluding a seal, inability to protect the airway, severe vomiting or upper GI bleeding, and untreated pneumothorax; in patients with pneumothorax, BiPAP should be discontinued until the pneumothorax is resolved, and in post–gastric bypass patients, there is a risk of massive bowel distention and anastomotic leak, so vigilance is required [^113etwcM] [^116Xid5a].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating anything. BiPAP is most strongly indicated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, where it reduces mortality and intubation; it is a reasonable alternative in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema when CPAP is unavailable or not tolerated; it can be considered in pediatric critical asthma and selected bronchiolitis cases; in chronic care, it is appropriate for OHS and selected neuromuscular respiratory failure, and serves as a CPAP alternative in OSA when CPAP fails or is poorly tolerated; beyond these, its role is more conditional and should be guided by patient selection, interface tolerance, and close monitoring for failure or harm [^115GNgHM] [^114fNVow] [^11138XAH] [^115QStBe] [^113V56sM].

---

BiPAP is indicated for **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** [^112iKm5c] due to COPD exacerbations [^115GNgHM], **obesity hypoventilation syndrome** [^115QStBe], and **neuromuscular disorders** [^113MRw5i], and for **acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema** [^112rVmqX] when CPAP is unavailable or contraindicated. It is also used for **post-extubation respiratory support** [^112r15Gb] in high-risk patients, and for **obstructive sleep apnea** [^113yVmTx] when CPAP is not tolerated or is ineffective. BiPAP is contraindicated in hemodynamic instability, untreated pneumothorax, facial trauma, severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and inability to protect the airway. It is not routinely indicated for isolated hypoxemic respiratory failure [^notfound] or primary community-acquired pneumonia without hypercapnia.

## Indications for BiPAP

### Acute respiratory failure

#### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations

In COPD exacerbations with **hypercapnic respiratory failure** (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg, pH ≤ 7.35) [^112iKm5c], BiPAP is indicated [^115GNgHM] and reduces mortality, intubation, and length of stay. It is also appropriate for **severe dyspnea, tachypnea, and accessory muscle use** despite optimal medical therapy.

---

#### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)

For OHS with **chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure**, BiPAP is indicated [^notfound] to improve gas exchange and reduce hospitalizations.

---

#### Neuromuscular disorders

In neuromuscular disorders with **respiratory muscle weakness** (e.g. myasthenia gravis, ALS, Duchenne muscular dystrophy), BiPAP is indicated [^113MRw5i] to support ventilation and prevent respiratory failure.

---

#### Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE)

In ACPE, BiPAP is indicated when **CPAP is unavailable or contraindicated** [^114fNVow]; it improves oxygenation and reduces intubation, though CPAP remains first-line [^114fNVow].

---

#### Post-extubation respiratory support

After extubation, BiPAP is indicated for **high-risk patients** (e.g. COPD, obesity, hypercapnia) to reduce reintubation and improve outcomes [^111v43hp].

---

### Chronic respiratory conditions

#### Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

For OSA, BiPAP is indicated when **CPAP is not tolerated or is ineffective** [^113yVmTx], particularly with concomitant hypercapnia or complex sleep apnea.

---

#### Central sleep apnea (CSA)

For CSA, BiPAP with a **backup rate** is indicated for complex sleep apnea or when CPAP is ineffective [^116NUbRY].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

### Absolute contraindications

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Unstable blood pressure or arrhythmias.
- **Untreated pneumothorax**: Risk of worsening air leak.
- **Facial trauma or deformity**: Poor mask fit or risk of injury.
- **Severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding**: Risk of aspiration.
- **Inability to protect airway**: Risk of aspiration.

---

### Relative contraindications

Relative contraindications include **severe encephalopathy or inability to cooperate**, which may limit effectiveness, and **recent upper airway or esophageal surgery**, where caution is advised. Severe **copious secretions** may also impair ventilation and clearance.

---

## Clinical scenarios where BiPAP is not indicated

- **Isolated hypoxemic respiratory failure**: Without hypercapnia or respiratory acidosis [^notfound].
- **Primary community-acquired pneumonia**: Without hypercapnia or respiratory acidosis.
- **Routine post-operative care**: Without respiratory failure or risk factors.

## Indications and contraindications

| **Indications** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|
| COPD exacerbations with hypercapnia | Hemodynamic instability |
| Obesity hypoventilation syndrome | Untreated pneumothorax |
| Neuromuscular disorders | Facial trauma or deformity |
| Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPAP unavailable) | Severe upper GI bleeding |
| Post-extubation respiratory support | Inability to protect airway |
| OSA (CPAP intolerance or ineffective) | Severe encephalopathy |

---

BiPAP is a **versatile non-invasive ventilation modality** for acute and chronic respiratory failure, with the strongest evidence in COPD exacerbations with hypercapnia [^115GNgHM]. It is not indicated for isolated hypoxemia without hypercapnia and should be avoided in hemodynamic instability, untreated pneumothorax, and when the airway cannot be protected.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) — the decision to start EN in adults requiring NIV should be multidisciplinary and made on a case-by-case basis, with careful consideration of the patient's overall medical and nutrition status; placement of an EN tube with a standard NIV mask will cause an additional air leak, and if the additional leak is unable to be compensated for, it is recommended to look into a mask with an adaptor or sealing pad; if choosing to enterally feed a patient who is on noninvasive ventilation, postpyloric placement would be preferred because of the likely increased aspiration risk.

Acute heart failure syndromes — noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in the emergency department is addressed with graded recommendations and supporting evidence: Level A recommendations are none specified. Level B recommendations state to use 5 to 10 mm Hg CPAP by nasal or face mask for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome without hypotension or the need for emergent intubation to improve heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and reduce intubation and possibly reduce inhospital mortality. Level C recommendations state to consider using BiPAP as an alternative to CPAP for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome; however, data about the possible association between BiPAP and myocardial infarction remain unclear. Supporting text notes that initial studies of CPAP at 5 to 10 mm Hg consistently showed significant improvements in oxygenation and reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure versus standard oxygen therapy, yet with the exception of one study that showed a reduction in mortality, a statistically significant benefit over standard oxygen therapy has not been found for hospital length of stay and mortality.

Abstract

Background

Guidelines recommend non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support as first-line respiratory support mode in preterm infants as NIV is superior to intubation and mechanical ventilation in preventing death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, with an ever-expanding variety of NIV modes available, there is much debate about which NIV modality should ideally be used, how, and when. The aims of this work were to summarise the evidence on different NIV modalities for both primary and secondary respiratory support: nCPAP, nasal high-flow therapy (nHFT), and nasal intermittent positive airway pressure ventilation (nIPPV), bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), nasal high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV), and nasally applied, non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NIV-NAVA) modes, with particular focus on their use in preterm infants.

Summary

This is a narrative review with reference to published guidelines by European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome: 2022 Update. nCPAP is currently the most commonly used primary and secondary NIV modality for premature infants. However, there is increasing evidence on the superiority of nIPPV over nCPAP. No beneficial effect was found for BiPAP over nCPAP. For the use of nHFT, nHFOV, and NIV-NAVA, more studies are needed to establish their place in neonatal respiratory care.

Key Messages

The superiority of nIPPV over nCPAP needs to be confirmed by contemporaneous trials comparing nCPAP to nIPPV at comparable mean airway pressures. Future trials should study NIV modalities in preterm infants with comparable respiratory pathology and indications, at comparable pressure settings and with different modes of synchronisation. Importantly, future trials should not exclude infants of the smallest gestational ages.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — airway and oxygen therapy specify to give supplemental oxygen for dyspnea to a target of 94–98% saturation with escalation from a nasal cannula as needed, that BVM ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure, that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be administered for severe respiratory distress via BVM, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and that if indicated, bronchodilators should be administered in line with NIV.

### Non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy for improving erectile dysfunction in men with obstructive sleep apnoea [^116yCV5M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with several chronic diseases, including erectile dysfunction (ED). The association of OSAS and ED is far more common than might be found by chance; the treatment of OSAS with non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy is associated with improvement of respiratory symptoms, and may contribute to the improvement of associated conditions, such as ED.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and acceptability of non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy for improving erectile dysfunction in OSAS.

Search Methods

We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED EBSCO, and LILACS, the US National Institutes of Health ongoing trials register ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation international clinical trials registry platform to 14 June 2021, with no restriction on date, language, or status of publication. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies, and review articles for additional references, and relevant manufacturers' websites for study information. We also searched specific conference proceedings for the British Association of Urological Surgeons; the European Association of Urology; and the American Urological Association to 14 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel or cross-over design, or cluster-RCTs, which included men aged 18 years or older, with OSAS and ED. We considered RCTs comparing any non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy (such as continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), variable positive airway pressure (VPAP), or similar devices) versus sham, no treatment, waiting list, or pharmacological treatment for ED. The primary outcomes were remission of ED and serious adverse events; secondary outcome were sex-related quality of life, health-related quality of life, and minor adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. A third review author solved any disagreement. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias of the included RCTs. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. To measure the treatment effect on dichotomous outcomes, we used the risk ratio (RR); for continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD). We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these measures. When possible (data availability and homogeneous studies), we used a random-effect model to pool data with a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (all assessing CPAP as the non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy device), with a total of 315 men with OSAS and ED. All RCTs presented some important risk of bias related to selection, performance, assessment, or reporting bias. None of included RCTs assessed the ED remission rate, and we used the provided ED mean scores as a proxy. CPAP versus no CPAP There is uncertainty about the effect of CPAP on mean ED scores after 4 weeks, using the International index of erectile function (IIEF-5, higher = better; MD 7.50, 95% CI 4.05 to 10.95; 1 RCT; 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and after 12 weeks (IIEF-ED, ED domain; MD 2.50, 95% CI -1.10 to 6.10; 1 RCT; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). There is uncertainty about the effect of CPAP on sex-related quality of life after 12 weeks, using the Self-esteem and relationship test (SEAR, higher = better; MD 1.00, 95% CI -8.09 to 10.09; 1 RCT; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision); no serious adverse events were reported after 4 weeks (1 RCT; 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). CPAP versus sham CPAP One RCT assessed this comparison (61 participants), but we were unable to extract outcomes for this comparison due to the factorial design and reporting of this trial. CPAP versus sildenafil (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors) Sildenafil may slightly improve erectile function at 12 weeks when compared to CPAP, measured with the IIEF-ED (MD -4.78, 95% CI -6.98 to -2.58; 3 RCTs; 152 participants; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations). There is uncertainty about the effect of CPAP on sex-related quality of life after 12 weeks, measured with the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction questionnaire (EDITS, higher = better; MD -1.24, 95% CI -1.80 to -0.67; 2 RCTs; 122 participants; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations). No serious adverse events were reported for either group (2 RCTs; 70 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). There is uncertainty about the effects of CPAP when compared to sildenafil for the incidence of minor adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.21; 1 RCT; 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). The confidence interval was wide and neither a significant increase nor reduction in the risk of minor adverse events can be ruled out with the use of CPAP (4/20 men complained of nasal dryness in the CPAP group, and 3/20 men complained of transient flushing and mild headache in the sildenafil group).

Authors' Conclusions

When compared with no CPAP, we are uncertain about the effectiveness and acceptability of CPAP for improving erectile dysfunction in men with obstructive sleep apnoea. When compared with sildenafil, there is some evidence that sildenafil may slightly improve erectile function at 12 weeks.

### 2021 ACC / AHA key data elements and definitions for heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop clinical data standards for heart failure) [^115cYVbb]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure clinical data standards — mechanical ventilatory support is defined as mechanical ventilation, or assisted ventilation, used for artificial ventilation where mechanical means assist or replace spontaneous breathing, with permissible values of Mechanical ventilation, CPAP, BiPAP, Adaptive servo-ventilation, and None. Mechanical ventilation is described as a life-sustaining technique moving gas toward and from the lungs via an external device connected directly to the patient. CPAP is described as continuous positive airway pressure/power applying mild air pressure on a continuous basis to keep airways continuously open in patients who can breathe spontaneously but need help keeping their airway unobstructed. BiPAP is described as a noninvasive therapy in which positive air pressure is higher during inspiration and lower during expiration. Adaptive servo-ventilation is positive airway pressure therapy in which the air pressure target is adjusted to the patient's breathing patterns; in patients with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF and central sleep apnea, adaptive servo-ventilation causes harm.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^115b7cuT]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Based on the limited data available, BiPAP does not appear to offer any significant clinical benefits over CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Until a large randomized controlled trial can demonstrate that BiPAP is associated with significant clinical benefit or is more cost-effective than CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the choice of modality will depend mainly on the equipment available.

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for acute asthma in children [^116HWzCT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission among children, with significant economic burden and impact on quality of life. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is increasingly used in the care of children with acute asthma, although the evidence supporting it is weak, and clinical guidelines do not offer any recommendations on its routine use. However, NPPV might be an effective way to improve outcomes for some children with asthma. A previous review did not demonstrate a clear benefit, but was limited by few studies with small sample sizes. This is an update of the previous review.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of NPPV as an add-on therapy to usual care (e.g. bronchodilators and corticosteroids) in children (< 18 years) with acute asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We searched all databases from their inception to March 2023, with no restrictions on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing NPPV as add-on therapy to usual care versus usual care for children hospitalised for acute asthma exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

We included three RCTs randomising 60 children with acute asthma to NPPV and 60 children to control. All included trials assessed the effects of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for acute asthma in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. None of the trials used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The controls received standard care. The median age of children ranged from three to six years, and asthma severity ranged from moderate to severe. Our primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and asthma symptom score. Secondary outcomes were non-serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, arterial blood gases and pH, pneumonia, cost, and PICU length of stay. None of the trials reported any deaths or serious adverse events (except one trial that reported intubation rate). Two trials reported asthma symptom score, each demonstrating reductions in asthma symptoms in the BiPAP group. In one trial, the asthma symptom score was (mean difference (MD) -2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.70 to -0.30, P = 0.03; 19 children) lower in the BiPAP group. In the other trial, a cross-over trial, BiPAP was associated with a lower mean asthma symptom score (MD -3.7; 16 children; very low certainty evidence) before cross-over, but investigators did not report a standard deviation, and it could not be estimated from the first phase of the trial before cross-over. The reduction in both trials was above our predefined minimal important difference. Overall, NPPV with standard care may reduce asthma symptom score compared to standard care alone, but the evidence is very uncertain. The only reported serious adverse event was intubation rate in one trial. The trial had an intubation rate of 40% and showed that BiPAP may result in a large reduction in intubation rate (risk ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.95; 78 children), but the evidence is very uncertain. Post hoc analysis showed that BiPAP may result in a slight decrease in length of PICU stay (MD -0.87 day, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.22; 100 children), but the evidence is very uncertain. Meta-analysis or Trial Sequential Analysis was not possible because of insufficient reporting and different scoring systems. All three trials had high risk of bias with serious imprecision of results, leading to very low certainty of evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence for NNPV is uncertain. NPPV may lead to an improvement in asthma symptom score, decreased intubation rate, and slightly shorter PICU stay; however, the evidence is of very low certainty. Larger RCTs with low risk of bias are warranted.

### Non-invasive ventilation for the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115GNgHM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is commonly used to treat patients admitted to hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and PsycINFO, and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. This update to the original review incorporates the results of database searches up to January 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH < 7.35 and mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) > 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission and need for endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, treatment intolerance, complications, changes in symptoms, and changes in arterial blood gases.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria to determine study eligibility, performed data extraction, and determined risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Review authors undertook meta-analysis for data that were both clinically and statistically homogenous, and analysed data as both one overall pooled sample and according to two predefined subgroups related to exacerbation severity (admission pH between 7.35 and 7.30 vs below 7.30) and NIV treatment setting (intensive care unit-based vs ward-based). We reported results for mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay in a 'Summary of findings' table and rated their quality in accordance with GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials involving 1264 participants. Available data indicate that mean age at recruitment was 66.8 years (range 57.7 to 70.5 years) and that most participants (65%) were male. Most studies (12/17) were at risk of performance bias, and for most (14/17), the risk of detection bias was uncertain. These risks may have affected subjective patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. dyspnoea) and secondary review outcomes, respectively. Use of NIV decreased the risk of mortality by 46% (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.76; N = 12 studies; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 9 to 23) and decreased the risk of needing endotracheal intubation by 65% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.46; N = 17 studies; NNTB 5, 95% CI 5 to 6). We graded both outcomes as 'moderate' quality owing to uncertainty regarding risk of bias for several studies. Inspection of the funnel plot related to need for endotracheal intubation raised the possibility of some publication bias pertaining to this outcome. NIV use was also associated with reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -3.39 days, 95% CI -5.93 to -0.85; N = 10 studies), reduced incidence of complications (unrelated to NIV) (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; N = 2 studies), and improvement in pH (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; N = 8 studies) and in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) (MD 7.47 mmHg, 95% CI 0.78 to 14.16 mmHg; N = 8 studies) at one hour. A trend towards improvement in PaCO 2 was observed, but this finding was not statistically significant (MD -4.62 mmHg, 95% CI -11.05 to 1.80 mmHg; N = 8 studies). Post hoc analysis revealed that this lack of benefit was due to the fact that data from two studies at high risk of bias showed baseline imbalance for this outcome (worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group). Sensitivity analysis revealed that exclusion of these two studies resulted in a statistically significant positive effect of NIV on PaCO 2. Treatment intolerance was significantly greater in the NIV group than in the usual care group (risk difference (RD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; N = 6 studies). Results of analysis showed a non-significant trend towards reduction in dyspnoea with NIV compared with usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.02; N = 4 studies). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant between-group differences.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from good quality randomised controlled trials show that NIV is beneficial as a first-line intervention in conjunction with usual care for reducing the likelihood of mortality and endotracheal intubation in patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The magnitude of benefit for these outcomes appears similar for patients with acidosis of a mild (pH 7.30 to 7.35) versus a more severe nature (pH < 7.30), and when NIV is applied within the intensive care unit (ICU) or ward setting.

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for acute asthma in children [^115FcTuZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission among children and constitutes a significant economic burden. Use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in the care of children with acute asthma has increased even though evidence supporting the intervention has been considered weak and clinical guidelines do not recommend the intervention. NPPV might be an effective intervention for acute asthma, but no systematic review has been conducted to assess the effects of NPPV as an add-on therapy to usual care in children with acute asthma.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of NPPV as an add-on therapy to usual care (e.g. bronchodilators and corticosteroids) in children with acute asthma.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR). The Register contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and by handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We searched all databases from their inception to February 2016, with no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing NPPV as add-on therapy to usual care versus usual care for children (age < 18 years) hospitalised for an acute asthma attack.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts. We retrieved all relevant full-text study reports, independently screened the full text, identified trials for inclusion and identified and recorded reasons for exclusion of ineligible trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion or, if required, consulted a third review author. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We identified the risk of bias of included studies to reduce the risk of systematic error. We contacted relevant study authors when data were missing.

Main Results

We included two RCTs that randomised 20 participants to NPPV and 20 participants to control. We assessed both studies as having high risk of bias; both trials assessed effects of bilateral positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Neither trial used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Controls received standard care. Investigators reported no deaths and no serious adverse events (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE): very low quality of evidence due to serious risk of bias and serious imprecision of results). Both trials showed a statistically significant reduction in symptom score. One trial did not report a standard deviation (SD), but by using an estimated SD, we found a statistically significantly reduced asthma symptom score (mean difference (MD) -2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.70 to -0.30, P = 0.03, 19 participants, GRADE: very low quality of evidence). In the other trial, NPPV was associated with a lower total symptom score (5.6 vs 1.9, 16 participants, very low quality of evidence) before cross-over, but investigators did not report an SD, nor could it be estimated from the first phase of the trial, before the cross-over. These gains could be clinically relevant, as a reduction of three or more points in symptom score is considered a clinically meaningful change. Researchers documented five dropouts (12.5%), four of which were due to intolerance to NPPV, and one to respiratory failure requiring intubation. Owing to insufficient reporting in the latter trial and use of different scoring systems, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis nor a Trial Sequential Analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not permit confirmation or rejection of the effects of NPPV for acute asthma in children. Large RCTs with low risk of bias are warranted.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^114SBqAw]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of OSAS in General (See Also Guideline on Pediatric OSAS)

Type of treatment of OSAS in craniosynostosis is determined by severity of the symptoms and location of the obstruction, and is aimed at improving upper airway patency. Treatment may be pharmacological, for example, nasal corticosteroid spray or antibiotics; surgical, for example adenotonsillectomy; or nonsurgical, for example, nocturnal O 2 administration or continuous/bi-level positive airway pressure ((continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)). –

Conservative measures are often successful in the milder types of OSAS, such as extensive nasal irrigation (saline lavage and air spraying), treatment of intercurrent infections, and assuring a specific sleep position.

Oxygen therapy may be indicated in nocturnal hypoxia, but only after having confirmed that the hypercapnia will not worsen as a result of reduced breathing activity after loss of the hypoxic drive in chronic hypercapnia.

### Investigating the effectiveness of combining high-frequency chest wall oscillation with bilevel positive airway pressure in pneumonia patients: a retrospective cohort study [^112o5HNn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The indication and setting of HFCWO and bipap

The indications for HFCWO in pneumonia patients at NCKUH include poor airway clearance function and comorbidities such as COPD, cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis with high sputum volume, and pulmonary atelectasis. Contraindications for HFCWO include unstable hemodynamic, massive hemoptysis, increase intracranial pressure (IICP), rib fracture, chest wall injury, and recent chest surgery. BiPAP is routinely added for patients receiving HFCWO, except for those at risk of pneumothorax (e.g. large bullae, history of pneumothorax, or recent chest surgery or biopsy), unable to cooperate with BiPAP, IICP, or with facial trauma or deformity. All applications of HFCWO and BiPAP at NCKUH require approval from a pulmonologist and respiratory therapist following a comprehensive patient evaluation.

The medical device for HFCWO is COMFORTCOUGH ® II (Seoil Pacific Corp. South Korea). We configure the HFCWO device to "percussor" mode, setting the amplitude and frequency of percussion pressure based on patient comfort and clinical effectiveness. The amplitude of pressure was adjusted from 40 to 60 cmH 2 O and the frequency from 400 to 600 Hz, once or twice daily dependent on the availability of devices and respiratory therapists. The BiPAP device used is FlexoTM Bi-Level, set to "S/T" mode. The settings for inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) are 8–15 cmH 2 O and 6–8 cmH 2 O, respectively. These settings aim to achieve a lung volume expansion targeted at 1.5 times the predicted tidal volume, which is calculated based on the predicted body weight (8–10 ml/kg of predicted body weight). The respiratory rate was set at 10–12 breaths per minute, with the inspiratory time set at approximately 33% of the single breathing cycle. Each setting was adjusted based on clinical effectiveness and patient comfort. BiPAP was administered contemporaneously with HFCWO, lasting about 30 min per session, once daily. For patients with significant sputum production, and when equipment and staff are available, BiPAP and HFCWO can be administered twice daily.

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ZeyaL]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

NIV associated with decreased endotracheal intubation rates and hospital mortality in acute hypoxemia nonhypercapnic respiratory failure excluding COPD exacerbation and CPE patients. It should be noted that there is no sufficient scientific evidence to recommend BiPAP or helmet due to the limited number of trials available. Large rigorous randomized trials are needed to answer these questions definitely.

### High-flow nasal cannulae for respiratory support in adult intensive care patients [^116KhXLG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) deliver high flows of blended humidified air and oxygen via wide-bore nasal cannulae and may be useful in providing respiratory support for adult patients experiencing acute respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Objectives

We evaluated studies that included participants 16 years of age and older who were admitted to the ICU and required treatment with HFNC. We assessed the safety and efficacy of HFNC compared with comparator interventions in terms of treatment failure, mortality, adverse events, duration of respiratory support, hospital and ICU length of stay, respiratory effects, patient-reported outcomes, and costs of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Web of Science, proceedings from four conferences, and clinical trials registries; and we handsearched reference lists of relevant studies. We conducted searches from January 2000 to March 2016 and reran the searches in December 2016. We added four new studies of potential interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled studies with a parallel or cross-over design comparing HFNC use in adult ICU patients versus other forms of non-invasive respiratory support (low-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae or mask, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 1972 participants. Participants in six studies had respiratory failure, and in five studies required oxygen therapy after extubation. Ten studies compared HFNC versus low-flow oxygen devices; one of these also compared HFNC versus CPAP, and another compared HFNC versus BiPAP alone. Most studies reported randomization and allocation concealment inadequately and provided inconsistent details of outcome assessor blinding. We did not combine data for CPAP and BiPAP comparisons with data for low-flow oxygen devices; study data were insufficient for separate analysis of CPAP and BiPAP for most outcomes. For the primary outcomes of treatment failure (1066 participants; six studies) and mortality (755 participants; three studies), investigators found no differences between HFNC and low-flow oxygen therapies (risk ratio (RR), Mantel-Haenszel (MH), random-effects 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.27; and RR, MH, random-effects 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.06, respectively). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of this evidence to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. Reported adverse events included nosocomial pneumonia, oxygen desaturation, visits to general practitioner for respiratory complications, pneumothorax, acute pseudo-obstruction, cardiac dysrhythmia, septic shock, and cardiorespiratory arrest. However, single studies reported adverse events, and we could not combine these findings; one study reported fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation with HFNC but no differences in all other reported adverse events. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events to low because of limited data. Researchers noted no differences in ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD), inverse variance (IV), random-effects 0.15, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.34; four studies; 770 participants), and we downgraded quality to low because of study risks of bias and different participant indications. We found no differences in oxygenation variables: partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) (MD, IV, random-effects 7.31, 95% CI -23.69 to 41.31; four studies; 510 participants); PaO 2 (MD, IV, random-effects 2.79, 95% CI -5.47 to 11.05; three studies; 355 participants); and oxygen saturation (SpO 2) up to 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects 0.72, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.17; four studies; 512 participants). Data from two studies showed that oxygen saturation measured after 24 hours was improved among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects 1.28, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.55; 445 participants), but this difference was small and was not clinically significant. Along with concern about risks of bias and differences in participant indications, review authors noted a high level of unexplained statistical heterogeneity in oxygenation effect estimates, and we downgraded the quality of evidence to very low. Meta-analysis of three comparable studies showed no differences in carbon dioxide clearance among those treated with HFNC (MD, IV, random-effects -0.75, 95% CI -2.04 to 0.55; three studies; 590 participants). Two studies reported no differences in atelectasis; we did not combine these findings. Data from six studies (867 participants) comparing HFNC versus low-flow oxygen showed no differences in respiratory rates up to 24 hours according to type of oxygen delivery device (MD, IV, random-effects -1.51, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.35), and no difference after 24 hours (MD, IV, random-effects -2.71, 95% CI -7.12 to 1.70; two studies; 445 participants). Improvement in respiratory rates when HFNC was compared with CPAP or BiPAP was not clinically important (MD, IV, random-effects -0.89, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.05; two studies; 834 participants). Results showed no differences in patient-reported measures of comfort according to oxygen delivery devices in the short term (MD, IV, random-effects 0.14, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.93; three studies; 462 participants) and in the long term (MD, IV, random-effects -0.36, 95% CI -3.70 to 2.98; two studies; 445 participants); we downgraded the certainty of this evidence to low. Six studies measured dyspnoea on incomparable scales, yielding inconsistent study data. No study in this review provided data on positive end-expiratory pressure measured at the pharyngeal level, work of breathing, or cost comparisons of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to demonstrate whether HFNC was a more effective or safe oxygen delivery device compared with other oxygenation devices in adult ICU patients. Meta-analysis could be performed for few studies for each outcome, and data for comparisons with CPAP or BiPAP were very limited. In addition, we identified some risks of bias among included studies, differences in patient groups, and high levels of statistical heterogeneity for some outcomes, leading to uncertainty regarding the results of our analysis. Consequently, evidence is insufficient to show whether HFNC provides safe and efficacious respiratory support for adult ICU patients.

CHAPTER 12 RESPIRATORY DISORDERS

12.1 What is the policy on respiratory disorders in syndromic craniosynostosis?

Introduction

Children with craniosynostosis syndromes belong to the risk groups for sleep-related respiratory disorders characterized by upper airway obstruction. This disrupts normal breathing and sleep. The respiratory disorders are obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea (OSA), central sleep apnea and hypopnea (CSA) and upper airway resistance (UAR).

The clinical symptoms of respiratory disorders are diverse and can be divided into symptoms at night: restless sleep, snoring, apnea, bedwetting and sweating, and during the day: dry mouth when getting up, fatigue, impaired cognitive functioning, reduced school performance and behavioral disorders. In the long term, growth disorders may occur. In addition, respiratory disorders may contribute to an increase in ICP, probably due to the cerebral vasodilation that occurs when CO 2 accumulates, causing more blood to flow to the brain and resulting in an increase in ICP. Since children with syndromic craniosynostosis often have a somewhat higher ICP, respiratory disorders in them may result in too high an ICP. In view of the seriousness of the respiratory disorders and the good treatment possibilities, early recognition is very important.

The treatment of respiratory disorders can be pharmacological, e.g. nasal corticosteroid spray or antibiotics, surgical, e.g. adenotonsillectomy or midface surgery, or non-surgical, such as nocturnal supplemental oxygen or continuous / bi-level positive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP). In the articles in which the European Respiratory Society presents a 'state-of-the-art' overview, a flowchart is given for the treatment of children up to 23 months old and for the treatment of older children with OSA. 1,2 There is one systematic review specific to craniosynostosis, but because it also includes case reports with only 2 patients it is not always of high quality. 3 These case reports, deal with treatment by nasopharyngeal tube (NPT), CPAP or BIPAP and tracheotomy. The NPT can be used to bridge a period pending a more definitive treatment. Respiratory support through non-invasive ventilation with CPAP or BIPAP is an accepted treatment in children with good results, but in which compliance is essential. 3 The systematic review by Nash describes that many of the 23 articles included describe a tracheal cannula for treatment of severe OSA. Eventually, surgical treatment will be necessary to eliminate the causes of the respiratory disorders.

### Positive expiratory pressure physiotherapy for airway clearance in people with cystic fibrosis [^1152SFzT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation and by temporarily increasing functional residual capacity. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2013. Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trial Register: 02 December 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with cystic fibrosis. This included, postural drainage and percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, oscillating PEP devices, thoracic oscillating devices, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) and exercise. Studies also had to include one or more of the following outcomes: change in forced expiratory volume in one second; number of respiratory exacerbations; a direct measure of mucus clearance; weight of expectorated secretions; other pulmonary function parameters; a measure of exercise tolerance; ventilation scans; cost of intervention; and adherence to treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.

Main Results

A total of 26 studies (involving 733 participants) were included in the review. Eighteen studies involving 296 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta-analysis. These studies compared PEP to active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), autogenic drainage (AD), oral oscillating PEP devices, high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and Bi level PEP devices (BiPaP) and exercise. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies. Single interventions or series of treatments that continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome. However, long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome. A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year. Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high-level evidence. The only reported adverse event was in a study where infants performing either PEP or postural drainage with percussion experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux. This was more severe in the postural drainage with percussion group. Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures.

Authors' Conclusions

Following meta-analyses of the effects of PEP versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane review demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations in people using PEP compared to those using HFCWO in the study where exacerbation rate was a primary outcome measure. It is important to note, however, that there may be individual preferences with respect to airway clearance techniques and that each patient needs to be considered individually for the selection of their optimal treatment regimen in the short and long term, throughout life, as circumstances including developmental stages, pulmonary symptoms and lung function change over time. This also applies as conditions vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations. However, meta-analysis in this Cochrane review has shown a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations in people using PEP in the few studies where exacerbation rate was a primary outcome measure.

Noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) in acute heart failure — In a study of 89 consecutive elderly patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/ FIO2 ≤ 300), CPAP reduced the need for ventilatory assistance and early 48-hour mortality compared with standard oxygen with no difference in hospital length of stay. Specifically, the need for ventilatory assistance was 17% less (P = 0.01) in the CPAP group (7%) compared to standard oxygen (24%), and early 48-hour mortality was 21% less (P = 0.017) in the CPAP group (9%) compared to standard oxygen (30%). Evidence for BiPAP was mixed: in a 2000 trial of 37 patients, intubation was significantly less with BiPAP (5% versus 33%; P = 0.04) with faster symptom resolution defined by oxygen saturation ≥ 96% and respiratory rate < 30 breaths/min, whereas a 1997 trial halted after enrollment of 27 patients found higher myocardial infarction in the BiPAP group (71%, N = 10, P = 0.06) versus CPAP (31%, N = 4) with extremely large 95% confidence intervals (9% to 76%). Additional studies showed no clear superiority or differences: an out-of-hospital comparison reported BiPAP was associated with increased intubation, myocardial infarction, and a combined endpoint within 24 hours; a 2001 convenience sample of 38 randomized to BiPAP or conventional oxygen found no statistically significant differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygenation, rate of intubation, hospital length of stay, or myocardial infarction; a 2002 crossover study of 6 patients sequentially receiving CPAP 5 mm Hg, CPAP 10 mm Hg, and BiPAP 10/5 mm Hg found no significant difference in oxygenation or hemodynamic response; and a 2004 randomized head-to-head trial of 46 patients comparing CPAP 10 mm Hg to BiPAP 15/5 mm Hg found no differences in myocardial infarction, intubation, or inhospital mortality.

### Effect of average volume-assured pressure support treatment on health-related quality of life in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure: a randomized trial [^111gm8k9]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease with higher mortality and morbidity worldwide. Patients with end-stage COPD frequently develop chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF) associated with end-of-life. In this stage of the disease, patients experience extremely disabling symptoms of dyspnoea, increased risk for frequent exacerbations, re-hospitalization leading to severely impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL), with limited treatment options.

Several factors predispose severe COPD patients to chronic respiratory failure; severe airflow obstruction, hyperinflation, imbalances in the respiratory muscle length-tension relationship, malnutrition, constant use of systemic steroid, and comorbid conditions. Hence, chronic nocturnal non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) could provide respiratory muscle rest, thus enhancing recovery from chronic respiratory muscle fatigue and thereby improving respiratory muscle strength, improving gas exchange.

Evidence to support interventions for the treatment of chronic respiratory failure in COPD, except for the use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), has been lacking. NiPPV is commonly instituted in COPD patients with hypercapnia during hospitalization for acute exacerbations and subsequently continued as an outpatient sporadically. However, the evidence to support this intervention is conflicting with no consistent benefit in survival, need for re-hospitalization, clinical impact, quality of life, sleep efficiency or 6 min walk distance.

Average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) is one of the forms of (NiPPV) that uses automated algorithms to adjust pressure support (PS) to deliver appropriate preset target ventilation to stabilize the PaCO 2, which relates directly to alveolar ventilation over several breaths.

AVAPS is an advanced technology of ventilation designed to smooth patients' comfort and prevent any potential di-synchronization. AVAPS come to revolutionize the way Bi-Level therapy provided to the breathing complication among patients. Only a few studies have been done to compare the effectiveness and safety of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to AVAPS in chronic respiratory failure secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neuromuscular disorders with respiratory muscle weakness.

### Cystic fibrosis pulmonary guidelines: pulmonary complications: hemoptysis and pneumothorax [^113etwcM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis pneumothorax — panel statements address observation, drainage, pleurodesis, device use, activity, and referral: The patient with small PTX (pneumothorax), but clinically stable, may be observed in the outpatient setting, while the patient with large PTX should always be admitted to the hospital. The patient with small PTX, but clinically unstable, should always have chest tube drainage, and the patient with large PTX, but clinically stable, should always have chest tube drainage; the patient with large PTX, but clinically unstable, should always have chest tube drainage. The patient with a first small PTX should always undergo pleurodesis to prevent recurrence, and the patient with recurrent ipsilateral large PTX should always undergo pleurodesis to prevent recurrence; for the patient with PTX who is undergoing pleurodesis the preferred method is surgical pleurodesis. For the patient with PTX and using BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) as a chronic therapy, the BiPAP should be discontinued as long as the PTX is present. Activity restrictions include that the patient with small PTX should not fly on a plane for 2 wk after it has resolved and the patient with large PTX should not perform vigorous aerobic exercise for 2 wk after it has resolved. Referral guidance states that the patient with PTX and severe lung disease (FEV1 < 40% predicted) should always be referred for a lung transplantation evaluation.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^115yNSow]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

1. CPAP or (s)NIPPV should be started from birth in all babies at risk of RDS, such as those < 30 weeks of gestation who do not need intubation for stabilisation (A1).

2. NIV with early rescue surfactant by LISA technique is considered optimal management for babies with RDS (A1).

3. The system delivering CPAP is of little importance; however, the interface should be short binasal prongs or mask with a starting pressure of about 6–8 cm H 2 O (A2). Ability to escalate to NIPPV will reduce the need for invasive MV in some infants (A1).

4. BIPAP devices confer no advantage over CPAP alone (A2). However, synchronised NIPPV, if delivered through a ventilator, can reduce need for ventilation or need for re-ventilation following extubation and may reduce BPD (A2).

5. HFNC can be used as an alternative to CPAP for some babies, with the advantage of less nasal trauma, provided centres have access to CPAP or NIPPV for those failing this mode (B2).

MV Strategies

Despite best efforts to maintain as many preterm babies as possible on NIV, around half of babies < 28 weeks will require MV and those that do have worse outcomes. In addition, around half of infants < 28 weeks will also fail their first attempt at extubation and they too have worse outcomes. It is important that those managing infants with RDS understand the principles of MV to minimise the risk of iatrogenic lung injury. The aim of MV is to provide "acceptable" blood gases by ventilating at optimal lung volumes (open lung concept) while avoiding over-distension and atelectasis. Pulmonary over-distension increases risk of air leaks and pulmonary interstitial emphysema, while ventilating at sub-optimally low pressures may cause atelectasis and repeated pulmonary sheer stress, which in turn can generate inflammation and lung injury.

### "Comparison between high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in children with acute respiratory failure by bronchiolitis: a randomized controlled trial" [^111QXUsS]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute viral bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory disease and the primary reason for hospitalization among infants. According to a survey carried out in the United States (US) between 2010 and 2019, approximately 20% of hospitalized patients required intensive care, 4.9% required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV), and 3.3% required invasive mechanical ventilation. In a cross-sectional analysis of children admitted for bronchiolitis also performed in the US from 2000 to 2016, an increase in the hospitalization cost was observed — from $449 million to $734 million — after adjustment for inflation.

Among the few options for evidence-based supportive care available for patients with bronchiolitis, HFNC therapy has gained relevance mainly due to its easy application outside the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), comfort, low sedation requirements, and tolerability. Recent studies have demonstrated that HFNC therapy is superior to low-flow oxygen therapy. However, to date, few randomized clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of HFNC therapy versus NIV (CPAP and BiPAP – bilevel positive airway pressure), especially related to treatment failure and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, have been published. Furthermore, most of these studies have some methodological limitations, such as the failure criteria not being well described, the lack of an established HFNC weaning protocol, the use of a small sample, the lack of clinical reassessment scores, the restricted populations analyzed, the inclusion of a small number of intubated patients, and the use of a short assessment period. All these biases could interfere with external validation of the use of HFNC therapy in the pediatric population.

Therefore, new studies are necessary to compare HFNC therapy to NIV (CPAP/BiPAP) for bronchiolitis, especially regarding treatment failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.

The objective of this study was to compare HFNC therapy to NIV (BiPAP) in children with bronchiolitis who experienced mild to moderate respiratory distress and who required noninvasive respiratory support. We hypothesized that HFNC therapy would not be inferior to NIV (BiPAP).

### High flow biphasic positive airway pressure by helmet – effects on pressurization, tidal volume, carbon dioxide accumulation and noise exposure [^114oFjwX]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates a new concept of time-cycled biphasic airway pressure with a high flow system in a lung model. This approach might resolve some of the problems seen with the helmet interface and broaden the indications for its use. With HF-BiPAP, CO 2 removal from the helmet was highly efficient regardless of the underlying lung pathology. Pressurization of the helmet seems particularly efficient at the lower levels of assistance. If the patient requires a high level of assistance one has to be aware of the increased pressurization during expiration, which might be beneficial but also increases the load during expiration.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^111Kze3h]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

A literature search was conducted using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005 issue 3), and EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1966 to 1 December 2005). Only randomized controlled clinical trials comparing BiPAP with CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema were included. Studies comparing BiPAP with CPAP in a heterogeneous group of patients with different causes of acute respiratory failure were excluded unless outcomes data for the subgroup of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema were available. Studies using both CPAP and BiPAP in the same group of patients in a crossover design were excluded because the clinical outcomes as a result of a particular treatment modality could not be ascertained. During the electronic database search, the following exploded MeSH terms were used: 'bilevel', 'pressure support', 'non-invasive', 'CPAP', or 'positive pressure', with 'ventilation' or 'support' and with 'pulmonary oedema', 'cardiac failure', 'heart failure', or 'respiratory failure'. The reference lists of related reviews and original articles identified were searched for relevant trials. Finally, the websites of the International Network of Agencies of Health Technology Assessment and International Society of Technology Assessment in Health Care were searched to ensure that all suitable studies were included. The authors of one study were contacted to obtain additional information but they did not respond to the request. No studies published in languages other than English were found in the literature search.

### Association of extubation failure rates with high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, and bilevel positive airway pressure vs conventional oxygen therapy in infants and young children: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113hd2KF]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Estimates of Interventions

In the network meta-analysis, all 9 trials reported outcomes for EF and TF. Figure 1 describes the relative effect estimates and absolute estimates reported for EF and TF of COT, HFNC, CPAP, and BiPAP. HFNC, CPAP, and BiPAP were associated with lower rates of EF compared to COT. The largest absolute risk reduction (6%), with a baseline risk of EF of 12%, was seen with CPAP (number needed to treat = 17 per 1000 patients). CPAP had the highest probability of being the best intervention with a SUCRA of 0.83. HFNC, CPAP, and BiPAP appeared to be even more effective with the outcome of reducing TF. Compared to COT, both HFNC (11% reduction) and CPAP (12% reduction) were associated with large absolute reductions in TF with the baseline TF rate of 18%. Like for EF, CPAP had the highest probability of being the best intervention to prevent TF with a SUCRA of 0.91. HFNC was the second ranked intervention and BiPAP the third ranked intervention for both EF and TF. The cumulative ranking curvesfor EF and TF are shown in Figure 2. The summary absolute effect sizes of all the comparisons along with the GRADE certainty of evidence estimates is provided in Figure 3 (EF) and Figure 4 (TF).

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^1113uZxq]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations

In view of the high prevalence of OSAS in children with syndromic craniosynostosis it is mandatory to screen these children for OSAS.

If the clinical history documents nocturnal breathing problems, further evaluation for OSAS should take place.

If the medical history does not document nocturnal breathing problems, moderate and severe OSAS can be excluded, in all likelihood, and further evaluation is then, in principle, not indicated.

Symptoms of OSAS in combination with an abnormal saturation profile are strongly suspicious of OSAS. Additional PSG is indicated in this case, to be performed according to the guideline on pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (POSAS).

Polysomnography is indicated to determine OSAS severity.

Because multiple factors may underlie OSAS in children with a syndromic craniosynostosis, endoscopy of the upper airways is indicated to determine the level of obstruction.

Adenotonsillectomy is the surgical therapy of choice from toddler age if syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with OSAS.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children with syndromic craniosynostosis can be treated with the noninvasive ventilation strategies CPAP and BIPAP.

In young children with severe OSAS a nasopharyngeal tube can be used temporarily to ameliorate the symptoms.

A tracheotomy may be indicated in young children with severe OSAS.

A Le Fort III procedure or monobloc advancement should be considered in the management of respiratory problems in children with a syndromic craniosynostosis and severe OSAS requiring ventilator support.

The choice of treatment for OSAS is made on the basis of severity of the OSAS, age of the patient, causal factors, and possible other functional problems (such as ICP or exorbitism).

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111HSXqf]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Using a flow driver to generate CPAP has the theoretical advantage of offloading expiratory work of breathing, although no important clinical differences have been shown in clinical trials among various CPAP devices. The simplicity of bubble CPAP systems allows their use in low-income settings with some evidence of benefit over free-flowing oxygen. Leaks between the interface and nose are common with both nasal prongs and masks but somewhat less with prongs. All CPAP interfaces carry risk of facial distortion and nasal trauma.

Bi-level CPAP, Duo-PAP, or BIPAP are variants between CPAP and IPPV that use low pressure differences between inspiratory and expiratory phases at PIPs of 9–11 cm H 2 O at rates of around 20–40 per minute with long inspiratory times of up to 1.0 s. There is no evidence that BIPAP confers any advantage over CPAP, and any clinical differences may simply reflect a higher overall mean airway pressure. Modern ventilators provide NIPPV using pressures similar to those used for invasive MV. Challenges of NIPPV relate to pressure delivery through a non-sealed system, which is limited by leak at the nasal interface and the infant's tolerance to gas inflation of the stomach. Ventilator inflations can be synchronised with the infant's breathing by using either an abdominal capsule or in-line sensors. Synchronisation of nasal ventilation further improves respiratory stability. Recent systematic reviews comparing different modes of NIV for primary respiratory support or post-extubation concluded that synchronised NIPPV was the most effective, decreasing the need for MV, or re-ventilation, in preterm infants.

### High-flow nasal oxygen vs noninvasive positive airway pressure in hypoxemic patients after cardiothoracic surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^112r15Gb]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Noninvasive ventilation delivered as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is often used to avoid reintubation and improve outcomes of patients with hypoxemia after cardiothoracic surgery. High-flow nasal oxygen therapy is increasingly used to improve oxygenation because of its ease of implementation, tolerance, and clinical effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether high-flow nasal oxygen therapy was not inferior to BiPAP for preventing or resolving acute respiratory failure after cardiothoracic surgery.

Design and Setting

Multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial (BiPOP Study) conducted between June 15, 2011, and January 15, 2014, at 6 French intensive care units.

Participants

A total of 830 patients who had undergone cardiothoracic surgery, of which coronary artery bypass, valvular repair, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy were the most common, were included when they developed acute respiratory failure (failure of a spontaneous breathing trial or successful breathing trial but failed extubation) or were deemed at risk for respiratory failure after extubation due to preexisting risk factors.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive high-flow nasal oxygen therapy delivered continuously through a nasal cannula (flow, 50 L/min; fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2], 50%) (n = 414) or BiPAP delivered with a full-face mask for at least 4 hours per day (pressure support level, 8 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 4 cm H2O; FiO2, 50%) (n = 416).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as reintubation, switch to the other study treatment, or premature treatment discontinuation (patient request or adverse effects, including gastric distention). Noninferiority of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy would be demonstrated if the lower boundary of the 95% CI were less than 9%. Secondary outcomes included mortality during intensive care unit stay, changes in respiratory variables, and respiratory complications.

Results

High-flow nasal oxygen therapy was not inferior to BiPAP: the treatment failed in 87 of 414 patients with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (21.0%) and 91 of 416 patients with BiPAP (21.9%) (absolute difference, 0.9%; 95% CI, -4.9% to 6.6%; p = 0.003). No significant differences were found for intensive care unit mortality (23 patients with BiPAP [5.5%] and 28 with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy [6.8%]; p = 0.66) (absolute difference, 1.2% [95% CI, -2.3% to 4.8%]. Skin breakdown was significantly more common with BiPAP after 24 hours (10% vs 3%; 95% CI, 7.3%-13.4% vs 1.8%-5.6%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among cardiothoracic surgery patients with or at risk for respiratory failure, the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy compared with intermittent BiPAP did not result in a worse rate of treatment failure. The findings support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy in similar patients.

Population characteristics at baseline

FiO2 was measured according to the oxygen flow prior to the initiation of NIV and according to the following formula: 0.21 + 0.03 x flow

Acute respiratory failure was defined by a respiratory rate over 25 ventilations/min and signs of increased work of breathing

Data are expressed as n (%) or median [interquartile range]

CRF denotes chronic respiratory failure. HACOR denotes heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation and respiratory rate score

PaO2:FiO2 and HACOR score were missing for 49 patients.

At baseline, 101 patients (51%) had ARF and 147 (74%) showed signs of increased work of breathing; the respiratory rate was 30 [25–35] breaths/min, SpO2:FiO2 ratio was 208 [147–297], and 105 of the 151 patients (70%) with blood gas analysis had acute hypercapnic acidosis (pH < 7.35 and PaCO2 > 45 mmHg).

The main indications for NIV were CPO in 96 patients (49%), acute exacerbation of COPD in 76 (38%), and de novo hypoxaemic respiratory failure in 26 (13%). NIV was initiated by mobile EMS in one of five cases and was mostly managed with BiPAP (Table 2).

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^111uikWN]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The duration of noninvasive ventilation needed until pulmonary oedema resolved (WMD in hours = 3.65, 95% CI -12.12 to +19.43; P = 0.65; I² = 0%) and the length of hospital stay (WMD in days = -0.04, 95% CI -2.57 to +2.48; P = 0.97; I² = 0%) were not significantly different between the two groups (Figures 4 and 5). Data on patients with new onset acute myocardial infarction after initiation of CPAP or BiPAP were limited and with some inconsistencies. Based on these limited data, there was an insignificant trend toward an increase in new onset myocardial infarction in patients treated with the BiPAP (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.91–4.84; P = 0.08; I² = 25.3%; Figure 6). None of the studies included a cost-effectiveness analysis.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^113u9LtD]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

We conducted the present study to investigate the potential beneficial and adverse effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) noninvasive ventilation in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.

Method

We included randomized controlled studies comparing CPAP and BiPAP treatment in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2005 issue 3), and EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1966 to 1 December 2005), without language restriction. Two reviewers reviewed the quality of the studies and independently performed data extraction.

Results

Seven randomized controlled studies, including a total of 290 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, were considered. The hospital mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32–1.78; P = 0.52; I² = 0%) and risk for requiring invasive ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33–1.94; P = 0.62; I² = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP. Stratifying studies that used either fixed or titrated pressure during BiPAP treatment and studies involving patients with or without hypercapnia did not change the results. The duration of noninvasive ventilation required until the pulmonary oedema resolved (weighted mean difference [WMD] in hours = 3.65, 95% CI -12.12 to +19.43; P = 0.65, I² = 0%) and length of hospital stay (WMD in days = -0.04, 95% CI -2.57 to +2.48; P = 0.97, I² = 0%) were also not significantly different between the two groups. Based on the limited data available, there was an insignificant trend toward an increase in new onset acute myocardial infarction in patients treated with BiPAP (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.91–4.84; P = 0.08; I² = 25.3%).

Conclusion

BiPAP does not offer any significant clinical benefits over CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Until a large randomized controlled trial shows significant clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of BiPAP versus CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the choice of modality will depend mainly on the equipment available.

Results

Identification of studies

A total of 321 records were retrieved through database searching, out of which 243 underwent title and abstract screening. After eliminating duplicates and irrelevant records (n = 65), 178 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated for eligibility. Nevertheless, 162 RCTs were disqualified due to factors like unsuitable comparator, intervention, condition, population, absence of necessary outcome, and redundant data. Ultimately, 16 RCTs were incorporated into this meta-analysis. The selection process is depicted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
PRISMA study flow diagram

Study characteristics

A total of 16 RCTs encompassing 1369 participants met the inclusion criteria, comprising stable COPD (n = 478 participants, 6 RCTs) and post-exacerbation COPD (PECOPD) (n = 891 participants, 10 RCTs). These trials compared nocturnal or home-based NIV to various COPD treatments, including long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), supplemental oxygen, medications, nasal high-flow therapy, nasal cannula, and sham treatment. The studies featured both male and female participants with varying COPD severity, baseline PaCO2 levels, hypercapnia, recent exacerbations, and differing follow-up durations and NIV usage. Table 2 outlines the specifics of the interventions and controls employed in the included studies. Most trials utilized the BiPAP ventilator system as the NIV device, delivered via nasal, full-face, or oronasal masks.

### A comparison of bilevel and continuous positive airway pressure noninvasive ventilation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^1164xD7C]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Whether bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is advantageous compared with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPO) remains uncertain. The aim of the meta-analysis was to assess potential beneficial and adverse effects of CPAP compared with BiPAP in patients with ACPO.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the treatment effects of BiPAP with CPAP were identified from electronic databases and reference lists from January 1966 to December 2012. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality. In trials that fulfilled inclusion criteria, we critically evaluate the evidence for the use of noninvasive ventilation on rates of hospital mortality, endotracheal intubation, myocardial infarction, and the length of hospital stay. Data were combined using Review Manager 4.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Both pooled effects and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials with a total of 1433 patients with ACPO were included. The hospital mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.65–1.14; p = 0.46; I(2) = 0%) and need for requiring invasive ventilation (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57–1.38; p = 0.64; I(2) = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP. The occurrence of new cases of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77–1.17; p = 0.53, I(2) = 0%) and length of hospital stay (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, -0.40 to 2.41; p = 0.98; I(2) = 0%) were also not significantly different between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

There are no significant differences in clinical outcomes when comparing CPAP vs BiPAP. Based on the limited data available, our results suggest that there are no significant differences in clinical outcomes when comparing CPAP with BiPAP.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^115WsqEp]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

Prehospital airway management — non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) — states that NIPPV should be considered early for severe ventilatory distress or impending respiratory failure of any etiology; options include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), bi-level nasal CPAP, purpose-built humidified, heated high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula, and assisted mask ventilation with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP); in pediatric patients too small for CPAP masks, BVM with PEEP valve may augment breathing and offer non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; NIPPV can also be used to improve oxygenation pre-intubation and can be used in patients with altered mental status if closely attended and prepared to intervene as necessary.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^111EXMAv]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema is a common medical emergency. The majority of patients with acute pulmonary oedema will improve with oxygen and pharmacological therapy. However, assisted ventilation may be needed in patients with severe cardiogenic pulmonary oedema who remain hypoxaemic and in respiratory distress despite conventional medical therapy.

Studies have shown that noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation can improve gas exchange, decrease respiratory and heart rate, reduce the need for invasive ventilation and reduce hospital mortality. Noninvasive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation delivers positive airway pressure at two different levels during inspiration and expiration, and can decrease inspiratory work of breathing more than CPAP can alone. Studies evaluating BiPAP in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema have shown that it improves gas exchange and reduces the need for invasive ventilation in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure compared with conventional medical therapy. However, none of these studies demonstrated a reduction in hospital mortality. Furthermore, the results of one of the earlier studies suggested that BiPAP compared with CPAP might increase the risk for new onset acute myocardial infarction in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Whether BiPAP is advantageous compared with CPAP in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema remains uncertain.

In the present meta-analysis we assessed the potential beneficial and harmful effects of BiPAP compared with CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. We also assessed whether the BiPAP may be more advantageous when the pressure used during BiPAP is titrated according to clinical need and in the subgroup of patients with significant hypercapnia (mean arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO 2] > 45 mmHg).

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^115wMa8r]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers examined the titles and the abstracts of all identified trials to confirm that they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The same reviewers examined and recorded the trial characteristics and outcomes independently, using a pre-designed data abstraction form. This abstraction form was used to record information regarding the quality of the trial, such as allocation concealment, randomization method, blinding of treatment, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the study was scored according to the Jadad scale (range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better quality), but the individual component that constitutes the quality of the study was also described. The grading of allocation concealment was based on the Cochrane approach (i.e. adequate or uncertain or clearly inadequate). Blinding of the attending physician who decided when to initiate invasive ventilation or to cease noninvasive ventilation with the assigned mode of noninvasive ventilation (for instance CPAP or BiPAP) was required for a study to qualify as double blind. Any disagreements between the two independent reviewers were resolved by consensus. Data were checked and entered into the Review Manager (version 4.2.6 for Windows, 2003; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) database for further analysis.

The hospital mortality and the proportion of patients requiring invasive ventilation (or intubation) were chosen as main outcomes of this meta-analysis because they are the most relevant clinical outcomes of noninvasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The criteria for requiring invasive ventilation varied between studies, but the common criteria included poor state of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 13), respiratory arrest or significant respiratory distress (respiratory rate > 40 breaths/minute), persistent hypoxaemia despite supplementary oxygen (arterial oxygen tension < 60 mmHg) and progressive increases in PaCO 2 despite CPAP or BiPAP treatment (> 5 mmHg). The other outcomes assessed in the meta-analysis included the proportion of patients who developed new onset acute myocardial infarction after initiation of BiPAP or CPAP, duration of noninvasive ventilation needed till the pulmonary oedema resolved, and length of hospital stay. The criteria and process of weaning from CPAP or BiPAP varied between studies, but the common criteria included absence of respiratory distress with respiratory rate below 25 breaths/minute and pulse oximetry saturation of 95% or greater. The weaning process usually involved stepwise reduction in inspiratory and expiratory pressures (2 cmH 2 O) and inspired oxygen concentration (10%).

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^1116BnMG]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Significance of the findings

The present meta-analysis indicates that BiPAP has no significant clinical advantage over CPAP in terms of reducing hospital mortality, requirement for invasive ventilation, length of noninvasive ventilation needed until resolution of pulmonary oedema, and hospital length of stay in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Based on the limited data available, BiPAP was associated with a trend toward increased risk for new onset acute myocardial infarction compared with CPAP.

BiPAP can reduce work of breathing more than CPAP can in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Titrating the level of airway pressure used during BiPAP to a targeted tidal volume or to the patient's clinical needs may render BiPAP more beneficial in patients with hypercapnic acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema because it reduces the work of breathing more effectively than does CPAP while avoiding unnecessary airway pressure that can cause an excessive reduction in cardiac output. However, we were unable to demonstrate any significant clinical benefit of BiPAP over CPAP, including in the subgroup of patients who received titrated BiPAP support and in patients with significant hypercapnia. The reasons for the lack of benefit from BiPAP as compared with CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema remain uncertain.

If we assume that the proportion of patients who may require invasive ventilation or intubation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema is 10%, then the sample size of this meta-analysis (n = 290) could only achieve a positive significant result if the relative risk reduction for requiring intubation is more than 80% when BiPAP is compared with CPAP. On the other hand, if the relative risk reduction for requiring intubation after use of BiPAP is more modest (for example, 40%), then a sample size of more than 600 patients would be needed to demonstrate such a difference. Therefore, it is still possible that BiPAP is superior to CPAP in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema but that this meta-analysis was underpowered to detect such a modest effect. A large randomized controlled study is needed to confirm whether BiPAP is equivalent or superior to CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.

Statistical analyses

The differences in categorical outcomes between the treatment and placebo group were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a random effect model. The effects of CPAP or BiPAP on the hospital mortality and the need for invasive ventilation were further stratified into studies using either a fixed level or variable levels of airway pressure during BiPAP treatment, and this interaction was tested by relative risk ratio. The differences in the duration of noninvasive ventilation required until the pulmonary oedema resolved and the length of hospital stay were reported as weighted mean differences (WMDs), using a random effect model. The presence of heterogeneity between trials was assessed using the χ 2 statistics and the extent of inconsistency was assessed using I 2 statistics. Because hypercapnia is a predictor of requiring intubation in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, sensitivity analysis was conducted to include studies that involved patients with hypercapnia (mean PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg) before initiation of either CPAP or BiPAP. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot using hospital mortality as an end-point.

### High flow biphasic positive airway pressure by helmet – effects on pressurization, tidal volume, carbon dioxide accumulation and noise exposure [^114ZaR8o]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- HF-BiPAP provides adequate pressurization at low levels of assistance. It is effective in both restrictive and obstructive lung conditions, even when there is high inspiratory effort.

- HF-BiPAP compensates a pressure drop below the lower pressure level during inspiration more efficiently than time-cycled pressure control or PSV.

- HF-BiPAP delivers tidal volumes that are comparable with BiVent or PSV. These volumes are even more efficient at low levels of assistance and higher respiratory rates.

- HF-BiPAP ensures an efficient CO 2 washout, regardless on the effort and clinical condition.

### BiPAP in acute respiratory failure due to myasthenic crisis may prevent intubation [^113MRw5i]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation using bilevel positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) has not been studied in acute respiratory failure caused by MG. Eleven episodes in nine patients were initially managed with BiPAP, and endotracheal intubation was avoided in seven of these trials. Presence of hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than 50 mm Hg) at onset predicted BiPAP failure and subsequent intubation. Results of this preliminary study suggest that a trial of BiPAP may prevent intubation in patients with myasthenic crisis without overt hypercapnia.

Age-adjusted subgroup forest plots derived using a meta-regression analysis for EF and TF are shown in Figure 5. The effect estimates appear similar for EF, whereas for TF, NRS appeared to be more effective in infants 6 months and younger. The interaction coefficient B (log odds ratio [OR] with 95% CrI) for EF was 0.25 (−1.60 to 2.06) with a DIC of 31.7. The interaction coefficient for TF was −1.21 (−2.91 to 0.25) with a DIC of 31.4. Thus, the covariate-adjusted models did not offer notable improvement in DIC compared with the unadjusted models (DIC = 30.4), and the 95% CrI of the interaction coefficient includes the possibility of no interaction for both the outcomes. The 95% CrI of the interaction coefficient for TF was close to the level of significance, suggesting that all 3 interventions (HFNC, CPAP, and BiPAP) may be more effective than COT in infants. In this age-adjusted model, CPAP remained the best ranked treatment, with a SUCRA of 0.82 for EF and 0.89 for TF.

### A potential complication of bi-level positive airway pressure after gastric bypass surgery [^116Xid5a]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) is a common treatment modality for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), especially in the morbidly obese population. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of any adverse effects of BIPAP on patients who undergo weight loss surgical procedures.

Methods

We report 2 patients who were treated with BIPAP in the postoperative period following open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). Their clinical courses and outcomes are presented.

Results

The patients developed massive bowel distention following treatment with BIPAP and subsequently developed anastomotic leaks.

Conclusion

BIPAP following RYGBP may not be a completely benign treatment modality. We advise caution and careful monitoring during the use of BIPAP after gastric bypass surgery.

### Protocol for a group-sequential two-stratum multicenter open-label randomized clinical trial of respiratory support in infants with acute bronchiolitis: breathing assistance in children with bronchiolitis (BACHb) [^113Ubcou]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice During the Trial

In both strata, to minimize variations in practice, sites will follow study guidance for the commencement, continued delivery and weaning of treatment (Figs. 1 and 2). Infants will be assessed for tolerance, response and readiness to wean the assigned treatment at least every 6 hours. A BACHb trial nurse educator will support and train sites to deliver all trial-related treatments.

Figure 1.
Algorithm for the initiation, weaning, switching, and escalation of treatment for the moderate stratum. BIPAP = bilevel positive pressure ventilation, CPAP = continuous positive airway pressure, FLACC = Face, Legs, Activity, Crying, and Consolability, HFNC = high-flow nasal cannula, HSO = humidified standard oxygen, Sp 2 = oxygen saturation.

BIPAP = bilevel positive pressure ventilation, CPAP = continuous positive airway pressure, FLACC = Face, Legs, Activity, Crying, and Consolability, HFNC = high-flow nasal cannula, Sp 2 = oxygen saturation.

If patients meet treatment failure criteria, they may be switched to the other arm within their allocated stratum or escalated to a higher form of respiratory support (including intubation) as "rescue treatment". Patients escalated to bilevel positive pressure ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation will be treated as per usual site practice (this will not be determined by the trial protocol). All other aspects of care including sedation and feeding for infants receiving the trial treatments will be decided by the treating clinical team.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^115VWXVU]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible studies, of which seven studies, including a total of 290 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were subjected to meta-analysis (Figure 1). Two studies used fixed level of CPAP (10 cmH 2 O) and BiPAP (15 and 5 cmH 2 O), two studies used a fixed level of CPAP (10 cmH 2 O) but titrated the level of peak inspiratory pressure in the BiPAP group (from 15 cmH 2 O to achieve a tidal volume of 400 ml), and three studies titrated the level of both CPAP (5–20 cmH 2 O) and BiPAP (peak inspiratory pressure range: 10–25 cmH 2 O). Four studies recruited patients who presented with hypercapnia (mean PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg). The mean age of the patients ranged from 61 to 77 years and the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores ranged from 17 to 20 in the pooled studies. The Jadad scale scores of the studies ranged from 2 to 5 (mean 3). Allocation concealment was clearly adequate in four studies but only one study used double blinding. The study details are described in Table 1.

There was good overall consistency in most of the results, without significant heterogeneity. Hospital mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.32–1.78; P = 0.52; I² = 0%) and the risk for requiring invasive ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33–1.94; P = 0.62; I² = 0%) were not significantly different between patients treated with CPAP and those treated with BiPAP (Figures 2 and 3). Stratifying studies into use of BiPAP at variable or fixed level of airway pressure did not change the results. The relative risk ratios for hospital mortality and requiring invasive ventilation between studies using BiPAP at a fixed level and studies titrating the pressure were 3.38 (95% CI 0.30–37.60; P = 0.32) and 1.26 (95% CI 0.15–10.94; P = 0.83), respectively. Sensitivity analysis including studies that involved patients with significant hypercapnia did not change the results.

### A comparison of continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema: a meta-analysis [^113G42JZ]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients with new onset myocardial infarction was reported in four studies but there were some inconsistencies in the results. Two studies reported an insignificant increase in risk for new onset acute myocardial infarction and two studies did not show such an effect. Pooling the limited data together from these four studies resulted in an insignificant trend toward an increase in risk for new onset myocardial infarction. However, patients recruited in these studies were, by nature, at high risk for developing acute myocardial infarction, either before or during the early phase of hospitalization. The small total number of patients included in these four studies (n = 167) could have generated a trend toward a false-positive result caused either by a small imbalance in baseline characteristics of the patients or by just a random effect. Nevertheless, use of excessive airway pressure in CPAP or BiPAP has been demonstrated to reduce cardiac output, especially when the left atrial filling pressure is less than 12 mmHg. When BiPAP was compared with conventional medical therapy (without CPAP) in two moderate size randomized controlled studies, there were no significant differences in the incidence of new onset acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, when BiPAP was compared with high-dose intravenous isosorbide-dinitrate in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, there was a significant increase in myocardial infarction in patients treated with BiPAP. Therefore, a small increase in risk for reducing cardiac output and/or inducing myocardial ischaemia with BiPAP cannot completely be excluded.

Cost-effectiveness analyses were not reported in any of the pooled studies. A CPAP machine is, in general, cheaper than a BiPAP machine. Based on the lack of significant clinical benefit identified in this meta-analysis, use of BiPAP instead of CPAP is unlikely to be cost-effective in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Formal cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered if a large randomized controlled study comparing BiPAP and CPAP in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema is planned.

### Days spent on non-invasive ventilation support: can it determine when to initiate VV-ECMO? Observational study in a cohort of COVID-19 patients [^1145z2Cj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of days spent on mechanical ventilation before interventions, such as venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) or steroids, has been used to classify different clinical stages of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This classification tries to differentiate between an early phase, most of the times defined within the first week from endotracheal intubation (ETI) when interventions could potentially change the ARDS evolution, and a late phase, normally more than seven days from ETI when interventions would theoretically be ineffective. This classification, where day 0 is defined by the day of ETI, represents a somewhat historic cohort given that in the past most of the patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) were not treated with any form of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) prior to ETI.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of NIV for hypoxemic ARF extraordinarily increased, initially due to logistical reasons, but soon after it became a more standard practice with observational reports showing that this NIV approach could be associated with a decrease in mortality (although study designs do not allow inferring causality) especially when compared to that of an early intubation approach. NIV in whatever form it be, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), probably heralds the initial stage of alveolar collapse of ARDS where positive pressure is required to maintain adequate oxygenation. HFNC can be included as a NIV modality but important differences exist in the level of positive pressure that can provide support to reduce the work of breathing and improve oxygenation. Furthermore, important concerns still exist respect to the effect that these pressures may have in the lung specially regarding the patient's self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) hypothesis although no solid scientific data has demonstrated so far that invasive ventilation would be less harmful than NIV, especially when high PEEP is required or recruitment manoeuvres are performed.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^1133ywb8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transpulmonary pressure monitoring

TPP- monitoring was initiated in subjects suffering from CARDS as per decision of the treating physician to optimize ventilator settings (plateau pressure, PEEP, tidal volume): In case of an endexpiratory TPP < 0mbar PEEP was increased (targeting an endexpiratory TPP of 0–10mbar) whereas in case of an endinspiratory TPP > 20–25mbar plateau pressure or tidal volume was reduced (as per hospital protocol) to target an endinspiratory TPP < 20mbar. TPP was always measured before and after a change of the ventilation mode or ventilator settings, in case of patient deterioration and as per the treating physician´s request. TPP was monitored using esophageal pressure as a surrogate for pleural pressure with a special nasogastric tube (NGT) (Nutrivent™, Löwenstein Medical) with an inflatable esophageal balloon. This NGT was positioned like a regular nasogastric tube after exclusion of contraindications. TPP was consecutively calculated by the difference of plateau pressure in inspiratory hold (representing alveolar pressure) and esophageal pressure. For the description of the correct positioning of the NGT Nutrivent™ tube and the explanation of the derived parameters (endinspiratory TPP, endexpoiratory TPP, elastance- derived TPP) please see the summary in the supplement (text 1).

Comparison of APRV- and BIPAP- mode

All subjects included in this study were ventilated in BIPAP in supine position initially with settings according to the ARDSnet recommendations. Patients with refractory hypoxemia in BIPAP- mode had a trial in APRV in supine position at the discretion of the intensive care consultant, according to the local practice. In this analysis, esophageal pressure, TPP, ventilator settings and pressures, arterial blood gas (ABG)-results (PaO 2, PaCO 2), sedation requirements, grade of sedation (GCS- and RASS- Score) and hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure, dosage of vasopressor support) were assessed in BIPAP and APRV. To increase the monitored timeframe in both ventilator modes, the mean / median values of the three last measurements of these parameters in BIPAP were compared to the respective values of the first three measurements in APRV. Intervals between the timepoints of the individual measurements were 1–2 h apart.

### CPAP and bi-level PAP therapy: new and established roles [^117KY1ZU]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past few decades, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea has evolved into more and more sophisticated modes of therapy for various forms of sleep-disordered breathing. While the principles of splinting the airway and delivering assisted ventilation underpin the basics of this therapy, the introduction of newer technologies and miniaturization are revolutionizing the former conventions of the field. The purpose of this review is to improve our understanding of various forms of PAP therapy by providing the rationale for such modalities, gaining a basic working knowledge of device technology, and critically assessing the clinical research evidence while identifying barriers to implementation. Dissemination of such information is vital in order to prevent knowledge gaps in healthcare providers and systems.

BACKGROUND

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic is characterized by rapid respiratory decompensation and subsequent need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Approximately 3%–17% of hospitalized patients require invasive mechanical ventilation. – Current recommendations advocate for early intubation, with many also advocating the avoidance of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation such as high-flow nasal cannula, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and bag-masking as they increase the risk of transmission through generation of aerosols. –

### An observational study of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in an out-of-hospital setting [^1116L195]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Out-of-hospital clinical experience with noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation is extremely limited compared to inhospital management. The aims of this study were to assess the feasibility of out-of-hospital BiPAP ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress of various origins, and to look for specific factors associated with failure of this respiratory support.

Methods

This 2-year prospective observational study assessed the failure rate of out-of-hospital BiPAP ventilation, the difficulties encountered, and factors predictive of failure by multivariate analysis.

Results

Overall, 138 patients were treated by out-of-hospital BiPAP for congestive heart failure (56%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (28%), and acute respiratory failure (16%). Failure rate was 26% (35/138; 95% confidence interval, 18%-33%) (11 before and 24 after reaching hospital). Independent risk factors were the cause of respiratory distress (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation; acute respiratory failure) and an audible air leakage.

Conclusions

The failure rate of BiPAP initiated out-of-hospital was no different from previous reports for inhospital failure rates. Failure was attributable to similar causes.

Positive airway pressure (CPAP/BPAP/APAP) — indications and titration: PAP may be delivered in continuous (CPAP), bilevel (BPAP), or autotitrating (APAP) modes, and partial pressure reduction during expiration (pressure relief) can also be added. CPAP is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe OSA (Standard) and mild OSA (Option); it is also indicated for improving self-reported sleepiness (Standard), improving quality of life (Option), and as an adjunctive therapy to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients with OSA (Option). Full-night, attended PSG performed in the laboratory is the preferred approach for titration to determine the optimal PAP level; however, split-night, diagnostic-titration studies are usually adequate (Guideline), and CPAP devices are currently recommended for split-night titration (Standard). Certain APAP devices may be used during attended titration with PSG to identify a single pressure for use with standard CPAP for treatment of moderate to severe OSA (Guideline), and certain APAP devices may be used in an unattended way to determine a fixed CPAP treatment pressure for patients with moderate to severe OSA without significant comorbidities (Option). BPAP, pressure relief, or APAP can be considered in the management of OSA in CPAP-intolerant patients (Consensus); BPAP is an optional therapy in some cases where high pressure is needed and the patient experiences difficulty exhaling against a fixed pressure or coexisting central hypoventilation is present (Guideline); and pressure waveform modification technologies (such as pressure relief) may improve patient comfort and adherence with PAP (Consensus).

### Positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea [^112wLVLh]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) is considered first-line therapy for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and may also be considered for mild obstructive sleep apnea, particularly if it is symptomatic or there are concomitant cardiovascular disorders. Continuous PAP is most commonly used. Other modes, such as bilevel airway pressure, autotitrating positive airway pressure, average volume assured pressure support, and adaptive support ventilation, play important roles in the management of sleep-related breathing disorders. This article outlines the indications, description, and comfort features of each mode. Despite the proven efficacy of PAP in treating obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and its sequelae, adherence to therapy is low. Close follow-up of patients for evaluation of adherence to and effectiveness of treatment is important.

### Investigating the effectiveness of combining high-frequency chest wall oscillation with bilevel positive airway pressure in pneumonia patients: a retrospective cohort study [^112PY4Zu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia remains a major public health concern worldwide, with significant mortality and morbidity rates, particularly among hospitalized patients. Despite advances in prevention and treatment, including antibiotics, the high incidence of pneumonia continues to impose a heavy burden on healthcare systems. Although supportive therapies such as oxygen therapy and chest physiotherapy (CPT) have proven beneficial, there is increasing interest in optimizing airway clearance strategies in pneumonia patients to improve clinical outcomes.

Airway clearance techniques (ACT) play a crucial role in managing conditions where mucus accumulation and airway obstruction contribute to respiratory compromise. High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), a well-established ACT, has been shown to improve secretion clearance by using an inflatable vest to generate rapid inflation and deflation, transmitting oscillations through the chest wall to mobilize mucus from the lungs. While HFCWO has demonstrated efficacy in conditions like cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchiectasis, its application in pneumonia, particularly in combination with other treatments, remains underexplored. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides positive airway pressure during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases via a non-invasive interface, has been shown to provide clinical benefits for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, heart failure-related respiratory failure, post-extubation, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally, several pilot studies have demonstrated that BiPAP, when used to support ACT, can augment tidal volumes and reduce patient effort, thereby enhancing sputum clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis or severe obstructive disease. However, the clinical benefits of combining BiPAP and HFCWO for pneumonia treatment have yet to be fully evaluated.

In this study, we hypothesized that the combination of BiPAP and HFCWO would yield superior clinical outcomes compared to either treatment alone or no additional treatment. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective cohort study at a college hospital in southern Taiwan to investigate the clinical effectiveness of this combination therapy in pneumonia patients.

### Effect of average volume-assured pressure support treatment on health-related quality of life in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure: a randomized trial [^1174cN7X]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COPD Patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure; experience respiratory symptoms and physical incapacity that negatively influence health status, which itself is a predictor of frequent hospitalizations and higher mortality.

Hence, the principal purpose of the study is to assess the impact of AVAPS treatment in COPD patients with CHRF on health status; through a structured interview incorporates the Short Form 12 (SF-12) over a 6-month duration. The SF-12 has been exhibited to be a valid evaluation tool that enables to calculate the physical well-being and the mental-well being components of HRQOL.

The main findings in this study, treatment with AVAPS, led to significant 6- month improvements in several domains of HRQOL, with the most significant increase seen in the general health domain. The effect is stronger on the physical than the mental aspects of health status. Prior studies in COPD patients with stable hypercapnic respiratory failure have demonstrated that patients receiving home-based NiPPV reported more restful sleep when using AVAPS as compared with conventional NiPPV. However, up to date, no study has consistently addressed the benefit of AVAPS on HRQOL.

Another important consideration in this study is adherence to therapy during the long-term use of AVAPS. In one study, Kelly et al. reported that AVAPS led to one additional hour per night of use compared with conventional PS. Such improvements in adherence could have an impact on patient outcomes.

Concerning gasometric parameters, we compared ABG values (PaCO 2, Pa O 2, and HCO3) at baseline and after 6 months of AVAPS treatment. We observed overall ABG alterations in both groups but a significant reduction in PaCO 2 after 6 months in the AVAPS treated group. Crisafulli et al. previously reported improved gas exchange in hypercapnic COPD patients who received AVAPS. Moreover, a recent randomized trial comparing patient satisfaction between (ST/BiPAP with AVAPS) and ST/BiPAP alone in 22 COPD patients; has shown that overall comfort and patient satisfaction was higher in the AVAPS group as an adjunct to standard BiPAP S/T therapy (1.64 ± 2.77 vs. 1.09 ± 3.02). Besides, they found a greater decrease in blood pressure, heart rate, and blood gases with S/T AVAPS group compared with the ST/BiPAP group. Therefore, COPD patients might benefit from the theoretical advantage of a guaranteed tidal volume during nocturnal ventilation.

### Management of respiratory failure in immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced overlap syndrome: a case series and review of the literature [^1113FTvw]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Bedside respiratory mechanics test and arterial blood gas can be used as prognostic indicators in a variety of diseases, but their use in NMRF and OS is poorly understood. Findings in early NMRF include hyperventilation with rapid/shallow breaths resulting in hypocapnia that progress in late NMRF to hypoventilation with hypercapnia. When PaCO 2 reaches between 40–45 mmHg and pH < 7.35, this indicates respiratory failure. However, bedside respiratory mechanics tests have been assessed to predict the need for respiratory support. In a study by Seneviratne and colleagues, arterial gases had poor predictive value of the duration and outcome of NIV or IMV in myasthenic crisis. Contrarily, a systematic review showed that patients with a maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) > 40 cm H 2 O, vital capacity (VC) > 20 mL/kg or maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) < -40 cm H 2 O typically do not need mechanical ventilation. Due to the fluctuating clinical course of NMRF in OS, symptom severity is not a reliable predictor of improvement and stability. Nonetheless, general principles should be used to treat the underlying neuromuscular disorder, use NIV in eligible patients, and IMV when necessary. While there is not much data regarding treatment of NMRF in OS, we can use this case series and myasthenic crisis as a reference that warrants further investigation.

Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is preferred in myasthenic crisis because it can model natural respiratory mechanics. Ventilatory failure due to respiratory fatigue and dysfunction are the predominant mechanism of NMRF. BiPAP allows for modifiable and continuous positive pressures that decreases the risk for both atelectasis and upper airway collapse. The benefits of BiPAP are significant, as 20% of patients in myasthenic crisis can be supported solely by NIV. Predictors of NIV success include an Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II score < 6, bicarbonate < 30 mEq/L, and absence of overt hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 50 mmHg strongly correlated with failure; p < 0.01). Patients managed initially with NIV prior to intubation require a shorter duration of ventilator support in comparison to patients only managed with IMV (4 vs. 9 days). Furthermore, prolonged IMV increases the risk of atelectasis, lowers MEP and is a frequent cause of longer ICU stays due to ventilator-associated pneumonia and other systemic complications. A BiPAP trial before established hypercapnia can prevent prolonged ventilation and intubation.

### Effect of positive airway pressure on cardiac troponins in patients with sleep-disordered breathing: a meta-analysis [^116WD5tb]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sleep‐disordered breathing (SDB) is a chronic condition characterized by repeated episodes of complete cessation or reduction of airflow during sleep. The resulting apneas and hypopneas can lead to intermittent hypoxemia and arousals from sleep. SDB encompasses a spectrum of abnormalities, including Cheyne–Stokes respiration (CSR), central sleep apnea (CSA), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). SDB is highly prevalentand is associated with many forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

Troponin is a protein complex found in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Cardiac troponins (cTnI and cTnT) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for myocardial cell injury allowing for early detection of acute coronary syndromes. In addition to the diagnostic value, elevated cardiac troponins were demonstrated to have a close correlation with adverse cardiovascular outcome whether coronary artery disease is present or not. Highly sensitive assays have been introduced that detect levels nearly 10‐fold lower than those detectable with the standard assay. The increased levels of cardiac troponin have been observed in SDB patients in previous studies.

Positive airway pressure (PAP, such as continuous PAP [CPAP], adaptive servo‐ventilation [ASV], or bi‐level PAP [BiPAP]) is the most effective nonsurgical treatment choice for moderate‐severe SDB. Whether PAP treatment has an impact on cardiac troponins in patients with SDB remains unclear. The purpose of this meta‐analysis was to quantitatively examine the effect of PAP treatment on cardiac troponins in patients with SDB.

Postextubation noninvasive respiratory support — Infants extubated to nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) were less likely to fail extubation than those extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (NCPAP) [RR = 0.21, CI95 (0.10, 0.45); NNT 3, CI95 (2, 5)]. In neonates and premature infants, binasal prong CPAP is more effective at preventing re-intubation than single nasal or nasopharyngeal prongs [RR = 0.59, CI95 (0.41, 0.85); NNT 5, CI95 (3, 14)]. In adults, routine use of postextubation noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation such as BIPAP is not recommended. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 cm H2O and pressure support ventilation (PSV) of 15 cm H2O have improved pulmonary gas exchange, decreased intrapulmonary shunt fraction, and reduced work of breathing.

### Noninvasive mechanical ventilation with average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypercapnic encephalopathy [^116tMACo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is used in patients with acute respiratory failure for several different etiologies. The heterogeneity of different patient groups leads to varying levels of success, with the best results produced in patients with infectious exacerbations of COPD and congestive heart failure. When NIV is initiated in patients with acute respiratory failure due to infectious exacerbations of COPD, ventilatory parameters are typically determined based on clinical assessment and changes in blood gases. In this manner, NIV support pressures are manually adjusted by an operator.

One of the limitations of traditional NIV is altered levels of consciousness. However, under certain circumstances, especially those produced by hypercapnic conditions, traditional NIV has produced very favorable results, even in patients with hypercapnic coma.

Patients with infectious exacerbations of COPD have obstruction, hyperinflation, air trapping, and increased respiratory effort and central respiratory drive. In particular, blood pCO 2 increases, which, due to its high lipid solubility, readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, provoking acidosis in the cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral interstitial tissue.

Previous studies that recommend the use of NIV in patients with altered consciousness report a rapid recovery as soon as the ventilatory strategy is established, and most recommend early intubation and suspension of treatment if consciousness does not quickly normalize. Altered levels of consciousness can be assessed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the encephalopathy scoring, and the Kelly-Matthay Scale (KMS). Although KMS is specifically designed to assess patients with neurological disorders on NIV, it is not commonly used in the emergency unit/ICU.

Bilevel positive airway pressure-spontaneous/timed (BiPAP S/T) with average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) allows for setting a fixed tidal volume, and the system output automatically adjusts based on variations in inspiratory pressure to ensure the predetermined target value. Its long-term benefits have been demonstrated in patients with chronic respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and alveolar hypoventilation syndrome.

We designed this study to assess the use of BiPAP S/T with AVAPS as a ventilatory strategy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnic encephalopathy (GCS < 10) and to compare these results with those from patients treated with BiPAP S/T alone, upon immediate arrival in the emergency department/ICU.

### Bi-level noninvasive ventilation in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111X9AiW]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bi-level noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used in respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) as primary treatment, post-extubation, and to treat apnea. This review summarizes studies on bi-level NIV in premature infants with RDS. Nonsynchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nsNIPPV) and synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV) use pressure settings ≥ those used during mechanical ventilation (MV), and biphasic continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP) use two nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) levels ≤ 4 cm H2O apart.

Methods

A systematic review (Medline OVID and Pubmed) and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Primary outcomes were bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality. Secondary outcomes included NIV failure (intubation) and extubation failure (re-intubation). Data were pooled using a fixed-effects model to calculate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) between NIV modes (RevMan v 5.3, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Results

Twenty-four randomized controlled trials that largely did not correct for mean airway pressure (MAP) and used outdated ventilators were included. Compared with NCPAP, both nsNIPPV and SNIPPV resulted in less re-intubation (RR 0.88 with 95% CI (0.80, 0.97) and RR 0.20 (0.10, 0.38), respectively) and BPD (RR 0.69 (0.49, 0.97) and RR 0.51 (0.29, 0.88), respectively). nsNIPPV also resulted in less intubation (RR 0.57 (0.45, 0.73) versus NCPAP, with no difference in mortality. One study showed less intubation in BiPAP versus NCPAP.

Conclusions

Bi-level NIV versus NCPAP may reduce MV and BPD in premature infants with RDS. Studies comparing equivalent MAP utilizing currently available machines are needed.

### Typical within and between person variability in non-invasive ventilator derived variables among clinically stable, long-term users [^111rhtCj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Results

One hundred and one patients were screened for enrolment between April 2018 and October 2019, 4 were ineligible and 29 agreed to participate in the study. Four did not tolerate the new ventilator and withdrew. Of those who withdrew, only one had more than 5 days of data. Two participants had failure of the data to record and/or be retrieved. Data from another four patients failed to upload remotely, however, manual retrieval and upload of ventilator data was possible at the end of the study period. No data upload issues were experienced with the newer ventilator model (Philips Respironics DreamStation BiPAP). Twenty-four participants' data were included in the final analyses. One participant using the A30 did not use a humidifier, and thus no usage (time) data were available for analyses.

The mean age of analysed participants was 54.0 years (SD 18.4), with a male predominance (58.3%) and mean body mass index of 37.0 kg/m 2 (13.7). The median length of NIV usage was 9.5 years (IQR; 15.2). Oro-nasal masks were used by 18 participants and nasal masks by 6. The most common indication for long-term assisted ventilation was obesity hypoventilation syndrome (41.7%), followed by neuromuscular (29.1%), restrictive chest wall (16.7%) and obstructive lung disease (12.5%). Participant numbers across diagnostic categories were too small for meaningful statistical analyses, but pulmonary and respiratory muscle function values reflected the diagnostic groups (table 1). Pressure support was set similarly across participants, but expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) was predictably higher in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

### Comparison of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) versus biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) ventilation in COVID-19 associated ARDS using transpulmonary pressure monitoring [^113LJRLu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

During the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, many Intensive Care patients presented with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID 19)-associated-ARDS (CARDS). Though fulfilling the Berlin definition, CARDS differs from ARDS of other pathophysiology. Patients suffering from CARDS often show signs of severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation. Mortality of CARDS remains high and ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI) might be a major contributor.

Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) has been used as a "rescue mode" of ventilation in managing patients with ARDS of other origin in the past to improve oxygenation and to keep the lung open (open lung concept) more consistently and more homogeneously. APRV and other modes of biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) represent a pressure targeted intermittent mandatory ventilation ranging biphasically between an upper and lower pressure level. But in contrast to BIPAP, APRV delivers continuous positive pressure (P high) for a preset of prolonged inspiratory time (T high) with intermittent releases to a lower pressure level (P low) at a preset of a shortened expiratory time (T low). This shortened expiratory time in APRV is supposed to create an intrinsic PEEP which ideally avoids cyclic derecruitment and reduces cyclical opening and collapse of lungs. But unfortunately, in APRV intrinsic PEEP and driving pressure can be difficult to measure and may be unreliable predictors of atelectasis.

Moreover, as prolonged inspiratory times resulting in increased mean airway pressures, are characteristic for APRV, this mode is supposed to establish alveolar recruitment, improvement of lung compliance and optimization of ventilation in relation to alveolar perfusion. Vice versa, other studies highlight the potential risk of baro- or volutrauma in APRV. This might especially be problematic in CARDS, a typically heterogenous lung disease.

Unfortunately, conventional ventilator monitoring is an insufficient detector for the risk of VILI. Transpulmonary pressure (TPP) could be a useful tool to detect an increased risk for baro-, volu- and atelectrauma in mechanically ventilated patients. So far, there is little knowledge about the risk of VILI in APRV vs. BIPAP in CARDS. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether there are differences regarding the risk of volu-, baro- and atelectrauma in patients suffering from CARDS comparing ventilation in APRV- vs. BIPAP- mode by monitoring endinspiratory and endexpiratory TPP.

Respiratory devices are used to help breathing. Patients may use respiratory devices at home or in a clinical setting, such as a hospital. Examples of Respiratory Devices Continuous Ventilators Mechanically controls or helps patients' breathing while delivering a set amount of oxygen. Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Machines Pumps air under varying pressure into the airway of the lungs. BiPAP machines use a higher pressure when you breathe in and lower pressure when you breathe out. These devices are also prescribed to people with obstructive sleep apnea to keep their airways open during sleep. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machines Keeps your airway open by providing a stream of air at a continuous pressure through a mask. CPAP machines are often prescribed to people with obstructive sleep apnea to keep their airways open during sleep.

### Treatment for acute asthma exacerbations… [^114uQ8qC]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Guidelines for the management of acute asthma exacerbations recommend noninvasive ventilation as an "experimental approach for treatment of respiratory failure due to severe asthma exacerbation. "1 Clinicians in our tertiary pediatric emergency department have the option to use bilevel positive airway pressure as treatment for children with asthma exacerbations who have no signs of respiratory failure. We sought to examine whether these patients have improved clinical outcomes. Methods The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Vanderbilt University. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents and verbal assent from the participants.

We performed a secondary analysis of data from a prospective observational study of 933 children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years who were admitted to our pediatric emergency department with acute asthma exacerbations. The objective of the parent study was to develop a clinical prediction rule for acute asthma exacerbations. 2 For each participant, we performed a comprehensive pulmonary examination and calculated the Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score before treatment. 3 The clinical team was not provided with the results of the pulmonary examination or the AAIRS. Our primary predictor variable was BiPAP treatment among participants who did not have signs of respiratory failure.

1 Outcomes included hospital admission, admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, hospital length of stay, and time to spacing of albuterol inhalation to every 4 hours based on severity scoring by respiratory therapists. Individual clinicians may, for a given patient, have different preferences for use of BiPAP treatment and different likelihoods for hospital or PICU admission. These preferences may result in confounding by indication, in which BiPAP-treated patients have a risk for relevant outcomes dependent on nonindependent clinician characteristics. Estimating associations of BiPAP treatment with these outcomes in multivariable regression models may not adjust for this confounding. To adjust for confounding by indication, we used propensity scoring that fitted a multiple regression model, with BiPAP treatment as the dependent variable.

4–6 Model predictors included the following covariates that might influence clinician decisions for BiPAP treatment: the individual pretreatment AAIRS components, age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, symptom duration, prior PICU admission for asthma, prior respiratory failure due to asthma, insurance type, and clinician type deciding whether to use BiPAP treatment. The output of this model was a propensity score ranging from 0 to 1 that estimated the adjusted probability of being treated with BiPAP. We then performed propensity score–matching analysis in which BiPAP-treated participants were matched 1: 3 by the propensity score with participants not treated with BiPAP, without replacement.
