## Question

does the hsv 1 IgG and hsv 2 IgG confirm herpes? can you have herpes if the results are non reactive?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether HSV-1/2 IgG serology definitively confirms herpes, and whether someone can still have herpes if the IgG test is non-reactive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what HSV IgG assays actually detect and what they do not. Then, I should review assay performance, including sensitivity, specificity, and the problem of low-positive index values. Next, I will integrate clinical context and define when an IgG result is confirmatory versus when lesion PCR is needed. After that, I need to examine reasons for non-reactive IgG despite true infection and outline retesting strategies. Finally, I should align recommendations with guidelines to frame appropriate use cases and counseling points [^11569rZ7] [^1118HTaK] [^1157fx7U].

> Let me first confirm what these tests measure. Type-specific HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays target glycoprotein G antigens (gG1 for HSV-1, gG2 for HSV-2), indicating prior exposure and an adaptive immune response; they do not establish anatomic site, timing of acquisition, or whether there is active shedding at the time of testing, so a positive IgG is evidence of past infection, not necessarily current disease activity [^116izgFD] [^11569rZ7] [^112fMEv8].

> Next, I should review test performance across platforms. High-quality comparisons against Western blot show substantial variability: for HSV-2, Roche typically performs best with high sensitivity and specificity, whereas DiaSorin tends to have lower specificity and more false positives; for HSV-1, all automated assays have weaker performance than for HSV-2, with meaningful false negatives and false positives compared to Western blot as the reference standard [^1118HTaK] [^1122UiLa] [^1124YUrG]. Wait, I initially recalled that HSV-1 sensitivity was around 97% on some platforms; let me verify and correct that — more rigorous cohorts show HSV-1 IgG sensitivities can fall well below 90% depending on the instrument, underscoring that HSV-1 serology is less reliable than HSV-2 serology across assays [^116aS4LE] [^1118HTaK].

> Hold on, I should double-check the issue of low-positive index values because that often drives misclassification. Low-positive results, commonly defined as index or cutoff values below about 3.0–3.5, carry disproportionately high false-positive rates and reduced positive predictive value, particularly on DiaSorin and in low-prevalence settings; modeling at an HSV-2 prevalence near 12% yields a positive predictive value for DiaSorin of roughly 69%, meaning nearly one in three positive results may be false without confirmatory testing [^115fShAF] [^113jtARy]. I need to ensure I emphasize that confirmatory strategies, such as repeat testing or Western blot, are indicated when the index is in this low-positive range before labeling someone as infected [^1118HTaK] [^1124YUrG].

> Let me consider cross-reactivity and discordant patterns. I should confirm the observation that false positivity is enriched when antibodies to the other HSV type are present; indeed, samples positive for HSV-2 by Western blot are more likely to test falsely positive for HSV-1 on certain automated instruments, and vice versa, with DiaSorin accounting for the majority of false positives across several comparisons, which reinforces caution with isolated low-positive results [^1122UiLa] [^114j2Esg].

> Now, to the clinical question, I need to be precise: Does a positive HSV IgG confirm herpes? A positive HSV-2 IgG generally confirms lifelong HSV-2 infection, but it does not diagnose an active outbreak; furthermore, in the low-positive range, confirmation is recommended before making a definitive diagnosis, especially in low-prevalence populations or when the clinical history is inconsistent [^11569rZ7] [^115fShAF]. For HSV-1, a positive IgG establishes prior exposure but cannot localize site; given rising genital HSV-1 incidence, serostatus alone cannot distinguish oral from genital disease, and test performance constraints make confirmation and clinical correlation especially important for low-positive results [^112fMEv8] [^1118HTaK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "confirmation" of active herpes. I should verify the diagnostic standard for active disease. For patients with compatible lesions, direct testing of lesions by PCR is the gold standard for diagnosing active genital or oral HSV; serology supports epidemiologic assessment, partner risk counseling, and diagnostic clarification in atypical or recurrent presentations but does not substitute for lesion testing when available [^11569rZ7] [^116D33iw]. In suspected encephalitis, CSF PCR should be obtained and repeated if initial results are negative but clinical suspicion remains high, which underscores that nucleic acid testing, not serology, defines acute CNS disease [^114QcaQD].

> I will now examine the scenario of non-reactive IgG with true infection. But wait, what if testing was too early? Median time to seroconversion after new HSV-2 infection is around 9–10 weeks, with a wide range, so early testing can be falsely negative; rare seroreversion has also been documented, and imperfect assay sensitivity means a fraction of true infections will be missed even outside the window period [^111w41PD] [^1118HTaK]. If clinical suspicion is high due to recent exposure or typical lesions, I should recommend repeating type-specific serology in 4–6 weeks and prioritizing lesion PCR if lesions are present to close the diagnostic gap [^116D33iw] [^11569rZ7].

> Next, I should review prevalence and its impact on predictive values. In U.S. adults aged 14–49 years, HSV-2 seroprevalence is about 12% and HSV-1 around 48%, and these baseline prevalences directly influence positive predictive value, such that low-prevalence groups will have more false positives at the same index threshold, especially for HSV-2 low-positive results on less specific platforms [^116PnpZy] [^113jtARy]. I need to ensure I communicate that pretest probability based on symptoms and exposure meaningfully shifts interpretation and the need for confirmation [^1118HTaK].

> Let me integrate guideline-based use. Routine screening of asymptomatic individuals is not recommended because of limited clinical utility and false-positive harms; instead, type-specific serology is appropriate in selected contexts such as partners of persons with genital herpes, patients with atypical or recurrent lesions with negative lesion PCR, those undergoing STI evaluation with high risk, and in certain HIV or pregnancy-related scenarios where serostatus informs management and counseling [^1157fx7U] [^116D33iw] [^111kt5Ks] [^112KeUzV]. I should confirm that in pregnancy, targeted serology may be used to assess risk when the partner is known HSV-positive, rather than universal screening, aligning with obstetric guidance [^112KeUzV].

> I should double-check confirmatory pathways for indeterminate results. When results are low-positive or equivocal, repeating on a different high-specificity platform or confirming with Western blot reduces misclassification; this approach is supported by comparative studies using Western blot as the reference and by analyses showing markedly improved specificity when higher index thresholds are applied before calling a result positive [^1124YUrG] [^111TNLF5]. Let me verify that most labs may not have immediate Western blot access, which makes repeat testing on a different platform and time-based retesting practical alternatives [^1118HTaK].

> With that, I can answer the first question clearly. Does HSV-1/2 IgG confirm herpes? A positive HSV-2 IgG generally confirms prior HSV-2 infection, but low-positive index values require confirmation due to substantial false-positive rates in low-prevalence settings and on less specific platforms; a positive HSV-1 IgG confirms past exposure without localizing site or confirming active genital disease, so clinical correlation and, when relevant, lesion PCR remain necessary for active disease diagnosis [^115fShAF] [^113jtARy] [^11569rZ7] [^116D33iw].

> Now the second question. Can you have herpes if the IgG is non-reactive? Yes, particularly if testing occurs during the serologic window period or if an assay's sensitivity is limited for HSV-1 or early HSV-2 infection; repeating serology after 4–6 weeks and testing lesions by PCR when present improves diagnostic yield and avoids premature reassurance in the face of compatible symptoms or exposures [^111w41PD] [^1118HTaK] [^116D33iw] [^11569rZ7].

> Finally, let me reconsider the practical next steps to ensure nothing is missed. For low-positive results, I should confirm with Western blot when available or repeat with a different platform, especially if the clinical picture is incongruent; for symptomatic patients, prioritize lesion PCR as the definitive test for active infection; and for asymptomatic individuals at low risk, avoid routine serologic screening to minimize harm from false positives, aligning counseling and follow-up with guideline-based indications [^1124YUrG] [^1118HTaK] [^1157fx7U] [^116D33iw].

No, HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG tests do not confirm active herpes infection [^116izgFD]; they only indicate past exposure [^11569rZ7]. Yes, you can have herpes with non-reactive IgG results if testing occurs during the seronegative window [^111w41PD], in immunocompromised states, or due to assay limitations [^1118HTaK] [^111vZqFQ]. For active infection, use PCR or culture from lesions [^116D33iw], and confirm low-positive or discordant serology with a second assay or Western blot [^1118HTaK] [^115fShAF].

## Interpretation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG results

HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG tests detect type-specific antibodies to glycoprotein G (gG-1 for HSV-1, gG-2 for HSV-2) [^116izgFD] [^111SeSPb], indicating prior exposure but not active infection [^11569rZ7] [^111vZqFQ]. IgG typically develops within **2–12 weeks** [^111w41PD] after exposure and persists for life [^116izgFD].

| **Result** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|
| Positive | Prior exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2; does not confirm active infection |
| Negative | No detectable antibodies; possible no exposure, early infection, or immunosuppression |
| Equivocal | Indeterminate; repeat testing or confirmatory testing recommended |

---

## Limitations and accuracy of HSV IgG testing

HSV IgG assays have **limitations** [^1118HTaK], including false positives and negatives, cross-reactivity [^1122UiLa], and variable performance across platforms [^111vZqFQ].

- **False positives**: Cross-reactivity or nonspecific binding, especially at low index values [^115fShAF] [^1122UiLa].
- **False negatives**: Early testing before seroconversion or immunosuppression [^111w41PD] [^11569rZ7].
- **Assay variability**: Performance differs by platform; Roche HSV-2 IgG shows high sensitivity/specificity, while DiaSorin has more false positives [^1118HTaK] [^1122UiLa] [^111vZqFQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios with non-reactive IgG but active infection

Active herpes can occur with **non-reactive IgG** due to:

- **Early infection**: Testing before seroconversion (2–12 weeks) [^111w41PD] [^11569rZ7].
- **Immunosuppression**: Blunted antibody responses (e.g. HIV, chemotherapy).
- **Assay limitations**: False negatives from assay variability or low antibody levels [^1118HTaK] [^111vZqFQ].

---

## Confirmatory testing and clinical correlation

PCR or culture of active lesions is preferred for diagnosing active infection; **PCR is more sensitive** [^116D33iw] [^11569rZ7]. Western blot is the **gold standard** for serologic confirmation, particularly for discordant or low-positive results [^1118HTaK] [^1124YUrG]. Results should be interpreted in the **clinical context**, including symptoms, exposure, and risk factors [^1157fx7U] [^111vZqFQ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **targeted testing** with **confirmatory strategies**:

- **CDC guidelines**: Use a two-step algorithm (screening assay followed by confirmatory test).
- **USPSTF**: Recommends against routine serologic screening in asymptomatic adults due to false positives and limited benefit [^111vZqFQ] [^115SCbDS] [^1157fx7U].
- **AAFP guidelines**: Use type-specific serology when clinical suspicion is high or PCR/culture is negative [^116D33iw] [^1157fx7U].

---

HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG tests indicate prior exposure but **do not confirm active infection** [^11569rZ7]. Non-reactive results can occur in early infection, immunosuppression, or due to assay limitations [^111w41PD] [^1118HTaK]. Confirm active infection with **PCR or culture** [^116D33iw], and use confirmatory serology when needed [^1118HTaK].

### Clinical correlates of index values in the focus HerpeSelect ELISA for antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) [^111w41PD]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical correlates of HerpeSelect ELISA index values are poorly understood.

- **Objectives**: This study was designed to determine the effects of time of infection, test variability, and antibody avidity on index values.

- **Study design**: Sera (N = 313) from 81 patients with new HSV-2 infections and 236 sera from 32 patients with long-standing (median 11.3 years) HSV-2 were tested by HerpeSelect HSV-2 ELISA. High positive, low positive, and negative controls were run on 42 test plates to establish test variability.

- **Results**: Index values tended to rise after infection, peaking a median of 9–10 weeks post-infection (range 8–323 days). Of 32 patients with established HSV-2 infections, 7 (22%) had at least one low index value (> 1.1 to ≤ 3.5), and one had a transient seroreversion event. Test variability of index values was substantially lower than inter- or intra-patient variability. Median antibody avidity was higher in sera with high versus low index values in established infections, but unrelated to index value in patients with early infections.

- **Conclusions**: Index values or index value changes are not absolute indicators of early versus established HSV-2 infection or solely a function of test variability. Low antibody avidity may contribute to low index values once infection is established.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^111vZqFQ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

In a comparison to WB for clinical testing sample remnants, no single assay performed best for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 in the clinical remnant cohort. The DiaSorin HSV-1 IgG assay had the highest sensitivity (94.8%) but lowest specificity (90.4%), while both the Roche and Bio-Rad assays had lower sensitivities (85.9% and 87.1%, respectively) but higher specificities (98.7% and 98.2%, respectively). For measuring HSV-2 IgG, the Roche assay had the highest sensitivity (96.1%) and specificity (99.7%). The Bio-Rad HSV-2 IgG assay had a sensitivity of 91.9% and specificity of 98.8%, while the DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG assay was both the least sensitive (85.4%) and least specific (94.5%).

On initial testing, 19 results (1.0%; 8 HSV-1 and 11 HSV-2) were equivocal on the Bio-Rad assay, and 24 results (1.2%; 16 HSV-1 and 8 HSV-2) were equivocal on the DiaSorin assay. For the Bio-Rad assay, the majority of equivocal results — 88% for HSV-1 and 64% for HSV-2 — were revised to a non-equivocal final result, of which 57% of the revised results were concordant with WB. Only 12.5% of the DiaSorin equivocal results had a non-equivocal final result, but all revised results were concordant with WB (see Supplemental Material for detailed discussion). Only two samples were equivocal on more than one assay. One sample was HSV-1 IgG positive only by WB and had initially equivocal results on the Bio-Rad HSV-1 IgG assay and the DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG assay.

### Emergence of herpes simplex type 1 as the main cause of recurrent genital ulcerative disease in women in Northern Ireland [^115m1XoG]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a common infection affecting approximately 20% of sexually active people. Although herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 can both establish genital latency, reactivation from the sacral ganglia tends to favor HSV-2. Over the past decade, the incidence of type 1 genital infection in women has significantly increased.

- **Objectives**: The goal was to determine whether the increased prevalence of HSV-1 genital infection was benign or impacting the pattern of virus recovery in reinfection.

- **Study design**: A retrospective analysis of laboratory computer records was conducted. Patients attending six genitourinary medicine (GUM) departments, over an 80-month period, were identified. Reinfection was confirmed when the virus was recovered from at least two separate episodes of genital ulceration that were separated by an interval of 12 or more weeks. Episodes were further analyzed for frequency, age, gender, and virus type.

- **Results**: Sixty-nine patients with recurrent genital herpetic infections were identified. HSV-1 and HSV-2 were predominantly recovered from recurrent genital infections in females (34 HSV-1 vs. 10 HSV-2) and males (one HSV-1 vs. 24 HSV-2), respectively (P > 0.001). The mean age of females and males at the initial diagnosis was 26 and 39 years. There was no significant difference in recurrence rates between virus types.

- **Conclusions**: HSV-1 has become the most common cause of recurrent genital ulceration in Northern Ireland, largely due to its recent increased prevalence in women over the last decade. Women are experiencing genital herpetic infections at an earlier age.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1132xwoX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The initial cohort consisted of samples selected from the University of Washington (UW) HSV WB sample remnants collected from January 2022 through April 2023. Sample selection was restricted to the 5,423 samples collected within the UW Medicine system to ensure the availability of clinical metadata, to approximate a more typical HSV testing population (since all UW specimens are tested only by WB without a prior screening test), and to avoid biasing specimens toward indeterminate results sent to our reference lab for WB confirmatory testing.

	- Based on the WB results, 449 samples were randomly selected that were negative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies, 177 samples that were positive for HSV-1 and negative for HSV-2 antibodies, 182 samples that were positive for HSV-2 and negative for HSV-1 antibodies, and 184 samples that were positive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies. For each WB category, each sample came from a different person. Two individuals contributed two samples as their WB serological status changed during the sample selection timeframe, and their samples were randomly selected in two result categories.

	- Due to low sample volume, 13 of the originally selected samples were unable to be tested, leaving 979 samples from 977 individuals. Additionally, due to low sample volume and rare barcode errors, not all samples were able to be run on all instruments. The number of samples from this cohort that were run on each instrument and their concordance with the WB result are presented in Table 1.

### Risk factors for herpes simplex virus-1/2 viremia and clinical outcomes following unmanipulated haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^112cacjr]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1/2 can still be reactivated after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) even when prophylactic acyclovir is used. However, the risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia and the clinical outcomes following unmanipulated haploidentical HSCT remain unknown.

- **Objectives and study design**: Nineteen patients with HSV-1/2 viremia and fifty-seven patients without HSV-1/2 viremia were selected using the case-pair method after undergoing haploidentical HSCT. We analyzed the risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia and compared the clinical outcomes between the two groups.

- **Results**: The risk factors for HSV-1/2 viremia included HLA disparity ≥ 2 loci (p = 0.049) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (p = 0.028). The incidences of platelet engraftment, oral mucositis, and severe haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in patients with and without HSV-1/2 viremia were 77% and 94% (p = 0.003), 78% and 13% (p = 0.000), and 25% and 6% (p = 0.04), respectively. Moreover, the median time to platelet engraftment in patients with and without HSV-1/2 viremia was +25 days (range, +11-+80) and +17 days (range, +8-+67) (p = 0.004), respectively. According to the multivariate analyses, HSV-1/2 viremia was associated with delayed platelet engraftment (p = 0.038), a higher incidence of oral mucositis (p = 0.000), and severe HC (p = 0.038). However, HSV-1/2 viremia was not associated with non-relapse mortality (34.0% vs. 31.5%, p = 0.26), leukaemia-free survival (60.9% vs. 57.9%, p = 0.46), and overall survival (61.2% vs. 60.7%, p = 0.37).

- **Conclusions**: Based on our study…

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^115FgtVo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

The second cohort consisted of serum specimens from individuals with genital lesions confirmed to be PCR- or culture-positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2. These participants were followed by the UW Virology Research Clinic and had provided written informed consent approved by the UW Institutional Review Board (IRB). One serum specimen was selected from each of the 1,074 HIV-negative individuals who tested positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by PCR and/or culture and were confirmed seropositive for the corresponding HSV type by WB. Samples were obtained at least 6 months following a participant's initial episode of genital herpes.

Some individuals with HSV-2 positive genital lesions had antibodies for both HSV-2 and HSV-1 when tested with the WB. This resulted in 131 samples positive for HSV-1 only, with both viral and WB testing. There were 566 samples positive for HSV-2 only, and 320 samples positive for HSV-2 with viral testing and both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies on WB. Virological data on shedding rates in genital herpes infections (measured as the percentage of swabs positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 by non-type-specific PCR over the total number of swabs) were available from 315 of 1,017 participants in the Virology Research Clinic (VRC) cohort, with shedding rates detailed in a supplemental data file.

- **Assay comparison**: The DiaSorin Liaison HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs; K081685 and K081687; DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota, USA), the Roche cobas Elecsys HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (K120625 and K121895; Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA), and the Bio-Rad BioPlex HSV-1/2 IgG immunoassays were compared.

Serum samples were thawed, mixed, and briefly spun (700 × g for 4 min) prior to testing with the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The BioPlex assay is a multiplexed microparticle immunoassay. Briefly, serum samples are incubated with dyed beads coated with either recombinant HSV-1 gG1 antigen or a synthetic HSV-2 gG2 peptide. After washing, anti-human IgG antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin is added, and the specimens are incubated at 37°C. After another wash cycle, the mixture passes through a detector that measures the fluorescence of both the bead dye and phycoerythrin. This allows for simultaneous determination of antibody amount and antigen type (e.g. HSV-1 or HSV-2).

Relative fluorescence intensity values are converted to the antibody index (AI) using the on-board software and manufacturer-provided calibrators. An AI of 8.0 is considered a narrow measurement range. With this measurement range, only 31% of results in this study had a non-bounded numerical result (i.e. from 0.2 to 8.0). Linearity was confirmed across the measurement range (0.2–8.0 AI). Bio-Rad recommends obtaining an additional sample and repeating testing for patients with equivocal results. We could not test additional samples, but we did repeat all equivocal specimens at least twice to assess the reproducibility of these equivocal results.

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: Findings from a randomized trial [^115vB2Gd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Study participants included healthy, HSV-2–seropositive adults aged 18–50 years with a history of recurrent genital herpes for at least 1 year, experiencing 3–9 recurrences per year without antiviral suppressive therapy. HSV-2 infection was documented using Western blot, HSV-2 HerpeSelect 2 immunoglobulin G (IgG)–specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; an index value of > 3.5 indicates a positive result), HSV-2 IgG Liaison assay, or type-specific culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Confirmation for all participants was done during screening via HSV-2 IgG Liaison assay. Exclusion criteria were immunocompromised state, presence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus, presence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen, pregnancy or nursing status, history of genital HSV-1 infection, ocular HSV infection, HSV-related erythema multiforme, HSV meningitis or encephalitis, or prior receipt of HSV-2 vaccine. Effective contraception was required throughout the study.

- **Study vaccine**: GEN-003 is a purified protein subunit vaccine comprising a transmembrane deletion mutant of gD (gD2ΔTMR) and a large fragment of infected cell protein 4 (ICP4.2) from HSV-2 (strain G). It also included Matrix-M2 (Novavax, Gaithersburg, MD) at a concentration of 50 µg per dose. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline served as a diluent (or placebo) to achieve a 0.5 mL volume for intramuscular administration. Participants assigned to receive antigen only did not have Matrix-M2 added to the antigens.

### Trends in herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 seroprevalence in the United States [^116PnpZy]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 are common infections worldwide. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the cause of most genital herpes and is almost always sexually transmitted. In contrast, HSV-1 is usually transmitted during childhood via nonsexual contacts. Preexisting HSV-1 antibodies can alleviate clinical manifestations of subsequently acquired HSV-2. Furthermore, HSV-1 has become an important cause of genital herpes in some developed countries.

- **Objective**: To examine trends in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States in 1999–2004 compared with 1988–1994.

- **Design, settings, and participants**: Cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys (US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys [NHANES]) were used to compare national seroprevalence estimates from 1999–2004 with those from 1988–1994. Changes in HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence since 1976–1980 were reviewed. Persons aged 14 to 49 years were included in these analyses.

- **Main outcome measures**: Seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies based on results from type-specific immunodot assays; diagnosis of genital herpes.

- **Results**: The overall age-adjusted HSV-2 seroprevalence was 17.0% (95% confidence interval, 15.8%-18.3%) in 1999–2004 and 21.0% (95% CI, 19.1%-23.1%) in 1988–1994, a relative decrease of 19.0% between the two surveys (95% CI, -28.6% to -9.5%; p < 0.001). Decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence were especially concentrated in persons aged 14 to 19 years between 1988 and 2004.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UWQPD]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase between Jan 1, 2003, and May 25, 2017, to identify studies of the relative risk (RR) of HIV acquisition after exposure to HSV-2 infection either at baseline (i.e. prevalent infection) or during follow-up (i.e. incident infection). This search focused on studies published since the review by Freeman and colleagues.

For PubMed, we searched for articles and abstracts using terms such as "HIV", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human immune deficiency virus", OR "human immuno deficiency virus" AND "HSV", "herpes simplex", "herpes virus type 2", "herpes virus 2", "herpesvirus 2", "genital herpes", OR "herpes genitalis". Additionally, PubMed was searched using the Medical Subject Headings terms "herpes simplex" OR "simplexvirus" AND "human immunodeficiency virus", "HIV infection", "HIV antibodies", "HIV seronegativity", OR "HIV seroprevalence".

We included studies if they met the following criteria:

- **Study design**: Cohort study, controlled trial, or case-control study (including those nested within a cohort or controlled trial).
- **Objective**: Designed to assess the effect of preceding HSV-2 infection, compared with HSV-2 negativity, on HIV acquisition.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Excluded case-control studies based on samples from only one point in time and studies that only looked at the effect of pre-existing HIV infection on HSV-2 acquisition.
- **Identification method**: Determined the HSV-2 infection status of study participants with an antibody-type-specific assay.

### Testing for herpes simplex virus in low-volume cerebrospinal fluid samples: Comparison of three protocols to optimize detection [^1114VpME]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Detection of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a medical emergency and requires rapid, sensitive testing. However, the volume of CSF received for microbiological studies may be limited, especially from young children. In this study, we compared three testing protocols to our routine real-time PCR method to determine the most sensitive approach for detecting HSV-1 and HSV-2 in low-volume (≤ 100 μl) CSF.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^114E4WRm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

In this large-scale comparison of HSV serologic diagnostic methods, we found substantial differences between the performance of three commonly used, automated FDA-cleared immunoassays for detecting HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG manufactured by Bio-Rad, DiaSorin, and Roche. For HSV-1 IgG, there was a clear trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for all assays. The DiaSorin HSV-1 IgG assay had the highest sensitivity but the lowest specificity. On the other hand, the Bio-Rad and Roche HSV-1 IgG assays had lower sensitivities (97%).

For HSV-2, there was a clear best assay, with the Roche HSV-2 IgG assay having both the highest sensitivity (97.9%) and highest specificity (99.5%). The Bio-Rad HSV-2 IgG assay was nearly as good as the Roche assay, but the DiaSorin HSV-2 assay performed worst for both sensitivity and specificity. Unfortunately for laboratories, there does not seem to be a one-size-fits-all approach to automated HSV serology assays. Indeed, while our study indicates that at least some automated HSV-2 IgG assays have promising performance metrics, none of the HSV-1 IgG assays tested are adequate.

### High seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection in French human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected outpatients [^114BYacH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Using commercially available herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological diagnostic tests, HSV type 2 (HSV-2) antibody prevalence was assessed in two parallel prospective studies. These studies included 534 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected outpatients living in two areas of northern France.

In the first cohort of 434 subjects, 223 (51%) individuals demonstrated a positive HSV-2 serological status, while 66 (66%) of 100 subjects in the second cohort were seropositive for HSV-2 (51% versus 66%; P = 0.08). Among the 223 HSV-2-seropositive subjects identified in the first study cohort, only 22 (10%) had suffered from recurrent anogenital lesions during the past 12 months, whereas 154 (69%) had no clinical history of herpesvirus infection.

Our findings demonstrate high proportions of subclinical and undiagnosed HSV-2 infection in HIV-1-infected individuals. These results suggest that HSV type-specific serological testing in the French HIV-1-infected subpopulation could be an efficient strategy to diagnose clinically asymptomatic HSV-2 infections.

### Association of anti-herpes simplex virus IgG in tears and serum with clinical presentation in patients with presumed herpetic simplex keratitis [^116xFT6R]. Cornea (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical relevance of tear anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) antibody measurement for the diagnosis of herpes simplex keratitis.

Methods consisted of a retrospective analysis of records from 364 patients clinically suspected of HSV-related keratitis. These patients had undergone tear anti-HSV IgG assessment (tear-quantified anti-HSV IgG/filtrated IgG ratio) at our institution between January 2000 and August 2008. Patients were classified into four groups: Group 1 had anti-HSV IgG negative in serum and tears; Group 2 had anti-HSV IgG negative in tears and positive in serum; Group 3 had anti-HSV IgG nonsignificantly positive in tears and positive in serum; and Group 4 had anti-HSV IgG significantly positive in both serum and tears. Randomly selected patient charts from each group were reviewed for clinical data.

Results indicated that the prevalence of anti-HSV IgG in blood increased with age, from over 70% before 20 years to 95% after 70 years. Similarly, the prevalence of anti-HSV IgG in tears increased with age, from 20% before 20 years to over 50% after 70 years. The presence, either significant or not, of anti-HSV IgG in tears was significantly associated with decreased corneal sensation, the presence of stromal opacities, and with neurotrophic keratitis. Logistic regression showed no significant association between age and clinical signs except for herpetic ulcers and herpetic necrotizing keratitis.

The conclusions drawn from this study suggest that tear production of anti-HSV IgG increases with age and is associated with sequelae of herpes simplex keratitis. Conversely, it is poorly associated with clinical signs of acute herpes simplex keratitis.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^116aS4LE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

The VRC cohort comprises samples that are positive for HSV-1 or HSV-2 antibodies based both on WB results and viral confirmation of genital infection. In this cohort, all automated instruments had lower sensitivity and specificity for detecting HSV-1 IgG, with all instruments having a sensitivity below 90%. Conversely, the automated assays are more sensitive for detecting HSV-2 antibodies than in a typical screening population. However, the automated assays had lower specificity for HSV-2 IgG in this cohort.

When analyzing samples with PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection, only positive for either HSV-1 IgG (131 samples) or HSV-2 IgG (566 samples), the sensitivities of the HSV-1 IgG assays were not improved (80.6% for Bio-Rad, 87.8% for DiaSorin, and 69.5% for Roche). For HSV-2, all instruments' sensitivities were largely unchanged and were within 0.6% of their values from the full cohort. Assay specificities for this subset were unchanged compared to the full cohort.

- **Test results**:
	- There were 16 (13 for HSV-1 IgG and 3 for HSV-2 IgG) equivocal results on the Bio-Rad instrument and 34 (18 for HSV-1 IgG and 16 for HSV-2 IgG) on the DiaSorin instrument.
	- In contrast to the clinical testing cohort where most of the Bio-Rad results had non-equivocal final outcomes, only 25% of the Bio-Rad equivocal results in the VRC cohort had a non-equivocal result after repeating. All four revised results became p.

### HSV IgG antibody inhibits virus detection in CSF [^116kEd7p]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Before PCR testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), laboratory diagnosis of herpes encephalitis (HSE) was based on virus isolation from brain biopsy. Viral isolation from CSF has limited clinical value due to low virus recovery, the cause for which has not been demonstrated.

- **Objective**: To investigate the role of anti-HSV antibodies on the recovery of HSV from CSF via cell culture.

- **Study design**: HSV-positive CSF samples were evaluated for their ability to neutralize HSV in cell culture. The presence of HSV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies was analyzed using HSV-infected cells. To identify whether HSV-specific IgG is the cause of viral inhibition, IgG was removed using anti-human IgG magnetic beads. Viral inhibition from CSF originating from asymptomatic patients was examined as a comparison.

- **Results**: CSF from 13 patients with acute HSV CNS disease was analyzed. All displayed high levels of viral neutralization to both HSV-1 and HSV-2 regardless of the infecting subtype. Interestingly, all the CSF samples stained strongly for anti-IgG antibody but not for anti-IgM antibody. Removal of IgG from CSF eliminated the viral inhibitory activity. Neutralizing IgG antibody was also found to be common in CSF of most patients, even in the absence of HSV disease.

- **Conclusions**: Viral-specific IgG is the major determinant of viral inhibition in CSF and prevents virus recovery in cell culture. In CSF from HSE-uninfected patients, viral inhibitory IgG originates from circulating serum antibody and is commonly present in CSF. However, this inhibitory IgG is not protective for the de…

### Longitudinal effects of herpesviruses on multiple cognitive outcomes in healthy elderly adults [^114Mk72Y]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

- **Distribution of cognitive outcomes**: Fig. 2 shows the distribution of cognitive outcomes concerning anti–HSV-1 IgG positivity. HSV-1 refers to herpes simplex virus type 1; IgG is immunoglobulin G. Key metrics include MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), TMT (trail-making test), and 7MS (7-minute screening test).

- **Regression results for cognitive outcomes**: Table 2 provides results from mixed and linear regression analyses for cognitive outcomes with anti–HSV-1 IgG+ and anti–CMV IgG+. Key terms include HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1), CMV (cytomegalovirus), IgG (immunoglobulin G), MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), TMT (trail-making test), and 7MS (7-minute screening test). CI represents the confidence interval. Data collections T1 and T2 were performed at ages 75 and 80, respectively. Mixed models were used for MMSE, TMT-A, and TMT-B scores, while linear regression was applied to 7MS scores. These mixed models included both fixed and random intercepts, adjusted for variables such as anti–HSV-1 IgG, anti–CMV IgG, APOE ɛ4 genotype, sex, education, follow-up time, and two-way interactions between each main effect and follow-up time. The linear regression model incorporated the intercept and adjustments for anti–HSV-1 IgG, anti–CMV IgG, APOE ɛ4, sex, and education, with additional interactions introduced in separate models.

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: Findings from a randomized trial [^111CNvNE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

After obtaining informed consent but before randomization and dosing, participants obtained genital swab samples twice daily for 28 days and maintained a diary of genital lesions (baseline). To be eligible for randomization, participants were required to provide a minimum of 44 baseline shedding swab specimens. The swabbing procedure was repeated immediately after the third dose of vaccine and during weeks 29 to 33 and weeks 53 to 57, referred to as 6 and 12 months after the last dose of vaccine, respectively. The initial protocol specified only the first post-dosing shedding evaluation and was later amended to include 6- and 12-month collection periods.

Participants were randomized sequentially into 3 cohorts defined by antigen dose (10, 30, or 100 µg of each antigen). Within each dose cohort, participants were randomized at a 3:1:1 ratio to receive either the complete GEN-003, HSV-2 antigens without the adjuvant (antigens only), or placebo. Participants were randomized in blocks of 10 by a computer-based system to ensure an assignment to GEN-003, antigens only, and placebo at a ratio of 3:1:1. The study product was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid approximately 21 days apart. The study vaccine was prepared and administered by unblinded staff not involved in subsequent study procedures. Investigators and other clinic personnel, as well as participants, were blinded to treatment assignment. Clinical laboratory evaluation was performed prior to treatment and at intervals thereafter. Blood specimens were collected for assessment of cellular immune response.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112fMEv8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and approximately 48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and around 12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

### Managing patients with genital herpes and their sexual partners [^115B7f2x]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the growing size and significance of the genital herpes epidemic. Recent developments in the wide-scale availability of type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) serologic assays mean that many previously undiagnosed mild, atypical, and subclinical infections may now be diagnosed with some degree of confidence without the use of Western blots. The value of such diagnostics is controversial; however, the importance of HSV, with its facilitation of HIV transmission and acquisition, the availability of various preventative strategies for limiting vertical HSV transmission, and the growing evidence that condoms, some educational and counseling interventions, and antiviral therapies may limit sexual transmission, have challenged many of the arguments against wider testing of the population.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for encephalitis, specifically concerning the evaluation for infectious etiology, the IDSA 2008 guidelines recommend obtaining herpes simplex PCR testing on all CSF specimens in patients with encephalitis. Repeat herpes simplex PCR 3–7 days later in patients with an initial negative test result and a compatible clinical syndrome or temporal lobe localization on neuroimaging.

### A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study of a replication-defective herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 vaccine, HSV529, in adults with or without HSV infection [^113Zo5mH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) causes genital herpes in over 400 million persons worldwide.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of a replication-defective HSV2 vaccine, HSV529. Twenty adults were enrolled in each of three serogroups of individuals: those negative for both HSV1 and HSV2 (HSV1-/HSV2-), those positive or negative for HSV1 and positive for HSV2 (HSV1 ± /HSV2+), and those positive for HSV1 and negative for HSV2 (HSV1+/HSV2-). Sixty participants received vaccine or placebo at 0, 1, and 6 months. The primary endpoint was the frequency of solicited local and systemic reactions to vaccination.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine percent of vaccinees experienced mild-to-moderate solicited injection site reactions, compared with 47% of placebo recipients (95% confidence interval, 12.9%-67.6%; p = 0.006). Sixty-four percent of vaccinees experienced systemic reactions, compared with 53% of placebo recipients (95% CI, -17.9% to 40.2%; p = 0.44). Seventy-eight percent of HSV1-/HSV2- vaccine recipients had a ≥ 4-fold increase in neutralizing antibody titer after three doses of vaccine, whereas none of the participants in the other serogroups had such responses. HSV2-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 36%, 46%, and 27% of HSV1-/HSV2-, HSV1 ± /HSV2+, and HSV1+/HSV2- participants, respectively, one month after the third dose of vaccine, and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in 14%, 8%, and 18% of participants, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The HSV529 vaccine was safe and elicited neutralizing antibody and modest CD4+ T-cell responses in HSV-se.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1118HTaK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Results

- **Clinical testing remnant samples cohort**: HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG were measured in 979 remnant WB samples from 977 individuals across all four WB result categories: 444 were negative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG, 175 were positive for HSV-1 but negative for HSV-2 IgG, 182 were positive for HSV-2 IgG but negative for HSV-1 IgG, and 178 were positive for IgG to both HSV-1 and HSV-2. For each instrument, we calculated concordance with the WB results [see Table 1].

- **Samples and demographics**: The clinical remnant samples comprised 474 (49%) women and 503 (51%) men, with a median age of 43 years (range: 3–91 years). The age distribution was bimodal, likely due to the two primary indications for HSV serology testing: STI testing and pre-transplant screening. Most individuals identified as White and non-Hispanic (64.3%) and were from Washington state (87.1%).

### Characteristics of herpes simplex virus infection and pathogenesis suggest a strategy for vaccine development [^112LJQK7]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) belongs to the alpha subfamily of the human herpesvirus family and includes HSV1 and HSV2, which are responsible for pandemics of various herpes diseases. Both pathogens have similar structural characteristics and are of concern worldwide, not only because the clinical outcome of oral or genital ulcerative lesions has long-lasting impacts on patient quality of life but also because ocular herpes can lead to blindness, and neonatal herpes or encephalitis can result in higher death rates. In addition, the viruses show higher infection rates in various age groups. Although observations of epidemics in various areas have described different pandemics, infection rates of at least 30% to 60% for HSV1 and 10% to 25% for HSV2 have been recognized by most researchers, and approximately 23 million new cases of HSV2 infection are reported annually.

It is not surprising that a viral disease with such severe clinical outcomes and such a strong spreading trend has been targeted for prophylactic vaccine development. At the time of writing, more than 10 HSV prophylactic vaccines, mainly targeting HSV2, have been developed and evaluated in human clinical trials. These vaccines contain antigens that effectively stimulate immune responses and immune memory, as measured by the indicators of neutralizing antibodies and specific cellular immune responses in animals or humans. These data suggest that the viral antigens selected and designed for vaccines are effective and that the host immune system is capable of recognizing HSV.

### Performance of HerpeSelect and Kalon assays in detection of antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 [^116Eueyv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

The performances of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in detecting herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibodies have been inconsistent for African and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive populations. We compared the performances of the HerpeSelect and Kalon glycoprotein G2 ELISAs for patients with genital ulcer disease in Ghana and the Central African Republic. Sera from 434 women were tested with the HerpeSelect assay, and a subsample (n = 199) was tested by the Kalon assay. Ulcer swabs and cervicovaginal lavage samples were tested for HSV-2 DNA by PCR. HSV-2-seronegative women with detectable genital HSV-2 DNA were retested for HSV-2 antibodies 14 and 28 days later by the two ELISAs. A total of 346 (80%) women were positive by HerpeSelect at baseline, and 225 (54%) had detectable genital (lesional or cervicovaginal) HSV-2 DNA. Sixty-six (19%) HerpeSelect-positive samples had low-positive index values (1.1 to 3.5), and 58% of these samples had detectable genital HSV-2 DNA.

Global agreement between the two serological assays was 86%. Concordance was high (99%) for sera that were negative by HerpeSelect or had high index values (> 3.5). Defining infection detected by HSV-2 DNA PCR and/or Kalon assay as true infection, 71% of sera with low-positive index values were associated with true HSV-2 infection. Twenty-five women were identified as having nonprimary first-episode genital HSV-2 infection. Rates of HSV-2 seroconversion at day 14 were 77% (10/13 patients) by HerpeSelect assay and 23% (3/13 patients) by Kalon assay, with four additional seroconversion observations noted.

### The epidemiology of herpes simplex virus type 1 in Asia: Systematic review, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions [^115CZHop]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review was informed by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PRISMA checklist is in Supplementary Table 1.

Available HSV-1 publications in PubMed (from 1950) and Embase (from 1974) databases were systematically reviewed until 22 April 2018. For inclusiveness, broad search criteria were used, with MeSH/Emtree terms exploded to cover all subheadings and with no language or year restrictions (Supplementary Box 1). Articles in Chinese, English, French, and Japanese were reviewed in their original language, while articles in other languages were translated. The Asia region definition was informed by the World Health Organization's definitions for South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions. The list of included countries/territories is in Supplementary Box 2.

Search results were imported into Endnote, a reference manager, where duplicate publications were identified and excluded. Titles and abstracts of the remaining records were screened for relevance, and full texts of relevant and potentially relevant publications were retrieved for additional screening. References of articles and reviews were also checked to identify further publications that could have been missed.

The inclusion criteria were met for any publication that reported HSV-1 seroprevalence measures, based on primary data using type-specific diagnostic assays such as Western blot or type-specific tests.

### Herpes simplex viral infection doubles the risk of dementia in a contemporary cohort of older adults: A prospective study [^1138dXBW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses were conducted on subsamples of anti-HSV, anti-HSV-1, and anti-CMV IgG-seropositive subjects to study the effects of anti-herpesvirus treatment, anti-HSV IgM, anti-HSV levels, and anti-CMV levels. The prevalences of educational level (≤ 9 years), sex, APOE ɛ4 carriership, antiviral treatment, Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia, and anti-CMV IgG positivity were compared between participants included and not included in the subsamples using the χ² test. The time to the event was defined as the number of days from inclusion to the diagnosis of dementia (if before the 15-year follow-up) or censoring. Censoring occurred on the date of death or at the 15-year follow-up, whichever came first.

Kaplan–Meier survival plots were used to visualize survival according to anti-HSV IgG carriership. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to assess the risks of incident dementia and AD, with anti-HSV or anti-CMV IgG as primary predictors in the full sample. In the HSV and HSV1 subsamples, primary predictors included anti-herpesvirus treatment, anti-HSV IgM, and anti-HSV levels. Anti-CMV IgG levels were the primary predictor in the CMV subsample. Initially, basic models including sex and a primary predictor were developed. These models were then fully adjusted for education and APOE ɛ4 carriership. Finally, interaction terms were added to the fully adjusted models (primary predictor × APOE ɛ4 or anti-CMV IgG × anti-HSV IgG), when possible within the covariate limit. This limit was determined by dividing the number of participants with or without the outcome, whichever was smallest, by the number of covariates.

### Antenatal herpes serologic screening: an appraisal of the evidence [^115ShcrR]. Obstetrics and gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Calls for universal antenatal type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) screening to prevent neonatal herpes have recently increased and would affect the four million pregnant women and their partners annually in the United States. We undertook this review to assess the appropriateness of such screening, making relevant comparisons to established antenatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening programs.

Data Sources

We conducted a full PubMed and bibliographic search for relevant literature in English available from 1966 through February 2006, using the terms "genital herpes", "neonatal herpes", "decision analysis" or "cost-effectiveness analysis", and "herpes and pregnancy" or "antenatal herpes screening". Comparison literature was obtained by replacing "herpes" with "HBV" or "HIV".

Methods Of Study Selection

We appraised antenatal type-specific HSV screening using well-established criteria for a good screening program, which we articulated as questions. Of 455 articles we selected those that addressed at least one of the questions and were pertinent to the U.S. population.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

We found that neonatal HSV is rare and its incidence is imprecisely defined. There is a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of interventions to prevent maternal acquisition of new infection in late pregnancy, which accounts for 60–80% of neonatal herpes. The consequences of universal screening are incompletely understood but include the potential for unnecessary cesarean deliveries and medical treatment, ma

### Viral infections in critical care: A narrative review [^117Mw76i]. Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1, although often asymptomatic, can present as gingivostomatitis or pharyngitis with painful vesicular lesions. More relevant to ICU clinicians is HSV encephalitis, which may occur as a primary infection, commonly in children and young people, or following the reactivation of latent infection. This condition is most reliably diagnosed by molecular testing of the cerebrospinal fluid.

Diagnosis may be supported by neuro-imaging (MRI) with characteristic temporal horn involvement. Treatment involves the antiviral acyclovir, which should be started upon clinical suspicion to limit cerebral damage rather than delayed for diagnostic confirmation.

Herpes simplex virus 1 is commonly detected in the respiratory secretions of ventilated patients and is associated with illness severity, ventilation duration, and critical illness-induced immunoparesis. In most cases, this reflects viral reactivation due to the loss of host immune control, and it is rare to find convincing evidence of herpes pneumonitis, such as cytological evidence of viral cell inclusions, positive HSV viral cell culture, and pneumonitis without other explanation. The use of antiviral treatment in these patients is generally not recommended due to a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting its use. However, a retrospective study showed that patients with high viral loads (> 105 HSV copies.ml −1) detected by bronchoalveolar lavage sampling showed marked improvement with acyclovir compared to those with low viral loads.

### T-cell responses to HSV-1 in persons who have survived childhood herpes simplex encephalitis [^116ToU9F]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) after primary herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection can occur in children due to inborn errors of cell-intrinsic immunity in the central nervous system. Paradoxically, symptomatic mucocutaneous HSV-1 recurrences are rare in survivors of childhood HSE. T-cell-acquired immunity is thought to be involved in the control of recurrent mucocutaneous HSV infection. We thus tested HSV-1-specific immunity in HSE survivors.

- **Methods**: We obtained serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from participants a median of 13.5 years after HSE. HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG were detected by type-specific immunoblot. PBMCs from subjects passing quality control criteria were tested using enzyme-linked immunospot assay for CD4 interferon-γ responses with an HSV-1 lysate and for CD8 responses using pooled synthetic HSV-1 peptide CD8 T-cell epitopes. Healthy adult PBMCs were used to standardize assays and as comparators.

- **Results**: All participants were HSV-1 seropositive. Most (23/24) HSE survivors had human leukocyte antigen class I types matching the human leukocyte antigen restriction of the pooled peptides. We detected HSV-specific CD8 T-cell responses in 14 of 24 (58%) HSE survivors and in 9 of 9 healthy HSV-1 seropositive adults. HSV-specific CD4 T-cell responses were present in all 5 HSE subjects tested and in 8 of 9 healthy adults. Response magnitudes were overlapping between subject groups.

### Evaluating the performance of the Focus HerpeSelect® HSV-2 IgG in veterans with chronic hepatitis C infection [^111TNLF5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic links between chronic hepatitis C and herpes simplex type-2 infection have been suggested; however, type-specific tests for HSV-2 infection have not been validated in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

The Focus HerpeSelect® HSV-2 IgG (Cypress, California) assay and the Biokit HSV-2 rapid assay (Biokit USA, Lexington, MA) were performed on serum samples obtained from 84 veterans with chronic hepatitis C who demonstrated a previously positive HSV-2 serologic test in their medical records.

- **Positive predictive value and specificity**: Using the Biokit HSV-2 as the comparator assay, the positive predictive value and specificity for the HerpeSelect® HSV-2 assay were 62.1% (95% CI: 49.3–73.8) and 41.9% (95% CI: 27.0–57.9), respectively.

- **Increased specificity and predictive value**: Increasing the HerpeSelect® HSV-2 index value defining a positive test result from > 1.1 to ≥ 2.89 increased the assay's specificity to 97.7% (95% CI: 87.7–99.6) and the positive predictive value to 94.1% (95% CI: 71.2–99.0).

In veterans with chronic hepatitis C infection, HerpeSelect® HSV-2 index values between 1.1 and 2.89 should be confirmed with an alternate test for HSV-2 infection.

### Seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 in HIV-infected and uninfected homosexual men in a primary care setting [^117FCFgf]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), with infections often being unrecognized by patients and/or clinicians. HSV-2 infections may be a risk factor for the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Reliable tests for type-specific HSV antibodies are now readily available.

- **Objectives**: To determine the seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in HIV-seronegative gay men in a primary care setting in Melbourne, Australia, and to compare it with the rate in HIV-infected gay men. Additionally, to assess the utility in a clinical setting of a type-specific HSV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared to western blot.

- **Study design**: We recruited a total of 300 HIV-seronegative homosexual men attending for HIV antibody testing, and HIV-infected men attending for CD4 lymphocyte count and viral load estimation. The subjects completed a questionnaire, and sera were sent for total IgG HSV testing and testing by Gull type-specific HSV ELISA assay. Selected serum samples were retested by western blotting and the results analyzed.

- **Results**: In total, 168 HIV-antibody negative men and 132 HIV-antibody positive men were recruited. Of all subjects, 73.3% had HSV-1 antibodies, a proportion that did not differ between HIV-seronegative and seropositive men (P = 0.48). Approximately 20% of HIV-seronegative men and 61% of HIV-seropositive men had antibodies to HSV-2 (P < 0.0001); 75.6% of HIV-seronegative men with antibodies to HSV-2 reported no history of genital herpes, as did 66.7% of HIV-seropositive men.

Pooled mean estimates for HSV-1 seroprevalence

Table 2 shows the seroprevalence meta-analyses. Overall pooled mean seroprevalence (across all measures, n = 622) was 67.4% (95% CI 65.5% to 69.3%). The pooled mean seroprevalences for healthy (n = 101) and for clinical (n = 3) children were 32.4% (95% CI 29.2% to 35.6%) and 37.8% (95% CI 28.3% to 47.8%), respectively. The pooled mean for healthy (n = 402) and for clinical (n = 59) adults was 73.7% (95% CI 71.9% to 75.4%) and 73.8% (95% CI 68.9% to 78.5%), respectively.

Across age groups, pooled mean seroprevalence increased gradually from 39.3% (n = 147, 95% CI 35.9% to 42.7%) in those aged 50 years.

Across European subregions/countries, the pooled mean seroprevalence was lowest at 57.7% (n = 161, 95% CI 54.4% to 60.9%) in Northern Europe, followed by 64.8% (n = 35, 95% CI 58.8% to 70.7%) in Israel, 66.1% (n = 264, 95% CI 63.1% to 69.0%) in Western Europe, 77.2% (n = 77, 95% CI 71.7% to 82.3%) in Southern Europe, 78.7% (n = 64, 95% CI 74.1%–83.0%) in Eastern Europe and 87.9% (n = 17, 95% CI 79.6% to 94.2%) in Turkey.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^111WQvTK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Participant and sample collection**: The participant had positive results of a type-specific HSV immunoblot assay. Swab specimens were collected every weekday for 4 weeks using a spatial grid of the female genital tract, as previously described. An aliquot of each swab specimen was used for column-based DNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to detect HSV-1 genomes. The participant also had symptomatic genital HSV-1 recurrences before and after the swabbing study; specimens from associated lesions were collected for HSV-1 culture. This individual's virus is referred to hereafter as "v.29". The University of Washington Human Subjects Division approved the study, and the participant provided informed consent.

### First HSV-1 non primary genital herpes in two patients [^1147A3dW]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

First HSV-1 genital episodes in HSV-2 infected patients, however, had never been demonstrated until the two cases we observed. This scarcity could reflect the lower impact of HSV-2 on Western populations but questions the existence of cross-protection between viral types.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^114j2Esg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Patterns of discordant results for the VRC cohort were similar to those for the clinical testing cohort (Fig. 4). Overall, the DiaSorin instrument alone accounted for at least half of the total false positives for either HSV-1 IgG (78%) or HSV-2 IgG (50%). There was a trend for the VRC cohort to have a larger proportion of samples test falsely positive (13.3% for HSV-1 IgG and 10.7% for HSV-2 IgG) compared to the clinical testing cohort (10.2% for HSV-1 IgG and 6.5% for HSV-2 IgG), likely reflecting the lack of double-negative samples in this cohort. There were significantly more HSV-1 IgG false-negative results in the VRC cohort than in the clinical testing sample remnant cohort (25.9% vs. 16.7%, P-value = 0.002). Conversely, there were significantly fewer HSV-2 false-negative results in the VRC cohort than in the clinical testing cohort (3.1% vs. 16.4%, P-value < 0.001).

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^114QvUSg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

All samples were tested using the Roche Elecsys HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG immunoassays according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, serum samples are incubated with biotinylated recombinant HSV-1 gG1 or HSV-2 gG2 antigens, and the same antigens are labeled with a ruthenium complex to form a double-antigen sandwich complex. Streptavidin-coated magnetic microparticles are then added, and the sandwich complex binds to this solid phase through the interaction of biotin and streptavidin.

The microparticles are then magnetically captured on the surface of an electrode, and all unbound substances are washed away. Applying a voltage to the electrode induces chemiluminescence of the ruthenium complex, which is measured by a photomultiplier. The on-board software converts this electrochemiluminescent signal to a cutoff index (COI) based on the manufacturer-supplied calibrators. A COI < 0.1 was attained, and reported values ranged from a COI of 0.026–234.8 for HSV-1 and 0.083–575.1 for HSV-2. Linearity was confirmed from 0.1 to 140 for HSV-1 and 0.2–350 for HSV-2. After testing using the Roche Elecsys assays, samples were frozen at −20°C for 2–3 weeks prior to running on the Bio-Rad BioPlex instrument.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^117KzeoJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Inter- and intra-assay reproducibility for serum was evaluated by performing a study using a whole virus control of HSV-1 and HSV-2. The virus was diluted in pooled human negative serum at concentrations ranging from 2 × 10⁴ copies/mL to 2 × 10² copies/mL over 3 to 5 days (n = 10 to 12 replicates). The means ± SD Ct values and the coefficient of variation (CV) are provided. The CV ranged from 1.0% to 1.4% for HSV-1 and 1.6% to 3.0% for HSV-2 in inter-assay assessments, demonstrating a high degree of precision. Additionally, intra-assay assessments showed CV ranges from 0.3% to 1.4% for HSV-1 and 0.6% to 2.2% for HSV-2.

- **Clinical performance comparison in serum specimens**: A total of 247 serum specimens from patients with known HSV-positive lesions were tested to assess the clinical performance of the modified Simplexa assay. The assay achieved a total percent agreement of 95% (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97) with laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), and a κ statistic of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.86), indicating moderate agreement for both targets. Twenty-six positive specimens were detected: 15 for HSV-1 and 11 for HSV-2, all confirmed by the CRM. HSV-1 showed a negative percent agreement of 94.4% (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.97), while HSV-2 had a negative percent agreement of 99.1% (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.0). Both targets achieved a positive percent agreement of 100% with the modified assay.

### Common use of inaccurate antibody assays to identify infection status with herpes simplex virus type 2 [^111SeSPb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

In recent proficiency testing of herpes simplex virus type-specific serologic evidence by the College of American Pathologists, commercially available herpes simplex virus antibody assays that were not glycoprotein-G based demonstrated high false-positive rates (14%-88%) for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies in sera that were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 antibodies but negative for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus serologic testing should be performed with only glycoprotein-G-based tests.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^115SCbDS]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least 500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals.

Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral therapy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and use of condoms. A clinically apparent herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum, and may be accompanied by a flu-like syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing.

Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, meningitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1122UiLa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

We found that the false positivity rate for HSV-1 or HSV-2 antibodies was higher in samples that were positive for antibodies to the other virus. For HSV-1, 17% (31 of 182) of samples that were seropositive for HSV-2 only by WB tested falsely positive for HSV-1 IgG on at least one automated instrument compared with 7.4% (33 of 444) of samples that were negative for any HSV antibodies by WB (two-sample z test: P-value < 0.001). There was a similar trend for HSV-2, as 9.7% (17 of 175) of samples that were positive for HSV-1 only by WB tested falsely positive for HSV-2 IgG on at least one automated instrument, while only 5.2% (23 of 443) of samples that were negative for all HSV antibodies by WB tested falsely positive for HSV-2 IgG (two-sample z test: P-value = 0.06).

Notably, 76% of HSV-1 false positive and 74% of HSV-2 false positive test results came from the DiaSorin instrument. For HSV-1, the DiaSorin instrument had fewer false negative results than the other instruments, and there were no samples where it was the only instrument to falsely call a sample negative. However, for HSV-2, the DiaSorin instrument had numerous false negative results, and 43% (25 of 58) of the HSV-2 false negative results were unique to the DiaSorin instrument.

During initial clinical WB testing, 168 of the 979 (17.2%) samples were repeated with a larger sample volume or adsorbed for HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies and re-tested. These samples that required repeating or absorption were significantly more likely to give discordant results on at least one automated assay.

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^11569rZ7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by reoccurring outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation. A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for the selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results.

Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and selection of the appropriate methodology are paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy. In this article, we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^116P18ys]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are among the most common and stigmatized infections in humans, affecting more than 4 billion people globally and more than 100 million Americans. Despite this prevalence, many individuals are unaware of their infection status, and antibody testing is not recommended, partly due to poor test performance.

This study compares the test performance of several assays, namely, the Roche Elecsys HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG, DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1/2 IgG, and Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG, against the gold-standard HSV western blot. A total of 1,994 individuals were included, comprising 1,017 individuals with PCR or culture-confirmed HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infection.

- **Performance metrics**:
	- The Bio-Rad and Roche assays showed similar metrics with low sensitivity (97%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and both high sensitivity (> 97%) and high specificity (> 98%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG.
	- The DiaSorin assay exhibited higher sensitivity (92.1%) but much lower specificity (88.7%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG, along with comparatively poor sensitivity (94.5%) and specificity (94.2%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG.
	- The DiaSorin assay had suboptimal performance at low-positive index values, with 60.9% of DiaSorin HSV-1 results and 20.8% of DiaSorin HSV-2 results with positive index values < 3.0 yielding false positive results.

Given an estimated HSV-2 seroprevalence of 12% in the United States, the positive predictive values for HSV-2 IgG were 96.1% for Roche, 87.4% for Bio-Rad, and 69.0% for DiaSorin. Consequently, nearly one out of every three positive DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG results would be falsely positive. Further developments in HSV antibody testing are necessary.

### Seropositivity to herpes simplex virus type 2, but not type 1, is associated with premature cardiovascular diseases: a population-based cross-sectional study [^1146zu54]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the relationship between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Thirty-five years after herpesviruses were suggested to induce atherosclerosis, sero-epidemiological evidence on Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) remains sparse and controversial.

A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 14,415 participants (mean age 34.3 years, range 20–49) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2010. Serum IgG antibodies to HSV were measured by enzymatic immunodot assay, and CVD were self-reported. CVD prevalence was 1.8%; 51.3% of participants were infected with HSV-1, 7.5% with HSV-2, and 15.2% with both. After adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, STD, and CVD risk factors, seropositivity to HSV-2 was positively associated with CVD (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–2.21, P = 0.014), but not with HSV-1 (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.79–1.62).

In conclusion, HSV-2 may be associated with premature CVD, but not HSV-1.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^113jtARy]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

We calculated the sensitivities and specificities from all 1,996 samples to estimate the overall performance of these assays. Using the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) population prevalence in the United States for persons aged 14–49 for HSV-1 of 48% and HSV-2 of 12%, we calculated the positive and negative predictive value for each assay based on the sensitivities and specificities from all samples tested. We also modeled the effect of changes in prevalence on the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).

- **Modeling the positive and negative predictive values**:
	- The positive and negative predictive values for each assay are shown as a function of prevalence based on the sensitivities and specificities calculated from all samples tested.

	- **HSV-1 IgG assay**:
		The gray line indicates a population prevalence for HSV-1 in the United States of 48%.

	- **HSV-2 IgG assay**:
		The gray line indicates the expected population prevalence for HSV-2 in the United States of 12%.

For all plots, the shaded areas represent the percent uncertainty for the sensitivity and specificity, set to the 95% confidence interval (CI) of either the sensitivity or specificity, whichever was larger.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^1124YUrG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

We reviewed the original WB blots for 25 of the samples that were discordant with the WB on two or three automated assays. These samples were selected to represent all four possible discordant situations (e.g. HSV-1 IgG positive by WB but negative by the automated assays, etc), and 12 of these samples were originally adsorbed or repeated during clinical testing. For this review, independent readers were aware that there was a discordance but were blinded to which assays were discordant. On review, no readers would have changed the final interpretation of any blots. However, there were three samples — two for HSV-2 and one for HSV-1 — that were positive on the WB and negative on all three automated assays. In these cases, at least one reader would now recommend adsorbing the sample for further clarification.

There were only three samples where all three automated instruments called the sample positive for HSV antibodies, yet the WB was negative. All three samples were discordant for HSV-1 IgG, and the blot reviewers noted that the HSV-1 blot was more consistent with HSV-1 cross-reactivity than true HSV-1 IgG. Overall, a review of the original WBs for a subset of samples where multiple automated assays were discordant with the WB found that 3 out of 25 samples would now be recommended for further testing (e.g. adsorption), but the expert readers agreed with the original clinical WB result in the vast majority of cases (88%). For this assay comparison study, the WB results were considered the ground truth, even for samples where more than one assay was discordant with the WB.

### Value of herpes simplex virus type-specific serology: a case report [^117DgG72]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Genital herpes, usually caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in humans. By contrast, intrauterine HSV-2 infections have been described rarely in the literature. Our report describes a case of a neonate who was delivered after 30+2 gestational weeks by cesarean section. He presented with a respiratory distress syndrome resulting in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At the age of 6 weeks, a chorioretinal scar was detected. During the 4th month of age, the infant developed recurrent HSV-2 infection with nasal lesions. The retrospective type-specific serologic diagnosis revealed previous HSV-2 infection of the mother resulting in prenatal HSV-2 infection of the infant. In conclusion, intrauterine HSV-2 infections may be underrepresented since they may not be associated with severe congenital malformations, and the diagnosis requires the use of HSV type-specific serologic methods not widely applied in microbiological laboratories.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^116HuoLf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

In December 2023, DiaSorin notified customers that HSV-2 reagent lots, including those used in this study, may have increased numbers of equivocal or false positive results. In our study, compared to the DiaSorin HSV-1 assay, the DiaSorin HSV-2 assay did not seem to be enriched for equivocal or false positive results, as the HSV-2 assay had fewer equivocal (16) or false positive (43) final results than the HSV-1 assay (21 equivocal and 133 false positive results). Notably, our data also confirm the high false positive rate of the DiaSorin HSV-2 assay observed from January to February 2021 by Quest Diagnostics Laboratory, especially for specimens with low-positive index values. Given that the performance issues of the DiaSorin assay predate the manufacture of the lots subject to the notification, further consideration for the utility of the assay is warranted. Based on our receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, even if the threshold for the DiaSorin assays were increased, the best sensitivity and specificity for their HSV-2 assay would remain worse than the other assays tested.

- **Limitations**: The study used clinical remnants rather than fresh prospectively collected specimens. Most (86%) of the VRC cohort specimens were stored frozen for over 10 years. However, sensitivity analysis of testing performance by date of collection demonstrated no substantial difference in assay sensitivity for samples collected prior to 2000 (n = 555) versus after 2000 (n = 462; Table S4). This study was not specifically designed to assess the effects of demographics on assay performance.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^111mDKfC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Samples were thawed and briefly mixed prior to testing with the DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG CLIA according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, magnetic beads coated with recombinant antigens specific for either HSV-1 glycoprotein (gG1) or HSV-2 glycoprotein (gG2) are incubated with patient serum.

After washing, the beads are incubated with an isoluminol-conjugated anti-human IgG mouse monoclonal antibody. Another wash removes any unbound antibody prior to inducing a flash chemiluminescence reaction. The resulting light signal, measured as relative light units (RLUs), indicates how much isoluminol-antibody conjugate and, thus, HSV-1 or HSV-2 IgG is present in the sample.

The RLUs are converted to an index value using the onboard calculation based on the manufacturer-provided calibrators. This index value is used to categorize samples as negative (index ≤ 1) or positive (index > 1) for HSV-specific IgG.

For the DiaSorin HSV-1 assay, index values ranged from 0.03 to > 23.6, and for HSV-2, from 0.1 to 47. Linearity was confirmed for index values between 0.1 and 47 for HSV-1, and 0.15 and 21 for HSV-2. Samples that were initially reported as equivocal were repeated at least twice, and the median measurement was reported as the final result. For the VRC cohort, the 34 initially equivocal samples were repeated at the end of the study, following an additional freeze-thaw cycle.

### Recommendations for the selective use of herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests [^11595pSj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological tests are now widely available, but indications for their use have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a committee of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations for the use of type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV-2) serological tests.

- **Methods**: By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population.

- **Results**: The committee concluded that, in addition to serological testing for diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV-2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial.

- **Conclusions**: The targeted use of HSV-2 serological tests for specific diagnostic situations and selected populations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recommendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV-2 serological tests.

### No. 208-guidelines for the management of herpes simplex virus in pregnancy [^112KeUzV]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the management of genital herpes in pregnant patients, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining type-specific serology testing in pregnant patients without a history of HSV but with a previous partner with genital HSV. This is to determine the woman's risk of acquiring genital HSV before or as early in pregnancy as possible. It is advised to repeat testing at 32–34 weeks of gestation.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^115fShAF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Although each assay's primary result is positive, negative, or equivocal (for the Bio-Rad and DiaSorin assays) for HSV-1 or HSV-2 IgG, each automated assay also provides a semi-quantitative index value. Previous studies have found that "low-positive" index values of < 3.0 (Fig. 2, red line) are associated with more false positive results and a decreased positive predictive value. Indeed, when samples are grouped by index value, samples with positive index values < 3.0 have the highest percentage of false positive results for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG on all instruments (Fig. 3). This is especially true for the DiaSorin instrument where 76.1% of low-positive index values are falsely positive for HSV-1 IgG, and 38.7% of low-positive results are falsely positive for HSV-2 IgG.

- **Semi-quantitative results**:

The black line shows the cutoff value of 1.0 with the gray dotted lines at 0.9 and 1.1 delineating the index values that are called equivocal by the Bio-Rad and DiaSorin instruments. The red dotted line at 3.0 marks a common cutoff for "low-positive" results. Values outside the reportable range for the Bio-Rad and DiaSorin instruments were assigned values 0.1 above or below the cutoff value and are shown as triangles.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^116D33iw]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for genital herpes, particularly concerning laboratory testing, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2 when there is a higher clinical suspicion for HSV-2. Situations such as recurrent episodes, atypical lesions, lesions with negative PCR or culture results, or in the context of HIV infection warrant this testing.

Classical serologic assays are not useful for the diagnosis of perinatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection during the acute phase of the disease. We report two cases of neonatal HSV infection that highlight the diagnostic value of HSV-specific IgG avidity and its contribution to the further characterization of neonatal HSV infection.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^116f8FvM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Bloodstream HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections can cause devastating outcomes with high morbidity and mortality, especially in neonates or immunocompromised individuals. Proper patient management for herpes simplex virus (HSV) bloodstream infections is time-sensitive and requires a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis. The absence of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved molecular assays for HSV detection in blood, coupled with a lack of consensus on the optimal sample type, underscores the unmet need for improved diagnostics.

We prospectively compared the cycle threshold values in paired samples including whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with bloodstream HSV infections. This analysis employed a modified use of the FDA-cleared Simplexa HSV-1 & 2 Direct assay. The clinical performance in serum was assessed by comparing the results of 247 remnant specimens on this sample-to-answer platform to established laboratory-developed tests in a blinded fashion.

Serum samples exhibited significantly lower cycle thresholds than whole blood samples [2.6 cycle threshold (Ct) bias, P < 0.001]. The modified Simplexa assay demonstrated 100% positive percent agreement for the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA in serum samples and yielded an overall agreement of 95% (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97), with a κ statistic of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.86) compared to the composite reference method. Discordance rates were 5.20% for HSV-1 and 0.81% for HSV-2. This investigation demonstrates that serum is an optimal specimen type for HSV detection.

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^116izgFD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2 that allows blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic. These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish a diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for the use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### A case report of isolated primary herpes-simplex virus neuroretinitis in an immunocompetent adult [^116Cdxmb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses (specifically HSV-1 and HSV-2) are greatly prevalent. In 2016, 66.6% of the world's population aged 15–49 years were living with HSV type 1 infection and 13.2% with HSV type 2. The spectrum of disease includes primary and recurrent infections that cause cutaneous or genital herpes, encephalitis, conjunctivitis, and keratitis, establishing a lifelong latent infection with reactivations. Other ocular disorders such as acute retinal necrosis syndrome or neuroretinitis are rare occurrences for these pathogens. Asymptomatic primary infection is the most frequent form observed in patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV).

We report the case of an isolated unilateral neuroretinitis as a manifestation of primary HSV infection in an immunocompetent adult without encephalitis or other related clinical features.

### Incidence of serum antibody titers against herpes simplex virus in Japanese patients [^111tQrfX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency in the sensory neuronal ganglia after primary infection and occasionally causes reinfection, mainly on the lips or genitalia. Previous reports revealed an age-related increase in HSV-immunoglobulin G seropositive subjects in a hospital-based study and the general population in Japan. In this report, we retrospectively analyzed the results of serological tests against HSV in which subjects were diagnosed with or suspected of having HSV infection.

A total of 1,216 subjects with at least one complement fixation (CF) result were included. Of these, 771 subjects (63.4%) were positive at the first visit. When stratified by age, the incidence of positive patients linearly increased with age from teenagers (44.9%) to those in their 80s (88.9%). Positivity in women was higher than in men overall, with significantly higher incidence observed in women aged in their 30s, 40s, and 60s.

When observing changing HSV-CF titers over time in 81 initially negative patients, 18 (22%) seroconverted during the 2,121-day observation period. In this study, we clearly show that the distribution of HSV-CF titers is similar to previous HSV-immunoglobulin G results. This correlation is probably caused by the continual subclinical proliferation of HSV, thus maintaining CF titers. Our observations provide data on the incidence of HSV, reconfirming that serological examination is unreliable in diagnosing reHerpes, and the majority of infected subjects are asymptomatic.
