## Question

When can i diagnose asthma in children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to diagnose asthma in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic principle and why pediatric asthma is uniquely challenging. Then, I should stratify by age because the diagnostic approach differs fundamentally between children under 5 years and those 5 years and older. Next, I will examine the diagnostic pathway for school-aged children, followed by the preschool pathway, including how to structure a therapeutic trial. After that, I need to consider special populations and the role of biomarkers. Finally, I should review the differential diagnosis, emphasize the need for ongoing reassessment, and synthesize a practical decision framework with key takeaways anchored to guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the core diagnostic principle so I don't jump to conclusions: asthma in children is a clinical diagnosis supported by characteristic symptom patterns plus evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and because no single gold-standard test exists, diagnosis should be reviewed over time to avoid misclassification, especially in younger children who cannot perform objective testing reliably [^1148j9QB] [^113ze1Ms].

> Hold on, I should verify the age stratification because it drives the entire diagnostic approach: for children 5 years and older, objective testing with spirometry and bronchodilator reversibility is recommended whenever feasible; for children 5 years and younger, routine spirometry is not practical, so diagnosis is based on symptom patterns, risk factors, response to a structured controller trial, and exclusion of alternatives, with the understanding that many preschoolers wheeze and not all wheeze equals asthma [^1148j9QB] [^111jHGkx] [^116fRoxw].

> Next, I will examine the school-aged pathway (≥ 5 years) and make sure I anchor to high-quality guidance: start with a careful history for wheeze, cough, breathlessness, nocturnal symptoms, triggers, and activity limitation, then obtain spirometry with bronchodilator testing; variable expiratory airflow limitation is supported by an increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL after bronchodilator, and if spirometry is not available, peak expiratory flow (PEF) can be used as a less reliable but still useful objective measure; I should double-check that ERS explicitly recommends spirometry and advises against relying on PEF variability alone as the sole objective test, which aligns with GINA's emphasis on confirming variable airflow limitation before labeling asthma [^114q6oiM] [^116p8Y8d] [^1148j9QB] [^115spWrp].

> Wait, let me verify the role of adjunctive tests in older children when uncertainty persists: FeNO can be considered as an adjunct in children aged 5 years and older with diagnostic uncertainty, but it should not be used in isolation to make or exclude the diagnosis; I initially thought FeNO might be broadly diagnostic in this age group, but I need to correct that — NAEPP 2020 conditionally recommends FeNO as an adjunct in those ≥ 5 years with uncertainty, and advises against using FeNO alone to assess control or predict exacerbations, reinforcing that it complements, not replaces, spirometry and clinical context [^1143mPZ9].

> Now, I will consider the preschool pathway (< 5 years) and I should confirm that I'm not overpromising objective testing: diagnosis here is clinical and probability-based, relying on recurrent wheeze, cough, or breathlessness patterns, risk factors such as atopy or family history, and a structured therapeutic trial of low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA for 2–3 months, followed by reassessment; improvement on therapy and worsening after withdrawal support asthma, whereas lack of response should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis or alternative causes; I need to ensure I emphasize that spirometry and most physiologic tests are not practical in routine care at this age, which is consistent with GINA and primary care guidance [^111jHGkx] [^114BtFWA] [^117BjDWE] [^116aY2AQ].

> But wait, what about prediction tools in preschoolers — do they diagnose asthma or just stratify risk? I should clarify that tools like the Asthma Predictive Index and newer instruments such as CHART identify children at higher likelihood of persistent symptoms, but they are not diagnostic criteria; they can inform anticipatory guidance and follow-up intensity, yet the diagnosis still hinges on symptom pattern, treatment response, and exclusion of alternatives, so I must not conflate risk prediction with diagnostic confirmation [^113w6ADu] [^1121SRLL] [^116oV8Z3].

> I need to check the role of FeNO in preschoolers because it's easy to overinterpret: FeNO can be measured in children as young as 1–5 years, and some studies suggest an elevated FeNO measured at least 4 weeks after a URI may predict later physician-diagnosed asthma, but evidence is limited and conflicting; NAEPP 2020 recommends against using FeNO to predict future asthma in children 0–4 years, so if FeNO is used, it should be interpreted cautiously and not used to make a current diagnosis in this age group [^114BtFWA] [^112pbEV6].

> Let me think about special populations and settings so I don't miss important caveats: in children already on ICS, confirming the diagnosis may require stepping down therapy to unmask variability; in low-resource settings where spirometry is unavailable, PEF or careful symptom-response documentation becomes critical; in athletes or those with normal spirometry but high suspicion, bronchoprovocation may be considered in specialist hands; and I should confirm that GINA advises "test before treat" wherever possible to avoid obscuring the diagnosis with early controller therapy [^1148j9QB] [^115spWrp] [^113yA9Y8].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis to avoid anchoring bias: in young children, recurrent wheeze may reflect viral bronchiolitis, structural airway anomalies, or gastroesophageal reflux; in older children, vocal cord dysfunction, dysfunctional breathing, and cardiac disease can mimic asthma; a careful history, exam, and selective testing (e.g., chest radiograph when indicated) help exclude alternatives before committing to an asthma diagnosis, and I should remember that "all that wheezes is not asthma" remains a key clinical maxim [^113ze1Ms] [^115Nbz2n].

> I should double-check the need for ongoing reassessment because misdiagnosis is common: both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis occur, and the diagnosis should be reviewed at each encounter, especially in preschoolers; as children mature, repeating objective testing can refine the diagnosis; changes in pattern, poor control despite therapy, or atypical features should trigger re-evaluation and consideration of comorbidities or alternative diagnoses, aligning with high-quality pediatric asthma reviews and primary care guidance [^114PfQ9H] [^113ze1Ms] [^114EJofr].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and make sure it aligns with guidelines: for children ≥ 5 years, combine characteristic symptoms with objective evidence of variable airflow limitation using spirometry (or PEF if needed), consider FeNO only as an adjunct in uncertainty, and avoid diagnosing on symptoms alone; for children < 5 years, base diagnosis on recurrent symptom patterns, risk factors, and a structured 2–3 month controller trial with reassessment, using prediction tools only to stratify risk, not to diagnose; throughout, exclude alternative causes and plan to review the diagnosis regularly as the child grows and as objective testing becomes feasible [^1148j9QB] [^111jHGkx] [^114q6oiM] [^116p8Y8d].

> Finally, I should confirm the key takeaways and ensure they reflect the evidence quality: there is no single gold-standard test for pediatric asthma; diagnosis in school-aged children should prioritize spirometry with reversibility; diagnosis in preschoolers is clinical and trial-based; misdiagnosis is common, so ongoing review is essential; and despite variability in guideline quality and evidence, these principles are consistently endorsed across major guidelines and high-quality reviews, which should guide practice while we continue to build better diagnostic evidence [^1148j9QB] [^114PfQ9H] [^115zTJnE] [^1122rhJL].

You can diagnose asthma in children when they have **recurrent wheeze, cough, or breathlessness** with risk factors (family history, atopy) and a documented response to asthma therapy, especially in children under 5 years where objective testing is limited [^111jHGkx] [^116fRoxw]. In children aged 5 years and older, confirm the diagnosis with **spirometry demonstrating reversible airflow limitation** (FEV₁ increase ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL after bronchodilator) [^1148j9QB]. Always exclude alternative diagnoses and **review the diagnosis regularly** as the child grows and new information becomes available [^113ze1Ms] [^114EJofr].

---

## Clinical features and symptom patterns

Asthma in children typically presents with the following **symptoms and patterns**:

- **Wheeze**: High-pitched, expiratory sound, often recurrent [^112N8Dbp].
- **Cough**: Especially at night or with exercise, and may be the only symptom [^117BjDWE].
- **Breathlessness**: Intermittent, often triggered by exercise, viral infections, allergens, or irritants [^114PfQ9H].
- **Chest tightness**: Less common in younger children but may be reported by older children [^notfound].

Symptoms are typically **intermittent and variable**, often worsening at night or with exercise, and may be absent between episodes [^112N8Dbp].

---

## Age-specific diagnostic criteria

### Children aged 5 years and older

In children aged 5 years and older, the diagnosis of asthma should be based on **characteristic symptoms plus objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation** [^1148j9QB]:

- **Spirometry**: Gold standard test; look for reversible airflow limitation (FEV₁ increase ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL after bronchodilator) [^114q6oiM].
- **Peak expiratory flow (PEF)**: Useful if spirometry is unavailable; document variability or reversibility [^115spWrp].
- **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)**: Adjunctive test indicating eosinophilic inflammation; not diagnostic alone [^1143mPZ9].

---

### Children under 5 years

Diagnosing asthma in children under 5 years is challenging because objective testing is often not feasible; therefore, the diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on:

- **Symptom patterns**: Recurrent wheeze, cough, or breathlessness, especially between viral infections or with exercise, laughing, or crying [^117BjDWE].
- **Risk factors**: Family history of asthma or atopy, personal history of eczema or food allergy, allergic sensitization [^111jHGkx].
- **Therapeutic trial**: Documented improvement with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and worsening upon withdrawal supports asthma [^114BtFWA].

---

## Objective tests and their limitations

| **Test** | **Age group** | **Role in diagnosis** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Spirometry | ≥ 5 years | Gold standard; detects reversible airflow limitation | Requires cooperation and technique |
| Peak expiratory flow (PEF) | ≥ 5 years | Alternative to spirometry; detects variability | Less reliable; user-dependent |
| Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) | ≥ 5 years | Indicates eosinophilic inflammation | Not diagnostic alone; influenced by smoking, diet |
| Therapeutic trial (ICS) | < 5 years | Supports diagnosis if symptomatic improvement occurs | Subjective; risk of overdiagnosis |

---

## Exclusion of alternative diagnoses

Before diagnosing asthma, **exclude alternative causes** of respiratory symptoms:

- **Respiratory infections**: Frequent viral infections, bronchiolitis, pneumonia [^111zjRmt].
- **Structural abnormalities**: Tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, congenital anomalies [^notfound].
- **Other chronic conditions**: Cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, immunodeficiency [^111zjRmt].
- **Environmental factors**: Tobacco smoke exposure, indoor allergens [^111zjRmt].

---

## Role of family history and atopy

Family history of asthma or atopy and personal history of **eczema or food allergy** increase the likelihood of asthma, particularly in younger children where objective testing is limited [^114BtFWA] [^111jHGkx].

---

## Importance of regular follow-up and reassessment

Asthma is a dynamic condition; **regular follow-up is essential** to confirm the diagnosis, assess control, and adjust therapy. Reassess symptoms, triggers, and response to therapy at each visit, and repeat objective testing (spirometry) periodically in older children [^114EJofr] [^1161Euwm].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Children ≥ 5 years** | **Children < 5 years** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical symptoms (wheeze, cough, breathlessness) | Clinical symptoms (wheeze, cough, breathlessness) |
| 2 | Objective testing (spirometry, PEF, FeNO) | Risk factors (family history, atopy) |
| 3 | Exclude alternative diagnoses | Therapeutic trial (ICS) |
| 4 | Regular follow-up and reassessment | Regular follow-up and reassessment |

---

You can diagnose asthma in children by combining **clinical features, risk factors, and objective tests** where feasible, and by excluding alternative diagnoses. Regular follow-up and reassessment are essential to ensure accurate diagnosis and optimal management [^111jHGkx].

### Diagnosing asthma in children [^114Q38Cr]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite being the most common chronic lung disease in children, asthma continues to be frequently misdiagnosed in the pediatric population. The recommendations to establish a diagnosis of asthma in school-aged children have evolved over time, but there are still important discrepancies between published guidelines. Furthermore, preschool-aged children are often unable to perform objective testing, so the diagnosis of asthma remains a clinical one in the first several years of life, and there is still debate on the criteria and nomenclature to be used in this age group. In this review, we first discuss the definition and misdiagnosis of asthma in children. We then assess and compare published guidelines that outline how to establish the diagnosis of asthma in school-aged children. We also discuss the necessary steps to diagnose preschool-aged children with this disease. Last, we outline unanswered questions and opportunities for research in this field.

### Question 3: can we diagnose asthma in children under the age of 5 years? [^116ba628]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of asthma in children under five years has been controversial due to changing concepts of what true asthma is in this age group. Previous diagnostic algorithms that used clinical indices to predict the persistence of asthma symptoms or phenotypes based on asthma triggers do not predict which children will benefit from asthma medication. A pragmatic approach to asthma diagnosis in this age group is based on identifying signs and symptoms of reversible airflow obstruction and documenting their response to asthma medication. Hopefully, this approach will provide clearer guidance to clinicians and improve asthma morbidity in these young children.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children 5 years and younger [^113HSkDw]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic disease as measured by school absences, emergency department visits, and hospitalisation. During the past two decades, many scientific advances have improved our understanding of asthma and our ability to manage and control it effectively. However, in children 5 years and younger, the clinical symptoms of asthma are variable and non-specific. Furthermore, neither airflow limitation nor airway inflammation, the main pathologic hallmarks of the condition, can be assessed routinely in this age group. For this reason, to aid in the diagnosis of asthma in young children, a symptoms-only descriptive approach that includes the definition of various wheezing phenotypes has been recommended. In 1993, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was implemented to develop a network of individuals, organizations, and public health officials to disseminate information about the care of patients with asthma while at the same time assuring a mechanism to incorporate the results of scientific investigations into asthma care. Since then, GINA has developed and regularly revised a Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention. Publications based on the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention have been translated into many different languages to promote international collaboration and dissemination of information. In this report, Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention in Children 5 Years and Younger, an effort has been made to present the special challenges that must be taken into account in managing asthma in children during the first 5 years of life, including difficulties with diagnosis, the efficacy and safety of drugs and drug delivery systems, and the lack of data on new therapies. Approaches to these issues will vary among populations in the world based on socioeconomic conditions, genetic diversity, cultural beliefs, and differences in healthcare access and delivery. Patients in this age group are often managed by pediatricians and general practitioners routinely faced with a wide variety of issues related to childhood diseases.

### Asthma in preschool children: a review of the diagnostic challenges [^117VcHTv]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Family physicians face many challenges when diagnosing asthma in preschool children. These diagnostic challenges are compounded by variations in the natural history of early stage asthma, which are not fully understood, since early childhood wheezing and asthma are heterogeneous disorders with many phenotypic and variable expressions. Since no standard definition for the type, severity, or frequency of symptoms exist for this age group, clear evidence-based recommendations are lacking. Without adequate guidance, family physicians are left to make diagnostic and treatment decisions, which can lead to undertreatment of asthmatics and overtreatment of transient wheezers. New guidelines that specifically address the challenges of diagnosing asthma in this particular age group (Global Initiative for Asthma, British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) have recently been published, and researchers are actively seeking new methods and techniques through epidemiological studies to assist primary care clinicians in the diagnostic process. This review has wide application in primary care. By recognizing the diagnostic challenges and understanding the related best practices, family physicians will be better placed to treat, manage, and control asthma symptoms, resulting in lower morbidity rates and reduced health system costs, as well as enhancing the overall quality of life and well-being of the children affected.

### Consider the child: how early should we treat? [^117MPx65]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic and natural history studies of asthma have found that, for most people who develop asthma, clinical manifestations of the disease occur in the early childhood years. Both asthma persistence and severity during early childhood predict disease persistence into later childhood and adulthood, at which point asthma remission is uncommon. Current pathogenesis paradigms suggest that early intervention, before serious pathologic changes occur, may lead to optimal outcomes. Early intervention might optimize lung growth and immune development, and mitigate asthma persistence and severity. In this overview, categories for early intervention strategies for asthma will be based on the level of disruption of asthma pathogenesis. "Early interventions" target asthma shortly after its onset, "secondary preventions" aim to prevent lung targeting of disease processes in the vulnerable host, and "primary preventions" strive to promote healthful immune development and lung growth by keeping pro-asthmatic immune responses from occurring. This review will discuss recent clinical studies that exemplify early intervention and prevention strategies.

Key messages

The quality of childhood asthma diagnostic guidelines is highly variable.
The evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations is generally of very poor quality.
There is discrepant advice on recommended diagnostic tests and thresholds across guidelines.
Better evidence needs to be generated for existing and emerging diagnostic strategies.
GPs should refer for spirometry and reversibility testing to evaluate children ≥ 5 years.

### Pediatric asthma: how significant it is for the whole life? [^113aPuVs]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma is most frequent chronic disease in childhood. Childhood asthma frequently persists to adulthood and the available evidence suggests that the severity of childhood asthma predicts the severity of asthma in the adulthood. To prevent long term remodeling of the airways and improve prognosis, early diagnosis and treatment are necessary. More precise markers that would help to detect asthma and predict its prognosis are urgently needed.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^114PfQ9H]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Asthma is the the most common chronic respiratory condition of childhood worldwide, with around 14% of children and young people affected. Despite the high prevalence, paediatric asthma outcomes are inadequate, and there are several avoidable deaths each year. Characteristic asthma features include wheeze, shortness of breath and cough, which are typically triggered by a number of possible stimuli. There are several diagnostic challenges, and as a result, both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of paediatric asthma remain problematic. Effective asthma management involves a holistic approach addressing both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, as well as education and self-management aspects. Working in partnership with children and families is key in promoting good outcomes. Education on how to take treatment effectively, trigger avoidance, modifiable risk factors and actions to take during acute attacks via personalised asthma action plans is essential. This review aimed to provide an overview of good clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of paediatric asthma. We discuss the current diagnostic challenges and predictors of life-threatening attacks. Additionally, we outline the similarities and differences in global paediatric asthma guidelines and highlight potential future developments in care. It is hoped that this review will be useful for healthcare providers working in a range of child health settings.

### Prognosis of new-onset asthma diagnosed at adult age [^116Wbvbd]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common chronic disease, which can affect patients at any age. Recently, cluster analyses have suggested that patients with asthma can be divided into different phenotypes and that the age at the onset of the disease is a critical defining factor. The prognosis of allergic childhood-onset asthma is relatively well known, whereas the prognosis of adult-onset asthma remains unclear.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review to identify studies that evaluated the long-term prognosis of new-onset asthma diagnosed at adult age. Criteria used (set 1) were: 1. adult-onset asthma, 2. physician diagnosed asthma (including objective lung-functions) < 1 year before the first visit, 3. follow-up time of at least 5 years, 4. objective lung function measurements used at follow-up and 5. not a comparative trial. Another set of studies (set 2) with less strict criteria were gathered.

Results

The main result of this systematic review is that the amount of evidence on the prognosis of new-onset asthma diagnosed at adult age is very limited. Only one study (n = 250) fulfilled the criteria (set 1) and it suggests that the five-year prognosis of new-onset asthma diagnosed at adult age may not be favorable, the proportion of patients being in remission was less than 5%. Furthermore, six additional follow-up studies (n = 964) were identified including mainly patients with adult-onset asthma (set 2). These studies had variable endpoints and the results could not be combined.

Conclusion

Further follow-up studies that recruit patients with new-onset adult asthma are needed to understand the prognostic factors in adult-onset asthma.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^112v2Ah9]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Good-quality evidence is lacking to support the use of diagnostic tests in childhood asthma. Discrepant guideline recommendations based on the same evidence may contribute to poor clinician adherence to asthma guidelines and variation in testing practices. Therefore, guideline bodies should prioritise evidence to address the essential gaps and employ rigorous methods to identify all the best available evidence when making diagnostic recommendations for children with asthma.

Differential diagnoses and diagnostic uncertainty

Misdiagnosis of asthma remains a major problem with rates of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis being high. Overdiagnosis is problematic as it exposes children to unnecessary side effects of medications and runs the risk of trivialising asthma.

There are several conditions that may be associated with chronic cough, wheeze and/or shortness of breath in children and therefore present similarly to asthma (table 1). Due to the difficulties with diagnosis, especially in young children where objective testing is not possible, the diagnosis of asthma should be reviewed at each clinical presentation and interaction.

Table 1
Asthma differentials and clues in medical history

Diagnosing asthma in children

There is no single 'gold-standard' test that can be used to accurately diagnose asthma. In practice, a diagnosis should be made based on characteristic symptom patterns, evidence of variability in airflow limitation in the presence of airway inflammation, likelihood of alternative diagnoses and response to treatment. Getting the diagnosis correct is key for optimal management of paediatric asthma.

Lung function tests can be used to aid the diagnosis of asthma in children over the age of 5 years. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and spirometry are commonly used to assess airflow obstruction and reversibility. PEF can be used to detect diurnal variation, which is a typical feature of asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) specifically recommends the use of either PEF or spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children over 5 years. Once a child is old enough to reliably perform lung function testing, it is recommended that this be undertaken if the diagnosis of asthma has not been previously confirmed. In children under 5, lung function testing is rarely practical outside a research setting. This makes diagnosis in this age group additionally challenging. Guidelines vary between countries and regions with regard to diagnostic criteria. An overview of the similarities and differences between these guidelines is displayed in table 2. Lung function testing is frequently used to monitor progress of children with asthma as part of their care. Objective testing should be repeated if there is poor response to treatment or diagnostic uncertainty.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^112N8Dbp]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Presentation of asthma

Children with asthma typically present with a symptom triad of wheeze, shortness of breath and cough. However, 'asthma' is an umbrella term used to describe this collection of symptoms and, when present, should prompt practitioners to ask, 'What type of asthma is this?' There are a number of asthma subtypes that present and respond to treatment differently. Identification of the features of asthma and modifiable or treatable traits should only be the start of the diagnostic journey. Asthma symptoms are normally intermittent in nature and may not be present at the time of clinical review, making the diagnosis challenging in some cases. Additionally, disease phenotypes are not fixed and may evolve over time, necessitating ongoing review of symptoms and treatment.

Wheeze is a key feature of asthma and, if not present, a diagnosis of asthma in a child is unlikely. Wheeze is an expiratory high-pitched whistle that occurs as a result of inflammation and narrowing of the small airways. Parental understanding of wheeze varies, and clarifying what is meant when it is reported is key in making an accurate diagnosis.

The prevalence of 'preschool wheeze' is an additional challenge when diagnosing asthma in young children. In the first few years of life, many children will experience wheeze, but not all will go on to develop true asthma. The diagnosis of asthma should therefore be reviewed routinely to identify true asthma and alter treatment where necessary. Favourable response to an appropriate trial of asthma treatment is an important confirmatory piece of diagnostic evidence.

Clinical examination may be normal in children and adolescents with asthma if they present during asymptomatic periods. During acute attacks, use of accessory muscles of respiration and widespread wheeze may be present. Chest hyperinflation may be identified in acute and chronic disease settings.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in preschool and school-age children: focus on the 2007 NAEPP guidelines [^116KChY5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the changes in the revised National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma pertaining to children and highlights areas that may benefit from further study.

Recent Findings

The most recent NAEPP Guidelines contain several pediatric-specific features, including subdividing classification and treatment recommendations, into three age categories (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and ≥ 12 years). The introduction of the concept of two domains within asthma severity and control, namely impairment and risk, allows classification of patients who are either treatment-naive (asthma severity) or who are receiving controller therapy (asthma control). Suggestions for criteria for initiating daily controller therapy in preschool children with exacerbations or risk factors for asthma symptom persistence, including the asthma predictive index, are discussed. Evidence-based treatment recommendations are provided for the three age groups.

Summary

The recent NAEPP Asthma Guidelines improve on many areas of the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in children and lead to the identification of areas that would benefit from further research.

### Diagnostic challenges of childhood asthma [^112apTwu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diagnosis of asthma in childhood is challenging. Both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of asthma are important issues. The present review gives information about challenging factors for an accurate diagnosis of childhood asthma.

Recent Findings

Although underdiagnosis of asthma in childhood has always been the most important diagnostic problem, overdiagnosis of asthma has also been increasingly recognized. This is probably due to diagnosis of asthma based on symptoms and signs alone. Demonstration of variable airflow obstruction by lung function tests is the most common asthma diagnostic tests used in practice and is therefore strongly recommended in children who can cooperate. Recently, an asthma guideline combining the clinical and economic evidences with sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic procedures was developed to improve accuracy of diagnosis and to avoid overdiagnosis. This guideline provided an algorithmic clinical and cost-effective approach and included fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement as one of the diagnostic tests in addition to lung function.

Summary

Diagnosis of asthma in children should be made by combining relevant history with at least two confirmatory diagnostic tests whenever possible. Diagnosis based on short-period treatment trials should be limited to young children who are unable to cooperate with these tests.

### Severe asthma guidelines in children and adolescents: a practical document for physicians [^116XRj3V]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common disease in childhood with a minority of affected children suffering from severe asthma. Patients with severe asthma require high dose inhaled glucocorticoids plus a second controller and/or systemic corticosteroids to be well-controlled or remain uncontrolled despite such treatment. Although only a small subset of children and adolescents falls in this category, the management of affected patients represents a major concern for pediatricians. Guidelines and recommendations have been designed to guide the management of this group of patients. Though the terms "recommendations" and "guidelines" are often used interchangeably, it should be noted that the first one should be used more narrowly to identify specific actions and the second one to broadly refer to the umbrella under which multiple recommendations for a specific condition are provided. Moreover, the availability of several and sometimes-conflicting documents on severe asthma management both in adult and pediatric age could generate confusion among health care professionals. The manuscript analyses seven papers addressing severe asthma, comparing any key aspects and differences. Finally, we tried to create a more practical document for physicians to simplify the interpretation of the several available documents on severe asthma management focusing the pediatric age.

Guidelines

Table 3 lists key recommendations from three international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children. Overall, they are similar in their recommendations for the use of objectives measurements to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. The guidelines, however, differ in the age brackets used to classify management recommendations, which slightly limits comparisons. A key fundamental difference is that the recent GINA guideline does not recommend the use of SABA alone for the management of asthma in children and adolescents aged 6 years and above. For mild asthma (step 1 treatment), GINA advise using a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler as needed. In children aged 6–11 years, owing to device limitations, SABA as needed via a metered dose inhaler plus a dose of ICS at the same time is recommended as step 1 treatment. GINA further recommend that a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler is used as a reliever for children aged 12 years and over. The GINA recommendations are a major change to the management of mild asthma and reliever treatment in asthma.

### Diagnosis of asthma in symptomatic children based on measures of lung function: an analysis of data from a population-based birth cohort study [^112FRaLM]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Asthma is an umbrella term that includes several phenotypes (which are better characterised in adults than in children); however, at present, the diagnosis is made before any phenotyping and treatment pathways are not dependent on phenotyping for most children with mild-to-moderate asthma. Diagnostic algorithms might need to allow for different patterns of lung function to capture all types of asthma. We recognise that we have tested this algorithm in a population of adolescents (aged 13–16 years) and that this age range is not fully representative of the paediatric population. Results in younger children might reveal different strengths and weaknesses of this algorithm and future prospective studies should aim to include children from age 5–6 years upwards.

We believe that our study makes an important contribution to knowledge in this difficult area. Our findings suggest an urgent need exists for appropriately designed studies to generate evidence about the value of different tests for the diagnosis of paediatric asthma in primary care. Until such evidence is available, the proposed NICE guidance on asthma diagnosis should not be implemented in children.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^114onBbp]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

Guidelines aim to reflect the appropriate standards of clinical care. Our study demonstrated the variable quality of methodology and reporting across international guidelines for childhood asthma. Few guidelines employed rigorous methods to search for the best available evidence, considered barriers, and facilitators in implementing guideline recommendations, appropriately involved all relevant stakeholders (including parents or public representatives), or had all guideline contributors declare and appropriately address conflicts of interest. The quality of evidence supporting childhood asthma diagnostic recommendations was also generally poor. Quality did not vary based on age group, test type or if the recommendation was "for" or "against" performing the test.

There were discrepancies in guidelines' recommendations about whether to perform a test based on different interpretations of the supporting evidence. Even though guidelines agreed that spirometry should be utilised for diagnosing asthma in children older than 5 years, the recommended diagnostic test thresholds differed. This would lead to significant uncertainty around testing and diagnosing asthma in children and also unreliable disease prevalence estimates.

The poor quality of evidence supporting recommendations and inconsistencies in guideline recommendations for a given diagnostic test could translate to variation in testing in clinical practice. This could mean some children receive tests unnecessarily, and others do not get tested, missing out on the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Over and undertesting causes harm to the individual patient from failure to receive appropriate treatment and its associated costs. It also has systemic implications relating to equity and fair distribution of resources.

### Challenges in assessing outcomes for pediatric asthma [^115H3Ugr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Although progress has been made in understanding asthma, much remains unknown; as a result, diagnosis and treatment are not optimal. Information is still needed about the natural history of asthma to better understand which patients are at risk of inflammation and at what point during their disease that inflammation occurs. In the case of children, a greater understanding of the disease's natural history is needed to establish criteria for early diagnosis and to evaluate progressive aspects of the disease so that appropriate measures of progression can be defined. The safety of various medications used as long-term controllers must also be evaluated. The growing information about medication effects on asthma provides unique opportunities to design studies that will guide improvement in asthma care. A number of disease outcomes can be used as surrogate markers of clinically significant endpoints, and a number of adverse effects may serve as surrogate markers. The consequences of poor control of pediatric asthma can be observed in a variety of clinical markers, including clinical features of the disease that worsen as it progresses, pulmonary function deterioration, lung hyperexpansion, and inflammation increases. The Childhood Asthma Management Program is an ongoing clinical trial designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in children. Its hypothesis is that anti-inflammatory treatment of childhood asthma will not only relieve morbidity but will also improve lung growth.

### Paediatric asthma-all that wheezes is not necessarily asthma-current diagnostic and management strategies [^115Nbz2n]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is a frequently encountered chronic medical condition encountered in paediatrics, affecting 7% of children under the age of 18 in the United States. Although asthma is one of the more common conditions that is associated with wheezing, there is a broad differential diagnosis to consider. The purpose of this review is to describe other causes of wheezing outside of asthma in a paediatric population and discuss diagnostic and management strategies to consider when evaluating a child or adolescent with wheezing.

Recent Findings

The characteristics of the wheezing along with other associated signs and symptoms can be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. The age and the past medical history of the patient are also important aspects to consider when determining next steps in the evaluation and management of paediatric wheezing. In addition to considering other causes of wheezing, it is often necessary to assess for the presence of underlying asthma, and recently updated asthma guidelines from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute provide a graded review of various recommendations for making the diagnosis and managing asthma in the clinical setting.

Summary

It is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating a paediatric patient with wheezing.

Management decisions for pediatric asthma (in patients younger than 12 years of age) based on extrapolation from available evidence in adolescents and adults (age 12 years and older) is common but rarely appropriate. This article addresses the disparity in response between the two age groups, presents the available pediatric evidence, and highlights the important areas in which further research is required. Evidence-based recommendations for acute and interval management of pediatric asthma are provided.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^114NSaTL]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Although many children with asthma do not experience persistence into adulthood, recent studies have suggested that poorly controlled asthma in childhood may be associated with significant airflow obstruction in adulthood. However, data regarding disease progression are lacking, and clinicians are not yet able to predict the course of a child's asthma. The goal of this article was to assess the current understanding of childhood asthma treatment and progression and to highlight gaps in information that remain.

Data Sources

Nonsystematic PubMed literature search and authors' expertise.

Study Selection

Articles were selected at the authors' discretion based on areas of interest in childhood asthma treatment and progression into adulthood.

Results

Uncontrolled asthma in early childhood can potentially have lasting effects on lung development, but it is unclear whether traditional interventions in very young children preserve lung function. Although not all children respond to standard interventions, certain asthma phenotypes have been identified that can help to understand which children may respond to a particular treatment.

Conclusion

Clinicians should monitor children's asthma control and pulmonary function over time to assess the long‐term impact of an intervention and to minimize the effect of uncontrolled asthma, especially exacerbations, on lung development. New biologic therapies have shown promise in treating adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma, and some of these therapies are approved in the United States for children as young as age 6. However, knowledge gaps regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments in younger children hamper our understanding of their effect on long‐term outcomes.

The 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma initiated a stepwise model based on an ongoing assessment of asthma severity and control. 9 An increasing step number corresponds to augmenting levels of intervention, and a decreasing step number corresponds to tapering down levels of intervention. Asthma severity refers to the intensity of the disease process, which is intrinsic to an individual's disease; severity is determined upon initiation of treatment. In contrast, asthma control is the degree to which symptoms impact a patient's life (eg, activity limitations); control must be continually assessed in order to adjust therapy accordingly. The NAEPP guidelines further focus on two domains of severity and control: impairment and risk. Impairment refers to the extent to which the frequency and intensity of asthma symptoms result in functional limitations for the patient, and risk refers to the likelihood of future asthma exacerbations, decline in lung function/lung growth, or adverse effects from medication. Severity also takes into account the amount of medication necessary to achieve control. Achieving and maintaining control is a major goal of asthma therapy; poorly controlled asthma is associated with increased risk of exacerbations. 10 Reducing impairment (eg, by preventing chronic symptoms) as well as minimizing future risk (eg, by preventing exacerbations) are therefore critical to the long‐term management of asthma. 9 The 2018 GINA report, which is updated and revised more frequently, also recommends a stepwise approach for asthma therapy. 2

Because asthma is heterogeneous in presentation and variable in course over time, its clinical consequences can be unpredictable if not assessed by objective determinants, such as lung function or airway hyperresponsiveness. Limiting the evaluation to the periodic use of subjective determinants of asthma, such as past interval history or asthma control scores, does not accurately reflect the natural history of an individual into adulthood. Persistent asthma refers to a continuation of symptoms, whereas asthma progression can be considered a worsening of asthma symptoms, potentially accompanied by a decline in lung function. 11 Although some children experience persistent or even progressive asthma as they enter adulthood, others experience a remission of symptoms as they age. 12, 13, 14

### Prevalence and risk factors for childhood asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rgw5e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the different definitions, the observed prevalences of childhood asthma are relatively close, with all estimates falling within a narrow range of 10–11%. Several factors may contribute to this similarity: the different definitions, while varying in their specific criteria, often overlap in the types of symptoms and conditions they capture. For example, a child with asthma who requires medical attention (care-defined) is also likely to be diagnosed by a physician and may report their condition in a survey; the overall prevalence of childhood asthma in the studied populations may be relatively stable, meaning that even with different definitions, the underlying burden of the disease remains consistent. This suggests that the core population of children with asthma is being captured across the different definitions; and the clinical practice of diagnosing and managing asthma may be well-established, leading to consistent reporting and management practices. This can result in similar prevalence rates across different definitions, as the same children are likely to be identified regardless of the method used.

### Difficult asthma in the pre-school child [^115zHYv5]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

The most important aspect of dealing with a pre-school child suspected of having difficult asthma, is to ensure that the diagnosis is correct, in order to avoid the inappropriate use of therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids. After exclusion of other diagnoses, if a pre-school child is thought to have asthma, difficult or otherwise, the corollary is, what sort of asthma? Is it a syndrome with airway inflammation susceptible to treatment, or one in which there is no inflammation and time alone will result in resolution of symptoms? Probably the most common mistake in this age group is to fail to recognise the latter and institute ever more aggressive and useless therapies. An approach to excluding other diagnoses, appropriate investigations to elicit the presence of airway inflammation and suggestions for subsequent management have been detailed in this review.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1148j9QB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnosis in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years: The diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, which should be documented from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests, and more than one test may be needed to confirm asthma or exclude alternative causes of respiratory symptoms. Many health professionals do not have access to spirometry; if so, peak expiratory flow (PEF) should be used, rather than relying on symptoms alone. Test before treating, wherever possible, i.e., document the evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment, as it is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis once asthma control has improved, and additional or alternative strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations including patients already on ICS-containing treatment, the elderly, patients presenting with cough as the only symptom (including cough variant asthma), and patients in low-resource settings.

2 THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA

Similar to adult asthma, the underlying etiology of pediatric asthma symptoms is chronic airway inflammation. Pediatric patients may present with a number of respiratory symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁). 2 Symptom presentation can vary significantly over time. Furthermore, serial measurements of lung function over time are usually limited to patients with the most severe asthma and seldom evaluated over time in less severe patients. Unfortunately, measurement of lung function and other physiologic tests are not feasible for the younger population aged < 6 years. Overall, there is a paucity of data investigating diagnosis and treatment of asthma in very young children (aged ≤ 5 years). Figure 1 outlines criteria for asthma diagnosis by age group, which are adapted from the GINA report. 2 Furthermore, the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network asthma guidelines suggest obtaining fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), airway responsiveness, and spirometry measurements (depending on the child's age) to assess asthma in children, but do not make recommendations about regular follow‐up for these tools. 6 It is noteworthy that although children aged ≤ 5 years have similar asthma symptoms as older patients with asthma, the presentation is complicated by the recurrent wheezing from frequent respiratory infections that occurs in this age group. In fact, in children aged < 3 years, wheezing alone is a poor predictor of asthma development later in life. 7 A number of factors have been linked to asthma development in children, including allergic sensitization to aeroallergens and family history of asthma. 8

### Asthma transition from childhood into adulthood [^113wL8TR]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease both in children and adults and resembles a complex syndrome rather than a single disease. Different methods have been developed to better characterise distinct asthma phenotypes in childhood and adulthood. In studies of adults, most phenotyping relies on biomaterials from the lower airways; however, this information is missing in paediatric studies because of restricted accessibility. Few patients show symptoms throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Risk factors for this might be genetics, family history of asthma and atopy, infections early in life, allergic diseases, and lung function deficits. In turn, a large proportion of children with asthma lose their symptoms during school age and adolescence. This improved prognosis, which might also reflect a better treatment response, is associated with being male and with milder and less allergic disease. Importantly, whether clinical remission of symptoms equals the disappearance of underlying pathology is unknown. In fact, airway hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation might remain despite the absence of overt symptoms. Additionally, a new-onset of asthma symptoms is apparent in adulthood, especially in women and in the case of impaired lung function. However, many patients do not remember childhood symptoms, which might reflect relapse rather than true initiation. Both relapse and adult-onset of asthma symptoms have been associated with allergic disease and sensitisation in addition to airway hyper-responsiveness. Thus, asthma symptoms beginning in adults might have originated in childhood. Equivocally, persistence into, relapse, and new-onset of symptoms in adulthood have all been related to active smoking. However, underlying mechanisms for the associations remain unclear, and future asthma research should therefore integrate standardised molecular approaches in identical ways in both paediatric and adult populations and in longitudinal studies.

### Pediatric asthma: a different disease [^117M9vqc]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Asthma currently affects the lives of more than 30 million Americans from infancy to the elderly. In many ways, pediatric asthma differs from adult asthma, including childhood-onset adult asthma. Despite many advances in our understanding of the disease, the natural history of asthma is not well defined, especially in different subsets of patients. For many with allergic asthma the disease has its origins in early childhood, associated with early sensitization to aeroallergens and exposure to repeated viral infections. These early life exposures, coupled with genetically determined susceptibility, have a major impact on the natural history of the disease. A number of risk factors during the critical early stages in the initiation of asthma have been associated with subsequent outcomes. In addition, protective factors linked to early life experiences have also been delineated which may impact the development of atopy and asthma and reduce the prevalence of these diseases. Cumulatively, the data highlight the critical nature of this early period in which immune/inflammatory responses in the lung are initiated and serve to maintain the disease in subsequent years.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pQ9XK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

### New directions in pediatric asthma [^111zNhoK]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Childhood asthma affects many children placing them at significant risk for health care utilization and school absences. Several new developments relevant to the field of pediatric asthma have occurred over the last 5 years; yet, there is much more to learn. It is poorly understood how to prevent the disease, optimally address environmental challenges, or effectively manage poor adherence. Moreover, it is not clear how to customize therapy by asthma phenotype, age group, high risk groups, or severity of disease. Highlights of advances in pediatric asthma are reviewed and multiple essential areas for further exploration and research are discussed.

Asthma is the leading chronic disease among children in most industrialized countries. However, the evidence base on specific aspects of pediatric asthma, including therapeutic strategies, is limited and no recent international guidelines have focused exclusively on pediatric asthma. As a result, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology nominated expert teams to find a consensus to serve as a guideline for clinical practice in Europe as well as in North America. This consensus report recommends strategies that include pharmacological treatment, allergen and trigger avoidance and asthma education. The report is part of the PRACTALL initiative, which is endorsed by both academies.

### Development of a symptom-based tool for screening of children at high risk of preschool asthma [^1121SRLL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can a symptom-based screening tool (CHILDhood Asthma Risk Tool [CHART]) improve the ability to identify children at risk of persistent asthma symptoms and health care use?

Findings

In this diagnostic study of 2354 children with validation in 2 external cohorts, CHART identified infants from the general population at high risk of asthma, persistent symptoms, and health care burden without the need for invasive and time-consuming tests.

Meaning

These findings suggest that CHART may be incorporated as a routine screening tool in primary care settings to trigger timely treatment initiatives and promote active disease monitoring.

### The asthma predictive index: a very useful tool for predicting asthma in young children [^113w6ADu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent wheezing is a common problem in young children: approximately 40% of children wheeze in their first year of life. However, only 30% of preschoolers with recurrent wheezing still have asthma at the age of 6 years. Nevertheless, asthma, the most prevalent chronic disease in children, is difficult to diagnose in infants and preschoolers. This article reviews the importance of determining at an early age which infants/preschoolers will have asthma later in life, analyzes the pros and cons of different predictive indices, and discusses the efficacy of the Asthma Predictive Index.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111jHGkx]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Symptoms suggestive of asthma in children 5 years and younger — diagnostic basis and controller trial follow-up: An asthma diagnosis in children 5 years and younger can often be based on symptom patterns (recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough, breathlessness (typically manifested by activity limitation), and nocturnal symptoms or awakenings), presence of risk factors for development of asthma (family history of atopy, allergic sensitization, allergy or asthma, or a personal history of food allergy or atopic dermatitis), therapeutic response to controller treatment, and exclusion of alternate diagnoses. The frequency and severity of wheezing episodes and the temporal pattern of symptoms should be considered, and any controller treatment should be viewed as a treatment trial, with follow up scheduled after 2–3 months to review the response. Diagnosis is based largely on recurrent symptom patterns plus careful clinical assessment and differential diagnosis; a positive family history or the presence of atopy or allergic sensitization provide additional predictive support, and early allergic sensitization increases the likelihood that a wheezing child will develop persistent asthma.

### Severe asthma in childhood: diagnostic and management challenges [^114WpoGE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Problematic severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes. It is rare (< 5% of children with asthma), but accounts for 30–50% of all pediatric asthma healthcare costs. This review looks into the currently used management strategies and the innovative treatments, considering both conventional medications and innovative biological therapies for targeting airway inflammation.

Recent Findings

Patients with problematic severe asthma should be seen by pediatric asthma specialists using a stepwise approach. The first step is to exclude alternative diagnoses; the second is to consider and exclude comorbidities, and assess adherence to medication; the third step involves identifying the pattern of inflammation; and response to treatment in the fourth. Innovative biological therapies are emerging and healthcare professionals should know how to handle them. Patient phenotyping is the main step towards a targeted therapeutic strategy.

Summary

A careful management is important for children with severe asthma, who form a small but challenging group of patients. More research efforts are needed to enable a personalized medicine and a biomarker-driven approach.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of asthma in children, what are the solutions? A scoping review of 3 countries in sub saharan Africa [^114zPEU4]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Asthma is a major cause of child morbidity and mortality and its prevalence is rising in SSA. Early asthma diagnosis and follow-up care allow alveoli and airway health, improve lung function, and prevent the risk of COAD. Asthma diagnosis remains a challenge in SSA countries mainly due to community stigma and lack of knowledge, inaccessibility to health care, strained health systems and lack of guidelines or non-implementation of these guidelines. A comprehensive 4-pronged approach to improve asthma diagnosis will include community and school based education programmes on asthma, revision of asthma diagnostic terms, development and implementation of diagnostic guidelines and health systems strengthening. In addition there is need to improve availability and accessibility to asthma treatment.

### Precision medicine to diagnose asthma in preschool children: comparison of clinical scores, lung function, biomarkers, and genetic tests [^1142pBVG]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is an umbrella term for several phenotypes and endotypes. It most frequently begins before the age of 6, with significant morbidity and decline in lung function occurring among all pediatric age groups. A delay in the diagnosis of asthma in preschoolers is associated with more severe exacerbations. One problem clinicians face is how to diagnose asthma early in its course; epidemiological phenotypes (i.e., transient, persistent, late-onset, and mid-childhood remitting wheeze) can only be ascertained retrospectively, and clinical phenotypes (e.g., episodic viral and multi-trigger wheeze) suffer from high variability and no relation with underlying pathological airway markers. International guidelines recommend that lung function tests and biomarkers be performed before diagnosing asthma in children under 5 years old. However, spirometry and airway resistance measures are typically normal in most preschoolers with asthma, and blood eosinophil counts, the most reliable biomarker for inhaled corticosteroid therapy, vary widely over time. Clinical predictive indices can help in predicting and diagnosing asthma in preschoolers. At least eight clinical predictive indices have been published, and four have been validated (API, PIAMA, APT, and PARS). Here, we will review the challenges of diagnosing asthma in the preschool age, the utility of several clinical indices, and the usefulness of incorporating biomarkers such as volatile organic components, exhaled breath condensate, and gene expression. Finally, we will discuss existing gaps and future directions for research in the field.

### 2022 year in review: pediatric asthma [^116hw69G]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by variable, reversible airway obstruction and hyper-responsive airways. There is a high economic burden due to a child having poorly controlled asthma with one or more asthma exacerbations resulting in an emergency department visit or hospitalization in a year. Publications on diagnosis, treatment, and management of pediatric asthma are ongoing with over 2,549 papers published from January-November 2022. The intent of this paper is to summarize 8 key topics that have prompted discussions with local, regional, and national asthma experts due to a shift in clinical practice or lessons learned from the recent pandemic that may have future application.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Difficult-to-treat asthma management in school-age children [^11246qvZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization divides severe asthma into three categories: untreated severe asthma; difficult-to-treat severe asthma; and severe, therapy-resistant asthma. The apparent frequency of severe asthma in the general population of asthmatic children is probably around 5%. Upon referral of these children, it is important to evaluate the diagnosis of asthma carefully before modifying management and applying a long-term monitoring plan. Identification of pathophysiologic phenotypes using objective biomarkers is essential in our routine assessments of severe asthma. Although conventional pharmacologic approaches should be attempted first, there is growing recognition that children with difficult-to-treat asthma may have unique clinical phenotypes that may necessitate alternative treatment approaches including asthma biologics. These new medications, especially those with effects on multiple pathologic features of asthma, raise the hope that new treatment strategies could induce remission. Besides introducing new medications, the opportunity for closer monitoring is feasible with advances in digital health. Therefore, we have the opportunity to improve response to medications, individualize treatment, and monitor response along with potential steps to prevent severe asthma.

### Defining asthma in the preschool-aged child [^111b7mn9]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

A physician faces many challenges in making a definitive diagnosis of asthma in young children. Although there are clinical and historical features consistent with asthma, identical features are present in many other diseases. Furthermore, there is no specific test for asthma. Other diseases must always be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis of asthma is made. Determining whether cough or wheeze is the primary symptom is important because asthma is primarily a wheezing disease. Sweat chloride testing, chest radiography, and allergy skin testing should be performed in children with persistent wheezing to rule out other causes and help support a diagnosis of asthma. Allergy skin testing provides particularly useful information for making a diagnosis of asthma in the preschool-aged child. A chart review of patients presenting consecutively to the Division of Allergy and Pulmonary Medicine provides insight and information on an approach to make an asthma diagnosis for this population.

### Protocol for a systematic review to identify and weight the indicators of risk of asthma exacerbations in children aged 5–12 years [^113S5HtW]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The key aim of the management of asthma in children (and all ages) is to reduce the burden of disease both by achieving good control of day-to-day symptoms and by reducing the risk of troublesome, and potentially serious asthma attacks. Targeting those at risk, has the potential to facilitate care commensurate with need and improve outcomes for those at highest risk. Likely risk factors include markers of severe disease and historical poor control (including previous exacerbations), as well as allergic sensitisation, exposure to environmental factors (including parental smoking), especially, the combination of infection and allergen exposure in sensitised children, and poor adherence to preventer medication and non-attendance for review appointments. Identification and weighting of these features of children and their family/environment will allow clinicians to identify 'at-risk' children, and inform discussions with parents about the need for regular 'preventer' treatment.

The vision is that risk assessment will have application both clinically for assessing individual children's asthma control and thus focussing additional care on those at high risk, as well as for assessing control within populations and targeting care at high-risk populations.

### Trends in the age of diagnosis of childhood asthma [^115Nx2R6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The cause of rising asthma incidence over time remains unexplained. Examining trends in the age of diagnosis across successive birth cohorts may offer insights into asthma etiology.

Objective

To examine trends in the age at asthma diagnosis and the age and proportion of children hospitalized at first asthma diagnosis in Ontario, Canada.

Methods

Eight consecutive birth cohorts of children (1993–2000) were observed using administrative data from a universal health insurance plan in Ontario, Canada (population 13 million). Trends in the need for hospitalization and age at asthma diagnosis were examined with descriptive and survival analyses.

Results

The records of 1,059,511 children were examined, of whom 201,958 developed asthma in the first 8 years of life, with an average cumulative incidence of 19.1%. Mean age at asthma diagnosis decreased from 4.7 ± 1.5 years in birth year 1993 to 2.6 ± 2.0 years in birth year 2000 (P < .0001), with a higher adjusted risk of asthma diagnosis (hazard ratio, 6.7; 95% CI, 6.5–6.9) in the first 3 years of life for children born after 1996 versus children born in the period 1993 to 1995 (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3–1.4). The proportion of children hospitalized at asthma diagnosis stayed stable while the age at first asthma hospitalization decreased over time (P < .0001).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates a significant increase in asthma incidence and a decrease in the age of asthma diagnosis across multiple birth cohorts. Changes in asthma incidence over time are primarily explained by variations in asthma rates in children younger than 3 years.

### Generating evidence to inform an update of asthma clinical practice guidelines: perspectives from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [^111yCWSZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Its increasing prevalence and evidence of suboptimal control require renewed efforts in the development and widespread implementation of clinical practice guidelines for prevention, treatment, and control. Given the rapidly changing landscape and evolving best practices for guideline development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute made a commitment to support rigorous systematic evidence reviews that frontline health care providers and stakeholders could use to create new or update existing guidelines. This article describes the protocols, key questions, methodology, and analytic framework to support the update of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) on the diagnosis and management of asthma in adults and children. It also describes the expert panel's practical experience in managing asthmatic patients across the age and severity spectrum. The article explains the process for ensuring that the expert panel's deliberations are conducted in accordance with the Institute of Medicine's standards and recommendations for guideline development. The outcome of this ambitious effort will be an update of the EPR-3 asthma guidelines and publication of the key recommendations in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Importantly, several novel approaches will be explored and incorporated as appropriate to accelerate adoption and sustained implementation of the guidelines.

### Childhood asthma prediction models: a systematic review [^112zyx8U]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Early identification of children at risk of developing asthma at school age is crucial, but the usefulness of childhood asthma prediction models in clinical practice is still unclear. We systematically reviewed all existing prediction models to identify preschool children with asthma-like symptoms at risk of developing asthma at school age. Studies were included if they developed a new prediction model or updated an existing model in children aged 4 years or younger with asthma-like symptoms, with assessment of asthma done between 6 and 12 years of age. 12 prediction models were identified in four types of cohorts of preschool children: those with health-care visits, those with parent-reported symptoms, those at high risk of asthma, or children in the general population. Four basic models included non-invasive, easy-to-obtain predictors only, notably family history, allergic disease comorbidities or precursors of asthma, and severity of early symptoms. Eight extended models included additional clinical tests, mostly specific IgE determination. Some models could better predict asthma development and other models could better rule out asthma development, but the predictive performance of no single model stood out in both aspects simultaneously. This finding suggests that there is a large proportion of preschool children with wheeze for which prediction of asthma development is difficult.

### Personalized medicine and pediatric asthma [^116mZk5s]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder described by a large number of clinical features. A growing body of literature on more specific asthma phenotypes provides evidence for a phenotype-based approach to management in which specific therapies are recommended based on patient and disease characteristics. This understanding, coupled with an increase in the number of available therapies for children with asthma, as well as emerging therapies and phenotypic markers, will allow for improved asthma management in the future.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116fRoxw]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of asthma in children 5 years and younger — making a confident diagnosis is challenging because episodic respiratory symptoms such as wheezing and cough are also common in children without asthma, particularly in those aged 0–2 years, and it is not possible to routinely assess airflow limitation or bronchodilator responsiveness in this age group; a probability-based approach based on the pattern of symptoms during and between viral respiratory infections may be helpful for discussion with parents/caregivers and allows individual decisions about whether to give a trial of controller treatment, with decisions for each child individually to avoid either over- or under-treatment.

Table 2
Summary of paediatric asthma national guidelines: focusing on diagnosis

FeNO is used to detect and quantify eosinophilic airway inflammation with levels elevated in those with eosinophilic asthma. Once staff are trained, and provided equipment is available, FeNO is a practically useful test that is quick to perform in school-aged children. The exact positioning of FeNO testing varies between guidelines worldwide (table 2). FeNO monitoring may also be useful in titrating dosage of ICS in those with an established diagnosis of asthma.

Allergy testing (skin prick testing or measurement of specific IgE levels) is not routinely carried out in the diagnostic process; however, it is recommended in a number of clinical guidelines and may identify individual triggers.

There are several aspects that make paediatric asthma diagnosis challenging. Most diagnoses are made in primary care where there is often limited access to objective testing at present. Despite guideline recommendations, objective testing is frequently only available in secondary or tertiary care settings where equipment and trained staff are available. The COVID-19 pandemic has served to exacerbate these issues and increase backlogs. Various solutions have been proposed, including community diagnostic hubs. In some healthcare systems, the cost of undergoing objective testing is a cause of health inequalities.

Additionally, the symptom onset for most cases of paediatric asthma occurs before the age of 3 yearswhen lung function testing cannot be used to aid diagnosis. In this age group, response to an asthma treatment trial is useful to aid diagnostic decision making and is recommended in a number of national guidelines.

### Phenotypic differences between pediatric and adult asthma [^1169MjPD]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

The goal of asthma phenotyping is to understand disease mechanisms or optimize management. Phenotypes show age-related variation. The phenotypes of wheezing in the first year of life are little studied; many remit in the second year of life, and the children who remit do not have later-onset wheeze, as far as is known. Preschool wheeze is optimally phenotyped by symptom pattern, defined as either episodic viral or multiple-trigger wheeze, which allows rational treatment planning. In school age and adult life, most patients with mild asthma can be managed adequately without phenotyping, but severe asthma clearly falls into several phenotypic groups. Children with severe asthma have no gender bias and are highly atopic with relatively well-preserved lung function, in contrast to the female-preponderant, non-atopic bias seen in adults. Phenotyping has been mainly by proximal luminal cellularity. However, this does not take account of any variation of cellularity over time, distal airway changes, or the relative contribution of mucosal and luminal inflammatory changes. There may be a separate exacerbating phenotype, characterized by airway eosinophilia. Particular adult phenotypes include late-onset asthma and a phenotype characterized by progressive loss of lung function, but critical review suggests that these phenotypes may also have childhood roots. Longitudinal data are needed to determine the stability of phenotypes and their prognoses. Retrospective recall of childhood events is of limited value. In conclusion, a full understanding the multifaceted phenotypes of asthma requires a thorough knowledge of early life events and their consequences over many decades.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^115VYmbg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

While we have international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, asthma remains poorly controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use, particularly in primary care.

Discussion

Clinical practice guidelines based on evidence from randomized controlled trials are considered the most rigorous and accurate. Current evidence-based guidelines are written predominantly from the perspective of the patient with a clear-cut asthma diagnosis, however, and tend not to consider the heterogeneity of asthma or to accommodate individual patient variations in response to treatment or their needs, differences in practice settings, or local differences in availability and cost of therapies. The results of randomized controlled trials, which are designed to establish efficacy of treatment under ideal conditions, may not apply to 'real-world' clinical practice, where patients are unselected, monitoring is less frequent, and effectiveness — the benefit of treatment in routine clinical practice — is the most relevant outcome. Moreover, most guidelines see asthma in isolation rather than considering other factors that may impact on asthma and response to asthma therapy, particularly age, allergic rhinitis, cigarette smoking, adherence, and genetic factors. When these links are recognized, guidelines rarely provide practical recommendations for treatment in these scenarios. Finally, there is some evidence that general practitioners are not convinced of the applicability of asthma guidelines to their practice settings, especially when those writing the guidelines principally work in specialist practice.

Conclusion

Developing country-specific guidelines or, ideally, local guidelines could provide more practical solutions for asthma care and could account for regional factors that influence patient choice and adherence to therapy. Pragmatic clinical trials and well-designed observational trials are needed in addition to randomized controlled trials to assess real-world effectiveness of therapies, and such evidence needs also to be considered by guideline writers. Finally, practical tools to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of asthma and factors responsible for poor control, such as associated allergic rhinitis, limited adherence, and smoking behavior, are needed to supplement treatment information provided in clinical practice guidelines for asthma.

### Asthma across the ages: knowledge gaps in childhood asthma [^111DFKJQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened an Asthma Group in response to the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. The overall goal of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act Program is to improve pediatric therapeutics through preclinical and clinical drug trials that lead to drug-labeling changes. Although significant advances have been made in the understanding and management of asthma in adults with appropriately labeled medications, less information is available on the management of asthma in children. Indeed, many medications are inadequately labeled for use in children. In general, the younger the child, the less information there is available to guide clinicians. Because asthma often begins in early childhood, it is incumbent on us to continue to address the primary questions raised in this review and carefully evaluate the medications used to manage asthma in children. Meanwhile, continued efforts should be made in defining effective strategies that reduce the risk of exacerbations. If the areas of defined need are addressed in the coming years, namely prevention of exacerbations and progression of disease, as well as primary intervention, we will see continuing reduction in asthma mortality and morbidity along with improved quality of life for children with asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114BtFWA]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma in children 5 years and younger — tests to assist diagnosis — notes that while no tests definitively diagnose asthma with certainty, the following are useful adjuncts: a therapeutic trial for at least 2–3 months with as-needed SABA and regular low-dose ICS may provide some guidance (Evidence D), with response evaluated by symptom control and frequency of wheezing and exacerbations; marked improvement on treatment and deterioration when stopped support a diagnosis, and a trial may need repeating; allergic sensitization can be assessed by skin prick testing or allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, is present in the majority once over 3 years of age, absence does not rule out asthma, and allergic sensitization is the best predictor for development of persistent asthma; chest radiographs are rarely indicated but may help exclude alternative diagnoses when doubt exists, with other imaging as appropriate; lung function, bronchial provocation, and other physiological tests do not have a major role at this age, though by 5 years many can perform reproducible spirometry with coaching; FeNO is not widely available and remains primarily a research tool, can be measured with tidal breathing with published normal reference values for children aged 1–5 years, and in preschool children an elevated FeNO recorded 4 weeks from any URTI predicted physician-diagnosed asthma at school age and increased the odds for wheezing, asthma and ICS use by school age.

### Advances in pediatric asthma 2006 [^114xPQZb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Because the outcomes experienced in adult asthma often result from pathophysiology that begins in early childhood, this year's summary focuses on recent advances in pediatric asthma. This past year, we have learned that early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids in childhood asthma reduces morbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Theme issues over the last year focused attention on severe asthma and black box warnings. Both of these themes significantly affect the management of childhood asthma. Responsiveness to asthma treatment is heterogeneous even among patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing control and adjusting treatment accordingly. We are now moving toward an individualized approach to asthma therapy and searching for biomarkers and genetics as a resource to guide treatment. To improve asthma control, we must continue to obtain information on early asthma, severe asthma, asthma exacerbations, and methods to improve asthma control. Evaluation and management of severe asthma in children include verification of the diagnosis, assessment for coexisting illnesses, and identification of effective treatment strategies directed to adherence, medication delivery, and combination therapy. Application of biomarkers and genetics could be useful tools in individualizing our approach to the management of childhood asthma.

### Age-and gender-specific incidence of new asthma diagnosis from childhood to late adulthood [^111EVGhm]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is currently divided into different phenotypes, with age at onset as a relevant differentiating factor. In addition, asthma with onset in adulthood seems to have a poorer prognosis, but studies investigating age-specific incidence of asthma with a wide age span are scarce.

Objective

To evaluate incidence of asthma diagnosis at different ages and differences between child- and adult-diagnosed asthma in a large population-based study, with gender-specific analyzes included.

Methods

In 2016, a respiratory questionnaire was sent to 8000 randomly selected subjects aged 20–69 years in western Finland. After two reminders, 4173 (52.3%) subjects responded. Incidence rate of asthma was retrospectively estimated based on the reported age of asthma onset. Adult-diagnosed asthma was defined as a physician-diagnosis of asthma made at ≥ 18 years of age.

Results

Among those with physician-diagnosed asthma, altogether, 63.7% of subjects, 58.4% of men and 67.8% of women, reported adult-diagnosed asthma. Incidence of asthma diagnosis was calculated in 10-year age groups and it peaked in young boys (0–9 years) and middle-aged women (40–49 years) and the average incidence rate during the examined period between 1946 and 2015 was 2.2/1000/year. Adult-diagnosed asthma became the dominant phenotype among those with physician-diagnosed asthma by age of 50 years and 38 years in men and women, respectively.

Conclusions

Asthma is mainly diagnosed during adulthood and the incidence of asthma diagnosis peaks in middle-aged women. Asthma diagnosed in adulthood should be considered more in clinical practice and management guidelines.

Conclusion

In conclusion, new diagnoses of childhood asthma in the US declined by half during the first year of the pandemic. These findings raise important questions whether pandemic-related changes in infectious or other triggers truly altered the incidence of childhood asthma beyond the well-described disruptions in healthcare access. Research on disease etiology and more recent diagnostic trends and clinical outcomes of asthma will help answer these questions.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of asthma in children, what are the solutions? A scoping review of 3 countries in sub saharan Africa [^116PVu72]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The rationale for the review

About 60–80% of asthmatic children show signs in the first 5 years of life. Diagnosis of asthma is crucial to precise treatment. Asthma is associated with school absence, repeated presentation to the emergency department, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and decreased lung function in adulthood. Missing a diagnosis of asthma particularly in infants and children, may lead to increased morbidity and mortality due to this disease as shown in a Ugandan study.

To date, there has not been a review that is dedicated to report on the challenges in the diagnosis of childhood asthma and possible solutions thereof.

The main aim of this review was to summarise the evidence on diagnosis of asthma in children in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. This study answers these specific questions: (i) What challenges have been experienced in the diagnosis of asthma in children? (ii) What possible solutions have been suggested or implemented to curb the challenges in diagnosis of asthma in children?

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^115q7g4J]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prevalence

Despite improved definitions, the current prevalence of severe asthma remains poorly understood. The best estimates range from 4% to 10% of the asthma population. Much of this uncertainly is due to a disconnect between clinical diagnosis and physiologic confirmation and the necessity of determining whether patients are treated and adhering to treatment appropriately. Severe asthma, although more common in the very young, as compared with older children, appears to become less common in adolescence and early adulthood, only to appear or reappear in midadult life. Although it is predominantly a male disease in childhood, severe asthma, like adult asthma overall, largely affects females, perhaps because of resolution in boys and increased adult incidence in women. In three different cohorts, 45–50% of patients with severe asthma reported adult-onset (> 12 yr old) disease, the majority of whom were females. In contrast, resolution of severe asthma (not asthma itself) was observed in 60% of children in SARP (Severe Asthma Research Program), 3–4 years after enrollment (median age 11 yr old). Little is understood regarding this temporary or perhaps permanent resolution. However, anecdotally, many patients report childhood disease, resolution, and subsequent second worsening in adulthood for unclear reasons.

Diagnosing asthma in children aged 5 years and under

It can be challenging to make the diagnosis of asthma in some children aged ≤ 5 years. Recurrent wheezing is very common in this age group, including in children without asthma, typically with viral upper respiratory tract infections. Routine assessment of airflow limitation or bronchodilator responsiveness in this age group is difficult and is not practical in primary care.

Asthma diagnosis in children aged ≤ 5 years can be based on symptom patterns, the presence of risk factors, therapeutic response to controller treatment, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses

A diagnosis of asthma in young children with a history of wheezing is more likely if they have wheezing or coughing that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, or in the absence of an apparent respiratory infection, a history of other allergic disease (eczema, food allergy, or allergic rhinitis), atopy or asthma in first-degree relatives, clinical improvement during 2–3 months of controller treatment, and worsening after cessation.

The following questions can be used to elicit features suggestive of asthma in young children and features that help support the diagnosis:
Does your child have wheezing? Wheezing is a high-pitched noise that comes from the chest and not the throat. Use of a video questionnaire, or asking a parent to record an episode on a smartphone if available can help to confirm the presence of wheeze and differentiate from upper airway abnormalities.
Does your child wake up at night because of coughing, wheezing, or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or breathlessness?
Does your child have to stop running, or play less hard, because of coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath?
Does your child cough, wheeze or get difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath when laughing, crying, playing with animals, or when exposed to strong smells or smoke?
Has your child ever had eczema, or been diagnosed with allergy to foods?
Has anyone in your close family had asthma, hay fever, food allergy, eczema, or any other disease with breathing problems?

In preschool children with wheeze, phenotypes have been proposed based on short-term symptom patternsor on symptom pattern trends over time –, but these have not proved to be clinically useful or accurate in predicting asthma in later childhood.

Risk profiles for wheezing children aged 5 years and younger — A number of risk profile tools aimed at identifying which wheezing children aged 5 years and younger are at high risk of developing persistent asthma symptoms have been evaluated for use in clinical practice; only three prediction tools have been externally validated, and a systematic review has shown that these tools have poor predictive accuracy, with variation in sensitivity and positive predictive value; larger predictive studies using more advanced statistical methods, and with objective measurements for asthma diagnosis, are probably needed to propose a practical tool in clinical care to predict persistent asthma in recurrent wheezers in infancy and preschool age; the role of these tools is to help identify children at greater risk of developing persistent asthma symptoms, not as criteria for the diagnosis of asthma in young children, and each tool demonstrates different performance characteristics with varying criteria used to identify risk.

### The role of objective tests to support a diagnosis of asthma in children [^115VpHzd]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

In many healthcare settings asthma in children is a clinical diagnosis based on parental reported symptoms. These include intermittent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness and periodic nocturnal dry cough. Increased symptoms often coincide with colds. Confirming a diagnosis of asthma in children can be difficult and recent reports highlight that misdiagnosis, including over- and under-diagnosis of asthma are common. Recent UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend diagnostic algorithms for children from five years and adults to support a clinical suspicion of asthma. Spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility and fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing are the first line tests to diagnose asthma in children. The introduction of these tests across all healthcare settings has the potential to reduce misdiagnosis, improve asthma management and reduce healthcare spending for asthma.

5 ASSESSMENT OF ASTHMA OUTCOMES

Yearly in‐office spirometry evaluations to determine FEV₁ are recommended, as per the 2012 European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force, for patients with asthma aged 3–95 years. 24, 29 For children with symptoms of poorly controlled asthma, such as exercise limitations or suspected nonresponse to treatment, high‐level assessments, such as evaluation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, are recommended in a specialist's office. 24 In addition, short‐term monitoring of peak expiratory flow can be used to evaluate response to treatment because variation in peak expiratory flow is associated with poor asthma control. 2 Ideally, a patient's asthma control should be assessed 1‐3 months after starting treatment and every 3‐12 months thereafter, as well as within 1 week of an exacerbation. 2 As a child gets older, additional measures can be taken to protect lung growth, including age‐appropriate counseling on smoking avoidance/cessation, assessment of symptom reversibility with conventional therapy, occupational counseling, and environmental assessment.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^116ckXw4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112pbEV6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

FENO measurement in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing — prediction of future asthma: In children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing, the Expert Panel recommends against FENO measurement to predict the future development of asthma (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The Clinician's Summary states that in children aged 4 years and younger with recurrent wheezing, FENO measurement does not reliably predict the future development of asthma, and test results should be interpreted with caution until more data are available; the Expert Panel recommends against using FENO testing to predict future development of asthma in this age group until additional research and clinical practice determinations are available. Evidence synthesis identified ten studies in children younger than 5 years to predict subsequent asthma in those aged 5 years and older; none were RCTs, seven were nonrandomized longitudinal studies and three were cross-sectional; in only a single study, a FENO level indicating increased risk yielded a positive predictive value of 58.0% for a composite of wheezing, diagnosis of asthma, or use of an ICS at age 7 years, with a negative predictive value of 78.2%. Additional context notes that FENO can be measured in young children with normal resting breathing and reference values exist for ages 1 to 5 years; in some preschool children with recurrent coughing and wheezing, an elevated FENO level more than 4 weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection may help predict physician-diagnosed asthma at school age, but the studies reviewed had conflicting results and provided low to moderate certainty; the acceptability of FENO measurement for predictive purposes is low and use of this testing is unlikely to change current treatment standards and could actually misdirect care.

### International consensus on (ICON) pediatric asthma [^1122xBB9]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic lower respiratory disease in childhood throughout the world. Several guidelines and/or consensus documents are available to support medical decisions on pediatric asthma. Although there is no doubt that the use of common systematic approaches for management can considerably improve outcomes, dissemination and implementation of these are still major challenges. Consequently, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has decided to propose an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma. The purpose of this document is to highlight the key messages that are common to many of the existing guidelines, while critically reviewing and commenting on any differences, thus providing a concise reference. The principles of pediatric asthma management are generally accepted. Overall, the treatment goal is disease control. To achieve this, patients and their parents should be educated to optimally manage the disease, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Identification and avoidance of triggers is also of significant importance. Assessment and monitoring should be performed regularly to re-evaluate and fine-tune treatment. Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. The optimal use of medication can, in most cases, help patients control symptoms and reduce the risk for future morbidity. The management of exacerbations is a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment. There is a trend toward considering phenotype-specific treatment choices; however, this goal has not yet been achieved.

9 HETEROGENEITY IN TREATMENT RESPONSE

Children that present with asthma exacerbations generally have more severe disease and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. 74 According to recent estimates, approximately 38% of children with asthma have uncontrolled disease, and 52% of children with uncontrolled asthma were already taking long‐term controller medications. 75 In addition, some children whose asthma is still not controlled despite ICS therapy respond to other standard therapies differently. 76 Another issue to consider is difficult‐to‐treat asthma, defined by the need for multiple medications, frequent and/or severe exacerbations, inability to avoid triggers, and complicated treatment regimens. 77 Although this type of asthma is not a phenotype as defined by treatment guidelines, it can describe asthma of any severity level and is likely to contribute to the population of children with uncontrolled asthma. Overall, efficacy can be difficult to demonstrate in young children due to the confounding influences of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities, as well as the heterogeneity of asthma itself.

### Risk factors for life-threatening asthma attacks and asthma-related mortality in children – A systematic review [^111Qo71M]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways, presenting with wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough, and characterized by variable and reversible airflow obstruction. It is estimated that 262 million people have been diagnosed with asthma globally, and 8 million people in the United Kingdom.

A sudden symptom deterioration, known as an "asthma attack", may be triggered by respiratory infections, aeroallergens, physical activity, or weather changes. Even with prompt management, attacks can be life‐threatening or fatal. Current guidelines emphasize the need to assess the risk of future asthma attacks in addition to current symptom control at every review, highlighting that symptom control and attack risk may be discordant.

In school‐aged children, a history of a previous asthma attack is the strongest predictor for further attacks. This is why an early asthma review is recommended following every attack.

Despite these recommendations, around 1000 people die of fatal asthma attacks every day globally, 1200 people annually in the United Kingdom, and around 3235 people annually in the United States of America.

In the United Kingdom, which has one of the highest incidences of asthma deaths in children and young people (CYP) amongst high‐income countries, a detailed review of asthma‐related deaths was commissioned in 2014. The National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) scrutinized the medical records of 195 people (including 28 children) who died from asthma between 2012 and 2013. The review identified potentially avoidable factors in 67% of asthma deaths, including lack of asthma reviews, over‐reliance on asthma reliever inhalers (short‐acting beta‐2 agonists, SABA), and lack of written asthma action plans. A recent report from the National Child Mortality Database reported 54 asthma deaths over a 4‐year period in the United Kingdom. High deprivation levels, air pollution, high use of SABA, previous hospitalization or emergency department visits, and prematurity were some of the risk factors identified in the report. As these reviews only included people who died, we do not know whether these factors are unique to that population or ubiquitous amongst people with frequent asthma attacks.

In addition to assessing patients for their risk of asthma attacks, it is clearly important to identify risk factors for asthma deaths and life‐threatening attacks. Therefore, this review aims to synthesize and summarize evidence to inform risk factors and predictors for life‐threatening and fatal asthma attacks in CYP from studies published from 2000 onwards.

Children with mild asthma show substantial heterogeneity, and functional lung changes can be detected with ventilation defects quantified by 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging.

Diagnosis of asthma in children 5 years and younger — key points and indicators: Recurrent wheezing occurs in a large proportion of children 5 years and younger and it may be difficult to recognize the initial presentation of asthma; previous classifications of wheezing phenotypes do not appear to identify stable phenotypes and their clinical usefulness is uncertain, although emerging research suggest more clinically relevant phenotypes and phenotype-directed therapy may be possible. A diagnosis of asthma in young children with a history of wheezing is more likely if they have wheezing or coughing with exercise, laughing or crying, or without an apparent respiratory infection; a history of other allergic disease, allergen sensitization or asthma in first-degree relatives; and clinical improvement during 2–3 months of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment plus as-needed short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) reliever with worsening after cessation.

### AI model for predicting asthma prognosis in children [^112yqpEQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is often a lifelong disease, affecting 1 in 12 people in the United States, and the most common chronic disease in children. A long-term study following individuals up to age 50 years found evidence linking asthma severity during childhood to clinical and lung function outcomes in adulthood. Although several studies tried to predict who will have asthma at school age (eg, age 6–10 years) among preschool children with a history of asthma-like symptoms (eg, wheezing for the first 3 years of life), it is understudied to predict future asthma prognosis (eg, remission vs persistent asthma) among children with asthma, which is informative when clinicians determine continuing versus changing their asthma management based on short-term prediction. A review paperhighlighted little success of several asthma prediction rules in clinical practice, which may in part be accounted for by the later development of asthma, noninformative rules (eg, low likelihood ratio of a positive test result), and/or heterogeneity of definitions of risk factors and/or outcomes (asthma). These challenges may be overcome by using electronic health records (EHRs) to reduce methodologic heterogeneity, including unstructured data (eg, free text), which is estimated to account for more than 80% of currently available health care data.

FeNO testing in asthma — In individuals aged 5 y and older with diagnostic uncertainty despite history, clinical findings, clinical course, and spirometry (or when spirometry cannot be performed), the Expert Panel conditionally recommends the addition of FeNO measurement as an adjunct to evaluation, and in those aged 5 y and older with persistent allergic asthma and uncertainty in anti-inflammatory therapy decisions, conditionally recommends FeNO as part of an ongoing monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessments; however, in individuals aged 5 y and older with asthma, the Expert Panel recommends against use of FeNO measurements in isolation to assess control, predict exacerbations, or assess exacerbation severity and, if used, it should be part of ongoing monitoring and management, and in children aged 0–4 y with recurrent wheezing, the Expert Panel recommends against FeNO measurement to predict the future development of asthma.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^115zTJnE]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Asthma is one of the most frequent reasons children visit a general practitioner (GP). The diagnosis of childhood asthma is challenging, and a variety of diagnostic tests for asthma exist. GPs may refer to clinical practice guidelines when deciding which tests, if any, are appropriate, but the quality of these guidelines is unknown.

Objectives

To determine (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric guidelines for the diagnosis of childhood asthma in primary care, and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations.

Design

Meta-epidemiological study of English-language guidelines from the United Kingdom and other high-income countries with comparable primary care systems including diagnostic testing recommendations for childhood asthma in primary care. The AGREE-II tool was used to assess the quality and reporting of the guidelines. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Results

Eleven guidelines met the eligibility criteria. The methodology and reporting quality varied across the AGREE II domains (median score 4.5 out of 7, range 2–6). The quality of evidence supporting diagnostic recommendations was generally of very low quality. All guidelines recommended the use of spirometry and reversibility testing for children aged ≥ 5 years, however, the recommended spirometry thresholds for diagnosis differed across guidelines. There were disagreements in testing recommendations for 3 of the 7 included tests.

Conclusions

The variable quality of guidelines, lack of good quality evidence, and inconsistent recommendations for diagnostic tests may contribute to poor clinician adherence to guidelines and variation in testing for diagnosing childhood asthma.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^116vPsSJ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

No prior studies have assessed the quality and reporting of diagnostic testing guidelines for childhood asthma. One study evaluated diagnostic guidelines in an adult primary care setting. Of interest, the authors found that recommendations based on high-quality evidence had greater rates of clinician adherence to CPGs. Two reviews specifically compared childhood asthma recommendations across international guidelines, focusing on management. For diagnostic questions, Level 1 evidence comprises prospective studies where diagnostic tests are compared with a gold standard test in all patients in the study group. Conducting such research in asthma is challenging due to the absence of a gold-standard test; it is even more difficult to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a sequential testing strategy.

Our study sought to determine: (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric asthma guidelines for primary care and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations for childhood asthma.

Implications for future research and practice

Poor quality evidence or the lack of evidence limits the ability of guideline developers to develop robust CPGs which inform practice. Guidelines could include specific research recommendations to address evidence gaps. The very low quality of included evidence for diagnostic recommendations highlights the need for research collaboration to produce high-quality systematic reviews and diagnostic accuracy studies to provide evidence for tests in a primary care setting. In younger children especially, there is a critical need for new research to evaluate existing diagnostic methods (such as trial of treatment) or to develop newer diagnostic strategies. Guidelines committees should also adhere to strict methodological standards so that important studies that could influence guideline recommendations are not missed. Further research could assess whether variation in CPG quality translates into variation in clinical practice.

There are a number of proposed drivers of poor clinician adherence to practice guidelines, and among these, a lack of clarity and credibility in the evidence has been cited. Other proposed barriers for the implementation of CPGs include financial, personnel and time constraints, lack of clinician confidence or knowledge about the guideline, and the sociocultural beliefs of patients. Future research should explore these potential barriers in the context of childhood asthma.

For the time being, practitioners need to be aware of the variation in CPGs for asthma. NICE guidance had the highest reporting standards, despite some limitations related to their contributors' competing interests and applicability for children in primary care. Until there is a new gold standard for asthma diagnosis, clinicians should utilise spirometry with the lower limit of normal diagnostic threshold and bronchodilator reversibility if childhood asthma is clinically suspected. Most importantly, the diagnosis should be regularly reviewed and updated.

### Age-specific incidence of allergic and non-allergic asthma [^115EUvhg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The incidence of allergic asthma is highest in early childhood and steadily decreases during adulthood, while the incidence of non-allergic asthma is low until it peaks in late adulthood. After 40 years of age most new cases of asthma are non-allergic. This study supports the concept that late-onset asthma is a separate entity and the mechanisms behind it differ from asthma beginning in childhood or in early adulthood.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^116h57eQ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by episodes of wheeze, cough, and shortness of breath. Around 14% of children worldwide have a diagnosis of asthma, making it the most common chronic respiratory disease of childhood.

Poor asthma control is associated with a number of negative effects on children and families. For example, they are more likely to be absent from school, have additional educational needs and have lower educational attainment. Caregivers also experience missed work days and financial challenges as a result. Some children will experience severe symptoms and life-threatening attacks.

Taking the UK as an example, paediatric asthma outcomes are poor overall with considerable associated morbidity and high rates of emergency hospital admissions, and most pertinently, there are several preventable deaths each year. Alarmingly, the National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) found that in almost all paediatric cases, there were a number of significant avoidable contributing factors and that these deaths may have been preventable.

There are several factors that make the diagnosis and management of asthma in children challenging. The aim of this review was to explore these issues and highlight good clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of paediatric asthma.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnostic flowchart for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years in clinical practice outlines an approach for patients presenting with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms in clinical practice. The algorithm begins by asking "Are symptoms typical of asthma?", then evaluates objective testing feasibility with "Is spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) available and feasible?" and directs to "Perform lung function test(s) as in Box 1–2, e.g. spirometry or PEF before and after bronchodilator" to determine whether "Is variable expiratory airflow limitation confirmed?". A branch conducts "Further history and tests for alternative diagnoses" with "Is alternative diagnosis confirmed?", leading to "Treat for alternative diagnosis" when confirmed. If other diagnoses are unlikely, it advises to "treat empirically with ICS-containing treatment (Boxes 4–5 & 4–11)", then "Review response in 1–3 months, including PEF or spirometry if available" and, if improved, "Treat for asthma with ICS-containing treatment See Boxes 4–5 & 4–11". The footnote states that "Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry, but it is better than having no objective measurement of lung function", and that readings "may vary by up to 20% between different meters" and to use "only the highest of three readings".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1137zS9U]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Challenges in clinical diagnosis — airflow patterns and age‑related presentation: Although asthma is characterized by variable expiratory airflow limitation, at least initially, and COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, the definitions of asthma and COPD are not mutually exclusive; in children and young adults with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms the differential diagnosis differs from older adults and, once other conditions are excluded, the most likely chronic airway disease in children and young adults is asthma, whereas in adults with long‑standing asthma persistent airflow limitation may be found and patients with COPD may show evidence of reversible airflow obstruction when a rapid‑acting bronchodilator is administered, so in medical records such patients often are assigned both diagnoses.

Asthma and wheezing in young children — burden, onset, and risk factors: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and a leading cause of morbidity measured by school absences, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and it often begins in early childhood with symptoms commencing during childhood in up to half of people with asthma; onset is earlier in males than females. No intervention has yet been shown to prevent the development of asthma or modify its long-term course, and atopy is present in the majority of children with asthma who are over 3 years old, with allergen-specific sensitization (particularly multiple early-life sensitizations) cited as one of the most important risk factors for development of asthma.

### Influence of age on clinical characteristics, pharmacological management and exacerbations in children with asthma [^111m8Gka]. Thorax (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma trials and guidelines often do not distinguish between adolescents and younger children. Using a large English data set, we evaluated the impact of age on asthma characteristics, management and exacerbations.

Methods

Primary care medical records, 2004–2021, were linked to hospital records. Children were categorised by age at diagnosis and followed until the next age bracket. Ages (based on management guidelines) were 5–8 years, 9–11 years and adolescents (12–16 years). Characteristics evaluated included body mass index, allergies and events before and after diagnosis (symptoms, medication). Exacerbation incidence was calculated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards determined associations with exacerbations.

Results

119611 children were eligible: 61940 (51.8%) 5–8 years, 32316 (27.7%) 9–11 years and 25355 (21.2%) adolescents. Several characteristics differed by age; children aged 5–8 years had the highest proportion with eczema, food/drug allergy and cough, but adolescents had the highest proportion with overweight/obesity, aeroallergen sensitisation, dyspnoea and short-acting-beta-agonist only use. Exacerbation rates were highest in the youngest children (per 100 person-years (95% CI): 5–8 years = 13.7 (13.4–13.9), 9–11 years = 10.0 (9.8–10.4), adolescents = 6.7 (6.5–7.0)). Exacerbation risk factors also differed by age; 5–8 years: male, eczema and food/drug allergy were strongly associated, but for children ≥ 9 years old, obesity and aeroallergen sensitisation were strongly associated. For all children, higher socioeconomic deprivation was significantly associated with having an exacerbation. Delayed diagnosis was most common in children aged 5–8 years and was associated with increased exacerbations across all ages.

Conclusion

Children's baseline characteristics and exacerbation rates varied according to their age group. Clinical guidelines should consider age at time of diagnosis more discretely than the broad range, 5–16 years, as this appears to impact on asthma severity and management.

### Asthma… [^112cnh3S]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms of forced expiratory volume in one second, and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. Causes Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions. These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.

It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics and a changing living environment. Asthma that starts before the age of 12 years old is more likely due to genetic influence, while onset after age 12 is more likely due to environmental influence. Pregnancy Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy is a risk factor for the child to develop asthma. Allergens Asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens. Common indoor allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, animal dander, and mould. Efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective on symptoms in sensitized subjects. Weak evidence suggests that efforts to decrease mould by repairing buildings may help improve asthma symptoms in adults.

Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children. Certain other infections, however, may decrease the risk. Hygiene hypothesis The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses. It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies. Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction. Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets. Use of antibiotics in early life had been linked to the development of asthma.

A later review found that previous studies came to inconsistent conclusions on the relationship between antibiotic use and asthma development, and that many failed to rule out respiratory infections as a confounding factor. Asthma exacerbations in school-aged children peak in autumn for 8 weeks, shortly after children return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations. Diagnosis While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is no one universal, agreed-upon definition. It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role.

### Childhood asthma [^11674JrN]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

Childhood asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and coughing. Around 4. 9 million children in the US suffer from asthma. It is difficult to diagnose asthma in children younger than 6 years of age. There can be multiple factors that can contribute to asthma in childhood such as genetics, allergens, and viral infections. Children are particularly vulnerable to environmental factors that contribute to asthma due to their developing respiratory systems, higher respiratory rates, and increased exposure to outdoor air pollutants during play and school activities. Childhood asthma has been linked to various environmental exposures such as air pollution, allergens, and indoor toxins. Additionally, social determinants such as housing quality, access to healthcare, and socioeconomic status can influence prevalence and outcomes.

Asthma attacks are triggered by infections, dust, psychological and physical stress, or excessive exercise. These exacerbations may require medical intervention or hospitalization. Early diagnosis, preventative measures and effective asthma management strategies can significantly improve a child's well-being and reduce the frequency of attacks. Ongoing public health efforts focus on reducing childhood asthma prevalence through education, improved air quality regulations, environmental control strategies, and expanded access to healthcare. Indoor allergens as a risk factor Asthma exacerbations in children have been associated with exposure to residential indoor environmental stressors such as allergens and air pollutants. Common indoor allergens that contribute to asthma symptoms include dust mites, mold, cockroach droppings, pet dander, and rodent allergens. Dust mites found in bedding, carpets, and upholstery are the most common indoor asthma trigger.

Proteins found in cockroach saliva, feces and body parts are also a potent asthma trigger. Studies indicate that sensitization and exposure to cockroach have been associated with increased hospitalizations and asthma related emergencies. Additionally, tobacco smoke and secondhand exposure increases the likelihood of childhood asthma development and can worsen symptoms. Secondhand smoke contains chemicals including benzene, formaldehyde and carbon monoxide which trigger airway inflammation in children with asthma. Secondhand smoke has been found to be linked to increase in school absence, emergency care, and hospitalization among children with asthma. Prevention Preventing childhood asthma exacerbations requires a multifaceted approach that includes reducing exposure to environmental triggers, implementing public health policies, and ensuring proper asthma management.

One effective strategy is minimizing exposure to common indoor allergens by maintaining clean and well-ventilated living environments. Regular cleaning and washing of bedding to minimize dust mite exposure, as well as, using HEPA filters in vacuum cleaners and air purifiers. Additionally, eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke and secondhand smoke is critical, as studies have shown that decreased exposure has led to decreased asthma related hospitalizations and improved lung function. Additional steps to take in lowering children's risk are keeping homes free of mold and dampness. Mold is a known risk of childhood asthma as stated above in the article. Uncontrolled asthma can interfere with daily activities and limit physical activity. Some warning signs are frequent nighttime coughing with waking up a few times a month, coughing during exercise, increased usage of inhaler, or prolonged coughing. References.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management… [^113yA9Y8]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. Diagnosis The diagnosis of asthma continues to require characteristic symptoms and evidence of variable airflow limitation on pulmonary function testing. The characteristic symptoms, especially in adults, include wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness that are worse at night or early in the morning; vary over time and in intensity; and are triggered by viral infections, exercise, allergen exposure, changes in weather, laughter, or irritants.

Features that decrease the likelihood of asthma include cough in the absence of other respiratory symptoms, chronic production of sputum, shortness of breath associated with light-headedness or paresthesia, chest pain, and exercise-induced dyspnea with noisy inspiration. An asthma diagnosis should be confirmed with pulmonary function testing to avoid overtreatment and to ensure that other diagnoses are not missed. In one study, 2% of adults diagnosed with asthma had serious cardiorespiratory conditions that were missed. In asthma, lung function can vary between normal and severely obstructed, especially when poorly controlled. In adults with characteristic symptoms, an increase or decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second of greater than 12% and 200 mL from baseline or a change in peak expiratory flow of at least 20% is consistent with asthma.

Bronchial provocation testing is useful for ruling out asthma but less useful for making the diagnosis, and it should be limited to diagnosing asthma in athletes or in patients with symptoms despite normal spirometry findings or when spirometry is unavailable. Although the presence of atopy increases the likelihood of allergic asthma, its absence does not rule out asthma. In patients taking controller treatment, it may be necessary to step down the dose to confirm an asthma diagnosis. Patients should be advised to reduce their inhaled corticosteroid dose by 25% to 50% or stop any other long-acting medication. Treatment Asthma severity is defined by the treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. Well-controlled asthma involves daytime symptoms or as-needed medication use twice a week or less, no activity limitation, and no waking with symptoms. Severity is assessed after several months of regular controller treatment.

Mild: Asthma is well controlled with step 1 or 2 treatment. Moderate: Asthma is well controlled with step 3 treatment. Severe: Step 4 or 5 treatment is required to control symptoms, or symptoms are uncontrolled despite this treatment. GINA recommends that a SABA not be prescribed as sole therapy because short-acting medications increase the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Adding an ICS daily or as needed reduces this risk. GINA also recommends using the lowest dose of ICS tolerated, including reducing the corticosteroid dose after symptoms are controlled. Clinicians should check inhaler adherence and treat any modifiable risk factors before considering a step up in treatment. A step down should be considered if asthma has been controlled for three months.

View information about pediatric asthma symptoms, diagnosis and treatment options. Plus, AAP clinical recommendations, resources for managing pediatric asthma patients and helpful information to share with patients and families. Asthma Overview. Asthma is the most common chronic condition of the lungs with times of increased symptoms or flares. Asthma is an inflammatory condition of the lungs that is the key driver for causing symptoms including cough, wheezing, chest tightness/discomfort, shortness of breath that can strongly interfere with quality of life and daily function. Asthma is a chronic condition and requires frequent check-ins with the patient/child's primary care provider to determine how much their breathing is affecting their daily function, school attendance, exercise/activities and sleep. Providers should be equipped to use standardized questionnaires to understand the individual's perception of their breathing and adjust medications appropriately.

A common misconception is that asthma requires pulmonary function testing or spirometry to diagnose. Spirometry or pulmonary function testing, sometimes called breathing tests, can help confirm the diagnosis, but not all ages or developmental stages are capable to perform this test, and this may not be available in all clinics. Pulmonary function testing should be done with staff that are trained and providers comfortable interpreting this. Often asthma can be diagnosed based on symptoms and other risk factors such as having allergies to environmental allergens or a family history of asthma. Asthma can have multiple triggers including illness or infections, environmental exposures such as tobacco exposure, air pollution, allergens or physical activity. It is important for providers and families to best identify these triggers to minimize the impact of asthma on the person's quality of life.

An asthma specialist should be consulted if the diagnosis is in questions or child is not completely responding to medications, if they are having frequent exacerbations, difficulty determining their triggers or if they have additional conditions often seen in conjunction with asthma including nasal symptoms or allergic skin conditions. However, an asthma specialist does not replace the role of primary care providers in the long-term care of that child. On this page, you can find many of the common triggers, treatment options and best practices to help minimize the impact of asthma on you, your patient's or your child's asthma, so they can live comfortably and not be limited. There are resources here for health care professionals caring for young children with asthma on what can be done to address all aspects of caring for their breathing.

### Management of asthma in children… [^111zjRmt]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma currently affects nearly 5 million children in the United States — more than 5 percent of the population younger than 18 years. 1 In children four years or younger, the prevalence increased 160 percent from 1980 to 1994, and from 1980 to 1993, the death rate from asthma nearly doubled among persons five to 24 years. 1 Asthma is 26 percent more prevalent and results in more severe disability and more frequent hospitalizations in black children than in white children, and black children are four to six times more likely to die of asthma. 2, 3 In children younger than 15 years, asthma accounts for 3 million physician visits, 570, 000 emergency department visits, 164, 000 hospital stays, 8. 7 million prescriptions and 10 million missed school days per year. 4, 5 These statistics highlight the need to aggressively manage this disease and its symptoms. Unfortunately, anti-inflammatory agents such as inhaled corticosteroids are not yet prescribed for all patients with persistent asthma.

Asthma has immediate and delayed inflammatory responses. During the early phase, mast cells release mediators that lead to vasodilation, edema and bronchoconstriction. 9 Leukotrienes, recently recognized as key culprits in asthma, are approximately 1, 000 times more potent than histamines in mediating an inflammatory response. Their powerful chemotactic effect on neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes enhances the inflammatory response.
10. Diagnosis Fifty to 80 percent of children with asthma develop symptoms before five years of age. 12 Asthma symptoms vary widely and may mimic other childhood diseases. When parents report episodic or persistent coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, rapid breathing or chest tightness, and if these symptoms are worse during the evening or early morning hours, or are associated with triggers, the physician should suspect asthma. Alternative diagnoses should be excluded. Wheezing is not present in all patients with asthma and is not a sign exclusive to asthma. Wheezing may be caused by respiratory infections, rhinitis, sinusitis or vocal cord dysfunction. Before a definitive diagnosis of asthma is reached, consideration should be given to other factors, such as foreign body aspiration, or to other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or heart disease, that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Obtaining a medical history is essential to establishing the diagnosis of asthma. Factors associated with the onset of asthma symptoms include allergy, family history of asthma or allergy, perinatal exposure to tobacco smoke, viral respiratory infections, male gender and low birth weight.

13 Young children who develop persistent asthma are likely to have increased serum IgE levels at nine months of age, atopic dermatitis and rhinitis during their first year, severe lower respiratory infections requiring hospitalization and diminished airway function by six years of age.
13. Identification of symptom patterns, severity of symptoms and precipitating factors will support the diagnosis of asthma: "How often and when do episodes occur. " "What is their duration. " "Do symptoms occur or worsen during the night, with exercise or with an infection. " "Are they precipitated or aggravated by specific triggers. " "Do they interfere with sleep or daily activities, or require emergency department or hospital visits. " "How often are short-acting bronchodilators used. " "Are symptoms temporarily relieved by bronchodilators". 14 Pulmonary function tests should be, and allergy tests may be conducted to confirm the diagnosis.
