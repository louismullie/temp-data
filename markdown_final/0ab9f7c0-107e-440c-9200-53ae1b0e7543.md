## Question

A 27-year-old man who recently immigrated to the United States with his family is diagnosed with an autosomal dominant disorder that causes anemia by extravascular hemolysis. The doctor explains that his red blood cells (RBCs) are spherical, which decreases their lifespan and explains that a splenectomy may be required in the future. Which of the following is most likely to be defective in this patient?
A. Iron absorption
B. Glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase
C. Spectrin
D. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which protein defect is most likely responsible for an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by anemia due to extravascular hemolysis, spherical RBCs, and the potential need for splenectomy, with answer choices including iron absorption, G6PD, spectrin, or GPI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it matches hereditary spherocytosis. Then, I should verify the inheritance pattern and the mechanistic link to splenectomy. Next, I will review the known molecular defects in hereditary spherocytosis and their frequencies. After that, I need to check each answer option against the pathophysiology and inheritance. Finally, I will select the most likely defective protein and briefly justify why the other options are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome. Spherical RBCs with reduced deformability, extravascular hemolysis in the spleen, and consideration of splenectomy for symptomatic disease are classic for hereditary spherocytosis, which is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia in people of Northern European ancestry and presents with anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly due to membrane instability and loss of surface area, leading to spherocyte formation and splenic clearance [^111JJubt] [^114T4r7Z].

> I need to check the inheritance. The vignette states autosomal dominant, which fits hereditary spherocytosis, where approximately 70–75% of cases are autosomal dominant and the remainder are autosomal recessive or de novo. Importantly, the causative genes encode membrane and cytoskeletal proteins rather than enzymes or metabolic pathways, which aligns with a structural membrane defect rather than an enzymopathy [^112xgrGN] [^111JJubt].

> Next, I should review the molecular basis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the implicated proteins. The primary lesion in hereditary spherocytosis is defective vertical linkage between the membrane skeleton and the lipid bilayer, most commonly due to mutations in ankyrin (ANK1), band 3 (SLC4A1), β-spectrin (SPTB), α-spectrin (SPTA1), or protein 4.2 (EPB42), with ankyrin and spectrin defects being particularly frequent; these defects cause membrane loss, reduced deformability, and spherocyte formation that are trapped and destroyed in the spleen [^111JJubt] [^114juAPB] [^116sZRXD].

> Now, I will examine each option against this pathophysiology. Option A, iron absorption, relates to iron homeostasis and would not explain spherocytes or splenic hemolysis. Iron-loading anemias like thalassemia or chronic hemolysis can cause secondary iron overload, but the primary defect here is not iron absorption, so this is inconsistent with hereditary spherocytosis [^111PVU4F]. Option B, G6PD, is an X-linked enzymopathy causing oxidative hemolysis under stress. It does not produce spherocytes and is not inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, so it does not fit the vignette [^115DmKz2]. Option D, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), is the anchor missing in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which causes complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis, not spherocytic extravascular hemolysis, so this is also incorrect [^115DmKz2]. Option C, spectrin, is a core cytoskeletal protein that maintains membrane integrity and deformability. Defects in spectrin or its linkage partners directly cause membrane instability, spherocyte formation, and splenic clearance, which matches the described phenotype and autosomal dominant inheritance in many families [^111JJubt] [^114juAPB].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about frequencies before concluding. I initially thought ankyrin mutations are the single most common cause, but I should double-check that assertion. Large cohort data show that ankyrin and band 3 defects are indeed the most prevalent, with spectrin defects also well represented; for example, one series found band 3 and spectrin deficiencies comprising the majority of identifiable protein abnormalities, and broader cohorts consistently implicate ANK1, SLC4A1, SPTB, SPTA1, and EPB42 as the principal genes, supporting that spectrin mutations are a leading cause and fit the autosomal dominant pattern in many cases [^114xKdf7] [^114juAPB] [^116sZRXD].

> Putting this together, the most likely defective protein in this autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis is spectrin, given its central role in the membrane skeleton, the known association of spectrin gene mutations with HS, and the concordance with spherocytes, extravascular hemolysis, and splenectomy responsiveness described in the vignette [^111JJubt] [^114juAPB] [^114T4r7Z].

---

The most likely defective protein in this patient with autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis is **spectrin** [^notfound], as mutations in spectrin or other membrane-cytoskeleton proteins (ankyrin, band 3, protein 4.2) cause membrane instability, spherocyte formation, and extravascular hemolysis [^111JJubt]. Splenectomy is effective because spherocytes are trapped and destroyed in the spleen [^111JJubt]. Iron absorption (A) is not the cause, G6PD deficiency (B) causes intravascular hemolysis, and GPI anchor defects (D) cause paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, not spherocytosis [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of hereditary spherocytosis

Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by defects in **membrane-cytoskeleton proteins**, including spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and protein 4.2 [^111JJubt]. These proteins maintain the biconcave shape and deformability of RBCs; mutations cause membrane instability, loss of surface area, and spherocyte formation [^113Cy7LQ]. Spherocytes are less deformable and trapped in the spleen, where they undergo extravascular hemolysis [^111JJubt].

---

## Genetic inheritance pattern

Approximately 75% of HS cases are inherited in an **autosomal dominant** manner, while the remaining cases are autosomal recessive or due to de novo mutations [^112xgrGN] [^111aYFFi]. This pattern aligns with the patient's family history and autosomal dominant inheritance.

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

HS typically presents with:

- **Anemia**: Chronic hemolytic anemia of varying severity [^111JJubt].
- **Jaundice**: Due to increased unconjugated bilirubin from hemolysis [^115DmKz2].
- **Splenomegaly**: From increased RBC destruction in the spleen [^111JJubt].
- **Gallstones**: Pigment gallstones from chronic hemolysis [^115JyFEz].

Diagnosis relies on clinical features, family history, a peripheral smear showing spherocytes, and confirmatory tests such as osmotic fragility and the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding assay [^116F3bW6] [^113vRLZK].

---

## Role of splenectomy in management

Splenectomy is the definitive treatment for moderate-to-severe HS because it removes the primary site of spherocyte destruction, thereby improving anemia and reducing jaundice and gallstone risk [^1138rr4R]. It is generally recommended after age 6 due to infection risk, with vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis required [^114T4r7Z].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Protein/defect** | **Relevance to hs** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Iron absorption | Incorrect | Iron absorption defects cause anemia (e.g. iron deficiency anemia) but do not cause spherocytosis or extravascular hemolysis [^notfound]. |
| B | Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) | Incorrect | G6PD deficiency causes oxidative hemolysis, typically intravascular, and does not produce spherocytes or splenomegaly [^115DmKz2]. |
| C | Spectrin | Correct | Spectrin mutations cause membrane instability, spherocyte formation, and extravascular hemolysis, consistent with HS [^111JJubt]. |
| D | Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor | Incorrect | GPI anchor defects cause paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), characterized by intravascular hemolysis, not spherocytosis [^1126dkx4]. |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely defective protein in this patient is **spectrin** (option C), as mutations in spectrin or other membrane-cytoskeleton proteins cause HS with spherocytes, extravascular hemolysis, and splenomegaly, and splenectomy is curative [^111JJubt] [^111rrb5v].

### A case of glaucoma in hereditary spherocytosis [^111rHDPH]. Journal of Glaucoma (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of glaucoma and the inherited red cell membranopathy hereditary spherocytosis diagnosed simultaneously in 2 individuals in a family.

Patient

A 66-year-old man with normal pressure glaucoma and hereditary spherocytosis.

Results

This patient presented with a branch retinal vein occlusion, and normal tension glaucoma that was incidentally detected. Further history revealed that the patient's maternal grandmother also had hereditary spherocytosis and glaucoma.

Conclusions

We hypothesize that glaucoma and hereditary spherocytosis may be associated. Hereditary spherocytosis may be a potential risk factor for glaucoma by causing impaired blood supply to the optic nerve.

### The clinical relevance of an isolated increase in the number of circulating hyperchromic red blood cells [^111yYNEu]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To search for laboratory evidence of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) among apparently healthy children with the chance finding of an isolated increase in hyperchromic red cells (cells with intracellular haemoglobin concentration > 410 g/litre).

Methods

Blood and reticulocyte counts and Pink tests were performed on successive children found on routine counts to have > 4% hyperchromic red cells, and compared with age and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) matched controls and children known to have HS.

Results

Thirty four patients with > 4% hyperchromic red cells had significantly higher absolute numbers of such cells (p < 0.0001) and higher reticulocyte counts (p < 0.01) than age matched controls, together with higher MCHC (p < 0.0001) and haemoglobin distribution width (p < 0.0001) values and lower mean cell volume (p < 0.02) values. Significant differences were also found among hyperchromic red blood cell, reticulocyte, and haemoglobin distribution width values when subjects were compared with MCHC matched controls. Pink test values were higher in children with increased hyperchromic red blood cells, but not significantly so. In patients with HS, most variables measured were significantly different both from those of children with > 4% hyperchromic cells and controls. Despite the differences found, few MCHC, HDW, reticulocyte, or Pink test values were outside of the normal limits, and only one child with increased hyperchromic cells had both a mild reticulocytosis and a slightly raised Pink test value.

Conclusions

Subjects with an isolated increase in hyperchromic red blood cells have a profile of red blood cell changes similar to that of patients with HS, but to a lesser degree. They may carry a recessive form of the disease but lack the laboratory features of clinically manifest HS.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^113tKhjy]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Here, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) nano-indentation for mechanical characterization of RBC EVs. We use quantitative image analysis and show that RBC EVs remain in a rather spherical shape upon adhesion to the sample surface. Protein analysis and imaging of collapsed vesicles show that vesicles contain significant amounts of membrane-associated proteins. Interestingly, mechanically most EVs behave like empty liposomes with a fluid bilayer. We find that the bending modulus of healthy donor RBC EVs is ~15 k_b T, which is similar to previously reported values for liposomesand which also corresponds well to bending moduli found in studies of the RBC membrane –. These results are compared to EVs derived from RBCs from patients with HS due to a mutation in the ANK1 gene. We reveal that these patient-derived EVs have an altered protein composition and a significantly softer membrane. This lower EV bending modulus could directly relate to the increased rate of vesiculation in HS patients.

### Laboratory markers of thrombosis risk in children with hereditary spherocytosis [^11719vYA]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data suggest that adults with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) may be protected from atherothrombosis before splenectomy but have increased risk of thrombosis following splenectomy. In order to aid in making informed decisions regarding splenectomy in children with HS, we conducted a retrospective study of several surrogate laboratory markers of thrombosis risk in children with HS.

Methods

A retrospective record review was performed on 246 children with HS. Platelet count and hemoglobin concentration were recorded prior to and following splenectomy in each patient. Serum cholesterol levels were collected from the record when available.

Results

Prior to splenectomy, hypocholesterolemia was common. Mean platelet counts in 31 evaluable patients pre- and post-splenectomy were 334 and 608 × 10⁹/L, respectively (P < 0.001). Twenty-nine patients (94%) exhibited persistent thrombocytosis following splenectomy. Hemoglobin values following splenectomy often rose to higher than age and gender-matched norms, with 30% of measurements greater than the 90th percentile and 17% greater than the 97th percentile.

Conclusions

The findings of hypocholesterolemia before splenectomy and thrombocytosis and mild polycythemia afterwards support the hypothesis that patients with HS might be protected from thrombosis before splenectomy and/or more susceptible afterwards. Prospective studies of additional prothrombotic biomarkers and thrombotic events in HS patients are warranted.

### De novo variations of ANK1 gene caused hereditary spherocytosis in two Chinese children by affecting pre-mRNA splicing [^111aYFFi]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS, MIM#612641) is a hereditary genetic disease caused by abnormalities in red blood cell membrane proteins resulting from congenital haemolytic anaemia. HS is mainly characterized by anaemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. Additional features comprise increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility and spherical red blood cell (RBC) count in peripheral blood smears. The symptomatology and clinical outcomes of HS are highly variable. Patients with mild HS might have no clinical manifestations related to anaemia due to the compensatory effect of the bone marrow, causing more erythropoiesis than destruction. Meanwhile, patients with severe HS might suffer from hemolytic crisis or even death. The major genetic mode of HS is autosomal dominant manner, accounting for approximately 75% of cases. In addition, approximately one-fourth of HS patients have no family history of the disease, and the inheritance patterns indicate that HS can be inherited as an autosomal recessive single-gene disorder or as a result of de novo mutations. To date, 5 associated genes associated with HS have been reported: ANK1, SLC4A1, SPTA1, SPTB and EPB42, encoding ankyrin protein, band-3 protein, alpha-spectrin protein, beta-spectrin protein and erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2, respectively. In summary, HS shows marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The prevalence of HS patients also exhibits a cosmopolitan distribution. Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of HS in Europe is approximately 1/2000–1/5000, whereas in China the estimated incidence is 1.39/100000. Notably, typical symptoms are not present at the same time in most patients with HS, and various factors can easily influence laboratory findings. Thus, diagnosing HS is difficult, and patients are frequently misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed. The incidence of the disease may be much higher than the clinical detection rate. Thus, obtaining a definite diagnosis is challenging, even though HS is not very rare. To the best of our knowledge, unequivocal gene sequencing can be used to confirm the diagnosis of HS. Therefore, the discovery of pathogenic gene variants detected by genetic testing and the detailed and intensive functional analysis associated with these genes might shed further light on HS pathogenesis.

In this article, online prediction tools and minigene constructs were used to further reveal the pathogenicity and characterization of novel variants detected in two Chinese families with HS, more accurately characterizing splicing variants in ANK1. This work further explains the relationship between the genotype and phenotype associated with ANK1 variants in the Chinese population and provides the basis for prenatal diagnostics and genetic counselling.

### Open-heart surgery using a centrifugal pump: a case of hereditary spherocytosis [^1178r93g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a genetic, frequently familial hemolytic blood disease characterized by varying degrees of hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. The disease is associated with various defects in any of the number of the proteins responsible for maintaining the shape and flexibility of the red blood cell (RBC), resulting in osmotically fragile and characteristically spherical RBCs. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can exacerbate hemolysis and subsequent renal dysfunction. There are few reports on open-heart surgery for adult patients with HS.

This study reports the case of a 63-year-old man with HS who underwent aortic valve replacement, valval aneurysm patch closure, and ascending aorta replacement.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^111GgRy5]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 4

When older adults are evaluated for anemia, certain features such as systemic symptoms and severe anemia may suggest more significant underlying causes such as hereditary red cell disorders. In a prospective study evaluating causes of unexplained anemia in a cohort of predominantly (69%) African American older adults aged ≥ 65 years, 4.6% had thalassemia trait, and 2.2% had a hemolytic condition. In clinical practice, patients can present at any age with uncommon causes of anemia such as undiagnosed SCD, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A thorough medical and family history, review of symptoms, and peripheral blood smear will help determine whether additional workup for inherited or acquired red cell disorders is indicated.

Membranopathies such as hereditary spherocytosis may go undiagnosed until older age if they cause infrequent or no major hemolytic episodes.

In patients with MCV of < 80 fL and no iron deficiency, a diagnosis of thalassemia is highly likely. β-globin disorders can be confirmed with hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography. The presence and type of α-globin mutation can be confirmed with α-globin gene sequencing. Typically, no treatment is required for thalassemia trait.

SCD is the most common severe inherited blood disorder in the United States. SCD is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene that leads to vaso-occlusion, thus causing complications such as strokes, renal disease, cardiopulmonary complications, and accelerated functional decline. There are several variants of SCD with hemoglobin SS being the most common. Individuals with hemoglobin-SC or sickle-β + –thalassemia variants are more likely to go undiagnosed for decades because they have fewer complications early in life, have a relatively higher hemoglobin level (usually 10–12 g/dL), and have a longer life expectancy compared with individuals with hemoglobin SS.

Older adults with SCD may develop progressive anemia due to both SCD and age-associated changes such as CKD, stem cell exhaustion due to a lifetime of hemolysis, and increased RBC turnover. Hematologic malignancies are also more common in individuals with SCD compared with the general population, and clonal hematopoiesis may also be more common in adults with SCD, occurring at an earlier age.

### Hemolytic anemia… [^1126dkx4]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia or haemolytic anaemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells, either in the blood vessels or elsewhere in the human body. This most commonly occurs within the spleen, but also can occur in the reticuloendothelial system or mechanically. Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias. It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects. The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic. Treatment depends on the type and cause of the hemolytic anemia. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia are similar to other forms of anemia, but in addition, the breakdown of red cells leads to jaundice and increases the risk of particular long-term complications, such as gallstones and pulmonary hypertension.

Chronic hemolysis leads to an increased excretion of bilirubin into the biliary tract, which in turn may lead to gallstones. The continuous release of free hemoglobin has been linked with the development of pulmonary hypertension; this, in turn, leads to episodes of syncope, chest pain, and progressive breathlessness. Pulmonary hypertension eventually causes right ventricular heart failure, the symptoms of which are peripheral edema and ascites. Causes They may be classified according to the means of hemolysis, being either intrinsic in cases where the cause is related to the red blood cell itself, or extrinsic in cases where factors external to the RBC dominate.

Intrinsic effects may include problems with RBC proteins or oxidative stress handling, whereas external factors include immune attack and microvascular angiopathies.
- Defects of red blood cell membrane production.
- Defects in hemoglobin production.
- Defective red cell metabolism.
- Wilson's disease may infrequently present with hemolytic anemia without due to excessive inorganic copper in blood circulation, which destroys red blood cells.
- Spur cell hemolytic anemia
- Any of the causes of hypersplenism, such as portal hypertension.
- Acquired hemolytic anemia is also encountered in burns and as a result of certain infections.
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, sometimes referred to as Marchiafava-Micheli syndrome, is a rare, acquired, potentially life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by complement-induced intravascular hemolytic anemia. Extravascular hemolysis Extravascular hemolysis refers to hemolysis taking place in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In this case little hemoglobin escapes into blood plasma. The macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system in these organs engulf and destroy structurally-defective red blood cells, or those with antibodies attached, and release unconjugated bilirubin into the blood plasma circulation.

### Beta-spectrinBari: a truncated β-chain responsible for dominant hereditary spherocytosis [^113YQHNr]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

We describe a beta-spectrin variant, named beta-spectrin Bari, characterized by a truncated chain and associated with hereditary spherocytosis. The clinical phenotype consists of a moderately severe hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and spherocytes and acanthocytes in the blood smear. The occurrence of the truncated protein, that represents about 8% of the total beta-spectrin occurring on the membrane, results in a marked spectrin deficiency. The altered protein is due to a single point mutation at position -2 (A- > G) of the acceptor splice site of intron 16 leading to an aberrant beta-spectrin message skipping exons 16 and 17 indistinguishable from that reported for beta-spectrin Winston-Salem. We provide evidence that the mutated gene is transcribed but its mRNA is less abundant than either its normal counterpart or beta-spectrin Winston-Salem mRNA. Our findings are an example of how mutations in different splice sites, although causing the same truncating effect, result in clearly different clinical pictures.

### Multiple splenic infarcts: unusual presentation of hereditary spherocytosis associated with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection [^117RvEDo]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 19-year-old African American woman presented to the emergency department with a history of left upper quadrant pain for a week, associated with nausea, malaise, loss of appetite, subjective fevers and chills. Her family history is significant for thalassemia in her maternal aunt, and hereditary spherocytosis in her brother, sister and cousin. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed massive splenomegaly and multiple splenic infarcts. On the second day of admission, she developed a fever of 103°F. Further evaluation revealed acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and hereditary spherocytosis. Her condition improved after 4 days on piperacillin/tazobactam, intravenous fluids, analgesics and antipyretics. Our case report describes a thorough clinical evaluation of a patient with fever, anaemia, massive splenomegaly and multiple splenic infarcts. It highlights the need for careful interpretation of multiple positive IgM results on viral serological testing that often accompanies acute EBV infections.

### Abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane [^111yZ35c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Primary abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane are characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity. Among this group, hereditary spherocytosis patients are more likely to experience symptomatic anemia. Treatment of hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Growing recognition of the long-term risks of splenectomy has led to re-evaluation of the role of splenectomy. Management guidelines acknowledge these considerations and recommend discussion between health care providers, patient, and family. The hereditary elliptocytosis syndromes are the most common primary disorders of erythrocyte membrane proteins. However, most elliptocytosis patients are asymptomatic and do not require therapy.

### Acute parvovirus B19 infection in identical twins unmasking previously unidentified hereditary spherocytosis [^115dAm8i]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Identical Caucasian male twins, previously fit, presented 1week apart with short histories of fever and lethargy. The twins were febrile at presentation with profound pancytopaenia and evidence of haemolysis. There was no rash or arthralgia. Both required multiple red cell transfusions. The twins had positive IgM serology for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and parvovirus B19. EBV viral capsid antigen and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgGs were also positive however, suggesting past EBV exposure. Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected from peripheral blood PCR; CMV and EBV DNA PCRs were negative. Convalescent serology demonstrated no evolution of the CMV serological response, that is no IgG to CMV developed which implies an initial non-specific polyclonal IgM response. The twins recovered fully over 7days, the first with a course of prednisolone and the second spontaneously. They were diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis on convalescent blood films. On further questioning, a family history of hereditary spherocytosis was eventually revealed. The twins' maternal grandmother was known to have the condition asymptomatically. Their mother had prior to this never been tested, but later bloods would reveal a compatible biochemical picture.

### Compliance with immunizations in splenectomized individuals with hereditary spherocytosis [^1127MajP]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Overwhelming infection by encapsulated bacteria is a significant risk of splenectomy. Strict adherence to immunizations against encapsulated organisms is recommended. We performed a cross-sectional study to determine immunization status after splenectomy in the hereditary spherocytosis (HS) population. As HS is most often autosomal dominant, we used a strategy of ascertaining older affected individuals by expanding pedigrees from patients in our pediatric hematology center. Only 26% of asplenic patients reported receiving all recommended post-splenectomy vaccines. This study demonstrates that pediatric hematology clinics have a unique opportunity to provide or recommend catch-up and booster vaccinations to splenectomized adult relatives of their patients.

### The diagnostic dilemma of congenital unstable hemoglobinopathies [^111ejCYa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Unstable hemoglobin variants represent a rare etiology of congenital hemolytic anemia. Without a high index of suspicion, plus proper laboratory testing and interpretation, the correct diagnosis can be elusive. We report on five children who were initially thought to have other congenital disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia, before β-globin gene sequencing led to the definitive diagnosis. Recognizing the variable clinical presentation and laboratory data reported will aid clinicians in diagnosis of unstable hemoglobins variants in children with atypical forms of hemolytic anemia, particularly those with low pulse oximetry values or whose hemoglobin electrophoresis suggest β-thalassemia trait.

### Total versus partial splenectomy in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Dp6ZZ]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

To compare the clinical effectiveness of total splenectomy (TS) or partial splenectomy (PS) in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed (PROSPERO registration CRD42015030056). There were 14 observational studies comparing pre- and postoperative hematologic parameters. Secondary outcomes include in-hospital infections, surgical complications, symptomatic recurrence, and biliary disease. TS is more effective than PS to increase hemoglobin (3.6 g/dl vs. 2.2 g/dl) and reduce reticulocytes (12.5% vs. 6.5%) after 1 year; outcomes following PS are stable for at least 6 years. There were no cases of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. A population-based patient registry is needed for long-term follow-up.

### Hemolytic anemia [^115DmKz2]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^116ZPEHX]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, we investigated a unique and genetically well-diagnosed group of HS patients in whom we performed an in-depth analysis of RBC properties, such as membrane instability, cellular density, cellular heterogeneity, vesiculation, turnover and lifespan. The data obtained were then correlated to clinical manifestations of HS in both non-splenectomized and splenectomized patients, in order to identify markers of disease severity. Our results indicate that clinical severity in HS cannot be solely attributed to the protein harboring the mutation, but rather to the stability of the whole cytoskeletal network. RBC density, heterogeneity and deformability were identified as potential markers of severity. We found that the presence of dense RBC is strongly associated with milder manifestations of HS. We hypothesize that unstable RBC from patients with clinically more severe disease are removed from the circulation before they acquire the features of senescence.

### Glycosylated haemoglobin: a false sense of security [^113fV2r5]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report the unusual case of a patient found to have a low glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) despite having recently been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient, who was not anaemic, with no symptoms or family history of haematological conditions, was subsequently found to have an elevated reticulocyte count, inferring increased red cell turnover as the culprit for the discordant HbA1c result. A diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis was made based on characteristic peripheral blood film appearances and confirmed by eosin-5-maleimide binding test. Exposure of an undiagnosed haemolytic anaemia by virtue of a low HbA1c is uncommon. However, conditions that distort HbA1c measurements are not infrequent. This case should serve to remind clinicians of the limitations of HbA1c in specified situations, and to remain vigilant when interpreting results.

Hereditary erythrocyte membrane disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding various transmembrane or cytoskeletal proteins of red blood cells. The main consequences of these genetic alterations are decreased cell deformability and shortened erythrocyte survival. Red blood cell membrane defects encompass a heterogeneous group of haemolytic anaemias caused by either (i) altered membrane structural organisation (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis) or (ii) altered membrane transport function (overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis, familial pseudohyperkalaemia and cryohydrocytosis). Herein we provide a comprehensive review of the recent literature on the molecular genetics of erythrocyte membrane defects and their reported clinical consequences. We also describe the effect of low-expression genetic variants on the high inter- and intra-familial phenotype variability of erythrocyte structural defects.

### Evaluating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in late preterm hispanic twins led to the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis in them, and in their sibling and in their mother [^115VzBbb]. Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We identified four cases of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in one Utah family, originally from Southwestern Mexico. The index cases were twin girls born at 35 weeks gestation, in whom the combination of hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis and elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) led to studies that confirmed the diagnosis of HS. Scleral icterus in their 4-year-old sibling and in their mother led to the diagnosis of HS in them as well. Although much less commonly reported in Hispanic neonates than in those of Northern European ancestry, HS does occur among Hispanic neonates and can contribute to significant neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. These cases are consistent with our earlier report, which identified an MCHC cutoff of > 36 as suggestive of further evaluation for HS.

### Changing trends of splenectomy in hereditary spherocytosis: the experience of a reference centre in the last 40 years [^114go5YP]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

We describe the clinical/haematological characteristics of 446 patients with hereditary spherocytosis diagnosed in the last 40 years in a reference centre. The frequency of splenectomy decreased over time (44% before 1990 to 7% in 2011–2020), notwithstanding a confirmed good efficacy. Age at splenectomy progressively increased (63% in children before 1990 to 88% in patients aged ≥ 20 years in 2011–2020). Our real-life experience showed that even a fraction of patients in the trait/mild categories (19/92, 21%) were splenectomised, whilst 30/78 (38%) in the moderate/severe groups were not. Overall, these data pinpoint to the increasing awareness about post-splenectomy thromboses and infections.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation in a childhood hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^115bTDgh]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the heterogeneity of the phenotype of Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) patients, some patients may have rare clinical complications such as biliary obstruction and ultra-high bilirubinemia.

Case presentation

A 8-y-old boy presented to the emergency with complaints of anemia for 6 years and worsened abdominal pain and scleral yellowing of the skin for 2 days. Physical examination showed tenderness in the middle and upper abdomen and splenomegaly. Abdominal CT revealed biliary obstruction. Genetic analysis revealed a de novo mutation in the gene ANK1, HS with biliary obstruction was diagnosed. The surgery of bile duct exploration and T-tube drainage, and splenectomy were performed successively. This patient was followed up for 13 months after splenectomy, and his condition was stable.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of HS is not clinically difficult, and once a patient with HS is diagnosed, regular follow-up management and standardized treatment are required. Genetic testing is also needed to screen for other genetic disorders that may co-exist in patients with HS who do not have a good efficacy or who have a long-term chronic onset of jaundice.

### Band 3 cape town (E90K) causes severe hereditary spherocytosis in combination with band 3 prague III [^114Vecgd]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited haemolytic anaemia, characterized by spheroidal, osmotically fragile red blood cells. This disorder exhibits heterogeneity in terms of both clinical severity and underlying molecular defect. We have studied a South African Cape Coloured individual with severe HS owing to a band 3 deficiency caused by two mutations, occurring in trans, in the band 3 gene: a novel variant that we have designated band 3 Cape Town and a previously described mutation, band 3 Prague III. Analysis of erythrocyte membrane proteins indicated a deficiency of both band 3 and protein 4.2, as well as a decreased functional capacity of band 3 to transport anions. Band 3 Cape Town is defined by a GAG→AAG point mutation at codon 90, substituting a glutamic acid with a lysine in the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule, while band 3 Prague III is a codon 870 CGG→TGG point mutation, replacing an arginine with a tryptophan in the transmembrane region of band 3. mRNA is transcribed from both mutant alleles, implying that mutant proteins are synthesized, but are either degraded prior to membrane incorporation or insertion is impaired. We conclude that the combination of these two mutations exacerbated the clinical presentation of the proband.

### Sickle cell disease… [^115SYzgp]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

This leads to the red blood cells adopting an abnormal sickle-like shape under certain circumstances; with this shape, they are unable to deform as they pass through capillaries, causing blockages. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain in joints, anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, dizziness and stroke. The probability of severe symptoms, including long-term pain, increases with age. Without treatment, people with SCD rarely reach adulthood but with good healthcare, median life expectancy is between 58 and 66 years. All of the major organs are affected by sickle cell disease. The liver, heart, kidneys, gallbladder, eyes, bones, and joints can be damaged from the abnormal functions of the sickle cells and their inability to effectively flow through the small blood vessels.

Splenic sequestration crisis The spleen is especially prone to damage in SCD due to its role as a blood filter. A splenic sequestration crisis, also known as a spleen crisis, is a medical emergency that occurs when sickled red blood cells block the spleen's filter mechanism, causing the spleen to swell and fill with blood. The accumulation of red blood cells in the spleen results in a sudden drop in circulating hemoglobin and potentially life-threatening anemia. Symptoms include pain on the left side, swollen spleen, fatigue, dizziness, irritability, rapid heartbeat, or pale skin. It most commonly affects young children, the median age of first occurrence is 1. 4 years. By the age of 5 years repeated instances of sequestration cause scarring and eventual atrophy of the spleen. Treatment is supportive, with blood transfusion if hemoglobin levels fall too low. Full or partial splenectomy may be necessary.

Long term consequences of a loss of spleen function are increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. In normal individuals, this is of little consequence, but the shortened red cell life of SCD patients results in an abrupt, life-threatening situation. Reticulocyte count drops dramatically during the disease, red cell production lapses, and the rapid destruction of existing red cells leads to acute and severe anemia. This crisis takes four to seven days to resolve. Most patients can be managed supportively; some need a blood transfusion.
- Osteomyelitis as a result of damage to the spleen, commonly caused by eitherStaphylococcus aureus or species ofSalmonella.
- Chronic kidney failure due to sickle-cell nephropathy manifests itself with hypertension, protein loss in the urine, loss of red blood cells in urine and worsened anaemia. If it progresses to end-stage kidney failure, it carries a poor prognosis.
- Leg ulcers are relatively common in SCD and can be disabling.
- In eyes, background retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy, vitreous haemorrhages, and retinal detachments can result in blindness. Regular annual eye checks are recommended.
- During pregnancy, intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, and pre-eclampsia. However, the deoxy form of HbS has an exposed hydrophobic patch which causes HbS molecules to join to form long inflexible chains. Under conditions of low oxygen concentration in the bloodstream, such as exercise, stress, altitude or dehydration, HbS polymerization forms fibrous precipitates within the red blood cell. In people homozygous for the sickle cell mutation, the presence of long-chain polymers of HbS distort the shape of the red blood cell from a smooth, doughnut-like shape to the sickle shape, making it fragile and susceptible to blocking or breaking within capillaries.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115AqoFm]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders are predominantly caused by mutations resulting in decreased RBC deformability and permeability. We present a family in which, the proband and his daughter presented with pseudohypokalaemia. Studies on the temperature dependence of pseudohypokalaemia suggested a maximum decrease in serum potassium when whole blood is stored at 37°C. Routine haematology suggested mild haemolysis with a hereditary spherocytosis phenotype. These two cases present a novel variant in temperature-dependent changes in potassium transport. A new variant was identified in the SLC4A1 gene which codes for band 3 protein (anion exchanger 1) in RBC membrane which may contribute to the phenotype. This is the first report of familial pseudohypokalaemia associated with changes in RBC membrane morphology. The clinical implications of pseudohypokalaemia are that it can lead to inappropriate investigation or treatment. However, many questions remain to be solved and other RBC membrane protein genes should be studied.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension: the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), endorsed by the international society of heart and lung transplantation (ISHLT) [^1166LCuA]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — group 1 updates and associated conditions are outlined as follows: The term familial PAH has been replaced by heritable PAH because specific gene mutations have been identified in sporadic cases with no family history, and heritable PAH includes clinically sporadic idiopathic PAH with germline mutations (mainly of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 gene as well as the activin receptor-like kinase type-1 gene or the endoglin gene) and clinical familial cases with or without identified germline mutations; this category does not mandate genetic testing in any patient with IPAH or in familial cases of PAH because this would not change clinical management. The classification of congenital heart disease causing PAH has been updated to include a clinical and an anatomical–pathophysiological version to better define and individualize prognosis, and associated PAH includes conditions with a similar clinical presentation to idiopathic PAH with identical histological findings including plexiform lesions. Schistosomiasis has been included among associated PAH forms, with a mechanism probably multifactorial including portal hypertension and local vascular inflammation caused by schistosome eggs, and chronic haemolytic anaemias such as sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, hereditary spherocytosis, stomatocytosis, and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia may result in PAH; in chronic haemolysis the mechanism relates to a high rate of nitric oxide consumption leading to resistance to NO bioactivity and smooth muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate is not activated in chronic haemolytic anaemia.

### Inherited hemolytic anemia: a possessive beginner's guide [^115DNP6e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Significant advances have been made in diagnosis and clinical management of inherited red cell membrane disorders that result in hemolytic anemia. Membrane structural defects lead to hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), whereas altered membrane transport function accounts for hereditary xerocytosis (HX) and hereditary overhydrated stomatocytosis (OHS). The degrees of membrane loss and resultant increases in cell sphericity determine the severity of anemia in HS and HE, and splenectomy leads to amelioration of anemia by increasing the circulatory red cell life span. Alterations in cell volume as a result of disordered membrane cation permeability account for reduced life span red cells in HX and OHS. Importantly, splenectomy is not beneficial in these 2 membrane transport disorders and is not recommended because it is ineffective and may lead to an increased risk of life-threatening thrombosis. Rational approaches are now available for the diagnosis and management of these inherited red cell disorders, and these will be discussed in this review.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis [^114T4r7Z]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with regard to clinical severity, protein defects and mode of inheritance. It is relatively common in Caucasian populations; most affected individuals have mild or only moderate haemolysis. There is usually a family history, and a typical clinical and laboratory picture so that the diagnosis is often easily made without additional laboratory tests. Atypical cases may require measurement of erythrocyte membrane proteins to clarify the nature of the membrane disorder and in the absence of a family history, occasionally molecular genetic analysis will help to determine whether inheritance is recessive or non-dominant. It is particularly important to rule out stomatocytosis where splenectomy is contraindicated because of the thrombotic risk. Mild HS can be managed without folate supplements and does not require splenectomy. Moderately and severely affected individuals are likely to benefit from splenectomy, which should be performed after the age of 6 years and with appropriate counselling about the infection risk. In all cases careful dialogue between doctor, patient and the family is essential. Laparoscopic surgery, when performed by experienced surgeons, can result in a shorter hospital stay and less pain.

### Erythrocyte membrane protein destabilization versus clinical outcome in 160 Portuguese hereditary spherocytosis patients [^111LY8GK]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) is a haemolytic anaemia caused by erythrocyte protein membrane defects - spectrin, ankyrin, band 3 or protein 4.2 - that lead to membrane destabilization. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of protein deficiencies and the role of membrane proteins or membrane-linked proteins in membrane disturbance and in HS clinical outcome. A total of 215 Portuguese individuals were studied - 203 from 71 families plus 12 individual unrelated subjects; 160 of them were diagnosed with HS. They were classified as presenting mild, moderate or severe forms of HS according to the degree of haemolytic anaemia. Standardized electrophoretic erythrocyte membrane protein analysis was used to identify and quantify protein deficiencies. Band 3 and ankyrin were found to account for the majority of the erythrocyte protein defects underlying HS. Increasing isolated protein deficiency or increasing imbalance between combined protein deficiencies seemed to underlie HS severity, by increasing membrane destabilization. There was an increased membrane linkage of the cytosolic proteins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and peroxiredoxin 2, and of denatured haemoglobin, suggesting that this linkage could interfere with membrane structure. Our data suggest that the quantification and the analysis of RBC membrane proteins may be helpful in predicting the clinical outcome of HS.

ACMG secondary findings — SLC4A1 was not recommended for the SF gene list; although nominated for hereditary spherocytosis type 4, ovalocytosis, SA type, and autosomal dominant distal renal tubular acidosis, the SFWG noted concerns that severity as a secondary finding may not rise to other listed conditions, severe presentations typically manifest and can be identified in early childhood, genotype–phenotype correlations and penetrance are unclear, and there is a lack of surveillance guidelines for carriers of P/LP variants.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^114MQRKr]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study reveals the factors defining RBC longevity and erythropoietic activity in patients with HS. These factors include membrane stability, which in turn depends on the localization of mutations affecting vertical or horizontal interactions within the membrane cytoskeleton and on the presence of splenic filtering capacity. Mild HS is associated with prolonged survival of RBC in the circulation, allowing greater loss of membrane, which results in smaller and denser RBC. Shorter-lived, unstable RBC from patients with severe HS phenotype are more heterogeneous and less dense, as reflected by lower MCHC.

Parameters that specifically mark clinical severity in HS are summarized in Table 2 and are RBC density (MCHC, Percoll, O hyper), RBC deformability (EI max), and RBC heterogeneity (RDW). These parameters may be used to monitor the success of supportive therapy and assist in the development of new personalized treatment regimens.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115NYrjK]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a family with a red cell membrane abnormality which results in an HS phenotype and pseudohypokalaemia. Clinically, the patients were asymptomatic and peripheral blood smears demonstrated HS and biochemistry suggested mild hyperbilirubinaemia with hemolytic anaemia. The true underlying molecular cause of this condition remains obscure, but it is suggested that a SLC4A1 variant gene could contribute to the condition. The clinical implications of pseudohypokalaemia are that it can lead to inappropriate investigation or treatment.

Learning points

We report, to our knowledge for the first time, a variation of the hereditary spherocytosis phenotype with increased red blood cell MCV and pseudohypokalaemia.
Severe hypokalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
Pseudohypokalaemia can be misleading and result in incorrect interpretation and patient mismanagement.
Immediate recognition of pseudohypokalaemia and appropriate intervention can prevent misdiagnosis.
The true underlying molecular cause of this condition remains obscure, but a possibility is that the SLC4A1 missense mutation which predicts structural alterations of transmembrane domains could contribute to changes in cation permeability.

### Glycosylated haemoglobin: a false sense of security [^114LnF45]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Since 2011, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) has been endorsed by WHO for the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus. HbA1c measurement provides a reflection of a patient's glycaemic control over the preceding 8–12 weeks and correlates with the development of diabetic complications. Despite this, its limitations are well documented in patients with certain haematological and genetic conditions. In these patients, HbaA1c may give false reassurance, and it is advisable that, when such conditions are recognised, alternative methods are used to diagnose and monitor diabetes.

This report highlights the limitations of using HbA1c as a diagnostic tool in patients with increased red blood cell turnover. In this case, an unexpectedly low HbA1c unmasked a compensated haemolytic anaemia due to previously undiagnosed hereditary spherocytosis (HS). While HS in this patient has been categorised as mild and is unlikely to require any intervention, the haemolysis is of clinical significance since it inadvertently delayed the diagnosis of diabetes.

A 16-year-old male patient with known hereditary spherocytosis presented with a 4-day history of chest pain and lethargy. On admission, he had a low-grade fever and was grossly anaemic; examination revealed splenomegaly. An ultrasound scan confirmed splenomegaly with areas of splenic infarction. Subsequent tests suggested possible Epstein-Barr virus infection. The patient recovered well and had a functional spleen on discharge. This case report presents an unusual complication of isolated hereditary spherocytosis.

### Red cell membrane disorders [^111rrb5v]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of the erythrocyte membrane, including hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis, comprise an important group of inherited hemolytic anemias. These syndromes are characterized by marked clinical and laboratory heterogeneity. Recent molecular studies have revealed that there is also significant genetic heterogeneity in these disorders. This is particularly true for the spherocytosis syndromes where each kindred has a private mutation in one of the spherocytosis genes. Treatment with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Splenectomy via a laparoscopic approach has become the surgical method of choice. Growing recognition and understanding of the long-term risks and complications of splenectomy, including cardiovascular disease, thrombotic disorders, and pulmonary hypertension, and the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, a concern for infection in overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, have led to reevaluation of the role of splenectomy. Recent management guidelines acknowledge these important considerations when entertaining splenectomy and recommend detailed discussion between health care providers, patient, and family.

### Treatment of asymptomatic gallstones in children with hereditary spherocytosis requiring splenectomy [^11577hZX]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gallstones are common in hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and other chronic hemolytic diseases, with most affected patients being asymptomatic. Whether and how asymptomatic gallstones should be treated is controversial.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with HS and asymptomatic gallstones to compare the clinical outcomes between the observation group (followed up with gallstones in situ) and the intervention group (cholecystectomy or cholecystolithotomy). The primary outcome was the composite of adverse outcomes, including gallstone-associated, gallbladder surgery-associated, and splenectomy-associated events. Secondary outcomes included the changes in the size and number of gallstones and the recurrence of gallstones.

Results

Fifty-two patients were included (38 in the observation group and 14 in the intervention group), with a mean follow-up length of 5.2 years. Patients in the intervention group had a lower incidence of primary outcomes (7.1% vs. 42.1%) than patients in the observation group (OR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.01–0.99). Patients with gallstones > 5 mm in diameter had the highest risk of adverse events (47.4%). In the observation group, gallstone growth, disappearance, and stability were observed in 19.4%, 29.0%, and 51.6% of splenectomized HS patients, respectively. Small gallstones (diameter ≤ 5 mm) or sludge were more likely to be associated with disappearance (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Most asymptomatic gallstones grow or persist in splenectomized HS patients for an extended period. Surgical treatment of asymptomatic gallstones in HS patients requiring splenectomy is associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation in a childhood hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^1148KJNW]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the heterogeneity of the phenotype of Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) patients, some patients may have rare clinical complications such as biliary obstruction and ultra-high bilirubinemia.

Case Presentation

A 8-y-old boy presented to the emergency with complaints of anemia for 6 years and worsened abdominal pain and scleral yellowing of the skin for 2 days. Physical examination showed tenderness in the middle and upper abdomen and splenomegaly. Abdominal CT revealed biliary obstruction. Genetic analysis revealed a de novo mutation in the gene ANK1, HS with biliary obstruction was diagnosed. The surgery of bile duct exploration and T-tube drainage, and splenectomy were performed successively. This patient was followed up for 13 months after splenectomy, and his condition was stable.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of HS is not clinically difficult, and once a patient with HS is diagnosed, regular follow-up management and standardized treatment are required. Genetic testing is also needed to screen for other genetic disorders that may co-exist in patients with HS who do not have a good efficacy or who have a long-term chronic onset of jaundice.

### Β-spectrin S (ta) Bárbara: a novel frameshift mutation in hereditary spherocytosis associated with detectable levels of mRNA and a germ cell line mosaicism [^117X82sj]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited anaemia characterized by the presence of spherocytic red cells and by a heterogeneous nature in terms of its clinical presentation, molecular basis and inheritance. Defects in several membrane protein genes have been involved in the pathogenesis of HS, including defects in the beta-spectrin gene. We detected a novel frameshift mutation in the beta-spectrin gene, a C deletion at codon 638, in a patient presenting with HS and spectrin deficiency. The mutant protein was not detected in the membrane or in other cellular compartments, but detectable levels of mutant mRNA were found in the patient. Interestingly, this mutation was not present in the patient's parents, suggesting a genetic mosaicism, especially as the patient has an affected brother with the same molecular defect. We analysed DNA from different tissues of the parents and the mutation was absent from all tissues analysed. This mutation seems to be confined to the germ cell lineage of the patient's mother and must present a mosaic pattern in these cells as the patient also has unaffected siblings.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation associated to hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^116kANqA]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) results from defects in erythrocyte membrane proteins characterized by hemolysis, anemia, jaundice, gallstones and splenomegaly. The severity depends on rate of hemolysis, degree of compensation of anemia by reticulocytosis. The clinical manifestations vary widely, ranging from nearly asymptomatic to transfusion-dependent or severe life-threatening anemia. In the neonatal period, the major clinical manifestations are jaundice and anemia. Splenomegaly and spherocytes are rarely observed. Therefore, it's difficult to diagnose in neonates. Even during the first year of life, approximately 34% affected infants are diagnosed.

Previous researches have shown that mutations in ANK1 (ankyrin 1), SPTB (spectrin, beta, erythrocytic), SPTA1 (spectrin alpha, erythrocytic 1), SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4, member 1, or band 3), and EPB42 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2) are associated with HS. The mutations of these genes lead to the normally double-concave disc-shaped red cells become spherical, fragile red cells. ANK1 located on 8p11.21, its mutations include nonsense, splicing or frameshift and affect about half of patients with HS.

In most cases, HS is usually diagnosed on the basis of a positive family history, increased osmotic fragility, hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly and spherocytes on peripheral blood smears. The neonatal HS ratio which is calculated by dividing the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) provides valuable information for the physicians. In the index infant, the ratio was > 0.36, which points towards a diagnosis of HS (97% sensitivity, 99% specificity). However, mild or atypical cases are difficult to identify because of the limitations of the classical approaches. It has been reported that approximately 10% patients of HS may be misdiagnosed due to the lack of the typical sphere-shaped erythrocytes in the peripheral blood.

In this report, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze a Chinese family with an infant with unknown causes of hemolysis, and we identified a de novo ANK1 mutation responsible for HS.

### Identification of a novel heterozygous SPTB mutation by whole genome sequencing in a Chinese patient with hereditary spherocytosis and atrial septal defect: a case report [^116xoD1m]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorder characterized by an abnormal increase of spherocytes in peripheral blood. HS occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, and its prevalence in China is about 1.27–1.49 per 100,000 individuals. The HS clinical spectrum ranges broadly from a nearly asymptomatic disease to life-threatening anemia, serious splenomegaly, and/or severe hyperbilirubinemia, even in the same family. About 70% of HS cases are associated with autosomal dominant inheritance, although non-dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance have been described.

HS is mostly characterized by sphere-shaped erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear resulting from qualitative and/or quantitative abnormalities of RBC membrane proteins, which are basically caused by mutations in the corresponding genes. Current evidence indicates that mutations in the ankyrin 1 (ANK1; about 50%), spectrin-β, erythrocytic (SPTB; approximately 20%), solute carrier family 4, member 1 (SLC4A 1; about 15%), erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2 (EPB42; 10%) and spectrin-ɑ, erythrocytic 1 (SPTA1; 5%) are associated with membrane defects in HS.

Although SPTB mutations mostly cause HS, only few HS families with such mutations have been reported in the Chinese population. Here, we identified a novel SPTB frameshift mutation responsible for HS in a Chinese family by whole genome sequencing (WGS).

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^117XXUWn]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

RBC EVs from hereditary spherocytosis patients are softened

Finally, we compared the mechanical properties of RBC EVs from healthy donors with RBC EVs from patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Dominantly inherited HS often is caused by mutations in the genes encoding ankyrin and band 3 (reviewed by Da Costa et al.). In two of these patients (patient 1 & 2), HS is caused by heterozygosity for a novel 4 base pair insertion in ANK1 (c.5201_5202insTCAG p. Thr1734fs). This 4 base pair insertion results in a shift of the reading frame, leading to a truncated ankyrin protein. One of these two patients underwent splenectomy (patient 2). The third patient (patient 3) shows heterozygosity for a novel nonsense mutation in ANK1: c.498C > G p.(Tyr166*). If stable, such proteins likely would be deficient in their function. Ankyrin truncation is expected to result in a disturbed cytoskeletal network and its connection to the plasma membrane. In turn this leads to increased vesiculation and hence a reduced ratio of surface area to volume, resulting in spherocytic cells (Fig. 5a). Such RBCs are poorly deformable and will be cleared prematurely from the blood circulation, leading to hemolytic anemia. Reduced RBC deformability was confirmed by laser diffraction ektacytometry (Fig. 5b).

Nonimmune hydrops fetalis may occur as a result of different etiological conditions and in about one-third of cases no cause could be identified. Here, we report two cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis associated with hereditary spherocytosis and hemophagocytic hystiocytosis. We think that babies with hydrops fetalis born of consanguineous parents should be examined for hereditary diseases, and that these rare causes should be taken into account in problematic cases.

### Coinheritance of sickle cell anemia and hereditary spherocytosis [^113DknPG]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

To date only three siblings with coinheritance of sickle cell anemia (SCA) and hereditary spherocytosis (HS) have been reported. We here describe a 17-year-old boy who experienced episodes of hemolysis and had a large spleen. The diagnosis of SCA was confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis (HbS 88.9%) and genetic analysis (homozygote HbSS mutation). The diagnosis of HS was established by an osmotic fragility test, performed twice. A splenectomy was performed, and following surgery the hemoglobin concentration was maintained between 9 and 11 g/dl without further transfusion requirements. This patient was the fourth reported case with co-existence of two different genetically transmitted hemolytic anemias.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114p41Ly]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia — evaluation for hemolysis in early or refractory cases includes that an infant < 24 hours old with a TSB concentration above the phototherapy threshold likely has hemolytic disease. Measurement of ETCOc, if available, may help identify hemolysis, and identifying whether there is G6PD deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis or other red cell membrane defects can help identify infants at risk for recurrent hemolysis and also provide information for families about increased risk in future pregnancies. In challenging clinical circumstances, such as an increasing TSB despite intensive phototherapy, which is suggestive of hemolysis, a neonatologist or hematologist can be consulted for guidance, and genomic sequencing may be helpful when the cause of hemolysis cannot otherwise be identified in neonates who receive escalation of care.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^1138rr4R]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemolytic anemias are a group of disorders with a variety of causes, including red cell membrane defects, red blood cell enzyme disorders, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, thalassemia syndromes and hemoglobinopathies. As damaged red blood cells passing through the red pulp of the spleen are removed by splenic macrophages, splenectomy is one possible therapeutic approach to the management of severely affected patients. However, except for hereditary spherocytosis for which the effectiveness of splenectomy has been well documented, the efficacy of splenectomy in other anemias within this group has yet to be determined and there are concerns regarding short- and long-term infectious and thrombotic complications. In light of the priorities identified by the European Hematology Association Roadmap we generated specific recommendations for each disorder, except thalassemia syndromes for which there are other, recent guidelines. Our recommendations are intended to enable clinicians to achieve better informed decisions on disease management by splenectomy, on the type of splenectomy and the possible consequences. As no randomized clinical trials, case control or cohort studies regarding splenectomy in these disorders were found in the literature, recommendations for each disease were based on expert opinion and were subsequently critically revised and modified by the Splenectomy in Rare Anemias Study Group, which includes hematologists caring for both adults and children.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^112qF6b8]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) originates from defective anchoring of the cytoskeletal network to the transmembrane protein complexes of the red blood cell (RBC). Red cells in HS are characterized by membrane instability and reduced deformability and there is marked heterogeneity in disease severity among patients. To unravel this variability in disease severity, we analyzed blood samples from 21 HS patients with defects in ankyrin, band 3, α-spectrin or β-spectrin using red cell indices, eosin-5-maleimide binding, microscopy, the osmotic fragility test, Percoll density gradients, vesiculation and ektacytometry to assess cell membrane stability, cellular density and deformability. Reticulocyte counts, CD71 abundance, band 4.1 a:b ratio, and glycated hemoglobin were used as markers of RBC turnover. We observed that patients with moderate/severe spherocytosis have short-living erythrocytes of low density and abnormally high intercellular heterogeneity. These cells show a prominent decrease in membrane stability and deformability and, as a consequence, are quickly removed from the circulation by the spleen. In contrast, in mild spherocytosis less pronounced reduction in deformability results in prolonged RBC lifespan and, hence, cells are subject to progressive loss of membrane. RBC from patients with mild spherocytosis thus become denser before they are taken up by the spleen. Based on our findings, we conclude that RBC membrane loss, cellular heterogeneity and density are strong markers of clinical severity in spherocytosis.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^113Cy7LQ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

RBC vesiculation is also relevant in blood disorders, for example in hereditary spherocytosis (HS). HS is one of the most common hereditary RBC disorders in the western world and is accompanied by increased release of EVs. This vesiculation is caused by a reduced linkage between the membrane and the underlying cytoskeletal spectrin network leading to loss of RBC membrane. Reduced membrane surface area results in the formation of spherocytes. Spherocytes are less deformable, which causes these cells to be retained and cleared by the spleen. However, the relation between this blood disorder and EV release is still poorly understood as we are lacking structural and mechanical insights into EVs properties of both donors and patients.

These structural and mechanical properties of EVs influence their behavior, such as their interactions with cells –. Therefore, there has been a strong interest in quantifying EV mechanical properties. At present, however, characterization of EVs is challenging due to their small size and a proper mechanical characterization of (RBC) EVs under physiological conditions has not yet been performed. Recently, we showed that the mechanics of small (< 200 nm) synthetic vesicles, i.e. liposomes, are accurately described by a quantitative model based on Canham-Helfrich theory –. However, the mechanical properties of natural vesicles will result from a combination of lipidic contributions as well as that of membrane proteins and intraluminal proteins. The presence of such proteins could lead to a nonzero shear modulus of the natural vesicles, which might therefore be better described as thin elastic shells, and hence potentially show typical behavior thereof, such as buckling. Moreover, thin shell behavior could be caused by spectrin structures, which is known to provide shear resistance to the RBC membrane –. A high percentage of the RBC membrane is occupied by membrane proteins (~20% at the hydrophobic core). The effect of these proteins on membrane mechanics is not entirely clear; nano-indentation studies with vesicles reconstructed from yeast membranes and influenza viruses both suggested that membrane proteins result in a large increase of the bending modulus of vesicles. On the other hand, studies with model membranes have mostly reported membrane softening due to the presence of short peptides in the membrane. Similar experimental studies with various larger membrane proteins showed either a neutral effect on membrane stiffness, or a decrease in the membrane stiffness. Recent simulations reconcile some of these results by reporting how integral membrane proteins can have diverse effects on membrane mechanics, either softening, neutral or stiffening.

### Extramedullary hematopoiesis in a child with hereditary spherocytosis: an uncommon cause of an adrenal mass [^1134NwHG]. Pediatric Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

We report a case of extramedullary hematopoiesis presenting as an adrenal mass in a young male with hereditary spherocytosis. The unilateral adrenal mass was discovered during an abdominal ultrasound performed for jaundice. CT and MR imaging were subsequently performed, followed by an excisional biopsy at the time of splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Although extramedullary hematopoiesis is a rare cause of an adrenal mass, the diagnosis must be considered in any patient with a history of a congenital hemolytic disorder such as hereditary spherocytosis. In this regard, the morbidity of an unnecessary procedure may be avoided.

### Hereditary haemolytic anaemias: unexpected sequelae of mutations in the genes for erythroid membrane skeletal proteins [^116oYzHg]. The Journal of Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Although the haemolytic anaemia may be the primary concern for hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis patients, it is clear that their situation can be compromised by primary and secondary defects in erythroid and non-erythroid systems of the body. All seven of the red cell membrane skeletal proteins discussed in this review are also expressed in non-erythroid tissues, and mutations in their genes have the potential to cause non-erythroid defects. In some instances, such as the protein 4.1R and ANK1 neurological deficits, the diagnosis is clear. In other instances, because of the complex expression patterns involved, the non-erythroid effects may be difficult to assess. An example is the large multidomain, multifunctional band 3 protein. In this case, the location of the mutation can cause defects in one functional domain or isoform and not the other. In other cases, such as the beta-adducin null mutation, other isoforms may partially compensate for the primary deficiency. In such cases, it may be that the effects of the deficit are subtle but could increase under stress or with age. To be completely successful, treatment strategies must address both primary and secondary effects of the anaemia. If gene replacement therapy is to be used, the more that is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms producing the multiple isoforms the better we will be able to design the best replacement gene. The various animal models that are now available should be invaluable in this regard. They continue to contribute to our understanding of both the primary and the secondary effects and their treatment.

### Mimicry of inherited red cell disorders: the result of somatic mutations in a clonal myeloid disease [^116KhV7j]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

The hematopathologist and hematological oncologist should consider acquired syndromes described here when alterations of the genes and/or chromosome loci noted in Table 1 occur in association with a chronic myeloid neoplasm or when the red cell morphology has features that are unusual, such as a heightened frequency or dominance of ovalocytes or spherocytes.

Table 1.
Somatic mutations in chronic myeloid neoplasms leading to acquired red cell syndromes simulating germline mutations.

A clonal myeloid disease, especially a myelodysplastic syndrome, may also result in a profound disorder of erythropoiesis that leads to "red cell anarchy". The latter is defined by an exaggerated combination of anisocytosis, anisochromia and poikilocytosis. Red cell anisocytosis (elevated red cell distribution width) predicts for a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemiaand in myelodysplastic syndrome. Elevated red cell distribution width is also a risk factor for progression of age-related clonal hematopoiesis in otherwise healthy persons to acute myelogenous leukemia.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^11772G9B]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This comprehensive study in a well-characterized cohort of patients offers insight into the variable phenotypic manifestations of HS, possible causes of clinical heterogeneity and severity, and the impact of splenectomy. We show here that strong markers of moderate/severe expression of HS are: (i) lower RBC density, reflected by differences in MCHC and fractionation of RBC on the Percoll density gradient; (ii) reduced RBC deformability and increased membrane loss, as determined by RBC vesicle numbers and a decrease in MPA; and (iii) heterogeneity in the RBC population reflected by differences in RDW and fractionation of RBC using a Percoll gradient.

We conclude that patients with moderate/severe HS have short-lived RBC of lower density and abnormally high intercellular heterogeneity, whereas patients with mild HS have a less pronounced reduction in RBC deformability resulting in the cells living longer and being subject to progressive loss of membrane. RBC from patients with mild HS thus become denser before they are taken up by the spleen.

### Open-heart surgery using a centrifugal pump: a case of hereditary spherocytosis [^111MV9A5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic, frequently familial hemolytic blood disease characterized by varying degrees of hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. There are few reports on adult open-heart surgery for patients with hereditary spherocytosis.

Case Presentation

We report a rare case of an adult open-heart surgery associated with hereditary spherocytosis. A 63-year-old man was admitted for congestive heart failure due to bicuspid aortic valve, aortic valve regurgitation, and sinus of subaortic aneurysm. The family history, the microscopic findings of the blood smear, and the characteristic osmotic fragility confirmed the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Furthermore, splenectomy had not been undertaken preoperatively. The patient underwent a successful operation by means of a centrifugal pump. Haptoglobin was used during the cardiopulmonary bypass, and a biological valve was selected to prevent hemolysis. No significant hemolysis occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively.

Conclusion

There are no previous reports of patients with hereditary spherocytosis, and bicuspid aortic valve. We have successfully performed an adult open-heart surgery using a centrifugal pump in an adult patient suffering from hereditary spherocytosis and bicuspid aortic valve.

### Red blood cell… [^112SifDM]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The spleen acts as a reservoir of red blood cells, but this effect is somewhat limited in humans. In some other mammals such as dogs and horses, the spleen sequesters large numbers of red blood cells, which are dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress, yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity. The elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate red blood cells has been offered as an explanation for the subsequent accumulation of non-coding DNA in the genome. The argument runs as follows: Efficient gas transport requires red blood cells to pass through very narrow capillaries, and this constrains their size. In the absence of nuclear elimination, the accumulation of repeat sequences is constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus, which increases with genome size.
- Macrophages recognize and phagocytose red cells that expose PS at their outer surface.

Thus the confinement of PS in the inner monolayer is essential if the cell is to survive its frequent encounters with macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, especially in the spleen.
- Premature destruction of thallassemic and sickle red cells has been linked to disruptions of lipid asymmetry leading to exposure of PS on the outer monolayer.
- An exposure of PS can potentiate adhesion of red cells to vascular endothelial cells, effectively preventing normal transit through the microvasculature. Thus it is important that PS is maintained only in the inner leaflet of the bilayer to ensure normal blood flow in microcirculation.
- Both PS and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate can regulate membrane mechanical function, due to their interactions with skeletal proteins such as spectrin and protein 4. 1R. Recent studies have shown that binding of spectrin to PS promotes membrane mechanical stability. PIP2 enhances the binding of protein band 4.

1R to glycophorin C but decreases its interaction with protein band 3, and thereby may modulate the linkage of the bilayer to the membrane skeleton. Membrane proteins The proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the deformability, flexibility and durability of the red blood cell, enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter of the red blood cell and recovering the discoid shape as soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces, in a similar fashion to an object made of rubber. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The red blood cell membrane proteins organized according to their function:

Because of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot synthesize any RNA, and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities. The inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells. However, infection with parvoviruses can affect erythroid precursors while they still have DNA, as recognized by the presence of giant pronormoblasts with viral particles and inclusion bodies, thus temporarily depleting the blood of reticulocytes and causing anemia. Life cycle Human red blood cells are produced through a process named erythropoiesis, developing from committed stem cells to mature red blood cells in about 7 days. When matured, in a healthy individual these cells live in blood circulation for about 100 to 120 days.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^113odKzb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a case that does not fit into the above categories. We describe a family previously classified as HS phenotype who presented in a novel form with familial pseudohypokalaemia. The patient and his daughter were recalled to hospital as an emergency for a repeat electrolyte measurement when a routine samples were found to show a low serum potassium. Repeat serum potassium measurements in an emergency department were within reference intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first case presentation of pseudohypokalaemia associated with the HS phenotype.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation in a childhood hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^116LzY3C]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common chronic non-immune hemolytic disease, and the clinical features of HS are mainly jaundice, splenomegaly and hemolytic anemia, but due to the heterogeneity of the phenotype of HS patients, anemia can be mild to severe in clinical manifestations, leading to possible misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis in some patients with atypical symptoms. ANK1 gene mutation is one of the most common causes of HS. The authors present a case of HS with a de novo ANK1 mutation combined with biliary obstruction in a child.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^111HSTLj]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Our results also provide new insights into the pathophysiology and vesiculation process in HS. Suggested mechanisms for membrane shedding by RBCs are related to clustering of membrane proteins driving curvature generation, and to the balance between membrane bending and stretching of the spectrin cytoskeleton –. The weaker linkage of the membrane with the underlying cytoskeleton in HS likely causes loss of organization in the membrane. This is supported by the observation that diffusion of membrane proteins is faster in RBCs from patients with HS. We speculate that loss of organization of the membrane gives room to accumulation of specific membrane proteins that lower the bending modulus locally and hence the energy barrier for vesicle formation. This would be consistent with the observation that the bending modulus of spherocytic red blood cells is not decreased, and in this way, the loss of membrane linkage could lead to the reported increase in vesiculation in HS patients. Ultimately, such increased vesiculation is the primary reason of the rounding and stiffening of HS RBCs, resulting in RBC clearance from the circulation and hemolytic anemia.

To conclude, we have presented an innovative approach to characterize the structural and material properties of extracellular vesicles. Surprisingly, the material properties of RBC EVs from healthy donors are similar to that of fluid liposomes. In contrast, the EVs from hereditary spherocytosis patients are significantly softer. This suggests a neutral effect for (membrane) proteins in donor EVs, whereas the different protein composition of patient EVs results in a lower bending modulus. The low rigidity of patient EVs fits with the augmented stiffness of HS patient RBCs and their increased vesiculation. Our approach has shed novel light on EV structure from healthy individuals as well as from HS patients, and is expected to be applied for the characterization and development of a variety of natural EVs and EV-based approaches in nanotechnology and nanomedicine.

### Spherocytosis… [^115oJ4aE]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Spherocytosis is the presence of spherocytes in the blood, i.e. erythrocytes that are sphere-shaped rather than bi-concave disk shaped as normal. Spherocytes are found in all hemolytic anemias to some degree. Hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are characterized by having only spherocytes. Causes Spherocytes are found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply. A complete blood count may show increased reticulocytes, a sign of increased red blood cell production, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. The term "non-hereditary spherocytosis" is occasionally used, albeit rarely.

Lists of causes:

- Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia
- Cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia/paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria
- Acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions
- ABO hemolytic diseases of newborn/Rh hemolytic disease of newborn
- Hereditary spherocytosis
- Intravenous water infusion or drowning
- Hypophosphatemia
- Bartonellosis
- Snake bites
- Hyposplenism
- Rh-null phenotype. Pathophysiology Spherocytosis most often refers to hereditary spherocytosis. This is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including spectrin, ankyrin, Band 3, or Protein 4.
2. Because the cell skeleton has a defect, the blood cell contracts to a sphere, which is its most surface tension efficient and least flexible configuration. Though the spherocytes have a smaller surface area through which oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged, they in themselves perform adequately to maintain healthy oxygen supplies.

However, they have a high osmotic fragility — when placed into water, they are more likely to burst than normal red blood cells. These cells are more prone to physical degradation. In short, spherocytosis has an attribute of decreased cell deformability. Diagnosis Spherocytosis can be diagnosed in Peripheral blood film by seeing spherical red blood cells rather than biconcave. Because spherical red blood cells are more prone to lysis in water there will be increased osmotic fragility on acidified glycerol lysis test. Treatment Treatment may vary depending on the cause of the condition. In the case of hereditary spherocytosis, although research is ongoing, at this point there is no cure for the genetic defect that causes hereditary spherocytosis. Current management focuses on interventions that limit the severity of the disease. Treatment options for this type of spherocytosis include:

- **Splenectomy**: As in non-hereditary spherocytosis, acute symptoms of anemia and hyperbilirubinemia indicate treatment with blood transfusions or exchanges and chronic symptoms of anemia and an enlarged spleen indicate dietary supplementation of folic acid and splenectomy, the surgical removal of the spleen. Splenectomy is indicated for moderate to severe cases, but not mild cases. To decrease the risk of sepsis, post-splenectomy spherocytosis patients require immunization against the influenza virus, encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and meningococcus, and prophylactic antibiotic treatment. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, such as penicillin, remains controversial.
- **Partial splenectomy**: Since the spleen is important for protecting against encapsulated organisms, sepsis caused by encapsulated organisms is a possible complication of splenectomy. The option of partial splenectomy may be considered in the interest of preserving immune function.

### Diagnostic power of laboratory tests for hereditary spherocytosis: a comparison study in 150 patients grouped according to molecular and clinical characteristics [^116F3bW6]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The laboratory diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis commonly relies on NaCl-based or glycerol-based red cell osmotic fragility tests; more recently, an assay directly targeting the hereditary spherocytosis molecular defect (eosin-5'-maleimide-binding test) has been proposed. None of the available tests identifies all cases of hereditary spherocytosis.

Design and Methods

We compared the performances of the eosin-5'-maleimide-binding test, NaCl-osmotic fragility studies on fresh and incubated blood, the glycerol lysis test, the acidified glycerol lysis test, and the Pink test on a series of 150 patients with hereditary spherocytosis grouped according to clinical phenotype and the defective protein, with the final aim of finding the combination of tests associated with the highest diagnostic power, even in the mildest cases of hereditary spherocytosis.

Results

The eosin-5'-maleimide-binding test had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 98% for detecting hereditary spherocytosis: the sensitivity was independent of the type and amount of molecular defect and of the clinical phenotype. The acidified glycerol lysis test and Pink test showed comparable sensitivity (95% and 91%). The sensitivity of NaCl osmotic fragility tests, commonly considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, was 68% on fresh blood and 81% on incubated blood, and further decreased in compensated cases (53% and 64%, respectively). The combination of the eosin-5'-maleimide-binding test and acidified glycerol lysis test enabled all patients with hereditary spherocytosis to be identified. The eosin-5'-maleimide-binding test showed the greatest disease specificity.

Conclusions

Each type of test fails to diagnose some cases of hereditary spherocytosis. The association of an eosin-5'-maleimide-binding test and an acidified glycerol lysis test enabled identification of all patients with hereditary spherocytosis in this series and, therefore, represents a currently effective diagnostic strategy for hereditary spherocytosis including mild/compensated cases.

### A neonate with coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice with spherocytes but normal erythrocyte indices: a rare case of autosomal-recessive hereditary spherocytosis due to α-spectrin deficiency [^113EovH6]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in a newborn infant is generally made on the basis of a positive family history, spherocytes on blood film and Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice of variable severity with an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). In general, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) quantification of erythrocyte membrane proteins is not needed to make the clinical diagnosis of HS. However, we observed that a neonate with no family history of HS, but with abundant spherocytosis on repeated blood films, Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice and normal MCHC and MCV measurements, where SDS-PAGE revealed alpha-spectrin deficiency, a rare autosomal-recessive variety of HS that generally has a severe clinical phenotype.

### How I treat hypoxia in adults with hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic disorders [^115XnfEq]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies are caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormal hemoglobin molecules, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Chronic complications involving the lung parenchyma, vasculature, and cardiac function in hemoglobinopathies result in impaired gas exchange, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia is defined as the deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body and is prevalent in patients with hemoglobinopathies, and its cause is often multifactorial. Chronic hypoxia in hemoglobinopathies is often a sign of disease severity and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxia in these disease processes is important in order to appropriately treat the underlying cause and prevent complications. In this article, we discuss management of hypoxia based on three different cases: sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis. These cases are used to review the current understanding of the disease pathophysiology, demonstrate the importance of a thorough clinical history and physical examination, explore diagnostic pathways, and review the current management.

### Correlation of genetic mutation with outcomes in children with hereditary spherocytosis undergoing partial splenectomy: a Multicentre study [^1175sKGb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) is a common genetic hematological disorder causing a life-long hemolytic anemia, with sequela of hemolysis. Children with severe HS commonly undergo partial or total splenectomy (PS, TS); PS confers the theoretical advantage of maintaining splenic immune function, but may be associated with regrowth, ongoing hemolysis, and need for completion splenectomy. HS can be caused by 5 different pathogenic gene variants. A rare and severe form is caused by homozygous/compound heterozygous mutations in the SPTA1 gene, coding for alpha spectrin. We hypothesized this form of HS is associated with worse outcomes following PS.

Methods

Following REB approval, a retrospective chart review of children with HS undergoing PS between 2000 and 2023 was conducted across 7 sites in the USA and Canada. Pre- and post-operative hematological values and need for completion splenectomy were analyzed. P < 0.05 was significant.

Results

Of 51 eligible patients, 10 had SPTA and 41 had non-SPTA1 HS. The SPTA1 group underwent PS at a younger age to non-SPTA1 (5.1 vs 9.6 yr, p = 0.003), and had lower pre-operative hemoglobin (86.2 vs 98.8 g/L, p = 0.04). There were no differences between groups regarding peri-operative surgical or hematological outcomes. The SPTA1 group required completion splenectomy at a higher rate than the non-SPTA1 group (70.0% vs 24.4%, p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Children with SPTA1 HS are more likely to require completion splenectomy following PS than children with other HS-causing mutations. These results support the role of genetic testing to permit an evidence-based individualized approach to patient selection for partial vs. total splenectomy.

### Hereditary spherocytosis due to an SPTA1 nonsense mutation coinherited with α spectrinin trans [^112xgrGN]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A next‐generation sequencing (NGS) panel for hereditary hemolytic anemias was analyzed. This showed the nonsense variant c.4519C > T p.(Arg1507*) in the SPTA1 gene, predicting substitution of an arginine by a premature stop codon at position 1507. The patient also carried two common variants in SPTA1 — c.6531‐12C > T and c.5572C > G p.(Leu1858Val). In addition, a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance was detected in the GSR gene, which encodes glutathione reductase: c.616A > C p.(Thr206Pro).

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) comprises a heterogeneous group of red cell membrane disorders, with an estimated prevalence of at least one in 2000 among individuals of Northern European descent. Approximately three‐quarters of cases have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, while the remainder are either sporadic de novo mutations or inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Pathogenic mutation of SPTA1 is responsible in only a minority of cases, occurring when there is homozygosity, compound heterozygosity, or coinheritance with a low expression allele in trans, such as α spectrin LELY (L ow E xpression Ly on) or α spectrin LEPRA (L ow E xpression P rague). The designation α spectrin LELY has sometimes been used to refer specifically to the c.6531‐12C > T variant but often to designate its coexistence with the c.5572C > G p.(Leu1858Val) variant in cis. This polymorphism, as observed in our patient, is common in the general population, with an allele frequency of approximately 20%–30%.

EMA binding is often used for confirmation of a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis when spherocytes are observed in the blood film of a patient with chronic hemolytic anemia. However, the observation of normal or borderline EMA binding does not exclude this diagnosis, and in this circumstance, detailed genetic analysis is indicated. It is also worth noting that this patient harbored a heterozygous variant in the GSR gene, which encodes glutathione reductase. While its pathogenicity is uncertain, impaired glutathione recycling may reduce the erythrocyte's ability to manage oxidative stress, potentially acting as a phenotype modifier in the setting of chronic hemolysis.

### Incidence of hereditary spherocytosis in a population of jaundiced neonates [^117NkLgR]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

As most of hereditary spherocytosis-affected individuals experience jaundice at birth, it seemed of interest to evaluate the proportion of hereditary spherocytosis in 402 severely jaundiced neonates with a bilirubinemia level prompting phototherapy. Red cell dehydration, a hallmark of spherocytosis whether constitutional or acquired, was demonstrated in 74 of them, among whom 23 disclosed a typical pattern of spherocytosis upon red cell deformability studies. Acquired spherocytosis of immune origin was diagnosed in 19/23 and hereditary spherocytosis in 4, making the proportion of hereditary spherocytosis-affected individuals among a severely jaundiced population of neonates amount to 1%, an incidence at least 30-fold that of the overall population.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation in a childhood hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^112hAaPZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Mutations in ANK1 were the most common cause of HS, and at least 60 mutations have been found in ANK1 in HS patients, including 7 missense mutations. Recently, mutations occurring in different regions of the ANK1 gene have been reported to cause clinical phenotypes, and the same mutated genes and sites may also show variation in clinical phenotypes. In a Canadian cohort study, the authors reported that four children with HS carried the ANK1 mutation (c.1405–9G > A), three of which were inherited (autosomal dominant) and one was a de novo mutation, but these four patients with HS also carried other mutated gene sites at the same time. In addition, the HS patients in this article had mild anemia and slightly elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin at median age of 13 years (8.6–17.6 years), whereas in the current HS case we reported, the age of onset was younger, and the case had more severe anemia and significantly elevated unconjugated bilirubin level, resulting in gallstones and biliary obstruction. Although the mutation site of the mutated genes in HS are the same, the clinical phenotypes may vary greatly and this may be related to age and race.

Since abnormal spherical red blood cells are mainly captured and destroyed in the spleen, splenectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with moderate to severe hemolytic HS. In this case, this patient also had moderate anemia persistent hyperbilirubinemia after T-tube drainage. Although symptoms of biliary obstruction had resolved, excessive hemolysis due to HS may leading to hyperbilirubinemia, so splenectomy was performed and finally achieved satisfactory efficacy. However, regular follow-up is still required to prevent possible postoperative complications and to monitor the immune function in this patient.

In this report, we identified a de novo mutation in the gene ANK1 (c.1405–9G > A) mutation in a Chinese patient. The diagnosis of HS is not clinically difficult, and once a patient with HS is diagnosed, regular follow-up management and standardized treatment are required. Genetic testing is also needed to screen for other genetic disorders that may co-exist in patients with HS who do not have a good efficacy or who have a long-term chronic onset of jaundice.

### Arteriosclerotic events are less frequent in persons with chronic anemia: evidence from families with hereditary spherocytosis [^116VbmdY]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Because anemic persons have lower cholesterol and whole blood viscosity than those who are not anemic, we hypothesized that subjects with hereditary spherocytosis who have not had the spleen removed should have fewer arteriosclerotic events than unaffected family members. We defined arteriosclerotic events as myocardial infarct, stroke, coronary artery surgery, and carotid artery surgery. We compared the rate of these events in affected-not splenectomized persons to the rate in unaffected family members. The relative risk of an arteriosclerotic event in hereditary spherocytosis patients with a spleen was one fifth that in unaffected family members. These data support the hypothesis that chronic anemia retards the development of arteriosclerosis. Spherocytosis is another example of an inherited condition that conveys an advantage in one system and a disadvantage in another.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^112G94wE]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell markers of severity of hereditary spherocytosis

As described in Table 1, the severity of HS in non-splenectomized patients was determined based on the decrease in hemoglobin concentration and increase in reticulocyte count. In our patients hemoglobin concentration correlated positively with MCHC (Figure 3A). Inverse correlations were observed between hemoglobin and RDW (Figure 3B), and between hemoglobin and reticulocyte count (Figure 3C). Furthermore, inverse correlations were observed between hemoglobin and parameters defining RBC hydration status such as intracellular K + and O hyper (Figure 3D, E).

### Is cholecystectomy really an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild hereditary spherocytosis? [^113f8NUj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Aim

The British Committee for Standards in Haematology currently recommends concomitant splenectomy in children with mild hereditary spherocytosis (HS) undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. However, splenectomy is associated with a risk of life-threatening infection, particularly in young children. The aim of this study was to audit the outcome of the practice of uncoupling splenectomy and cholecystectomy in such patients.

Methods

Children referred with symptomatic gallstones complicating HS between April 1999 and April 2009 were prospectively identified and reviewed retrospectively. During this period, the policy was to undertake concomitant splenectomy only if indicated for haematological reasons and not simply because of planned cholecystectomy.

Results

A total of 16 patients (mean age 10.4, range 3.7 to 16 years, 11 women) with HS and symptomatic gallstones underwent cholecystectomy. Three patients subsequently required a splenectomy for haematological reasons 0.8–2.5 years after cholecystectomy; all three splenectomies were performed laparoscopically. There were no postoperative complications in the 16 patients; postoperative hospital stay was 1–3 days after either cholecystectomy or splenectomy. The 13 children with a retained spleen remain under regular review by a haematologist (median follow-up 4.6, range 0.5 to 10.6 years) and are well and transfusion independent.

Conclusions

The advice to perform a concomitant splenectomy in children with mild HS undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones needs revisiting. In the era of minimal access surgery, the need for splenectomy in such children should be judged on its own merits.

### Hereditary spherocytosis [^111JJubt]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a common inherited disorder that is characterised by anaemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. It is reported worldwide and is the most common inherited anaemia in individuals of northern European ancestry. Clinical severity is variable with most patients having a well-compensated haemolytic anaemia. Some individuals are asymptomatic, whereas others have severe haemolytic anaemia requiring erythrocyte transfusion. The primary lesion in hereditary spherocytosis is loss of membrane surface area, leading to reduced deformability due to defects in the membrane proteins ankyrin, band 3, beta spectrin, alpha spectrin, or protein 4.2. Many isolated mutations have been identified in the genes encoding these membrane proteins; common hereditary spherocytosis-associated mutations have not been identified. Abnormal spherocytes are trapped and destroyed in the spleen and this is the main cause of haemolysis in this disorder. Common complications are cholelithiasis, haemolytic episodes, and aplastic crises. Splenectomy is curative but should be undertaken only after careful assessment of the risks and benefits.

### Partial splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis [^111qNy9x]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The significant risks associated with total splenectomy have led to interest in the use of partial splenectomy as an alternative surgical therapy for children who have congenital hemolytic anemia. Partial splenectomy is designed to remove enough spleen to gain desired hematologic outcomes while preserving splenic immune function. Although preliminary data demonstrate successful laboratory and clinical outcomes after partial splenectomy in various congenital hemolytic anemias, conclusive data comparing the efficacy of partial splenectomy to total splenectomy are not reported. Based on preliminary data, a definitive clinical trial of partial splenectomy in children who have severe congenital hemolytic anemia may be warranted.

### Disorders of red cell membrane [^112zkfEq]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Studies during the last three decades have enabled the development of detailed molecular insights into the structural basis of altered function in various inherited red cell membrane disorders. This review highlights our current understanding of molecular and mechanistic insights into various inherited red cell membrane disorders involving either altered membrane structural organization (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary ovalocytosis) or altered membrane transport function (hereditary stomatocytosis). The molecular basis for the vast majority of cases of hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and ovalocytosis have been fully defined while little progress has been made in defining the molecular basis for hereditary stomatocytosis. Mutations in a number of distinct genes account for hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, while a single genetic defect accounts for all cases of hereditary ovalocytosis. Based on these molecular insights, a comprehensive understanding of the structural basis for altered membrane function has been developed. Loss of vertical linkage between membrane skeleton and lipid bilayer leads to membrane loss in hereditary spherocytosis, while weakening of lateral linkages between skeletal proteins leads to membrane fragmentation and surface area loss in hereditary elliptocytosis. Importantly, the severity of anaemia in both these disorders is directly related to extent of membrane surface area loss. Splenectomy results in amelioration of anaemia.

### Hereditary spherocytosis is associated with decreased pyruvate kinase activity due to impaired structural integrity of the red blood cell membrane [^112wkue3]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is characterised by increased osmotic fragility and enhanced membrane loss of red blood cells (RBC) due to defective membrane protein complexes. In our diagnostic laboratory, we observed that pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in HS was merely slightly elevated with respect to the amount of reticulocytosis. In order to evaluate whether impaired PK activity is a feature of HS, we retrospectively analysed laboratory data sets from 172 unrelated patients with HS, hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) or PK deficiency, sickle cell or haemoglobin C disease, or β-thalassaemia minor. Results from linear regression analysis provided proof that PK activity decreases with rising reticulocyte counts in HS (R² = 0.15; slope = 9.09) and, less significantly, in HE (R² = 0.021; slope = 8.92) when compared with other haemolytic disorders (R² ≥ 0.65; slopes ≥ 78.6). Reticulocyte-adjusted erythrocyte PK activity levels were significantly lower in HS and even declined with increasing reticulocytes (R² = 0.48; slope = −9.74). In this report, we describe a novel association between HS and decreased PK activity that is apparently caused by loss of membrane-bound PK due to impaired structural integrity of the RBC membrane and may aggravate severity of haemolysis in HS.

### Challenging diagnosis of spherocytosis in early infancy [^114a1f2N]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This case report describes an infant who presented to the emergency department with rhinorrhoea and severe mucocutaneous pallor. Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anaemia with reticulocytosis and a peripheral blood smear suggestive of peripheral red blood cell (RBC) destruction, although without the presence of spherocytes. Despite the absence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, the clinical evaluation, including family history, led to the consideration of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). The diagnosis was confirmed through genetic testing, revealing a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the ANK1 gene, associated with HS. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of HS, particularly in the early infancy, and highlights the importance of genetic panels in cases of unexplained haemolytic anaemia.

### Coinheritance of hereditary spherocytosis with haemochromatosis: next-generation sequencing reveals [^115BiTkw]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We report the case of a man in his 50s with extravascular haemolysis, fluctuating indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, elevated transferrin saturation with hyperferritinaemia and normal liver enzymes. Spherocytes were detected in a blood smear and a mutation of unknown significance, c.1626+1G > Ap.?, in intron 13 of the SLC4A1 gene, was identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The same mutation was found in his daughter, who presented with similar laboratory changes, confirming the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Abdominal MRI showed hepatosplenomegaly with hepatic iron overload. In this context of haemolysis (without anaemia) and iron overload, a diagnosis of haemochromatosis was presumed. NGS confirmed the presence of the variants p.(His63Asp) and p.(Cys282Tyr) in heterozygosity in the HFE gene. We report this case for the rarity of co-existing two haematological diseases counteracting each other.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation associated to hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^113K9VQf]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this report, we described a Chinese family with a patient affected by HS. A de novo mutation (exon 25: c.2693dupC:p. A899Sfs*11) causing an amino acid change in exon 25 of ANK1 was found through next-generation sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing to verify the relationship between the ANK1 mutation and HS.

HS is an inherited disorder characterized by the presence of spherical-shaped blood cells. Approximately two-thirds of cases are autosomal dominant (AD), and the remaining cases represent autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance or de novo mutations in some sporadic cases. Cases of HS are sporadic in China. However, in some countries and continents, many HS patients have no family history.

ANK1 mutations are responsible for the majority of cases of HS. A heterozygous ANK1 IVS3–2A > C mutation that may lead to exon 4 skipping of the ANK1 gene and cause HS was recently identified in a 7-year-old girl. A patient with HS who was diagnosed clinically with only 10% spherical-shaped erythrocytes in the peripheral blood was identified to have a novel de novo ANK1 c.4276C > T (p.R1426*) nonsense mutation, while neither of his parents or his young brother carried this mutation. A 6-year-old girl who was clinically diagnosed with HS carried a de novo nonsense ANK1 mutation (c.796G > T, p. Glu266X), a single-nucleotide change from G to T, which caused a substitution from glutamic acid to a premature stop at codon 266.

### Analysis of MRI-derived spleen iron in the UK biobank identifies genetic variation linked to iron homeostasis and hemolysis [^1133AFiS]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In normal human physiology, iron is recycled much faster than new dietary iron is absorbed, and this iron economy is regulated by the spleen. The spleen plays a critical role in removing senescent erythrocytes from the blood and does so via a population of splenic macrophages as well as by the action of the protein ferroportin, which transports iron back to the plasma. Given the large iron flux through the normal spleen due to erythrocyte recycling, measurement of spleen iron has the potential to reflect activity of iron salvage pathways.

Spleen iron also may reflect erythrocyte biology and dysfunction. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS [MIM:and]) is a relatively common hemolytic anemia, occurring at a prevalence of 1:1,000–2,500 in European populations. Affected individuals have defects in membrane and cytoskeletal genes that contribute to erythrocyte membrane integrity and deformability, including SPTA1 (encoding the filamentous protein alpha-spectrin [MIM:]) and ANK1 (encoding a protein that tethers spectrin filaments to erythrocyte membranes [MIM:]). The protein products of these genes interact in the formation of the mature erythrocyte cytoskeleton, a process accompanying cellular remodeling during reticulocytosis. In HS, the resulting erythrocytes are spherically shaped and lose deformability and are ultimately trapped and ingested by macrophages within the red pulp of the spleen, resulting in an enlarged spleen and anemia despite brisk reticulocytosis. When measured directly with radiolabeled cells, erythrocyte turnover is dramatically accelerated in individuals with severe HS. While laboratory measures such as sphered cell and reticulocyte volume can diagnose HS, less is understood about the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the disease.

### Band 3, an essential red blood cell hub of activity [^1154gbew]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Another impressive feature of this manuscript is the depth of characterization of the band 3 N-terminal interactome provided by the authors. Varied proteomic approaches, including chemical crosslinking, characterized site-specific interaction interfaces between GAPDH and band 3, with additional prospective interacting proteins reported including enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis, recycling and lipid peroxidation pathways. However, dissecting the functional relevance of the band 3 interactome is beset with substantial challenges, with its own abundance, existence within at least three (and potentially many more sub-) populations each with genuine direct and additional indirect interactants, all complicating interpretation. It is unlikely and indeed in some cases impossible (where binding sites for multiple proteins overlap) that all of the proteins reported bind to all of the copies of band 3, or even every band 3-containing complex. Efforts such as this, and others to uncover not just the identity but the plasticity and relevance of such interactions under physiologically relevant conditions, be they altered oxygenation, tonicity, mechanical deformationor storage such as the work described here, are key to our evolving understanding of RBC structure-function relationships.

Finally, given the essential role band 3 plays in RBC metabolism, the manuscript also touches on the potential of band 3 polymorphisms to influence storage characteristics, using data from the REDSIII storage study. Here a note of caution needs to be applied as, besides a handful of already known polymorphisms in the band 3 N-terminus (previously shown to be associated with hereditary spherocytosis), it remains unclear what precise impact these mutations have. Any alteration in band 3 abundance has knock-on effects on RBC membrane stability which will impact on the expression of band 3-dependent and -independent proteins alike. Nevertheless, more widely, further determination of the mechanistic basis by which polymorphisms (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) can influence properties of the RBC beyond those most obviously apparent represents an important continuing endeavor.

### Novel β-spectrin mutations in hereditary spherocytosis associated with decreased levels of mRNA [^111kNMBi]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is one of the most frequent and heterogeneous inherited haemolytic anaemias. It is associated with abnormalities of several erythrocyte membrane proteins. We investigated relative mRNA quantification of red blood cell membrane protein genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in order to better characterize HS cases and to select genes to search for mutations in patients with spherocytosis. qPCR experiments indicated that the spectrin beta gene (SPTB) could be involved in anaemia pathogenesis. DNA analysis of SPTB in the HS subjects with decreased SPTB mRNA levels revealed the presence of five previously undescribed mutations: R1756X, 781delT and IVS22nt-4G > A, 1502insA and IVS20nt-2A > G.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^114juAPB]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common form of chronic hereditary hemolytic anemia in the Caucasian population, with an estimated prevalence of 1:2000–1:5000. – HS usually originates from mutations in ANK1 (ankyrin), SLC4A1 (band 3), SPTA1 (α-spectrin), SPTB (β-spectrin) or EPB42 (protein 4.2). Anemia in HS may require transfusion(s) and in severe cases splenectomy. A characteristic feature of HS is red blood cell (RBC) membrane instability, which leads to membrane loss and formation of dense cells with reduced RBC deformability. – Increased RBC density is an important feature of HSand is reflected, for example, by increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).

HS is a very heterogeneous RBC disorder, resulting from a wide range of molecular defects and characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in RBC properties and disease severity. – In fact, considerable differences in disease severity are reported even between HS patients with identical mutations. It therefore seems rea sonable to assume that the heterogeneity in disease severity is not only a reflection of particular genotypes but is also affected by other factors that control RBC properties.

Healthy RBC become increasingly dense during their lifespan, but this process is accelerated in HS. Shedding of essentially hemoglobin-free vesicles results in an increase in MCHC and a corresponding increase in RBC density and intracellular viscosity. Electrogenic potassium leakage also contributes to RBC dehydration in HS patients and is not compensated by an accumulation of Na +. As a result, the intracellular K + concentration in the RBC of HS patients is approximately 13 mmol/L lower than that in the cells of healthy subjects, which results in net ion and water loss. Compensatory activation of Na, K-ATPase in the RBC of patients is insufficient to prevent the loss of K + and dissipation of K + /Na + gradients. The function of other electroneutral ion transporters (KCC, NKCC, Na/Li exchanger) in RBC of HS patients was reported to be indistinguishable from that of cells of healthy controls.

### Clinical and hematologic features of 300 patients affected by hereditary spherocytosis grouped according to the type of the membrane protein defect [^114xKdf7]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis is a very heterogeneous form of hemolytic anemia. The aim of this study was to relate the type of molecular defect with clinical and hematologic features and response to splenectomy using information from a large database of patients.

Design and Methods

Data from 300 consecutive patients with hereditary spherocytosis, grouped according to the results of sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were analyzed and the sensitivity of red cell osmotic fragility tests was compared in various subsets of patients.

Results

Band 3 and spectrin deficiencies were the most common protein abnormalities (54% and 31%, respectively); 11% of cases were not classified by the electrophoretic analysis. Spectrin deficiency was more frequently diagnosed in childhood and band 3 deficiency in adulthood. Hemoglobin concentration was slightly lower, spherocyte number and hemolysis markers higher in spectrin deficiency than in band 3 deficiency. The sensitivity of the osmotic fragility tests ranged from 48% to 95%, and was independent of the type and amount of the membrane defect. The association of the acidified glycerol lysis test and the NaCl test on incubated blood reached a sensitivity of 99%. Splenectomy corrected the anemia in patients with all subtypes of hereditary spherocytosis although spectrin-deficient patients still showed increased reticulocyte numbers and levels of unconjugated bilirubin. Splenectomy allowed the identification of the membrane defect in all the previously unclassified patients, most of whom had spectrin and/or ankyrin deficiency.

Conclusions

The definition of the red cell membrane defect in hereditary spherocytosis has no major clinical implications, but may be useful for a differential diagnosis from other hematologic disorders that mimic this hemolytic anemia.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^111VZn8E]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We repeated the mechanical measurements for the HS derived EVs from the three patients. These EVs showed similar size (R₀ = 84 ± 5 nm, s.e.m. N = 3 patients), and they appear similarly rounded as the donor samples with H/R_c = 1.5 ± 0.1 nm (s.e.m. N = 3 patients). In about 50% of cases a membrane tether could be detected with average forces in the same range as the donor samples (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, combining the stiffness, radius and tether force measurements to estimate the bending modulus for each patient (Supplementary Fig. 6) revealed that the bending modulus of patient derived EVs is 9 ± 1 k_b T (s.e.m. N = 3 patients) (Fig. 5d). This is approximately 40% lower than EVs derived from the three healthy donors. Hence, HS patient derived EVs are significantly softened compared to healthy donor derived EVs.

### Splenectomy improves erythrocyte functionality in spherocytosis based on septin abundance, but not maturation defects [^115phE7b]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although splenectomy represents the standard therapeutical treatment for patients with hereditary spherocytosis nowadays, it is accompanied by increased risks of infections and vascular events. In consequence, partial splenectomy or laparoscopic ligation of splenic vessels are proposed as alternatives to total splenectomy in order to maintain partial splenic activity, but long-term studies to determine clinical outcomes are lacking. We reported here, upon total spleen removal, a large but not complete restoration of RBC morphology and functionality according to septin content. However, at the same time, the RBC maturation process was strongly affected, suggesting that administration of autophagy modulators could be beneficial for splenectomized patients, as described by mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition for anemia in β-thalassemia. Moreover, the absence of restoration of septin-independent parameters upon splenectomy could question its recommendation, especially for patients showing high cryohemolysis vs low osmotic fragility. Finally, septins could represent a new contributor to the pathophysiology of hereditary spherocytosis.

### A complex splicing defect associated with homozygous ankyrin-deficient hereditary spherocytosis [^113o8A1Y]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Defects in erythrocyte ankyrin are the most common cause of typical, dominant hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Detection of ankyrin gene mutations has been complicated by allelic heterogeneity, large gene size, frequent de novo mutations, and associated mRNA instability. Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC)-based mutation detection, a mutation in the splice acceptor of exon 17 was discovered in a Turkish family. Reticulocyte RNA and functional minigene splicing assays in heterologous cells revealed that this mutation was associated with a complex pattern of aberrant splicing, suggesting that removal of intron 16 is important for ordered ankyrin mRNA splicing. As predicted by clinical, laboratory, and biochemical studies, the parents were heterozygous and the proband was homozygous for this mutation. These data indicate that DHPLC offers a highly sensitive, economic, and rapid method for mutation detection and, unlike previously suggested, homozygosity for a mutation associated with dominant ankyrin-linked HS may be compatible with life.

### Vascular dysfunction in a murine model of severe hemolysis [^1153MBBh]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Spectrin is the backbone of the erythroid cytoskeleton; sph/sph mice have severe hereditary spherocytosis (HS) because of a mutation in the murine erythroid alpha-spectrin gene. sph/sph mice have a high incidence of thrombosis and infarction in multiple tissues, suggesting significant vascular dysfunction. In the current study, we provide evidence for both pulmonary and systemic vascular dysfunction in sph/sph mice. We found increased levels of soluble cell adhesion molecules in sph/sph mice, suggesting activation of the vascular endothelium. We hypothesized that plasma hemoglobin released by intravascular hemolysis initiates endothelial injury through nitric oxide (NO) scavenging and oxidative damage. Likewise, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that plasma hemoglobin is much greater in sph/sph mice. Moreover, plasma from sph/sph mice had significantly higher oxidative potential. Finally, xanthine oxidase, a potent superoxide generator, is decreased in subpopulations of liver hepatocytes and increased on liver endothelium in sph/sph mice. These results indicate that vasoregulation is abnormal, and NO-based vasoregulatory mechanisms particularly impaired, in sph/sph mice. Together, these data indicate that sph/sph mice with severe HS have increased plasma hemoglobin and NO scavenging capacity, likely contributing to aberrant vasoregulation and initiating oxidative damage.

### Intractable neonatal jaundice due to hereditary spherocytosis and Gilbert's syndrome [^113zYuYV]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

In this article the authors present a case of pathological neonatal jaundice resistant to phototherapy in a baby with a family history of Gilbert's syndrome and hereditary spherocytosis. Her presentation was ultimately explained with a diagnosis of both conditions, and required treatment with phenobarbitone. The authors discuss the mechanism by which Gilbert's syndrome results in hyperbilirubinaemia and its similarities with Crigler-Najjar syndrome. The presentation of hereditary spherocystosis in the neonatal period is also explored, as is the mechanism of exaggerated hyperbilirubinaemia when the two conditions co-exist.

Genetic diagnostic outcomes in patients who underwent NGS testing.

Distribution of genetic diagnoses, a excluding GS, among diagnosed patients (A) and distribution of presumed clinical diagnoses, b excluding GS, among diagnosed patients (B). a A genetic diagnosis was classified by the identification of (1) homozygous/hemizygous P/LP variants; or (2) two P/LP variants (without successive confirmation of the variants being on opposite chromosome [in‐trans]) for autosomal/X‐linked recessive conditions; or (3) heterozygous P/LP variants for autosomal dominant conditions. b Individuals were given a presumed clinical diagnosis of the condition if they had a genetic diagnosis in the respective genes appropriate for diagnosis, as per the genotype/phenotype correlation. AK1, adenylate kinase 1 deficiency; CDA, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia; DBA, Diamond–Blackfan anaemia; G6PD, glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; GS, Gilbert's syndrome; HE, hereditary elliptocytosis; HPP, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis; HS, hereditary spherocytosis; PK, pyruvate kinase; P/LP, pathogenic/likely pathogenic; SA, sideroblastic anaemia.

While a comprehensive assessment of the clinical utility of NGS testing was limited due to insufficient clinical data, which hindered the ability to correlate genetic findings with clinical presentations, presumed clinical diagnoses were evaluated based on known gene–disease associations (Table S1). Special consideration for inferring genotype–phenotype correlation was applied for patients with molecular findings in the SPTA1 and SPTB genes (Appendix S4).

The most common presumed clinical diagnoses were hereditary spherocytosis (51.3%), G6PD deficiency (17.1%) and pyruvate kinase deficiency (9.0%). Together, these conditions accounted for 77.4% of all presumed clinical diagnoses (Figure 1B). A presumed clinical diagnosis of GS was identified in 14.4% of those tested (see Appendix S3 for further details).

### Treatment… [^112vj6H6]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a congenital hemolytic disorder wherein a genetic mutation coding for a structural membrane protein phenotype causes the red blood cells to be sphere-shaped, rather than the normal biconcave disk shape. This abnormal shape interferes with the cells' ability to flex during blood circulation, and also makes them more prone to rupture under osmotic stress, mechanical stress, or both. Cells with the dysfunctional proteins are degraded in the spleen, which leads to a shortage of erythrocytes and results in hemolytic anemia. On a blood smear, Howell-Jolly bodies may be seen within red blood cells. Primary treatment for patients with symptomatic HS has been total splenectomy, which eliminates the hemolytic process, allowing for normal hemoglobin, reticulocyte and bilirubin levels. The resultant asplenic patient is susceptible to encapsulated bacterial infections, the risk of which can be reduced with vaccination.

If other symptoms such as abdominal pain persist, the removal of the gallbladder may be warranted for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Etiology Hereditary spherocytosis is an erythrocytic disorder of that affects the following red cell membrane proteins in a congenital fashion:

- Spectrin
- Ankyrin
- Band-3 protein
- Protein-4. 2
- Lesser proteins of significance. Hereditary spherocytosis can be an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant trait. The autosomal recessive inheritance pattern accounts for close to 25% of the clinical cases. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern accounts for over 75% of the clinical cases. Many positive individuals will not present clinically, thus the etiologic data may be artificially skewed towards the more prominent dominant forms. These dominant forms tend to leave a family history that yields generational splenectomies and black gallstones cholelithiasis. Lastly, an estimated 25% of cases are due to spontaneous mutations.

The most common presentation will demonstrate jaundice, anemia and a palpable spleen, sometimes with concomitant tenderness. It is worth noting that a subsection of HS patients will also have incidental black pigmented gallstones made of calcium bilirubinate, and some of these patients will develop cholelithiasis or the potential complex sequelae of this condition.
- **Coombs test**: Negative
- **Osmotic fragility test**: Positive.
- **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration**: Increased. This is secondary to less water being in the cell.
- **Red blood cell distribution width**: Increased. The spherocytes create variation in the size of the red blood cells on average, thus expanding the distribution.
- **Red blood cell count**: Sometimes increased early. The loss of surface area per cells cause the body to mass produce red blood cells. The spleen will filter spherocytes out and change this value.
- **Reticulocytes**: Increased. The body to mass produces red blood cells even as the spleen filters spherocytes out.

### Temporal differences in membrane loss lead to distinct reticulocyte features in hereditary spherocytosis and in immune hemolytic anemia [^1163YdRK]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

Spherocytic red cells with reduced membrane surface area are a feature of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). It is generally assumed that membrane loss in spherocytic red cells occurs during their sojourn in circulation. The structural basis for membrane loss in HS is improper assembly of membrane proteins, whereas in AIHA it is due to partial phagocytosis of circulating red cells by macrophages. A hypothesis was formed that these different mechanisms should lead to temporal differences in surface area loss during red cell genesis and during sojourn in circulation in these 2 spherocytic syndromes. It was proposed that cell surface loss could begin at the reticulocyte stage in HS, whereas surface area loss in AIHA involves only circulating mature red cells. The validity of this hypothesis was established by documenting differences in cellular features of reticulocytes in HS and AIHA. Using a novel technique to quantitate cell surface area, the decreased membrane surface area of both reticulocytes and mature red cells in HS compared with normal cells was documented. In contrast, in AIHA only mature red cells but not reticulocytes exhibited decreased membrane surface area. These data imply that surface area loss in HS, but not in AIHA, is already present at the circulating reticulocyte stage. These findings imply that loss of cell surface area is an early event during genesis of HS red cells and challenge the existing concepts that surface area loss in HS occurs predominantly during the sojourn of mature red cells in circulation.

### Compound mutations in human anion exchanger 1 are associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and hereditary spherocytosis [^117Jdt6T]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations in the human anion exchanger 1 have been associated with inherited distal renal tubular acidosis and hereditary spherocytosis. These two disorders, however, are almost always mutually exclusive. We have found an important and unusual exception: a novel combination of heterozygous E522K and G701D mutations in the anion exchanger 1 manifested as complete distal renal tubular acidosis and severe hereditary spherocytosis in an affected patient. Analysis of protein trafficking and subcellular localization of the wild-type kidney isoform of human anion exchanger 1 and these mutants transfected into MDCK cells showed they formed homodimers or heterodimers with each other. Homodimers of the wild-type and E522K mutant were found at the plasma membrane, whereas the G701D mutant largely remained in the cytoplasm. Heterodimers of either E522K or G701D and the wild-type exchanger were located in the plasma membrane, whereas E522K/G701D heterodimers remained in the cytoplasm. Our study shows that the compound E522K/G701D mutation of human anion exchanger 1 causes a trafficking defect in kidney cells, and this may explain the complete distal renal tubular acidosis of the patient.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^1142tfhb]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are widely studied regarding their role in cell-to-cell communication and disease, as well as for applications as biomarkers or drug delivery vehicles. EVs contain membrane and intraluminal proteins, affecting their structure and thereby likely their functioning. Here, we use atomic force microscopy for mechanical characterization of erythrocyte, or red blood cell (RBC), EVs from healthy individuals and from patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) due to ankyrin deficiency. While these EVs are packed with proteins, their response to indentation resembles that of fluid liposomes lacking proteins. The bending modulus of RBC EVs of healthy donors is ~15 k_b T, similar to the RBC membrane. Surprisingly, whereas RBCs become more rigid in HS, patient EVs have a significantly (~40%) lower bending modulus than donor EVs. These results shed light on the mechanism and effects of EV budding and might explain the reported increase in vesiculation of RBCs in HS patients.

### The diagnostic challenge of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia: two cases of' CDA type II' [^112fKK9r]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias (CDAs) are a group of rare hereditary disorders characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis and morphological abnormalities in the erythroblasts. Patients may present with jaundice or with symptoms of anaemia, gall stones or iron overload. The diagnosis can be challenging and cases have been confused with haemolytic anaemia, haemochromatosis or a haemoglobinopathy. A delayed diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment or delayed management of iron overload. We present two patients previously diagnosed as CDA type II in whom the diagnosis was revised to CDA type I and to hereditary spherocytosis. The conditions are compared and the approach to diagnosis is discussed.

### Congenital hemolytic anemia… [^1128Yn3S]. Wikipedia (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital hemolytic anemia is a diverse group of hereditary conditions marked by premature removal of red blood cells from circulation, often leading to severe anemia and decreased life expectancy. This may be caused by defects in the red cell's membrane proteins, internal metabolism, or by defective or deficient hemoglobin. Subtypes Hereditary spherocytosis Hereditary spherocytosis is a common hemolytic disorder distinguished by a defect or deficiency within one or more of the proteins that make up the membrane of the red blood cell. As a result of this, red blood cells have an abnormal shape, require more metabolic energy, and are trapped and destroyed prematurely in the spleen. With a prevalence of about 1 in 2000, hereditary spherocytosis, including the very mild or subclinical forms, is the most prevalent cause of non-immune hemolytic anemia in people of Northern European ancestry. However, very mild varieties of the disease are likely to be far more common.

In 75% of cases, hereditary spherocytosis is inherited as a dominant trait, with the remainder being truly recessive cases as well as de novo mutations. The hallmark of HS is chronic hemolysis. Most people have a mild condition that does not require any treatment. In extreme situations, it causes jaundice, splenomegaly, and severe anemia. Folate supplementation is advised in cases of severe and moderate HS but is not required in cases of mild HS. In severe cases, splenectomy may be advised as a therapy and may help to improve the condition. Hereditary elliptocytosis Hereditary elliptocytosis is a group of red blood cell membrane disorders characterized by elliptical erythrocytes and decreased RBC survival. Defects in the cytoskeletal proteins that keep red blood cells in their biconcave shape can cause hereditary elliptocytosis. These defects can be either in quantity or structure.

Since most patients have compensated hemolysis even in the presence of hemolysis, symptoms are generally uncommon. Patients with significant clinical hemolysis, on the other hand, may experience anemia-related symptoms. Hereditary elliptocytosis is diagnosed by identifying abnormal red blood cell morphology on a peripheral blood smear and identifying characteristic membrane biomechanical properties with osmotic gradient ektacytometry. Hereditary elliptocytosis rarely causes symptoms and requires no treatment. Splenectomy significantly improves the condition of patients with clinically significant hemolytic anemia. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide, is an inborn error of metabolism that predisposes to red blood cell breakdown. Most of the time, those who are affected have no symptoms.

Following a specific trigger, symptoms such as yellowish skin, dark urine, shortness of breath, and feeling tired may develop. Complications can include anemia and newborn jaundice. The most important measure is prevention – avoidance of the drugs and foods that cause hemolysis. Vaccination against some common pathogens may prevent infection-induced attacks. Pyruvate kinase deficiency Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder of the enzyme pyruvate kinase which affects the survival of red blood cells. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance have been observed with the disorder; classically, and more commonly, the inheritance is autosomal recessive. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is the second most common cause of enzyme-deficient hemolytic anemia, following G6PD deficiency.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of red cell membrane disorders [^111z6yPq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia, but they may require substantially different management, based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs). Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment, and demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessment in clinical and/or research laboratories. Here we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, with a clinical case that exemplifies such a workup.

### Delayed adverse vascular events after splenectomy in hereditary spherocytosis [^115Vsvwf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It is probable that the variety and frequency of delayed adverse vascular events after splenectomy are underappreciated. Splenectomy is performed for a wide variety of conditions, and delayed postsplenectomy hazards are not often studied.

Objective

To estimate the relative risk of adverse vascular events in members of hereditary spherocytosis families who have or have not had a splenectomy.

Methods

Members of families in which hereditary spherocytosis exists were systematically questioned about adverse vascular events.

Results

The cumulative incidence of arterial and venous events at age 70 years was greater in persons who had undergone a splenectomy for spherocytosis (arterial, 22% females, 32% males; venous, 20% females, 19% males) than in affected persons who did not undergo splenectomy (arterial, 3% females, 2% males; venous, 6% females, 4% males) or non-affected family members (arterial, 10% females, 17% males; venous, 4% females, 12% males). Affected subjects who undergo splenectomy are at greatly increased risk of arterial events as compared to affected subjects who do not undergo splenectomy [arterial, hazard ratio (HR) 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8–17.2; venous, HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1–9.8].

Conclusion

There is a significant, long-lasting, increased risk of adverse arterial and venous thromboembolic events after splenectomy performed for hereditary spherocytosis. A review of the literature indicates that this is also true when splenectomy is performed for several other indications.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis – 2011 update [^113vRLZK]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Guidelines on hereditary spherocytosis (HS) published in 2004 (Bolton-Maggs et al, 2004) are here replaced to reflect changes in current opinion on the surgical management, (particularly the indications for concomitant splenectomy with cholecystectomy in children with mild HS, and concomitant cholecystectomy with splenectomy in those with asymptomatic gallstones). Further potential long term hazards of splenectomy are now recognised. Advances have been made in our understanding of the biochemistry of the red cell membrane which underpins the choice of tests. Biochemical assays of membranes proteins and genetic analysis may be indicated (rarely) to diagnose atypical cases. The diagnostic value of the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test has been validated in a number of studies with understanding of its limitations.

### Delay in diagnosis of diabetes mellitus due to inaccurate use of hemoglobin A1c levels [^113bvoBr]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Testing of hemoglobin A(1C) (HbA(1C)) levels has become widespread in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus. Since the 1980s, it has proven to be an invaluable tool correlating with a patient's average blood glucose levels as well as with their disease morbidity. Clinicians often base treatment decisions and make adjustments depending on a patient's HbA(1C) level. As useful as the HbA(1C) is, it does have notable limitations. A number of conditions can lead to a falsely elevated or a falsely low HbA(1C) level. When one of these conditions is present, it is important to recognize the inaccuracy of the HbA(1C) test to prevent a delay or error in the diagnosis or care of patients with diabetes mellitus. It is also important to be aware of alternative methods of monitoring a patient's diabetes such as a fructosamine assay or home and office blood glucose measurements. Presented is the case of a patient with diabetes mellitus and hereditary spherocytosis, a condition that interfered with her HbA(1C) value and resulted in a delay in her care.

### Understanding the genetic architecture and phenotypic landscape of SPTB gene variants causing hereditary spherocytosis in an Indian cohort [^116Rx6VU]. Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common form of haemolytic anaemia caused by defects or deficiencies in genes encoding erythrocyte membrane proteins, such as ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EPB42, and SPTA1. Among these, ANK1 and SPTB mutations are the most frequent causes of HS worldwide. This study analysed 53 Indian HS patients, identifying 33 novel and 12 previously reported SPTB variants using targeted next-generation sequencing (t-NGS). The identified SPTB variants included frameshift (28%), missense (24%), nonsense (44%), and splicing (4%) types, with nonsense variants being the most common. These nonsense variants typically result in truncated proteins. The variants were widely distributed across the gene, with the highest density observed in the spectrin repeats and ankyrin-binding domain, while no variants were found in the tetramerization domain. All identified SPTB variants exhibited heterozygous inheritance, consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the gene causing HS. One patient, however, carried compound heterozygous variants, leading to severe anaemia, and five patients had de novo SPTB variants. This study expands the spectrum of SPTB variants, enhances the understanding of spectrin-related molecular defects, establishes genotype-phenotype correlations, and provides valuable insights for laboratories developing genetic tests for HS. The high number of identified variants highlights the importance of advanced technologies like NGS for accurate molecular diagnosis in HS disorder. This approach not only supports clinical diagnostics but also aids in family counseling for improved management of HS.

### Biliary obstruction in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis: a clinical review of 16 cases [^115JyFEz]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited hemolytic disease characterize by anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. The underlying defect in the spherocyte cell membrane predisposes these cells to entrapment and destruction in the spleen, leading to significantly elevated bilirubin levels in the biliary system and the formation of pigment gallstone. Consequently, complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis and biliary obstruction are clinical concerns in HS patients.

The prevalence of gallbladder stone in pediatric HS patients is reported to be 17%, with this figure raising to 41% when regular biliary ultrasound scan is initiated earlier. But most these gallstones remain asymptomatic, as evidence indicated that symptomatic cases requiring cholecystectomy mainly involve cholesterol stones. Most HS pediatric cases with biliary stone are diagnosed before the age of 13. Acute biliary obstruction associated with gallstone in HS is a severe but rarely reported manifestation that sometimes be fatal. Despite its clinical significance, there is limited consensus on the optimal management strategies, particularly regarding surgical interventions.

The aim of this study is to review the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of acute biliary obstruction in pediatric HS patients, with the goal of narrowing the existing knowledge gap and providing evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.
