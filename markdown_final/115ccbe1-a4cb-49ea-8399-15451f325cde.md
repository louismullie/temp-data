## Question

What are the key factors to consider when deciding between open surgical repair and endovascular repair for an abdominal aortic aneurysm?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key factors to consider when deciding between open surgical repair (OSR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and urgency. Then, I should verify rupture risk and anatomic suitability. Next, I will assess patient-specific risk and life expectancy. After that, I need to compare perioperative versus long-term outcomes. Then, I should integrate patient preferences and shared decision-making. Finally, I will consider center and operator factors, special populations, and synthesize a practical decision framework with explicit thresholds and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and urgency because that dictates the initial branch in decision-making. If the patient presents with suspected rupture or is hemodynamically unstable, I should not delay definitive management; an endovascular-first strategy is generally preferred if anatomy is suitable, with a rapid 30–30–30 minute door-to-intervention framework, while open repair remains appropriate when EVAR is not feasible or when local expertise favors OSR in rupture protocols [^112mirmL] [^112WPFGR]. Hold on, I should verify that randomized data for rupture do not show a clear 30-day mortality advantage; indeed, IMPROVE and pooled analyses show similar early mortality but faster recovery and better early quality-of-life outcomes with an endovascular strategy, reinforcing the preference for EVAR when anatomically feasible rather than asserting unequivocal survival superiority [^113VMm5f] [^111W1XNj] [^1122TcKN].

> Next, I should review rupture risk and anatomic suitability for EVAR because these are foundational. For elective cases, repair is generally indicated at 5.5 cm in average-risk men, with consideration of a lower threshold around 5.0 cm in women given higher rupture risk at a given diameter, and rapid expansion or symptoms lower the threshold further; I need to ensure I am aligning with contemporary guidance on sex-specific risk and thresholds [^113UGTNb] [^111GdTbt] [^113FbPA8]. Wait, let me verify the anatomic requirements for standard EVAR: adequate proximal neck length, acceptable neck angulation, and suitable iliac access are critical; if these are unfavorable, fenestrated or branched EVAR or OSR should be considered, and I should double-check that the center has the capability for complex endovascular options before committing to a plan [^111qZR7v] [^116DP3uQ] [^112ixSWd].

> I will now examine patient-specific risk and life expectancy, since this is the pivot for long-term benefit. For patients with limited life expectancy under about 3 years, elective repair may not be recommended; for those with 3 to 15 years, EVAR is often favored if anatomy allows; and for those with more than 10 to 15 years of expected survival, open repair may confer better long-term outcomes despite higher early risk, so I should confirm life expectancy using validated tools and integrate comorbidity burden and frailty into this estimate [^112DQgub] [^11427tsZ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that risk stratification studies support this gradient, and recent cohort data suggest open repair associates with better long-term survival in low-risk patients, whereas EVAR may be advantageous in moderate-to-high risk patients, which reinforces tailoring to risk phenotype [^11576JWe].

> Now I need to compare perioperative versus long-term outcomes carefully. EVAR consistently reduces 30-day mortality to roughly 1–2% versus 4–5% with open repair in randomized and observational datasets, with shorter length of stay and fewer cardiopulmonary complications, which is attractive for older or comorbid patients [^113faJ9K] [^112zKALm] [^116KRxUs]. But wait, I should verify the long-term trade-offs; beyond 4–8 years, EVAR shows higher rates of secondary interventions, late rupture, and aneurysm-related mortality, whereas open repair demonstrates superior durability without the need for lifelong surveillance, so the early benefit of EVAR attenuates over time [^11697veY] [^114qictb] [^113LDNiz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought EVAR might maintain a long-term survival advantage, but the OVER trial and subsequent meta-analyses show survival equivalence with a hazard pattern that can favor open repair late, so I should correct that assumption and present the time-varying hazard transparently [^1163gvsT] [^1117GLhz] [^114evJjR].

> Next, I should review patient preferences and engage in shared decision-making because values often determine the optimal choice when outcomes are equipoise over the long term. Many patients prioritize shorter recovery and less invasive procedures and thus prefer EVAR, whereas others prioritize long-term durability and wish to avoid lifelong surveillance, favoring open repair. Decision aids improve alignment between preferences and the procedure received, and I need to ensure the conversation covers early benefits, late risks, and surveillance obligations [^116bbGoL] [^1157cKMp] [^111rKdcJ]. Hold on, I should verify that qualitative work supports these themes. Indeed, short-term concerns dominate preference for many, while younger patients weigh long-term outcomes more heavily, which should shape counseling and timing of decision-making [^1159VwGE] [^113q8Skq].

> I need to ensure center and operator factors are not overlooked, as outcomes are volume- and experience-dependent. Elective EVAR should be performed in centers with at least 10 EVARs per year and documented mortality and conversion rates of 2% or less, and elective open repair should be limited to centers with at least 10 open aortic operations per year and mortality 5% or less; broader guidance also recommends high-volume aortic centers for complex disease, and I should confirm local capabilities before recommending a modality [^116wLzj6] [^112MiHw5] [^115NVmM9]. Let me reconsider the implication: if the local center lacks robust open experience, pushing a patient toward OSR may be unsafe, and similarly, limited EVAR expertise undermines the early mortality advantage of endovascular repair [^115SYmH6].

> I will now examine special populations where thresholds or strategies differ. In women, I should consider earlier repair around 5.0 cm due to higher rupture risk and recognize that female anatomy is less often suitable for standard EVAR, contributing to higher operative mortality and under-treatment; this mandates careful anatomic assessment and a low threshold to discuss complex endovascular or open options [^111GdTbt] [^117FqKXr]. For very elderly or frail patients, EVAR's lower perioperative risk is compelling, but I should confirm candidacy for lifelong surveillance because nonadherence increases late rupture risk; conversely, in patients under about 65 with long life expectancy, open repair may yield superior long-term survival despite higher early morbidity, so I should not reflexively default to EVAR in this group [^112DQgub] [^11427tsZ] [^1161Msdn]. But wait, what if the patient has connective tissue disorders or a thoracoabdominal aneurysm? In those settings, open repair is generally preferred given durability concerns and the complexity of endovascular reconstruction, so I should verify the full aortic morphology and genetic context before proposing EVAR [^114pRxf5].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check each branch against the evidence. If ruptured or unstable, proceed with an endovascular-first strategy if feasible, with rapid protocolized care and contingency for open repair; if elective, first confirm size and anatomic suitability for EVAR, then stratify by perioperative risk and life expectancy, and finally align with patient preferences. High-risk patients with limited life expectancy often benefit from EVAR's early advantage, average-risk patients should undergo shared decision-making given late hazard equivalence, and low-risk patients with long life expectancy may realize better long-term outcomes with open repair; throughout, ensure the chosen center meets volume and outcomes benchmarks and that the patient understands surveillance requirements after EVAR [^112mirmL] [^114kyDGw] [^112DQgub] [^116wLzj6]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with major guidelines; ACC/AHA explicitly endorses shared decision-making for anatomically suitable patients, and ESVS emphasizes life expectancy as a primary determinant, which supports this structured approach [^114kyDGw] [^112DQgub].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses surveillance and durability. After EVAR, lifelong imaging follow-up is mandatory to detect endoleaks, migration, or sac expansion, with CT angiography or duplex ultrasound protocols individualized by risk. Nonadherence is common and increases late rupture risk, so I should build a surveillance plan the patient can realistically follow and counsel on signs of complications [^112u1npq] [^1179P9z8]. If a type I or III endoleak occurs, or a type II endoleak with sac expansion, prompt intervention is indicated; if endovascular measures fail, conversion to open repair should be considered, and I should confirm that the center has a clear endoleak management pathway [^112nwRzs] [^114Aa9UZ].

The choice between open and endovascular AAA repair hinges on **anatomy, patient risk, and long-term goals**. EVAR offers **lower perioperative risk** and faster recovery [^113faJ9K] but requires lifelong surveillance and has higher reintervention rates [^11697veY] [^112u1npq]; open repair has higher early morbidity [^116KRxUs] yet provides **greater durability** with less late rupture risk [^113LDNiz] [^1117GLhz]. For ruptured AAA, an **endovascular-first strategy** is recommended when feasible [^112mirmL] [^113VMm5f]. Shared decision-making is essential [^114kyDGw] to align repair choice with patient preferences, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^1179P9z8] [^1157cKMp].

## Anatomical considerations

- **Neck morphology**: Adequate proximal neck length (> 15 mm), diameter (< 32 mm), and minimal angulation (< 60°) are critical for EVAR [^116JSj41]. Short, wide, or angulated necks favor open repair [^notfound].

- **Iliac access**: Severe iliac calcification, tortuosity, or small caliber (< 6 mm) complicate EVAR and may necessitate open repair [^112i3R5G].

- **Aneurysm extent**: Juxtarenal, suprarenal, or thoracoabdominal aneurysms often require open repair or complex endovascular techniques (fenestrated/branched EVAR) [^116DP3uQ].

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Age and comorbidities**: Older patients or those with significant cardiopulmonary disease benefit from EVAR's lower perioperative risk [^115GTzxc] [^113faJ9K].

- **Life expectancy**: Younger patients with long life expectancy may benefit from open repair's superior long-term durability [^11427tsZ] [^1117JitC].

- **Patient preference**: Many patients prefer EVAR for its minimally invasive nature and faster recovery, but shared decision-making is essential [^114kyDGw] [^1157cKMp].

---

## Clinical outcomes

| **Outcome** | **Evar** | **Open repair** |
|-|-|-|
| Perioperative mortality | Lower (1–2%) [^113faJ9K] [^112zKALm] | Higher (4–5%) [^113faJ9K] [^112zKALm] |
| Long-term survival | Similar after 4 years [^114qictb] [^1163gvsT] | Similar after 4 years [^114qictb] [^1163gvsT] |
| Reintervention rate | Higher (15–20%) [^notfound] | Lower (5–10%) [^notfound] |
| Late rupture risk | Higher [^113LDNiz] [^113hBsFb] | Lower [^113LDNiz] [^113hBsFb] |
| Length of stay | Shorter (2–3 days) [^116KRxUs] | Longer (7–10 days) [^116KRxUs] |

---

## Special considerations

Women have higher rupture risk at smaller diameters and may require **lower intervention thresholds** [^111GdTbt]; EVAR suitability is also lower due to anatomical factors [^117FqKXr]. For ruptured AAA, an **endovascular-first strategy** is recommended when feasible, with lower perioperative mortality and faster recovery [^112mirmL] [^113VMm5f].

---

## Current guidelines

- **Shared decision-making**: Recommended for patients with suitable anatomy for either approach [^114kyDGw] [^1139ooSz].

- **High-risk patients**: EVAR is preferred to reduce perioperative complications [^113USRb9] [^111LAswd].

- **Low-risk patients**: Open repair may be favored for its long-term durability [^11427tsZ] [^11576JWe].

---

## Conclusion

EVAR is preferred for patients with suitable anatomy, older age, or significant comorbidities, emphasizing lower perioperative risk and faster recovery [^113USRb9]. Open repair is favored for younger patients with long life expectancy, complex anatomy, or when EVAR is unsuitable, emphasizing **durability** and lower late complications [^113LDNiz]. Shared decision-making remains critical to align treatment with patient preferences and clinical context [^114kyDGw].

### Effect of age on survival between open repair and surveillance for small abdominal aortic aneurysms [^113gFVcS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials have shown no significant difference in survival between immediate open repair and surveillance with selective repair for asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms of 4.0 to 5.5 cm in diameter. This lack of difference has been shown to hold true for all diameters in this range, in men and women, but the question of whether patients of different ages might obtain different benefits has remained unanswered. Using the pooled patient-level data for the 2,226 patients randomized to immediate open repair or surveillance in the United Kingdom Small Aneurysm Trial (UKSAT; September 1, 1991, to July 31, 1998; follow-up 2.6 to 6.9 years) or the Aneurysm Detection and Management (ADAM) trial (August 1, 1992, to July 31, 2000; follow-up 3.5 to 8.0 years), the adjusted effect of age on survival in the 2 treatment groups was estimated using a generalized propensity approach, accounting for a comprehensive array of clinical and nonclinical risk factors. No significant difference in survival between immediate open repair and surveillance was observed for patients of any age, overall (p = 0.606) or in men (p = 0.371) or women separately (p = 0.167). In conclusion, survival did not differ significantly between immediate open repair and surveillance for patients of any age, overall or in men or women. Combined with the previous evidence regarding diameter, and the lack of benefit of immediate endovascular in trials comparing it with surveillance repair for small abdominal aortic aneurysms, these results suggest that surveillance should be the first-line management strategy of choice for asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms of 4.0 to 5.5 cm.

### Patient preference for surgical method of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: postal survey [^112ZbYT7]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether men with small abdominal aortic aneurysm have a preference between either endovascular or open aneurysm repair for future treatment.

Design

Prospective study of self-declared treatment preference following receipt of a validated patient information pack.

Participants

Men aged 65–84 years (n = 237) with asymptomatic aneurysm (4.0–5.4 cm) detected by population-based screening.

Methods

An unbiased, validated patient information pack and questionnaire were developed to conduct a postal survey.

Results

One hundred sixty seven participants (70%) returned a completed questionnaire; 24 (10%) did not respond at all. Initially, only 38 (23%) declared a treatment preference. After reading the information pack, 130 participants (80%) declared a treatment preference: 30 preferred open repair (18%), 77 endovascular repair (46%), 23 were happy with either option (14%) and only 34 remained without any preference (20%). Nearly all (92%) thought that the information pack had prepared them well for future discussions with clinicians and with no single feature identified as influencing the preference-making process, 66 respondents (40%) still opted to 'take the advice of the doctor'.

Conclusion

The patient information pack facilitated the development of treatment preferences with endovascular repair being preferred to open repair. Nevertheless for patient-centred care, vascular centres must continue to safely provide both open and endovascular repair.

Regarding medical management for abdominal aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to shared decision-making, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend to ensure shared decision-making when determining the appropriate thresholds for intervention, deciding on the type of surgical repair, choosing between open surgical versus endovascular approaches, and in medical management and surveillance in patients with aortic disease.

### Editor's choice-assessment of international outcomes of intact abdominal aortic aneurysm repair over 9 years [^117EfKo3]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Case mix and outcomes of complex surgical procedures vary over time and between regions. This study analyses peri-operative mortality after intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in 11 countries over 9 years.

Methods

Data on primary AAA repair from vascular surgery registries in 11 countries for the years 2005–2009 and 2010–2013 were analysed. Multivariate adjusted logistic regression analyses were carried out to adjust for variations in case mix.

Results

A total of 83,253 patients were included. Over the two periods, the proportion of patients ≥ 80 years old increased (18.5% vs. 23.1%; p < .0001) as did the proportion of endovascular repair (EVAR) (44.3% vs. 60.6; p < .0001). In the latter period, 25.8% of AAAs were less than 5.5 cm. The mean annual volume of open repairs per centre decreased from 12.9 to 10.6 between the two periods (p < .0001), and it increased for EVAR from 10.0 to 17.1 (p < .0001). Overall, peri-operative mortality fell from 3.0% to 2.4% (p < .0001). Mortality for EVAR decreased from 1.5% to 1.1% (p < .0001), but the outcome worsened for open repair from 3.9% to 4.4% (p = .008). The peri-operative risk was greater for octogenarians (overall, 3.6% vs. 2.1%, p < .0001; open, 9.5% vs. 3.6%, p < .0001; EVAR, 1.8% vs. 0.7%, p < .0001), and women (overall, 3.8% vs. 2.2%, p < .0001; open, 6.0% vs. 4.0%, p < .0001; EVAR, 1.9% vs. 0.9%, p < .0001). Peri-operative mortality after repair of AAAs < 5.5 cm was 4.4% with open repair and 1.0% with EVAR, p < .0001.

Conclusions

In this large international cohort, total peri-operative mortality continues to fall for the treatment of intact AAAs. The number of EVAR procedures now exceeds open procedures. Mortality after EVAR has decreased, but mortality for open operations has increased. The peri-operative mortality for small AAA treatment, particularly open surgical repair, is still considerable and should be weighed against the risk of rupture.

### Endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms [^113hBsFb]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been the subject of rigorous scientific scrutiny. Prevalence studies have directed the formation of screening programmes, and observational studies and randomised controlled trials have defined aneurysm growth and treatment thresholds. Pre-emptive intervention with traditional open surgical repair has been the bedrock of improving long-term outcome and survival in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms but it is associated with a significant procedural morbidity and mortality. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has substantially reduced these early complications and has been associated with promising results in both elective and emergency aneurysm repair. However, the technique has brought its own unique complications, endoleaks. An endoleak is the presence of blood flow within the aneurysm sac but outside the EVAR graft. Although in randomised control trials EVAR was associated with a reduced early mortality compared with open repair, its longer-term morbidity and mortality was higher because endoleak development is associated with a higher risk of rupture. These endoleak complications have necessitated the development of postoperative imaging surveillance and re-intervention. These contrasting benefits and risks inform the selection of the mode of repair and are heavily influenced by individual patient factors. An improved strategy to predict endoleak development could further help direct treatment choice for patients and improve both early and late outcomes. This article reviews current EVAR practice, recent updates in clinical practice guidelines and the potential future developments to facilitate the selection of mode of aneurysm repair. Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04577716.

Regarding medical management for abdominal aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to setting of care, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider referring asymptomatic patients with extensive aortic disease, patients likely to benefit from complex open and endovascular aortic repairs, and patients with multiple comorbidities eligible for an intervention to a high-volume center (performing at least 30–40 aortic procedures annually) with experienced surgeons in a multidisciplinary aortic team to optimize treatment outcomes.

### Design of the PReferences for open versus endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (PROVE-AAA) trial [^113bCPw3]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

For patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), randomized trials have found endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality than open surgical repair (OSR). However, OSR has fewer long-term aneurysm-related complications, such as endoleak or late rupture. Patients treated with EVAR and OSR have similar survival rates within two years after surgery, and OSR does not require intensive surveillance. Few have examined if patient preferences are aligned with the type of treatment they receive for their AAA. Although many assume that patients may universally prefer the less-invasive nature of EVAR, our preliminary work suggests that patients who value the lower risk of late complications may prefer OSR. In this study, called The PReferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (PROVE-AAA) trial, we describe a cluster-randomized trial to test if a decision aid can better align patients' preferences and their treatment type for AAA. Patients enrolled in the study are candidates for either endovascular or open repair and are followed up at VA hospitals by vascular surgery teams who regularly perform both types of repair. In Aim 1, we will determine patients' preferences for endovascular or open repair and identify domains associated with each repair type. In Aim 2, we will assess alignment between patients' preferences and the repair type elected and then compare the impact of a decision aid on this alignment between the intervention and control groups. This study will help us to accomplish two goals. First, we will better understand the factors that affect patient preference when choosing between EVAR and OSR. Second, we will better understand if a decision aid can help patients be more likely to receive the treatment strategy they prefer for their AAA. Study enrollment began on June 1, 2017. Between June 1, 2017 and November 1, 2018, we have enrolled 178 of a total goal of 240 veterans from 20 VA medical centers and their vascular surgery teams across the country. We anticipate completing enrollment in PROVE-AAA in June 2019, and study analyses will be performed thereafter.

### Endovascular strategy or open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: one-year outcomes from the IMPROVE randomized trial [^113VMm5f]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Following repair of a ruptured AAA, it has been proposed that follow-up, to 90 days and beyond is necessary for patient and clinical decision-making. After 1 year, this trial has shown no significant survival benefit at any time-point for an endovascular strategy (using a standard EVAR device whenever anatomically and operationally possible, with open repair as a default option) vs. open repair. In contrast, there were gains for the endovascular strategy vs. the open repair group with respect to patient-preferred outcomes: faster discharge, more often to home, and QoL and overall the endovascular strategy was cost-effective.

Shock with systemic organ damage, rather than type of repair might result in the very high early mortality after ruptured AAA repair and many patients have prolonged hospital stays. There are other potential reasons why there was no difference in survival between the randomized groups. First, the operative mortality from open repair was lower than anticipated. Second, we now know that aortic anatomy, particularly aneurysm neck length, has an important influence on mortality and that those patients who are not candidates for standard EVAR (∼40%) have the highest operative mortality, particularly for open repair, and that those anatomically suitable for EVAR have much lower mortality after either EVAR or open repair. The trial was designed to be inclusive and consider whether the availability of an endovascular service would improve the outcome of all patients with rupture, not just those anatomically suitable for EVAR. So inevitably the endovascular strategy group included a significant proportion of patients who had to be treated with open repair. Therefore, the findings suggesting faster recovery in the endovascular strategy group are notable: shorter overall hospital stay, a greater propensity to be discharged to home, and better early QoL than the open repair group. The between-group mean differences in QoL, 0.087 (3 months) and 0.068 (1 year), exceed the minimum clinically important difference of 0.03, although at 1 year, the mean difference was not statistically significant. The absolute EQ-5 utility scores of the endovascular strategy group at 3 and 12 months (0.76 and 0.78) seemed slightly higher than those undergoing elective EVAR in the EVAR-1 trial (0.71 and 0.74, respectively), whereas the absolute scores of the open repair group (0.69 and 0.74) were similar to those undergoing elective open repair (0.67 and 0.75). In addition, in this trial, there was no evidence of a difference in re-interventions (including those for endoleaks) at any time during the first year after rupture and the risk of re-intervention for endoleak seems lower than the 10–23% range suggested in previous reports: the cost-effectiveness estimates remained robust to sensitivity analyses allowing for additional interventions. This is in contrast to the findings for elective repair, where in the first year AAA-related re-interventions were more common after EVAR and EVAR cost significantly more than open repair.

### Morphological suitability for endovascular repair, non-intervention rates, and operative mortality in women and men assessed for intact abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: systematic reviews with meta-analysis [^111GdTbt]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Treatment guidelines recommend that an abdominal aortic aneurysm in men should be considered for elective repair once the aneurysm has reached a diameter of 5·5 cm, based on randomised trials that compared early elective repair with surveillance; these trials included only a small proportion of women. The decision to offer repair is made when the probable risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair. Since the rate of rupture of small abdominal aortic aneurysm is four times higher in women than men at the same diameter, women are often considered for repair at diameters smaller than 5·5 cm. Several studies, have suggested that the prognosis of individuals with abdominal aortic aneurysm is worse for women than men, with the operative mortality following repair of intact aneurysm being higher in women than men.

To determine whether women, compared with men, are being offered adequate management of their intact aneurysms once they have reached the aneurysm diameter threshold for intervention, three pieces of crucial information are required: the proportion of each sex morphologically suitable for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR; often preferred to open repair because it is minimally invasive and has a lower operative mortality), the proportion of each sex not offered repair (for which the suitability for EVAR might be influential), and the 30-day mortality after elective aneurysm repair, either EVAR or open repair.

### Long-term outcomes of open versus endovascular treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm: systematic review and meta-analysis with reconstructed time-to-event data [^114evJjR]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The advent of endovascular techniques has revolutionized the care of patients with uncomplicated abdominal aortic aneurysms. This analysis compares the overall survival and the freedom from reintervention rate between open surgical repair (OSR) and endovascular repair (EVAR) in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies including patients who underwent either OSR or EVAR for uncomplicated AAA. All randomized controlled trials and propensity-score-matched cohort studies reporting on the outcomes of interest were considered eligible for inclusion. The systematic search of the literature was performed by 2 independent investigators in accordance with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. We conducted 1-stage and 2-stage meta-analyses with Kaplan-Meier-derived time-to-event data and meta-analysis with a random-effects model.

Results

Thirteen studies met our eligibility criteria, incorporating 13409 and 13450 patients in the OSR and EVAR arms, respectively. Patients who underwent open repair had improved overall survival rates compared with those who underwent EVAR (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88–0.98, p = 0.004) during a mean follow-up of 53.8 (SD = 29.8) months and this was validated by the 2-stage meta-analysis (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.8–0.99, p = 0.03, I² = 62.25%). Splitting timepoint analysis suggested that EVAR offers better survival outcome compared with OSR in the first 11 months following elective intervention (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.22–1.54, p < 0.0001), while OSR offers a significant survival advantage after the 11-month timepoint and up to 180 months (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.8–0.89, p < 0.0001). Similarly, freedom from reintervention was found to be significantly better in EVAR patients (HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.14–1.44, p < 0.0001) within the first 30 days. After the first month postrepair, however, OSR demonstrated higher freedom-from-reintervention rates compared with EVAR that remained significant for up to 168 months during follow-up (HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.66–0.79, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Despite the first-year survival advantage of EVAR in patients undergoing elective AAA repair, OSR was associated with a late survival benefit and decreased risk for reintervention in long-term follow-up.

Clinical Impact

Open surgical repair for uncomplicated abdominal aortic aneurysm offers better long-term outcomes in terms of survival and freedom from reintervention rate compared to the endovascular approach but in the first year it carries a higher risk of mortality. The novelty of our study lies that instead of comparing study-level effect estimates, we analyzed reconstructed individual patient-level data. This offered us the opportunity to perform our analyses with mathematically robust and flexible survival models, which was proved to be crucial since there was evidence of different hazard over time. Our findings underline the need for additional investigation to clarify the significance of open surgical repair when compared to the latest endovascular devices and techniques within the evolving era of minimally invasive procedures.

### Effect of a decision aid on agreement between patient preferences and repair type for abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^1157cKMp]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Preferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Study Team Data Sharing Statement AAA indicates abdominal aortic aneurysm; EVAR, endovascular repair; OSR, open surgical repair. EVAR indicates endovascular repair. Question Can a decision aid help patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm choose between open repair and endovascular repair. Meaning Decision aids can help better align patient preferences and cardiovascular treatments. Importance Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm can choose open repair or endovascular repair. While EVAR is less invasive, it requires lifelong surveillance and more frequent aneurysm-related reinterventions than open repair. A decision aid may help patients receive their preferred type of AAA repair. Objective To determine the effect of a decision aid on agreement between patient preference for AAA repair type and the repair type they receive.

Design, Setting, and Participants In this cluster randomized trial, 235 patients were randomized at 22 VA vascular surgery clinics. All patients had AAAs greater than 5. 0 cm in diameter and were candidates for both open repair and EVAR. Data were collected from August 2017 to December 2020, and data were analyzed from December 2020 to June 2021. Patients were similar between the decision aid and control groups by age, sex, aneurysm size, iliac artery involvement, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Patients preferred EVAR over open repair in both groups. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03115346 Randomized trials and observational studies have shown that endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair offers lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair.

1–5 However, with this benefit comes trade-offs, as the risk of reintervention and late aneurysm-related death is higher with EVAR than open repair. 6–8 This trade-off makes it difficult to find which AAA repair type is best for each individual patient. 7, 9 Helping patients make the best decision for aortic aneurysm repair has been challenging, as patients often have little knowledge about the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
9. The multicenter cluster randomized Preference for Open Versus Endovascular repair of AAA study has been previously described. 9, 23 The trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1. In this clinic-based study, 22 VA medical centers that offered both open repair and EVAR enrolled patients who were considering AAA repair; 22 sites, each site being a cluster, were randomly assigned to either the decision aid arm or the control group arm in a 1: 1 fashion.

Patients with AAA were required to meet 2 enrollment criteria to be eligible for the study. Patients had to have an AAA measuring at least 5. 0 cm in diameter and be deemed candidates for both open repair and EVAR, based on review of the patient's medical record and cross-sectional imaging for anatomic assessment by the enrolling surgeon. The threshold for repair suggested in the Society for Vascular Surgery's guideline statement in 2021 was 5. 5 cm in diameter for men and
5. 0 cm for women; as such, we enrolled male patients when the AAA reached 5. 0 cm to allow time for discussion and risk assessment. Female patients were enrolled at this similar size threshold for simplicity in our protocol. 24 Patients could be candidates for fenestrated or advanced EVAR in addition to infrarenal EVAR. In both the decision aid and control group, the study coordinator obtained consent before the patient was seen by the surgeon.

### Endovascular vs open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair… [^112X2MfF]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Hypothesis Adverse cardiac event rates following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair are similar. We also hypothesized that the Eagle criteria are useful predictors of cardiac events in patients undergoing EAAA repair. Conclusions Patients undergoing OAAA and EAAA repair had similar cardiac event rates and mortality. In patients undergoing EAAA repair, history of congestive heart failure and Q wave on electrocardiogram were predictors of cardiac events. SINCE THE FIRST report by Parodi et al, 1 interest in endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has grown markedly. Multiple series have demonstrated the short-term effectiveness of EAAA repair.

2–7 However, few data are available regarding the cardiac morbidity and mortality of EAAA repair as compared with standard open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The Eagle criteria have been shown to be predictive of adverse cardiac events following elective vascular surgery. 8–10 However, the utility of these criteria for predicting adverse cardiac events in patients undergoing EAAA repair has not been investigated. The most frequent Eagle criterion was age older than 70 years, followed by Q wave on ECG, angina, diabetes, history of CHF, and ventricular ectopy requiring therapy. A comparison of clinical risk factors for patients undergoing EAAA and OAAA repair is listed in Table 1.

Patients undergoing EAAA repair were significantly older than those undergoing OAAA repair, and were more likely to be older than 70 years. There was otherwise no difference in the Eagle risk factors. Within the EAAA group, 60 had aortic aneurysms alone and 23 had aortic and iliac aneurysms. All EAAA repairs were performed with a bifurcated modular endovascular prosthesis using general anesthesia in 79 patients, local in 3 patients, and epidural in 1 patient. The average length of hospital stay was 5. 7 days. Thus, one would anticipate a lower cardiac morbidity and mortality rate for EAAA repair. This expected reduction in cardiac morbidity was not noted in our study. This may be the result of a combination of factors. The EAAA repairs in our study were performed under general anesthesia, which itself is a major cardiac stress.

Second, as mentioned earlier, patients undergoing EAAA repair may have had a greater cardiac risk than what was reflected by the Eagle criteria. We have since begun to selectively use local anesthesia for our high-risk patients undergoing EAAA repair. Whether this change in anesthetic approach will affect the cardiac event rate remains to be seen. The Eagle criteria have previously been demonstrated to be useful predictors of adverse cardiac events for patients undergoing major vascular surgery. 8–10 Eagle et al10 reported a 3% adverse cardiac event rate in patients with no clinical criteria, a 15% event rate for those with 1 or 2 criteria, and a 50% event rate for those with 3 or more criteria. Our 2 previous studies of patients undergoing elective major vascular surgery confirmed the value of the Eagle criteria. 8, 9 We reported no cardiac morbidity or mortality for patients without a single criterion and a 7% cardiac event rate with 1 or more criteria.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1177pWpo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm management thresholds and evidence — Some controversy exists regarding treatment strategies for patients who present with an AAA between 4.0 and 5.4 cm, and in UKSAT and ADAM the 30-day operative mortality in the immediate surgery groups (5.5% UKSAT, 2.1% ADAM) led to an early disadvantage in survival with no statistically significant difference in long-term survival between the immediate OSR and surveillance groups. Currently, nearly 80% of all AAAs are treated by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in the United States. The CAESAR and PIVOTAL trials compared immediate EVAR with surveillance for AAAs between 4.1 and 5.4 cm and 4.0 and 5.0 cm and found no survival benefit for early EVAR, and a Cochrane database review demonstrated no advantage to immediate repair by open surgery or EVAR for small AAAs (4.0–5.5 cm). Patients with an asymptomatic fusiform AAA > 5.4 cm should be considered for repair and surveillance is recommended for smaller aneurysms, with an individualized approach for patients with an AAA > 5.4 cm who are of advanced age or have significant comorbid conditions, while young, healthy patients, particularly women, with an AAA between 5.0 and 5.4 cm or those with rapid expansion of small fusiform AAAs may benefit from early repair.

### Morbidity of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is directly related to diameter [^115U2TA9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous randomized controlled trials have defined specific size thresholds to guide surgical decision-making in patients presenting with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). With recent advances in endovascular techniques, the anatomic considerations of AAA repair are rapidly changing. Our specific aims were to evaluate the most recent national population data to compare anatomic differences and perioperative outcomes in patients with AAA.

Methods

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried from 2011 to 2015 using the targeted vascular public use file. Patients with AAA undergoing elective open or endovascular repair were included. Risk factors and outcomes were stratified by size and divided into quartiles for categorical comparison. A logistic regression model was used to compare the impact of size on morbidity and mortality with each technique. A risk adjustment model used all preoperative criteria to generate observed and expected values for open and endovascular repair.

Results

There were 10,026 patients who underwent elective AAA repair, 8182 (81.6%) endovascular and 1844 (18.4%) open. Repairs were divided into density quartiles for a logistic analysis: smallest quartile, 3.5 to 5 cm; second quartile, 5.01 to 5.5 cm; third quartile, 5.51 to 6.2 cm; and largest quartile, > 6.2 cm. Patients with larger aneurysms (> 6.2 cm) were more likely to be male, to have a dependent functional status, and to have increased blood urea nitrogen concentration and American Society of Anesthesiologists score (P < .05). Larger aneurysms had longer operative time (162 vs 135 minutes) and greater extension toward the renal and iliac vessels (all P < .05). Risk adjustment revealed an observed/expected morbidity plot that favored endovascular repair throughout the size range but confirmed lack of size effect within the open repair category. The adjusted increase in morbidity with endovascular repair is 9.7% per centimeter increase in size of AAA. These trends remained true with an infrarenal subgroup analysis.

Conclusions

Patients with a larger AAA have comorbidities and anatomic factors associated with a more difficult repair. The higher morbidity seen with larger aneurysms represents both anatomic and patient factors but seems to have a greater impact on endovascular repairs. However, endovascular repair still results in fewer near-term complications than open repair across all size strata.

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open repair outcomes — Pooled data from 7 RCTs evaluating infrarenal AAA repair show perioperative mortality is much lower with EVAR (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.2–0.66), and this advantage persists at 6 months after which survival becomes equivalent. However, after 8 years, EVAR is associated with higher aneurysm-related death (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.6–16.4), secondary intervention (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7–2.7), aneurysm rupture (OR, 5; 95% CI, 1.1–23.3), and death attributable to rupture (OR 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9–6.8) compared with open repair.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the early and late outcomes of open and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111ePQBi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Any possible long-term benefit from endovascular (EVAR) versus open surgical repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unproven. Long-term data from the Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) trial add to the debate regarding long-term all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate 30-day and long-term mortality, reintervention, rupture and morbidity after EVAR and open repair for AAA in a systematic review.

Methods

Standard PRISMA guidelines were followed. Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis was performed to evaluate mortality and morbidity outcomes.

Results

The existing published randomized trials, together with information from Medicare and SwedVasc databases, were included in a meta-analysis. This included 25 078 patients undergoing EVAR and 27 142 undergoing open repair for AAA. Patients who had EVAR had a significantly lower 30-day or in-hospital mortality rate (1·3 per cent versus 4·7 per cent for open repair; odds ratio (OR) 0·36, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·21 to 0·61; P < 0·001). By 2-year follow-up there was no difference in all-cause mortality (14·3 versus 15·2 per cent; OR 0·87, 0·72 to 1·06; P = 0·17), which was maintained after at least 4 years of follow-up (34·7 versus 33·8 per cent; OR 1·11, 0·91 to 1·35; P = 0·30). There was no significant difference in aneurysm-related mortality by 2 years or longer follow-up. A significantly higher proportion of patients undergoing EVAR required reintervention (P = 0·003) and suffered aneurysm rupture (P < 0·001).

Conclusion

There is no long-term survival benefit for patients who have EVAR compared with open repair for AAA. There are also significantly higher risks of reintervention and aneurysm rupture after EVAR.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^115QAgYj]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Most abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are asymptomatic, not detectable on physical examination, and silent until discovered during radiologic testing for other reasons. Tobacco use, hypertension, a family history of AAA, and male sex are clinical risk factors for the development of an aneurysm. Ultrasound, the preferred method of screening, is cost-effective in high-risk patients. Repair is indicated when the aneurysm becomes greater than 5.5 cm in diameter or grows more than 0.6 to 0.8 cm per year. Asymptomatic patients with an AAA should be medically optimized before repair, including institution of beta blockade. Symptomatic aneurysms present with back, abdominal, buttock, groin, testicular, or leg pain and require urgent surgical attention. Rupture of an AAA involves complete loss of aortic wall integrity and is a surgical emergency requiring immediate repair. The mortality rate approaches 90 percent if rupture occurs outside the hospital. Although open surgical repair has been performed safely, an endovascular approach is used in select patients if the aortic and iliac anatomy are amenable. Two large randomized controlled trials did not find any improvement in mortality rate or morbidity with this approach compared with conventional open surgical repair.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease: similarities and differences among cardiovascular guidelines and NICE guidance [^111ujFQh]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of endovascular techniques has improved abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management over the past 2 decades. Different cardiovascular societies worldwide have recommended the endovascular approach as the standard of care in their currently available guidelines. While endovascular treatment has established its role in daily clinical practice, a new debate has arisen regarding the indications, appropriateness, limitations, and role of open surgery. To inform this debate, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from 2010 to May 2020; the systematic search identified 5 articles published between 2011 and 2020 by 4 cardiovascular societies and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Four debatable domains were assessed and analyzed: diagnostic methods and screening, preoperative management, indications and treatment modalities, and postoperative follow-up and endoleak management. The review addresses controversial proposals as well as widely accepted recommendations and "gray zone" issues that need to be further investigated and analyzed, such as screening in women, medical management, and follow-up imaging. While the recommendations for AAA management have significant overlap and agreement among international cardiovascular societies, the NICE guidelines diverge regarding the role of open repair in aortic disease, recommending conventional surgery in most elective cases.

### The impact of recent European trials on abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: is a paradigm shift warranted? [^112ztvnd]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2008). Low credibility.

Recent reports, following upon the reported outcomes of European randomized prospective trials of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), have brought into question the appropriateness of some of the trials' main conclusions, particularly in patients deemed at high-risk for surgical intervention. Based on the data of these trials, specifically EVAR 2, it has been suggested that EVAR should not be performed in high-risk individuals due to the likelihood of poor outcomes and the lack of improved survival, both associated with higher costs. In addition, certain aspects of the trials involving those deemed fit for open repair (the EVAR 1 and Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management trials) deserve qualified reservations. Although prospective, randomized United States trial data on such patients are not currently available, some large retrospective studies and registry reviews provide a basis for comparison of these trials with US EVAR experiences. In this review, the European EVAR trials are analyzed along with these other US studies and the rationale for modifying some of the conclusions drawn from the trials is presented and general guidelines for the selective management of abdominal aortic aneurysm patients presenting with potential indications for intervention are proposed.

### Risk stratification and treatment selection in patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms [^112DQgub]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The choice of surgical technique for elective abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is a challenge because multiple factors should be considered when individualizing treatment. The 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an AAA recommend using a detailed score to estimate the perioperative mortality but do not further detail estimation of life expectancy or choice of treatment based on risk profile. The 2024 clinical practice guidelines of the European Society for Vascular Surgery recommend that physiological reserves and life expectancy be the primary determinants when choosing repair option. Open surgical repair (OSR) should be considered as the preferred treatment modality for most patients with long life expectancy, defined as greater than 10 to 15 years. In patients with a limited life expectancy of less than 2 to 3 years, elective AAA repair is not recommended. For patients with a life expectancy of 3 to 15 years, the European guidelines recommend that endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) should be considered as the preferred treatment modality if anatomically suitable. These recommendations reflect the fact that the perioperative mortality is significantly lower with EVAR compared with OSR, but the benefits for EVAR diminish over time, leading to long-term equipoise in overall survival, or even long-term superiority for OSR. There is consensus that risk stratification and estimation of life expectancy in patients with asymptomatic AAA is central when considering elective repair. However, robust data to support risk-stratified clinical decision-making for elective AAA repair are largely missing.

Ruptured AAA — role of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open surgical repair (OSR): An early randomized trial reported that the suitability for endovascular repair was only 46%, but the rate of EVAR was lower (30%). In the IMPROVE trial, patients were randomized before CT imaging was performed; 316 patients were randomized to EVAR and 297 patients to open repair, and the 30-day mortality was similar among patients treated with EVAR (35.4%) or open repair (37.4%). Secondary analyses demonstrated shorter length of stay and a higher proportion of patients discharged to home for those treated by EVAR. Recently reported 1-year outcomes demonstrated that EVAR was most cost-effective compared with open repair, but no survival benefit was observed. National trends indicate that EVAR is being used with increasing frequency for ruptured AAA with a decrease in associated mortality, and outcomes are superior when EVAR for a ruptured aneurysm is performed in teaching hospitals and high-volume centers.

In this issue of JAMA Surgery, Eid et al1 presented a randomized clinical study aimed to determine if a preconsultation-administered decision aid would affect a patient's choice between open or endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Their results showed that patients exposed to a decision aid were more likely to receive the repair they preferred. Interestingly, almost 45% of patients did not know their preference before the aid was administered, and 24% remained unsure afterward. All patients, irrespective of whether a decision aid was administered, were able to reach a decision after they consulted with a vascular surgeon. As expected, the majority of patients preferred EVAR over open repair. Very few patients who chose EVAR ultimately selected open repair, whereas more patients who chose open repair in the control group ultimately selected EVAR. Cheng SWK.

### Imaging and management of complications of open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^116wfWUH]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Open repair is still considered the reference standard for long-term repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). In contrast to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), patients with open surgical repair of AAA are not routinely followed up with imaging. Although complications following EVAR are widely recognized and routinely identified on follow-up imaging, complications also do occur following open surgical repair. With frequent use of multi-slice computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) in vascular patients, there is now improved recognition of the potential complications following open surgical repair. Many of these complications are increasingly being managed using endovascular techniques. The aim of this review is to illustrate a variety of potential complications that may occur following open surgical repair and to demonstrate their management using both surgical and endovascular techniques.

### Open versus endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114qictb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Elective endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm results in lower perioperative mortality than traditional open repair, but after 4 years this survival advantage is not seen; in addition, results of two European trials have shown worse long-term outcomes with endovascular repair than with open repair. Long-term results of a study we conducted more than a decade ago to compare endovascular repair with open repair are unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms to either endovascular repair or open repair of the aneurysm. All the patients were candidates for either procedure. Patients were followed for up to 14 years.

Results

A total of 881 patients underwent randomization: 444 were assigned to endovascular repair and 437 to open repair. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. A total of 302 patients (68.0%) in the endovascular-repair group and 306 (70.0%) in the open-repair group died (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.13). During the first 4 years of follow-up, overall survival appeared to be higher with endovascular repair than with open repair; from year 4 through year 8, overall survival was higher in the open-repair group; and after 8 years, overall survival was once again higher in the endovascular-repair group (hazard ratio for death, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.18). None of these trends were significant. There were 12 aneurysm-related deaths (2.7%) in the endovascular-repair group and 16 (3.7%) in the open-repair group (between-group difference, -1.0 percentage point; 95% CI, -3.3 to 1.4); most deaths occurred during the perioperative period. Aneurysm rupture occurred in 7 patients (1.6%) in the endovascular-repair group, and rupture of a thoracic aneurysm occurred in 1 patient (0.2%) in the open-repair group (between-group difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 2.6). Death from chronic obstructive lung disease was just over 50% more common with open repair (5.4% of patients in the endovascular-repair group and 8.2% in the open-repair group died from chronic obstructive lung disease; between-group difference, -2.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -6.2 to 0.5). More patients in the endovascular-repair group underwent secondary procedures.

Conclusions

Long-term overall survival was similar among patients who underwent endovascular repair and those who underwent open repair. A difference between groups was noted in the number of patients who underwent secondary therapeutic procedures. Our results were not consistent with the findings of worse performance of endovascular repair with respect to long-term survival that was seen in the two European trials.

### Two decades of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: enormous progress with serious lessons learned [^113D1vzP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

The modern open surgical management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has changed little since its inception in the 1950s. Endoaneurysmorrhaphy, first described by Rudolph Matas in 1888, involved ligating the branches of an aneurysm from within the aneurysm sac. Approximately 25 years later at the beginning of the 20th century, Alexis Carrel received the Nobel Prize for demonstrating the feasibility of suture repair of arteries and perfecting an anastomotic technique to join 2 vessels. With these techniques established, an AAA could be repaired by anastomosis of a synthetic conduit to the aorta just proximal and distal to the AAA, thereby preserving antegrade blood flow. Dubost was the first to marry these 2 techniques in 1952, with the first report of a successful open AAA repair with homograft replacement. Aside from the development of various different types of conduit materials, open AAA repair has remained largely unchanged through to the present day.

The most dramatic shift in the surgical management of AAA occurred in 1991, when Juan Parodi reported the first endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). This transformative moment marks the beginning of minimally invasive AAA repair as an alternative to open surgical repair. Whereas the elective management of AAA traditionally had depended solely on open surgical repair, these recent developments in catheter-based, endovascular techniques led to a substantial increase in the proportion of AAAs managed electively with EVAR. In 2006, only 15 years after the initial EVAR report, 21 725 EVAR procedures were performed in the United States, exceeding for the first time the number of open surgical AAA repairs. Currently, > 70% of elective AAA repairs in the United States are performed with EVAR.

Although the goals of EVAR and open surgical AAA repair are identical (ie, to eliminate the risk of death from rupture of AAA), the treatment strategy underlying EVAR is completely different than that of open surgical repair. During open repair, the aorta and iliac arteries are clamped, thereby increasing aortic resistance and inducing pelvic and lower-extremity ischemia; the aneurysm is opened; branch vessels are suture-ligated; the aortic aneurysm is replaced with a prosthetic graft; clamps are removed; and blood flow is restored to the pelvis and lower extremities. During EVAR, the aneurysm is left intact, but all blood flow is excluded from the aneurysm by catheter-based deployment of a stent graft, without the necessity to transiently occlude the aorta (Figure 1).

### Endovascular treatment for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1122TcKN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (pathological enlargement of the aorta) can develop in both men and women as they grow older. It is most commonly seen in men over the age of 65 years. Progressive aneurysm enlargement can lead to rupture and massive internal bleeding, a fatal event unless timely repair can be achieved. Despite improvements in perioperative care, mortality remains high (approximately 50%) after conventional open surgical repair. A newer minimally invasive technique, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), has been shown to reduce early morbidity and mortality as compared to conventional open surgery for planned AAA repair. Emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) has been used successfully to treat ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA), proving that it is feasible in selected patients. However, it is not yet known if eEVAR will lead to significant improvements in outcomes for these patients or indeed if it can replace conventional open repair as the preferred treatment for this lethal condition.

Objectives

To assess the advantages and disadvantages of emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (eEVAR) in comparison with conventional open surgical repair for the treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA). This will be determined by the effect on short-term mortality, major complication rates, aneurysm exclusion, and late complications when compared with the effects in patients who have had conventional open repair of RAAA.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 2). Reference lists of relevant publications were also checked.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which patients with a clinically or radiologically diagnosed RAAA were randomly allocated to eEVAR or conventional open surgical repair.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies identified for potential inclusion were independently assessed for eligibility by at least two review authors. Data extraction and quality assessment were also completed independently by two review authors. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Meta-analysis was performed using fixed-effect models with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data and mean differences with 95% CIs for continuous data.

Main Results

Three randomised controlled trials were included in this review. A total of 761 patients with a clinical or radiological diagnosis of RAAA were randomised to receive either eEVAR or open surgical repair. Overall risk of bias was low but one study did not adequately report random sequence generation, putting it at risk of selection bias, two studies did not report on outcomes identified in their protocol, indicating reporting bias, and one study was underpowered. There was no clear evidence to support a difference between the two interventions on 30-day (or in-hospital) mortality, OR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.22; P = 0.52). The 30-day complications included myocardial infarction, stroke, composite cardiac complications, renal complications, severe bowel ischaemia, spinal cord ischaemia, re-operation, amputation, and respiratory failure. Individual complication outcomes were reported in only one or two studies and therefore no robust conclusion can currently be drawn. For complication outcomes that did include at least two studies in the meta-analysis there was no clear evidence to support a difference between eEVAR and open repair. Six-month outcomes were evaluated in only a single study, which included mortality and re-operation, with no clear evidence of a difference between the interventions and no overall association. Cost per patient was only evaluated in a single study and therefore no overall associations can currently be derived.

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this review are currently limited by the paucity of data. From the data available there is no difference in the outcomes evaluated in this review between eEVAR and open repair, specifically 30-day mortality. Not enough information was provided for complications in order to make a well informed conclusion at this time. Long-term data are lacking for both survival and late complications. More high quality, randomised controlled trials comparing eEVAR and open repair for the treatment of RAAA are needed in order to better understand if one method is superior to the other, or if there is no difference between the methods on relevant outcomes.

Open surgery versus endovascular repair — comparative outcomes indicate that in equally eligible AAAs, the choice of treatment relates to the results of 4 important trials (EVAR-1, DREAM, OVER and ACE); meta-analyses showed the early postoperative mortality advantage of EVAR was lost after 3 years follow-up; EVAR-1 reported lower long-term survival after EVAR, whereas DREAM and OVER reported similar long-term survival rates for EVAR and open surgery; in general, there was an increased reintervention rate in the EVAR group; these data support an open surgical repair strategy in patients with a long life expectancy (e.g. exceeding 10 years); and frail patients unfit for elective open repair could be protected against aneurysm-related mortality by EVAR, although life expectancy did not differ between EVAR or optimal surveillance in these patients.

EACTS/STS Guidelines — Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management reports four trials with no differences in short-term outcomes between open surgery and EVAR in anatomically eligible patients, while observational studies showed EVAR had better outcomes in ICU transfer, blood loss and hospital stay and was potentially beneficial for women. Considerations include age > 80 years, which may favour endovascular repair, and hostile anatomy necessitating open surgery; long-term survival appears comparable between EVAR and open surgery for patients discharged from hospital.

### Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms: vascular anatomy, device selection, procedure, and procedure-specific complications [^111qZR7v]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is abnormal dilatation of the aorta, carrying a substantial risk of rupture and thereby marked risk of death. Open repair of AAA involves lengthy surgery time, anesthesia, and substantial recovery time. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) provides a safer option for patients with advanced age and pulmonary, cardiac, and renal dysfunction. Successful endovascular repair of AAA depends on correct selection of patients (on the basis of their vascular anatomy), choice of the correct endoprosthesis, and familiarity with the technique and procedure-specific complications. The type of aneurysm is defined by its location with respect to the renal arteries, whether it is a true or false aneurysm, and whether the common iliac arteries are involved. Vascular anatomy can be divided more technically into aortic neck, aortic aneurysm, pelvic perfusion, and iliac morphology, with grades of difficulty with respect to EVAR, aortic neck morphology being the most common factor to affect EVAR appropriateness. When choosing among the devices available on the market, one must consider the patient's vascular anatomy and choose between devices that provide suprarenal fixation versus those that provide infrarenal fixation. A successful technique can be divided into preprocedural imaging, ancillary procedures before AAA stent-graft placement, the procedure itself, postprocedural medical therapy, and postprocedural imaging surveillance. Imaging surveillance is important in assessing complications such as limb thrombosis, endoleaks, graft migration, enlargement of the aneurysm sac, and rupture. Last, one must consider the issue of radiation safety with regard to EVAR.

Key Points

Question

Which treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms, open repair or endovascular repair, is associated with better long-term survival?

Findings

In this cohort study of 6891 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms stratified into 4 risk groups, open repair was associated with significantly better long-term survival in low-risk patients, whereas endovascular repair was associated with significantly better long-term survival in moderate-to-high-risk patients. No statistically significant survival differences were seen in the other risk groups.

Meaning

This study highlights the potential benefits of risk stratification when planning abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment.

### Comparison of outcomes in elective endovascular aortic repair vs open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^116BMXv6]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found no statistically significant difference between outcomes after EVAR and OSR to repair AAA in long-term mortality during more than 13 years of follow-up. Similarly, there were no long-term differences in reintervention or secondary rupture between the AAA repair approaches. However, EVAR was associated with a higher long-term MACE-free survival rate. The long-term outcomes after EVAR do not appear to have improved more than OSR since the conduct of the seminal RCTs. The reasons for these findings will require further study, including consideration of specific graft makes and models, adherence to IFU, and types and reasons for reintervention.

### Anatomic factors to guide patient selection for fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair [^116DP3uQ]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Endovascular repair of complex abdominal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms has become increasingly common, with some specialized centers using fenestrated and branched endografts as a first-line therapy, given the decreased early morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair. However, the long-term durability of fenestrated and branched endovascular aortic repair remains in question, given the high rate of secondary interventions. Contraindications, complications, and causes of secondary interventions after fenestrated and branched endovascular aortic repair are often related to the anatomic factors of the aorta, target arteries, and access vessels. This article provides an overview of anatomic factors that should be considered when determining eligibility, as well as designing and executing fenestrated and branched endovascular aortic repair procedures.

### Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113faJ9K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An abnormal dilatation of the abdominal aorta is referred to as an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Due to the risk of rupture, surgical repair is offered electively to individuals with aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm in size. Traditionally, conventional open surgical repair (OSR) was considered the first choice approach. However, over the past two decades endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has gained popularity as a treatment option. This article intends to review the role of EVAR in the management of elective AAA.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of EVAR versus conventional OSR in individuals with AAA considered fit for surgery, and EVAR versus best medical care in those considered unfit for surgery. This was determined by the effect on short, intermediate and long-term mortality, endograft related complications, re-intervention rates and major complications.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (January 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12). The TSC also searched trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EVAR with OSR in individuals with AAA considered fit for surgery. and comparing EVAR with best medical care in individuals considered unfit for surgery. We excluded studies with inadequate data or using an inadequate randomisation technique.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently evaluated trials for appropriateness for inclusion and extracted data using pro forma designed by the Cochrane PVD Group. We assessed the quality of trials using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. We entered collected data in to Review Manager (version 5.2.3) for analysis. Where direct comparisons could be made, we determined odds ratios (OR). We tested studies for heterogeneity and, when present, we used a random-effects model; otherwise we used a fixed-effect model. We tabulated data that could not be collated.

Main Results

Four high-quality trials comparing EVAR with OSR (n = 2790) and one high-quality trial comparing EVAR with no intervention (n = 404) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In individuals considered fit for surgery, a pooled analysis, including 1362 individuals randomised to EVAR and 1361 randomised to OSR, found short-term mortality (including 30-day or inhospital mortality, excluding deaths prior to intervention) with EVAR to be significantly lower than with OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%, OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.55; P < 0.0001). Using intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) there was no significant difference in mortality at intermediate follow-up (up to four years from randomisation), with 221 (15.8%) and 237 (17%) deaths in the EVAR (n = 1393) and OSR (n = 1390) groups, respectively (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; P = 0.40). There was also no significant difference in long-term mortality (beyond four years), with 464 (37.3%) deaths in the EVAR and 470 (37.8%) deaths in the OSR group (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; P = 0.78). Similarly, there was no significant difference in aneurysm-related mortality between groups, either at the intermediate- or long-term follow up. Studies showed that both EVAR and OSR were associated with similar incidences of cardiac deaths (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; P = 0.36) and fatal stroke rate (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.55; P = 0.52). The long-term reintervention rate was significantly higher in the EVAR group than in the OSR group (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.51; P = 0.02; I(2) = 85%). Results of the reintervention analysis should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the EVAR and OSR groups. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group compared with the EVAR group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; P = 0.006). In individuals considered unfit for conventional OSR, the one included trial found no difference between the EVAR and no-intervention groups with regard to all-cause mortality at final follow up, with 21.0 deaths per 100 person-years in the EVAR group and 22.1 deaths per 100 person years in the no-intervention group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with EVAR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; P = 0.97). Aneurysm-related deaths were, however, significantly higher in the no-intervention group than in the EVAR group (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89; P = 0.02). There was no difference in myocardial events (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91) between the groups in this study.

Authors' Conclusions

In individuals considered fit for conventional surgery, EVAR was associated with lower short-term mortality than OSR. However, this benefit from EVAR did not persist at the intermediate- and long-term follow ups. Individuals undergoing EVAR had a higher reintervention rate than those undergoing OSR. Most of the reinterventions undertaken following EVAR, however, were catheter-based interventions associated with low mortality. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between EVAR and OSR. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group. In individuals considered unfit for open surgery, the results of a single trial found no overall short- or long-term benefits of EVAR over no intervention with regard to all-cause mortality, but individuals may differ and individual preferences should always be taken into account.

### Predicting risk of rupture and rupture-preventing reinterventions following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [^112u1npq]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become the primary choice of repair for many patients with an intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 1 and is a less invasive alternative to traditional open repair of AAA. Evidence from RCTs of EVAR versus open repair has shown that EVAR has an early mortality benefit; however, this survival benefit is eroded within a few years after operation 2, 3, 4, 5, with significantly higher AAA‐related mortality and rates of secondary rupture 2, 6. Guidelines 7 therefore recommend lifelong clinical and imaging surveillance after EVAR in order to detect complications that require timely reintervention.

Compliance with lifelong surveillance is, however, poor. Among Medicare beneficiaries in the USA, 50 per cent of patients were lost to annual imaging follow‐up by 5 years 8. Compliance also dropped off in the EVAR‐1 trial 2, where only half of the surviving patients in the EVAR group still underwent annual CT 6 years after randomization. This loss to follow‐up could partly be explained by an ageing population (in EVAR‐1, over 40 per cent of patients still alive after 6 years were aged over 80 years). However, there are also concerns about the frequent use of CT and resulting radiation burden that might suggest a less intensive CT surveillance protocol is required 7, with colour duplex ultrasonography recommended as a reasonable alternative to CT 9, 10. In addition, the costs associated with lifelong CT surveillance are high; one‐third of the total costs of EVAR follow‐up in the first 5 years is associated with yearly postoperative radiological surveillance 11, which influences the long‐term cost‐effectiveness of EVAR 12.

### Era of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair is linked to preoperative anatomic severity and perioperative patient outcomes [^117W2Goi]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Varying opinions on optimal elective and emergent surgical management of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms are expressed by the most recent Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), European Society for Vascular Surgery, vs UK National Institutes for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. The UK National Institutes for Health and Care Excellence guidelines propose that open surgical repair serve as the default treatment for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The rationale for this approach relied on data from the early era of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and are in contrast to the more balanced approaches of the SVS and European Society for Vascular Surgery. We hypothesize that significant differences in patient selection, management, and postoperative outcome are related to the era in which treatment was undertaken, contextualizing the outcomes reported in early-era EVAR randomized controlled trials.

Methods

Retrospectively, two cohorts representing all EVAR patients from "early" (n = 167; 2008–2010) and "late" (n = 129; 2015–2017) periods at a single treating institution were assembled. Primary outcomes of era-related changes in preoperative demographics, anatomy, and intraoperative events were assessed; anatomy was compared using the SVS anatomic severity grading system. These era-related differences were then placed in the context of early perioperative outcomes and at follow-up to 1 year.

Results

Choice of surgical strategy differed by era, despite the same patient preoperative comorbidities between EVAR groups. Preoperative anatomic severity was significantly worse in the early cohort (P < .001), with adverse proximal and distal seal zone features (P < .001). Technical success was 16.2% higher in the late cohort, with significantly fewer type 1A/B endoleaks perioperatively (P < .001). In-hospital complications, driven by higher acute kidney injury and surgical site complications in the early cohort, resulted in a 16.5% difference between cohorts (P < .05). At 1 year of follow-up, outcome differences persisted; late-era patients had fewer 1A endoleaks, fewer graft complications, and better reintervention-free survival.

Conclusions

From a granular dataset of EVAR patients, we found an impact of EVAR repair era on early clinical outcomes; late cohort infrarenal EVAR patients had less severe preoperative anatomy and improved perioperative and follow-up outcomes to 1 year, suggesting that the results of early EVAR randomized controlled trials may no longer be generalizable to modern practice.

Open versus endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — recommendations: In patients with nonruptured AAA with low to moderate operative risk and anatomy suitable for either open or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), a shared decision-making process weighing the risks and benefits of each approach is recommended (1 A). In patients undergoing elective EVAR for nonruptured AAA, adherence to manufacturer's instructions for use is recommended (1 B-NR). In patients with nonruptured AAA and a high perioperative risk, EVAR is reasonable to reduce the risk of 30-day morbidity, mortality, or both (2a B-NR). For patients with nonruptured AAA, a moderate to high perioperative risk, and anatomy suitable for an FDA-approved fenestrated endovascular device, endovascular repair is reasonable over open repair to reduce the risk of perioperative complications (2a A).

### Long-term outcome of open or endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^11697veY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

For patients with large abdominal aortic aneurysms, randomized trials have shown an initial overall survival benefit for elective endovascular repair over conventional open repair. This survival difference, however, was no longer significant in the second year after the procedure. Information regarding the comparative outcome more than 2 years after surgery is important for clinical decision making.

Methods

We conducted a long-term, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing open repair with endovascular repair in 351 patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm of at least 5 cm in diameter who were considered suitable candidates for both techniques. The primary outcomes were rates of death from any cause and reintervention. Survival was calculated with the use of Kaplan-Meier methods on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

We randomly assigned 178 patients to undergo open repair and 173 to undergo endovascular repair. Six years after randomization, the cumulative survival rates were 69.9% for open repair and 68.9% for endovascular repair (difference, 1.0 percentage point; 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.8 to 10.8; P = 0.97). The cumulative rates of freedom from secondary interventions were 81.9% for open repair and 70.4% for endovascular repair (difference, 11.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 21.0; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Six years after randomization, endovascular and open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in similar rates of survival. The rate of secondary interventions was significantly higher for endovascular repair. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00421330.)

### Editor's choice-endovascular vs. open repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm: systematic review and meta-analysis of updated peri-operative and long term data of randomised controlled trials [^1117GLhz]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to investigate whether endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has better peri-operative and late clinical outcomes than open repair for non-ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Methods

Electronic bibliographic sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL) were searched up to July 2019 using a combination of thesaurus and free text terms to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the outcomes of EVAR and open repair. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Pooled estimates of dichotomous outcomes were calculated using odds ratio (OR) or risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A time to event data meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method and the results were reported as summary hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI.

Results

Seven RCTs reporting a total of 2 983 patients were included in quantitative synthesis. Three of the trials reported long term follow up that extended to 15.8 years, 14.2 years, and 12.5 years. Meta-analysis found significantly lower odds of 30 day (OR, 0.36; 95% CI 0.20–0.66) and in hospital mortality with EVAR (RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.04 to -0.02). Meta-analysis of the three trials reporting long term follow up found no significant difference in all cause mortality at any time between EVAR and open repair (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.93–1.13; p = .62). The hazard of all cause (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.42–0.91) and aneurysm related death within six months (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.24–0.75) was significantly lower in patients who underwent EVAR, but with further follow up, the pooled hazard estimate moved in favour of open surgery; in the long term (> 8 years) the hazard of aneurysm related mortality was significantly higher after EVAR (HR 5.12; 95% CI 1.59–16.44). The risk of secondary intervention (HR 2.13; 95% CI 1.69–2.68), aneurysm rupture (OR, 5.08; 95% CI 1.11–23.31), and death due to rupture (OR, 3.57; 95% CI 1.87–6.80) was significantly higher after EVAR, but the risk of death due to cancer was not significantly different between EVAR and open repair (OR, 1.03; 95% CI 0.84–1.25).

Conclusion

Compared with open surgery, EVAR results in a better outcome during the first six months but carries an increased risk of aneurysm related mortality after eight years.

### International variations in clinical practices on abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment among patients under 65 years of age: a report from the international consortium of vascular registries [^1161Msdn]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Societal guidelines recommend risk assessment before elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment, including consideration of age. Long term durability concerns for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) suggest that age should influence the choice between open aortic repair (OAR) and EVAR. This study aimed to identify international variability in treatment strategies for AAA patients aged < 65 years.

Methods

Registry data on OAR and EVAR for intact AAAs from 2014 to 2019 were collected from 11 countries (Australia, USA, Denmark, Hungary, Finland, Iceland, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and UK) via the International Consortium of Vascular Registries. Variations in treatment modality, comorbidities, AAA diameter, and peri-operative death were assessed.

Results

Of 94 833 patients, 12 682 (13.4%) were aged < 65 years, with statistically significant international variety (range, 8.6% [Sweden, UK] - 25.6% [Hungary], p < .001). EVAR was performed in 59.6% of patients aged < 65 years, with considerable variation across countries (range, 24.9% [Denmark] - 74.0% [USA]). The use of EVAR in general strongly correlated with its use among patients aged < 65 years (correlation coefficient = 0.88, p < .001). One third of the patients were treated below guideline recommended diameter thresholds: 36.5% of men and 29.3% of women. The likelihood of EVAR increased with age, with variations most pronounced among the youngest patients. Compared with patients who underwent EVAR, those who underwent OAR had statistically significantly larger AAAs (5.9 vs. 5.6 cm, p < .001) and higher peri-operative mortality (1.4 vs. 0.3%, p < .001).

Conclusion

Despite similar AAA guidelines from international vascular societies, substantial variability exists in AAA management for patients aged < 65 years, particularly regarding treatment modality, diameter thresholds, and outcomes. Closer evaluation of international practice patterns and gaps in guideline adherence is warranted.

### The rationale for lowering the size threshold in elective endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116MLtcR]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

The current size threshold for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is 5.5 cm. Over this diameter limit, the AAA rupture rate exceeds the perioperative mortality of open surgical repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is associated with lower perioperative mortality rates, so it seems logical to hypothesize that the size threshold for endovascular AAA repair should be lowered. The arguments supporting this proposal are: (1) the EVAR-associated mortality rises several fold with increasing age, (2) larger AAAs have more complex anatomy that may not be suitable for EVAR, and (3) smaller AAAs treated with EVAR have lower perioperative and long-term mortality and fewer secondary interventions. Future guidelines may need to consider lowering the size threshold for elective AAA repair in the endovascular era in certain patient subgroups. The reduction of the size threshold should be counterbalanced against the cost of the procedures, as well as the age, life expectancy, and general condition of the patient.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112WPFGR]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management recommendations include timing, protocols, resuscitation strategy, referral, and repair modality. We suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30–30–30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. An established protocol for the management of ruptured AAA is essential for optimal outcomes. We recommend implementing hypotensive hemostasis with restriction of fluid resuscitation in the conscious patient. We suggest that patients with ruptured AAA who require transfer for repair be referred to a facility with an established rupture protocol and suitable endovascular resources. If it is anatomically feasible, we recommend EVAR over open repair for treatment of a ruptured AAA.

### Lessons learned in adopting endovascular techniques for treating abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^1136q6p2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Hypothesis Endovascular exclusion of abdominal aortic and common iliac aneurysms can be performed safely, and in the short term represents a feasible alternative to traditional, open aneurysm repair. Patients and Methods Forty-one patients were treated with endovascular grafts for 39 abdominal aortic and 2 common iliac artery aneurysms. Conclusion Patients with large abdominal aortic aneurysms and considerable cardiac comorbidity can safely undergo endovascular aneurysm repair. Femoral groin wound complications resulting in prolonged hospitalization remain the major cause of perioperative morbidity. In contradistinction to open aneurysm repair, long-term surveillance is essential to detect migration of the device and identify flow within the residual aneurysm sac — complications that could lead to aneurysm rupture following endovascular repair. THE GOAL of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is to prevent aneurysm rupture and prolong life.

Traditional methods for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm involve transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approaches. Recently, an alternative method for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using endovascular techniques has received considerable attention in both the surgical literature and clinical practice. Few technologic advances have exhibited a comparable influence on the practice of vascular surgery as have the development of endovascular techniques presently used to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysms. Since the initial report of successful endovascular exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms by Parodi et al1 in 1991, the philosophy regarding aneurysm repair has undergone considerable evolution in terms of delivery systems, types of stents, and graft fabric. Early experience suggests that at least in the short term, endovascular aneurysm exclusion is a feasible alternative to traditional open aneurysm repair.

It is widely accepted, however, that the long-term durability of the procedure remains to be determined. The Medical College of Wisconsin serves as a tertiary referral center for southeastern Wisconsin. A considerable number of surgeons in the surrounding communities routinely perform open aneurysm repair. Most of the patients seen in the referral center had already been prescreened for open aneurysm repair. At present with younger, good-risk patients, we recommend open operation, reserving the use of endovascular exclusion for patients with serious cardiopulmonary or additional comorbid disease. However, owing to the tremendous amount of information available to the general public, there are patients who demand the endovascular procedure if feasible. Additionally, all but 1 patient underwent standard preoperative abdominal and pelvic arteriography.

The CT scans and arteriograms were reviewed by both vascular surgical and interventional radiology staff to determine the suitability of aneurysm morphologic traits and geometry for endovascular repair. Once anatomic suitability was confirmed, a suitable device was chosen and operation undertaken. Patients treated using the Vanguard system were deemed eligible for the procedure according to guidelines set forth by the investigators of the Vanguard clinical trial. 3 More recently, we have considered all patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic or common iliac aneurysms for endovascular repair. Patients receiving 1 of the remaining 3 devices were deemed eligible for the procedure if anatomic parameters were acceptable for the respective device. Indication for operation in all patients was exclusion of asymptomatic abdominal aortic or common iliac aneurysms. No symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms were considered for endovascular repair.

### Individual-patient meta-analysis of three randomized trials comparing endovascular versus open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111W1XNj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm remain controversial, without any strong evidence about advantages in specific subgroups.

Methods

An individual‐patient data meta‐analysis of three recent randomized trials of endovascularopen repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm was conducted according to a prespecified analysis plan, reporting on results to 90 days after the index event.

Results

The trials included a total of 836 patients. The mortality rate across the three trials was 31·3 per cent for patients randomized to endovascular repair/strategy and 34·0 per cent for those randomized to open repair at 30 days (pooled odds ratio 0·88, 95 per cent c.i. 0·66 to 1·18), and 34·3 and 38·0 per cent respectively at 90 days (pooled odds ratio 0·85, 0·64 to 1·13). There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity in the odds ratios between trials. Mean(s.d.) aneurysm diameter was 8·2(1·9) cm and the overall in‐hospital mortality rate was 34·8 per cent. There was no significant effect modification with age or Hardman index, but there was indication of an early benefit from an endovascular strategy for women. Discharge from the primary hospital was faster after endovascular repair (hazard ratio 1·24, 95 per cent c.i. 1·04 to 1·47). For open repair, 30‐day mortality diminished with increasing aneurysm neck length (adjusted odds ratio 0·69 (95 per cent c.i. 0·53 to 0·89) per 15 mm), but aortic diameter was not associated with mortality for either type of repair.

Conclusion

Survival to 90 days following an endovascular or open repair strategy is similar for all patients and for the restricted population anatomically suitable for endovascular repair. Women may benefit more from an endovascular strategy than men and patients are, on average, discharged sooner after endovascular repair.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1179P9z8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.

Methods

The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.

Results

Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30–30–30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions

Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

### Risks… [^112i3R5G]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with aneurysms require elective repair of their aneurysm when it reaches a diameter large enough such that the risk of rupture is greater than the risk of surgery. Repair is also warranted for aneurysms that rapidly enlarge or those that have been the source of emboli. Lastly, the repair is also indicated for aneurysms that are the source of pain and tenderness, which may indicate impending rupture. The options for repair include traditional open aortic surgery or endovascular repair. Endovascular procedures aim to reduce the morbidity and mortality of treating arterial disease in a patient population that is increasingly older and less fit than when major open repairs were developed and popularized. Even in the early days, significant risks were accepted in the understanding that the large open operation was the only option. That is not the case in most patients today.

Studies that assign aneurysm patients to treatment with EVAR or traditional open surgery have demonstrated fewer early complications with the minimally invasive approach. Some studies have also observed a lower mortality rate with EVAR. The reduction in death, however, does not persist long-term. After a few years, the survival after repair is similar to EVAR or open surgery. This observation may be the result of durability problems with early endograft, with a corresponding need for additional procedures to repair endoleaks and other device-related issues. Newer, improved technology may reduce the need for such secondary procedures. If so, the results of EVAR may improve to the point where long-term survival benefit becomes evident. EVAR is also used for rupture of the abdominal and descending thoracic aorta, and in rare cases used to treat pathology of the ascending aorta. Its use in complicated aortic dissection is under investigation.

In the Clinical Practice Guidelines of the European Society for Vascular Surgery, it is recommended that in patients with complicated acute type B aortic dissection, endovascular repair with thoracic endografting should be the first line intervention. Before people are deemed to be suitable candidates for this treatment, they have to go through a rigorous set of tests. These include a CT scan of the complete thorax/abdomen/pelvis and blood tests. The CT scan gives precise measurements of the aneurysm and the surrounding anatomy. In particular, the calibre/tortuosity of the iliac arteries and the relationship of the neck of the aneurysm to the renal arteries are important determinants of whether the aneurysm is amenable to endoluminal repair. The abdominal aneurysm extends down to the common iliac arteries in about 25%-30% of patients. In such cases, the iliac limbs can be extended into the external iliac artery to bypass a common iliac aneurysm.

Alternatively, a specially designed endograft, can be used to preserve flow to the internal iliac arteries. The preservation of the hypogastric arteries is important to prevent buttock claudication and impotence, and every effort should be made to preserve flow to at least one hypogastric artery. The endograft acts as an artificial lumen for blood to flow through, protecting the surrounding aneurysm sac. This reduces the pressure in the aneurysm, which itself will usually thrombose and shrink in size over time. Percutaneous EVAR has been systematically compared to the standard EVAR cut-down femoral artery approach. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there are no differences in short-term mortality, aneurysm sealing, long and short-term complications, or infections at the wound site. Higher quality evidence suggests that there are no differences in post-repair bleeding complications or haematoma between the two approaches.

Current abdominal aortic aneurysm management and need for medical management to limit growth and rupture

Current management

Randomized controlled trials suggest that early elective open surgical repair (OSR) or EVAR of asymptomatic 40–55 mm AAA does not reduce mortality. One trial suggested that EVAR did not significantly reduce mortality in people with large AAA unfit for OSR although this evidence maybe outdated due to advances in EVAR. One trial found that EVAR and OSR had similar 30-day mortality for ruptured AAA. Quality of life was better in the EVAR group, and 3-year mortality was lower after EVAR in participants with proven rupture. The risk of small aneurysm rupture is higher, and outcome of surgery is worse in women compared with men. Based on this evidence, current European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend monitoring of small AAA (< 55 mm in men; < 50 mm in women) through imaging surveillance, elective surgical repair of large aneurysms in fit patients, and EVAR of ruptured AAA, if morphologically suitable. The intervention threshold for women is not evidence-based and remains a research priority.

Small abdominal aortic aneurysm and large abdominal aortic aneurysm that do not undergo surgical repair

The risk of rupture of small AAA in men is < 1%/year. The 3-year rupture rate of unrepaired 50–54 mm AAA in women was 3.4% in a recent study. Most small AAA grow in size over time, with the UK small aneurysm trial finding that 70% of 40–55 mm AAA grew to 55 mm within 5 years. Large aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture (estimated as 2.2%, 6.0%, and 18.4% over 3 years for 55–60 mm, 61–70 mm, and > 70 mm AAA, respectively). Rupture rate of large AAA is significantly greater in women than men, with a recent study reporting women with unrepaired 61–70 mm AAA had a 3-year incidence of rupture of 12.8% compared with 4.5% in men. There is no evidence that the growth rate of small AAA has changed over time. Thus, medical treatments that can slow AAA growth and reduce the risk of small aneurysm rupture are needed. The remainder of this review summarizes previous research performed to test and develop medical therapy to limit AAA growth and rupture.

### Guidelines for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. report of a subcommittee of the joint council of the American association for vascular surgery and Society for Vascular Surgery [^113UGTNb]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Decision-making in regard to elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) requires careful assessment of factors that influence rupture risk, operative mortality, and life expectancy. Individualized consideration of these factors in each patient is essential, and the role of patient preference is of increasing importance. It is not possible or appropriate to recommend a single threshold diameter for intervention which can be generalized to all patients. Based upon the best available current evidence, 5.5 cm is the best threshold for repair in an "average" patient. However, subsets of younger, good-risk patients or aneurysms at higher rupture risk may be identified in whom repair at smaller sizes is justified. Conversely, delay in repair until larger diameter may be best for older, higher-risk patients, especially if endovascular repair is not possible. Intervention at diameter < 5.5 cm appears indicated in women with AAA. If a patient has suitable anatomy, endovascular repair may be considered, and it is most advantageous for older, higher-risk patients or patients with a hostile abdomen or other technical factors that may complicate standard open repair. With endovascular repair, perioperative morbidity and recovery time are clearly reduced; however, there is a higher reintervention rate, increased surveillance burden, and a small but ongoing risk of AAA rupture. There is no justification at present for different indications for endovascular repair, such as earlier treatment of smaller AAA. Until long-term outcome of endoluminal repair is better defined and results of randomized trials available, the choice between endovascular and open repair will continue to rely heavily on patient preference.

### Preferences for endovascular (EVAR) or open surgical repair among patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms under surveillance [^113q8Skq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is no evidence about patient preferences for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair (OSR). This study examined patient preferences for elective future aneurysm repair and factors that may influence such preferences.

Methods

Patients with small AAAs under ultrasound scan surveillance at two United Kingdom (UK) hospitals participated in a semi-structured telephone interview. Features of the two techniques were assessed with regard to their influence on the preferences of participants for EVAR or OSR, using a Likert scale. In addition, participants ranked the relative importance of 14 features against each other.

Results

Fifty-six out of 100 eligible participants (56%) completed the semi-structured telephone interview. Of those, 84% (47 patients) said they would prefer a future EVAR repair. Patients who expressed a preference for OSR were significantly younger. Risks of major organ failure and death were most commonly judged as important features in influencing patient preference (Likert scale score 5/5). Risk of death was also most frequently ranked above all other features. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were regarded by patients as more important than the need for surveillance and risk of long-term problems with EVAR. Type of incision and radiation exposure were both given low Likert scale scores of 1/5, and the risk of sexual dysfunction was most frequently ranked as the least important feature of either operation, out of 14 other features.

Conclusion

When presented with detailed information about EVAR and OSR, most patients with small aneurysms would prefer EVAR.

### Factors associated with preference of choice of aortic aneurysm repair in the PReference for open versus endovascular repair of AAA (PROVE-AAA) study [^116bbGoL]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients can choose between open repair and endovascular repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, the factors associated with patient preference for one repair type over another are not well-characterized. Here we assess the factors associated with preference of choice for open or endovascular AAA repair among veterans exposed to a decision aid to help with choosing surgical treatment.

Methods

Across 12 Veterans Affairs hospitals, veterans received a decision aid covering domains including patient information sources and understanding preference. Veterans were then given a series of surveys at different timepoints examining their preferences for open versus endovascular AAA repair. Questions from the preference survey were used in analyses of patient preference. Results were analyzed using χ 2 tests. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with preference for open repair or preference for EVAR.

Results

A total of 126 veterans received a decision aid informing them of their treatment choices, after which 121 completed all preference survey questions; five veterans completed only part of the instruments. Overall, veterans who preferred open repair were typically younger (70 years vs 73 years; p = 0.02), with similar rates of common comorbidities (coronary disease 16% vs 28%; p = 0.21), and similar aneurysms compared with those who preferred EVAR (6.0 cm vs 5.7 cm; p = 0.50). Veterans in both preference categories (28% of veterans preferring EVAR, 48% of veterans preferring open repair) reported taking their doctor's advice as the top box response for the single most important factor influencing their decision. When comparing the tradeoff between less invasive surgery and higher risk of long-term complications, more than one-half of veterans preferring EVAR reported invasiveness as more important compared with approximately 1 in 10 of those preferring open repair (53% vs 12%; P < .001). Shorter recovery was an important factor for the EVAR group (74%) and not important in the open repair group (76%) (P = .5). In multivariable analyses, valuing a short hospital stay (odds ratio, 12.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–135.70) and valuing a shorter recovery (odds ratio, 15.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–240.20) were associated with a greater odds of preference for EVAR, whereas finding these characteristics not important was associated with a greater odds of preference for open repair.

Conclusions

When faced with the decision of open repair versus EVAR, veterans who valued a shorter hospital stay and a shorter recovery were more likely to prefer EVAR, whereas those more concerned about long-term complications preferred an open repair. Veterans typically value the advice of their surgeon over their own beliefs and preferences. These findings need to be considered by surgeons as they guide their patients to a shared decision.

### Elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: does the aneurysm diameter influence long-term survival? [^113suMPR]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate whether initial abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter influences long-term survival after elective repair.

Design

Retrospective analysis of database.

Material and Methods

Between March 1995 and December 2006, a consecutive series of 895 patients underwent elective treatment of an AAA either by open surgical or endovascular repair. An AAA diameter of 5.5cm was chosen as threshold to distinguish between small and large aneurysms, according to the definition given by the UK small aneurysm trial. Patient characteristics and distribution of basic risk factors were assessed. Survival estimates (Kaplan-Meier) and Cox proportional hazards regression results are reported.

Results

Patients with small aneurysms were more likely to survive the first 6 years after AAA repair, even after adjustment for treatment modality and baseline risk factors. After adjustment for age and sex aneurysms with smaller diameter were related to a lower risk of death (p < 0.0016).

Conclusions

Patients with small aneurysms (≤ 5.5cm) have an improved long-term survival than patients with larger aneurysms.

Objective

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries in succession to the 2011 and 2019 versions, with the aim of assisting physicians and patients in selecting the best management strategy.

Methods

The guideline is based on scientific evidence completed with expert opinion on the matter. By summarising and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of patients have been formulated. The recommendations are graded according to a modified European Society of Cardiology grading system, where the strength (class) of each recommendation is graded from I to III and the letters A to C mark the level of evidence.

Results

A total of 160 recommendations have been issued on the following topics: Service standards, including surgical volume and training; Epidemiology, diagnosis, and screening; Management of patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), including surveillance, cardiovascular risk reduction, and indication for repair; Elective AAA repair, including operative risk assessment, open and endovascular repair, and early complications; Ruptured and symptomatic AAA, including peri-operative management, such as permissive hypotension and use of aortic occlusion balloon, open and endovascular repair, and early complications, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and colonic ischaemia; Long term outcome and follow up after AAA repair, including graft infection, endoleaks and follow up routines; Management of complex AAA, including open and endovascular repair; Management of iliac artery aneurysm, including indication for repair and open and endovascular repair; and Miscellaneous aortic problems, including mycotic, inflammatory, and saccular aortic aneurysm. In addition, Shared decision making is being addressed, with supporting information for patients, and Unresolved issues are discussed.

Conclusion

The ESVS Clinical Practice Guidelines provide the most comprehensive, up to date, and unbiased advice to clinicians and patients on the management of abdominal aorto-iliac artery aneurysms.

### Endovascular strategy or open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: one-year outcomes from the IMPROVE randomized trial [^116JSj41]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Trial design

IMPROVE (Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 48334791) is a multicentre trial of unselected patients with an in-hospital clinical diagnosis of ruptured AAA randomized to either an endovascular strategy of immediate CT scan and emergency EVAR if possible or to emergency open repair. Since patients were randomized before knowledge of whether the aortic anatomy was suitable for EVAR, open repair was the specified treatment for patients (35–40%) who were anatomically unsuitable for EVAR in the endovascular strategy group. In the open repair group, CT scan was not compulsory but was used in 90%. The trial methods and 30-day outcomes have been publishedand, together with the study protocol, and statistical analysis plan, are available from the trial web sites;. Briefly, this trial was conducted in 29 British centres and 1 Canadian centre, with each centre attaining the credentialing criteria necessary for participation. Patients over 50 years with a clinical diagnosis of ruptured AAA or ruptured aorto-iliac aneurysm were eligible for inclusion, and 613 patients were randomized from September 2009 to July 2013. The trial guidelines for EVAR suitability were aneurysm neck diameter ≤ 32 mm, aneurysm neck length ≥ 10 mm, and neck angulation < 60°. Since the diagnosis of rupture can be difficult, CT scans were reviewed later by experts in a core laboratory. There are no ESC guidelines for the management of ruptured AAA.

Randomization

The trial used central telephone computer-generated randomization (1:1), stratified by centre with variable block size. Since this was a surgical trial focusing on mortality there was no blinding.

### Short-term concerns primarily determine patient preference for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [^1159VwGE]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair may be performed through open or endovascular approaches, but the factors influencing a patient's repair-type preference are not well characterized. Here we performed a qualitative analysis to better understand factors influencing patient preference within the Preference for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of AAA Trial.

Methods

Open-ended responses regarding primary (n = 21) and secondary (n = 47) factors influencing patient preference underwent qualitative analysis using the constant comparative method with iterative reviews. Codes were used to generate themes and themes grouped into categories, with each step conducted via consensus agreement between three researchers. Relative prevalence of themes were compared to ascertain trends in patient preference.

Results

Patient responses regarding both primary and secondary factors fell into four categories: Short-term concerns, long-term concerns, advice & experience, and other. Patients most frequently described short-term concerns (23) as their primary influence, with themes including post-op complications, hospitalization & recovery, and intraoperative concerns. Long-term concerns were more prevalent (20) as secondary factors, which included themes such as survival, and chronic management. The average age of patients voicing only long-term concerns as a primary factor was 11 years younger than those listing only short-term concerns.

Conclusion

Short-term concerns relating to the procedure and recovery are more often the primary factor influencing patient preference, while long term concerns play a more secondary role. Long-term concerns are more often a primary factor in younger patients. Vascular surgeons should consider this information in shared decision making to reach an optimal outcome.

### Open versus endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in VA hospitals [^1165obVU]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), when compared with conventional open surgical repair, has been shown to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. We performed a retrospective cohort study with prospectively collected data from the Department of Veterans Affairs to examine outcomes after elective aneurysm repair.

Study Design

We studied 30-day mortality, 1-year survival, and postoperative complications in 1,904 patients who underwent elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR n = 717 [37.7%]; open n = 1,187 [62.3%]) at 123 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals between May 1, 2001 and September 30, 2003. We investigated the influence of patient, operative, and hospital variables on outcomes.

Results

Patients undergoing EVAR had significantly lower 30-day (3.1% versus 5.6%, p = 0.01) and 1- year mortality rates (8.7% versus 12.1%, p = 0.018) than patients having open repair. EVAR was associated with a decrease in 30-day postoperative mortality (adjusted odds ratio[OR] = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.36, 0.99; p = 0.04). The risk of perioperative complications was much less after EVAR (15.5% versus 27.7%; p < 0.001; unadjusted OR 0.48; 95% CI = 0.38, 0.61; p < 0.001). Patients operated on at low volume hospitals (25% of entire cohort) were more likely to have had open repair (31.3% compared with 15.9% EVAR; p < 0.001) and a nearly two-fold increase in adjusted 30-day mortality risk (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.19, 2.98; p = 0.006).

Conclusions

In routine daily practice, veterans who undergo elective EVAR have substantially lower perioperative mortality and morbidity rates compared with patients having open repair. The benefits of a minimally invasive approach were readily apparent in this cohort, but we recommend using caution in choosing EVAR for all elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs until longer-term data on device durability are available.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for abdominal aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to endovascular aneurysm repair, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend to perform ultrasound-guided percutaneous closure over open cutdown for endovascular AAA repair to reduce operative time, blood loss, length of stay, time to wound healing, and pain in patients with suitable common femoral artery anatomy.

### Endovascular strategy or open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: one-year outcomes from the IMPROVE randomized trial [^1117q9ib]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is fatal in over 80% of cases and operative mortality remains high in those who survive to undergo repair (42%). The majority of patients in Europe, the USA, and elsewhere is treated with open surgical repair rather than the less invasive endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) – and emergency EVAR is not available, or not always available, in many centres. Following a small pilot trial, three larger European randomized trials of endovascular vs. open repair of ruptured aneurysms were established, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that 30-day outcomes were better after either endovascular repair or an endovascular strategy: observational studies suggest that operative mortality after emergency endovascular repair is in the range of 16–36%, varying with haemodynamic stability. The conventional reporting standard for surgery is 30-day mortality and all three later randomized trials have reported this outcome recently. – In the two smaller trials, which recruited a limited range of patients, who were fit for open repair and after CT scan deemed anatomically suitable for EVAR, 30-day mortality (20–25%) was similar in patients randomized to EVAR vs. open repair. The much larger IMPROVE trial, randomized patients at the point of in-hospital clinical diagnosis, when vascular teams were alerted, but before a CT scan had confirmed either the diagnosis or the anatomical suitability for EVAR. Randomization was to an endovascular strategy (EVAR wherever possible, with open repair for those anatomically unsuitable for standard EVAR) vs. open repair. The aim of this trial was to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a preferential endovascular strategy for the management of suspected ruptured AAA. Again there was no 30-day survival benefit for the endovascular strategy, except perhaps in women, with overall mortality ∼35%.

An editorial commentary on the 30-day outcomes of the IMPROVE trial emphasized correctly that modern intensive care permitted more patients to survive to 30 days, with many patients still being in hospital at 30 days, so that only an assessment of longer term outcomes, to 90 days and beyond, would provide the requisite evidence for both clinical and patient decision-making. This need for longer term data also is endorsed by a recent Cochrane review and the IDEAL recommendations. To the patients and their families involved in the design of the IMPROVE trial, the most important outcome was going home without major complications. Here we report the 1-year pre-specified outcomes from the IMPROVE trial.

### Predictors of survival following open and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^111KwmEq]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical decision making for asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) weighs risk of aneurysm rupture, treatment hazards, and overall survival expectations. AAA diameter is the primary parameter in assessing rupture risk. Perioperative risk assessment has been extensively studied, and in-hospital mortality has been reduced to less than 8% with higher-risk open repair and less than 3% with endovascular repair. The purpose of this report is to determine risk factors that predict 2-year survival following open and endovascular AAA repair. We studied 334 patients enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial evaluating an endovascular graft in comparison to standard open repair of infrarenal AAA. Demographic, medical history, physical examination, laboratory, anatomic, procedural, and standardized risk score system variables were analyzed in a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. Overall survival was 89% at 2 years. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke were the most common causes of death, and no deaths were due to AAA rupture. Cox modeling demonstrated that there were several independent predictors for death after AAA repair: smaller body mass index (p = 0.005), Society for Vascular Surgery pulmonary risk score ≥ 1 (p = 0.005), history of erectile dysfunction (p = 0.008), history of heart valve replacement (p = 0.008), lower preoperative platelet count (p = 0.012), larger ratio of AAA diameter/proximal neck diameter (p = 0.020), and lower ankle-brachial index (p = 0.031). Age, gender, and open or endovascular treatment group are not significant independent risk factors for 2-year mortality in this study. Clinical, laboratory, and anatomic factors predict survival after open and endovascular repair of AAAs. With progressive reduction of in-hospital mortality, assessment of patient longevity after AAA repair has become a more important factor in clinical decision making. Use of valid predictors of patient survival will optimize resource utilization and improve overall patient outcomes. Better selection of patients for any method of repair may improve overall utility more than choice of open or endovascular techniques.

### Long-term comparison of endovascular and open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1163gvsT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether elective endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm reduces long-term morbidity and mortality, as compared with traditional open repair, remains uncertain.

Methods

We randomly assigned 881 patients with asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms who were candidates for both procedures to either endovascular repair (444) or open repair (437) and followed them for up to 9 years (mean, 5.2). Patients were selected from 42 Veterans Affairs medical centers and were 49 years of age or older at the time of registration.

Results

More than 95% of the patients underwent the assigned repair. For the primary outcome of all-cause mortality, 146 deaths occurred in each group (hazard ratio with endovascular repair versus open repair, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 1.22; P = 0.81). The previously reported reduction in perioperative mortality with endovascular repair was sustained at 2 years (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.98; P = 0.04) and at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.00; P = 0.05) but not thereafter. There were 10 aneurysm-related deaths in the endovascular-repair group (2.3%) versus 16 in the open-repair group (3.7%) (P = 0.22). Six aneurysm ruptures were confirmed in the endovascular-repair group versus none in the open-repair group (P = 0.03). A significant interaction was observed between age and type of treatment (P = 0.006); survival was increased among patients under 70 years of age in the endovascular-repair group but tended to be better among those 70 years of age or older in the open-repair group.

Conclusions

Endovascular repair and open repair resulted in similar long-term survival. The perioperative survival advantage with endovascular repair was sustained for several years, but rupture after repair remained a concern. Endovascular repair led to increased long-term survival among younger patients but not among older patients, for whom a greater benefit from the endovascular approach had been expected.

### The PIVOTAL study: a randomized comparison of endovascular repair versus surveillance in patients with smaller abdominal aortic aneurysms [^113qWkx6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The diameter of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the single most important factor in deciding whether to repair an aneurysm or to monitor it conservatively. Open surgical repair does not appear to be beneficial until the diameter of the aneurysm is > 5.5 cm. Prospective clinical trials, however, confirmed a lower risk of operative mortality after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) than after open surgical repair. Further, retrospective analyses of EVAR databases suggested that EVAR outcome is directly related to aneurysm size and is better for smaller aneurysms than for larger aneurysms. Noting similar results with open surgical management vs surveillance in patients with smaller AAA, lower morbidity rates with EVAR vs open repair, and the favorable results with EVAR in smaller aneurysms, a clinical trial testing the hypothesis that EVAR is beneficial in patients with small AAA appeared warranted. To answer this question, the 70-site Positive Impact of endoVascular Options for Treating Aneurysm earLy (PIVOTAL) was begun. PIVOTAL has an enrollment goal of up to 1025 patients with a 4- to 5-cm AAA, randomly assigning patients to EVAR or surveillance. The primary end points of PIVOTAL are aneurysm rupture and AAA-related death at up to 36 months after randomization. When complete, the results of PIVOTAL should provide objective evidence to guide the use of EVAR for small AAAs.

### Techniques and future perspectives for the prevention and treatment of endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^116mQZ5B]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms was first described nearly three decades ago and has offered a crucial management shift of patients with aortic disease, particularly when open repair was not an option.

A variety of EVAR devices were developed over the years offering a range of outcomes. There has been a substantial evolution in design and technology, from the initial tube grafts to the custom-made fenestrated and branched devices that are used today. EVAR has offered some benefits over the traditional open surgical repair; however, there is a cost to pay and this is mainly the need of closer patient follow-up and sometimes the necessity of re-interventions. Follow-up is required to assess growth of the aneurysm sac, device migration, blockage, or infection. The most common reason for re-intervention is the increase of the aneurysmal sac due persistence of flow, a phenomenon otherwise known as "endoleak". The purpose of this review article is to illustrate the various types of endoleaks and to describe what the current status of percutaneous management is.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair outcomes — despite improvements in cardiovascular risk factor management, 5-year survival after successful aneurysm repair remains below 70%. EVAR is associated with a threefold reduction in perioperative mortality compared with propensity-matched patients undergoing elective OSR, yet despite the reduced risk compared with OSR, EVAR remains an intermediate- to high-risk procedure for cardiovascular complication.

### Preferences of patients, their family caregivers and vascular surgeons in the choice of abdominal aortic aneurysms treatment options: the PREFER study [^114YubYE]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Factors influencing the choice between endovascular (endovascular aneurysm repair, EVAR) and open repair (OPEN) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are of increasing interest. We quantified their importance among the different subjects involved in the treatment.

Methods

Pre- and postoperative patients (pts), their relatives and vascular surgeons completed questionnaires evaluating six treatment characteristics: anaesthesia; recovery time to basic everyday activities; risk of re-intervention at 5 years (RR); complexity of follow-up; risk of major complications; and additional cost of intervention (AC). Through a discrete choice experiment, hypothetical scenarios of treatment were obtained and the relative importance (RI) of each characteristic was determined through a conditional logistic regression model.

Results

A total of 160 pts, 102 relatives and 30 surgeons from nine centres completed the questionnaires. Major complications and re-intervention risk were the most important characteristics (RI = 56.0% and 27.2%, respectively) for all the respondent categories. Pts and their relatives considered very important also a possible out-of-pocket AC. Recovery time and type of anaesthesia were among the least important characteristics, including hospital additional cost for surgeons. The different categories of respondents showed different opinions towards different treatment characteristics depending also on possible previous treatment.

Conclusion

Preferences for AAA treatment characteristics differ between groups of involved subjects. Understanding individuals' preferences could help in optimising treatment benefits.

### Long-term outcomes of open vs endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair… [^113LDNiz]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question What are the long-term outcomes associated with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair compared with open aneurysm repair. Findings In this cohort study of 32 760 abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in a Medicare-matched database, open repair was associated with higher odds of 30-day mortality and perioperative complications but lower rates of 6-year mortality, rupture, and reintervention. Meaning These findings suggest that endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair had perioperative benefits but long-term outcomes remained a significant concern, warranting careful surveillance during long-term follow-up and consideration of open aneurysm repair in appropriate candidates. Importance Endovascular aneurysm repair is associated with a significant reduction in perioperative mortality and morbidity compared with open aneurysm repair in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm.

However, this benefit decreases over time owing to increased reinterventions and late aneurysm rupture after endovascular repair. Objective To compare long-term outcomes of endovascular vs open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Design, Setting, and Participants. Exposures First-time elective endovascular or open repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary long-term outcome of interest was 6-year all-cause mortality, rupture, and reintervention. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality and perioperative complications. Results. After propensity score matching, there were 2852 patients in each group. Open repair was associated with significantly lower 6-year mortality compared with endovascular repair. Open repair, compared with endovascular repair, also was associated with significantly lower rates of 6-year rupture and reintervention. Open repair was associated with significantly higher odds of 30-day mortality and complications. Conclusions and Relevance. These findings suggest that overall mortality after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was higher with endovascular repair than open repair despite reduced 30-day mortality and perioperative morbidity after endovascular repair. Endovascular repair additionally was associated with significantly higher rates of long-term rupture and reintervention. These findings emphasize the importance of careful patient selection and long-term follow-up surveillance for patients who undergo endovascular repair.

The use of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has dramatically increased since its first inception in 1991, 1 accounting for an estimated 74% to 76% of intact abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs. 2, 3 The Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management, 4 EVAR-1, 5 and Open Versus Endovascular Repair 6 multicenter randomized clinical trials all demonstrated decreased perioperative mortality and morbidity with the endovascular approach compared with open aneurysm repair, which was further confirmed in retrospective studies. 7–10.

### Variations in abdominal aortic aneurysm care: a report from the international consortium of vascular registries [^111nuoA1]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Editorial, see p

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease in the Western population, with a prevalence of 2% to 5% in men ≥ 65 years of age, – and is a major cause of death as a result of rupture. Treatment consists of an open or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR).

Many aspects of treatment, including size threshold for intervention, – the benefits of EVAR, – and AAA screening in high-risk cohorts,– have been studied extensively. Using the available data, both the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) have established guidelines for the management of AAA. The aim of these guidelines is to settle uncertainties in management and to identify best practices. However, treatment choices may be driven not only by clinical and medical science but also by cultural differences, economic incentives, access to technology, physician skill set, and patient/physician preference. Historically, significant variation in the management of AAA has been noted between some countries, but wider international variation related to society guidelines has not been assessed. –

Here, we assessed differences in contemporary practice for 11 countries across 3 continents participating in the ICVR (International Consortium of Vascular Registries), which is a collaboration of national quality improvement registries.

### The impact of work status and age in choosing type of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [^115RFhhj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The PReferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (PROVE-AAA) trial aimed to determine the efficacy of a validated decision aid to enable better alignment between patient preference and their ultimate repair. We sought to determine the key factors influencing the decision-making of veterans for endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) or open surgical repair (OSR).

Methods

A total of 235 veterans in the PROVE-AAA trial were asked their information sources regarding repairs, employment status, and preferred intervention. Answers were coded and analyzed using conventional content analysis to generate nonoverlapping themes, then stratified by employment status.

Results

Forty-two patients (17.8% of enrollees) provided their source of information for OSR prior to using a decision aid. 81% of retired veterans were greater than 70 y old, while 58% of nonretired veterans were greater than 70 (P = 0.003). The most common information source was from a vascular surgeon/professional or unspecified MD/other health professionals (51.4%), while sources from outside this group made up the remaining 48.5%. The most preferred procedure was EVAR. However, nonretired individuals were more likely to prefer OSR. These data on information source and preferred procedure were similar in patients who provided their source for EVAR.

Conclusions

Veterans in the PROVE-AAA study were more likely to be retired and more likely to rely on information from an unspecified MD/other health professionals for EVAR. Although both retired and nonretired veterans preferred EVAR the most, nonretired veterans were more likely to prefer OSR despite being younger.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair — endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open surgery shows lower perioperative mortality with EVAR (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.2–0.66), with this advantage persisting at 6 months before survival becomes equivalent; after 8 years EVAR is associated with higher aneurysm-related death (hazard ratio, 5.12; 95% CI, 1.6–16.4), secondary intervention (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7–2.7), aneurysm rupture (OR 5; 95% CI, 1.1–23.3), and death attributable to rupture (OR 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9–6.8), while observational data indicate the EVAR survival advantage lasted longer among older patients and that fenestrated repair has a similar early survival advantage over complex open repair in the first 30 days after surgery.

### Trends in management of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^114BpWs2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients undergoing elective repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and the longitudinal trends in surgical management (open repair vs endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]), factors associated with the choice of surgical technique, and differences in the rate of in-hospital mortality at a single large-volume Canadian center.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used data from a prospectively collected vascular surgery database and reviewed all patients undergoing elective repair of an infrarenal AAA over a recent 10-year period (June 2000-May 2010). Information was reviewed regarding surgical techniques, patient demographics, and short-term outcomes. Subsequent analysis included univariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression with data presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

A total of 1942 patients underwent elective AAA repair over this 10-year study period, 1067 (54.9%) via open repair and 875 (45.1%) via EVAR. The proportion of patients undergoing EVAR was significantly higher in the latter half of the study period compared to the first half (55.8% vs 33.9%; P < .01). Older patients (75 vs 71; P < .01) and those with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (P < .01) were more likely to receive endovascular repair than open repair. The overall in-hospital mortality rate in the entire cohort was low (2.3% for EVAR and 3.9% for open repair), and after multivariable logistic regression and adjustment for preoperative factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with open AAA repair (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.04–3.13; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

This 10-year analysis shows a significant shift toward an endovascular approach in the repair of infrarenal AAAs at our Canadian center. Similar to other jurisdictions, higher risk and older patients are more likely to be treated with an endovascular repair resulting in a survival advantage in these patients compared to standard open repair.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms: which risk factors play a role in decision-making? [^115JD5FL]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

There are three choices for management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), ie, endovascular repair (EVAR), open repair (OR), and continuing surveillance (OBS). The treating physician must weigh the risk of no intervention, in terms of ultimate death from rupture, against the more immediate risk associated with either form of repair, considering in the process those risk factors that directly or indirectly relate to outcome. These risk factors include AAA size and the patient's comorbidities, age, gender, and AAA anatomy, as well as the skills and experience of the treating physicians and the health care environment in which the patient is treated. While individualization is clearly required, a generalizable platform for decision-making derived from past trials and other pertinent observational studies is also useful. This article attempts to present pertinent background information and develop it into generally applicable guidelines.

### Comparison of outcomes in elective endovascular aortic repair vs open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^115opJLW]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Endovascular repair has demonstrated a persistent loss of long-term mortality benefit and high reintervention rates in both RCTs and population-based studies. Consequently, economic analyses have demonstrated EVAR to be cost ineffective, which has led the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencein the United Kingdom to recommend against EVAR in its draft of AAA management guidelines. However, the best evidence used to define these guidelines is limited to the seminal RCTs, which are themselves limited by older endografts and early knowledge regarding complications and management. Furthermore, EVAR offers potential benefits other than reduced mortality, despite higher reintervention rates. Many studies have uniformly demonstrated lower perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, shorter lengths of stay in hospitals, and higher rates of discharge home, among others. Furthermore, mortality does not reflect the considerable impact of myocardial infarction and stroke on quality of life among survivors of myocardial infarctions and strokes. Consequently, a case can be made for extension of EVAR to younger, healthier patients with longer life expectancy as opposed to reserving it for the most comorbid patient populations or not using it at all. However, the safety of this approach will require even longer follow-up for patients who undergo EVAR than is currently available, to our knowledge. These data will ascertain whether any long-term sequelae, such as cancer, exist secondary to EVAR surveillance and permit greater understanding of the appropriate decision-making approach regarding endoleak and complication management in the context of evolved endograft architecture.

### Morphological suitability for endovascular repair, non-intervention rates, and operative mortality in women and men assessed for intact abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: systematic reviews with meta-analysis [^117FqKXr]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

An earlier systematic review (of articles published by July, 2009) showed that the operative mortality (defined as either in-hospital mortality or 30-day mortality) for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm open repairs was 7·6% in women versus 5·1% in men, and for endovascular repair the mortality in women was 2·9% versus 1·5% in men. To our knowledge, no previous systematic reviews have been done to compare women with men for either the morphological suitability for minimally invasive endovascular repair or for non-intervention rates.

Added value of this study

Operative mortality is not the first step in the care pathway of a patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm of a size at which intervention is considered. First the patient must be assessed, including imaging, to evaluate the extent of their aneurysm and whether the aortic morphology might be suitable for endovascular repair. Often the next step is discussion of the patient at a multidisciplinary team meeting, where the decision to offer a repair and what type of repair is made. The gold standard for surgical reporting is 30-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality is often lower than 30-day mortality. Our study, using international data, shows that at each step of the care pathway, women fare worse than men. Fewer women than men are deemed morphologically suitable for endovascular repair, more women than men are not offered an intervention, and the 30-day operative mortality is almost twice as high in women than in men for both endovascular and open repair.

Implications of all the available evidence

Previously, abdominal aortic aneurysm has been considered as having a strong male preponderance and aneurysm screening is recommended for men, but not for women. Nowadays, women constitute a third of the patients presenting with the devastating complication of rupture. This presentation might result, in part, from only two-thirds of women with a large intact abdominal aortic aneurysm being offered a corrective intervention, which in turn, might be partly because their more complex aortic morphology renders them unsuitable for the lower risk endovascular repair. The default option of open repair is associated with an unacceptably high mortality, which might even be increasing with time, possibly because these are the most challenging cases in which endovascular repair was not feasible and the expertise with open repair is waning. The management of abdominal aortic aneurysm in women needs urgent improvement.
