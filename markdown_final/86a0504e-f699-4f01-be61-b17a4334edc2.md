## Question

Which conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of systemic pruritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of systemic pruritus without primary skin disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the problem and anchor the approach in guideline-based evaluation. Then, I should categorize the causes by pathophysiology and highlight red flags that change urgency. Next, I will outline a staged diagnostic workup with labs and imaging. After that, I need to consider population-specific nuances. Finally, I will synthesize evidence-based symptomatic and disease-directed treatments, noting areas of conflicting guidance and limited evidence, while keeping verification at each step aligned to high-credibility sources [^1146KnPG] [^112EiWPf].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: generalized/systemic pruritus without obvious primary skin disease requires a parallel path — exclude primary dermatoses by exam/skin testing while screening for systemic causes with targeted labs and imaging, because up to half of chronic itch is extracutaneous and primary lesions vs secondary excoriations is the key first branch point [^114KEFY5] [^112qkqxD] [^114BE4X8] [^111XYUnR].

> Hold on, I should verify the major etiologic buckets before diving in: hepatobiliary cholestasis, renal disease, endocrine/metabolic, hematologic/lymphoproliferative malignancy, solid tumors/paraneoplastic, infectious, neuropathic, psychiatric/psychogenic, drug-induced, pregnancy-specific dermatoses, autoimmune/inflammatory, nutritional deficiencies, and CPUO when exhaustive evaluation is negative, which matches international guidance and epidemiologic reviews of chronic itch without rash [^1146KnPG] [^113w8Fsx] [^111XYUnR] [^1137S2So].

> Let me consider hepatobiliary and cholestatic causes first because they are frequent and clinically pivotal: PBC, PSC, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, chronic viral hepatitis, NAFLD, and hepatic sarcoidosis can all present with pruritus — sometimes preceding jaundice — with pathophysiology increasingly linked to autotaxin/LPA and possibly MRGPRX4 signaling rather than bile salts alone [^117UtYWL] [^114Ln9SQ] [^115Mo57t] [^117AwLRN].

> Next, I will examine renal and endocrine/metabolic contributors: uremic pruritus in CKD/dialysis is common and multifactorial, and thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, and disorders of calcium-phosphate-PTH homeostasis also contribute; initial labs should therefore include renal, hepatic, thyroid, glucose/A1c, and iron studies with ESR/CRP as needed, aligning with primary care and dermatology guidance [^112EiWPf] [^111LkijD] [^114KEFY5].

> I need to check hematologic and lymphoproliferative malignancies because lymphoma-associated itch (notably Hodgkin's) can precede diagnosis by months, and aquagenic pruritus should raise concern for polycythemia vera; age > 60 with new diffuse pruritus warrants malignancy consideration and tailored investigations, including LDH, CXR, and age-appropriate cancer screening [^111wngPg] [^115J9SjV] [^111XYUnR] [^111xjjux].

> But wait, solid tumors can also present with paraneoplastic pruritus and syndromes (e.g., dermatomyositis, erythroderma); I should confirm that in older adults or those with systemic symptoms, a malignancy screen is not delayed when the skin is clear yet itch is severe or refractory [^111wngPg] [^113GC9u1] [^111XYUnR].

> I will now review infectious etiologies: HIV and viral hepatitis are classic culprits; travel/exposure histories guide evaluation for parasites like strongyloides or schistosomiasis; scabies should remain on the radar even when burrows are not obvious, especially with household spread and a papular distribution [^113w8Fsx] [^115qwVFx] [^115hHewQ].

> Let me think about neuropathic itch: localized syndromes (notalgia paresthetica, brachioradial) and generalized small fiber neuropathy or diabetic neuropathy can drive persistent pruritus; clinical patterns plus neurologic testing where indicated and response to neuromodulators (gabapentinoids) reinforce this diagnosis [^115usUAU] [^113vqX1W].

> I should confirm the role of psychogenic and functional itch disorders: anxiety, depression, OCD, and somatic symptom disorder can sustain pruritus cycles; behavioral strategies and treating comorbid mental health conditions are recommended adjuncts, especially when the workup is unrevealing or mixed [^1166xRyz] [^1146KnPG].

> Hold on, I should verify drug-induced itch: opioids, calcium channel blockers, hydrochlorothiazide, ACE inhibitors, amiodarone, allopurinol, hormonal therapies, and cytotoxics are common triggers; the temporal relationship and resolution on withdrawal are key clues, particularly in polypharmacy and in older adults [^1129DEwk] [^113paMho].

> Next, pregnancy-specific conditions deserve a separate pass: intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is high-risk and mandates urgent bile acid testing; polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, and atopic eruption of pregnancy have distinct clinical patterns and management pathways that require obstetric coordination [^112EGbR3] [^115ct4c8].

> I need to ensure autoimmune and inflammatory systemic diseases are not missed: SLE, Sjögren's (xerosis), systemic sclerosis, sarcoidosis, and IBD (with PSC links) can present with itch, and cholestatic liver test patterns or biopsy clues should direct biliary imaging when appropriate [^117V4beC] [^112UifuD].

> Let me reconsider nutritional and metabolic contributors: iron deficiency — with or without anemia — zinc and vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate itch; hence iron studies and selected micronutrient evaluation can be justified when initial screens are unrevealing or clinical suspicion is high [^112EiWPf] [^114KEFY5].

> When exhaustive evaluation is negative, I should double-check the criteria for chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO): it accounts for a meaningful fraction of chronic itch, may have type 2 immune signatures in some patients, and management relies on symptom control and neuromodulation with shared decision-making given limited high-quality trial data [^116xy64i] [^115bdb1Z] [^111XYUnR].

> Now, the diagnostic approach — let me first confirm the essentials: take a meticulous history (onset, diurnal/nocturnal pattern, localization, triggers, meds/supplements, exposures/travel, pregnancy), perform a complete skin exam including finger webs, scalp, nails, anogenital area, and classify lesions as primary vs secondary; add skin scraping/biopsy/culture if the etiology remains unclear or infestation/inflammatory dermatoses are suspected [^114KEFY5] [^112qkqxD] [^113paMho].

> Next, I should review the first-line laboratory screen: CBC with differential (eosinophils), CMP including liver enzymes and bilirubin, BUN/creatinine, TSH, fasting glucose or A1c, iron studies (ferritin/iron/TIBC), with ESR/CRP as adjuncts; then tailor second-line tests by suspicion — HBV/HCV serologies, GGT, AMA/ANA for cholestasis, HIV testing, PTH/calcium/phosphate for CKD, LDH/uric acid/peripheral smear for hematologic disease, and bile acids in pregnancy [^112EiWPf] [^113w8Fsx] [^114KEFY5].

> I will now examine when to image: CXR for lymphoma/sarcoidosis or paraneoplastic suspicion, abdominal ultrasound for hepatobiliary disease and organomegaly, and cross-sectional imaging or MRCP/ERCP when cholestasis or PSC is suspected; in large-duct PSC with progressive pruritus, exclude treatable strictures endoscopically before escalating medical therapy [^112UifuD] [^111XYUnR] [^114KEFY5].

> But wait, what if the patient is older than 60 with diffuse itch and normal skin — should I escalate malignancy screening early? Yes, guidelines support a low threshold for age-appropriate screening and targeted imaging/labs in this group and in anyone with B symptoms or laboratory red flags, to avoid missing neoplastic etiologies [^111XYUnR] [^111wngPg].

> For immediate symptomatic care while the workup proceeds, I need to ensure foundational measures: trigger avoidance, gentle skin care with liberal emollients, short/tepid bathing, and moisturizers matched to xerosis severity are recommended as first-line nonpharmacologic strategies [^111BRfTw] [^113paMho].

> Let me first confirm the role of antihistamines: non-sedating H1 antagonists are appropriate for histaminergic conditions like urticaria and as an initial symptomatic trial, with sedating agents at night if sleep is affected; however, many systemic itch syndromes are nonhistaminergic and will not respond, so expectations must be managed [^111qBPmb] [^112EiWPf] [^116uE25d].

> I should review neuromodulators next: gabapentin or pregabalin are guideline-endorsed for neuropathic and CKD-associated pruritus or refractory/undetermined chronic pruritus, titrated to effect while monitoring for sedation and dizziness, which is especially relevant in older adults [^1148gazg] [^113vqX1W] [^116thVRc].

> Hold on, I should verify antidepressant options: mirtazapine and certain SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine) can benefit psychogenic pruritus and refractory cases, including malignant, cholestatic, or CKD-related itch, particularly for nocturnal symptoms and comorbid mood disturbance [^1146KnPG] [^116wFZS3].

> Let me consider phototherapy: narrowband UVB can be added to topical/systemic measures in selected chronic pruritus phenotypes (avoiding combination with calcineurin inhibitors or systemic immunosuppressants), recognizing heterogeneous evidence and the need for safety monitoring [^116sW932] [^112tTwvW].

> I need to check opioid-axis modulation: mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone) can be considered in refractory chronic pruritus, especially cholestatic itch; they are also used second-line in PSC-related pruritus per hepatology guidance, with attention to adverse effects and contraindications [^1149bjEd] [^112di2Sm].

> Next, I should review NK1 receptor antagonists and biologics: NK1 antagonists like serlopitant have emerging but mixed evidence; omalizumab is useful in refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria with itch, and dupilumab is appropriate for atopic dermatitis with refractory pruritus — outside these, evidence remains insufficient for chronic pruritus of other origins [^111Q9pTs] [^112Xf7vA].

> Hmm, wait a minute — there is conflicting guidance on serotonin receptor antagonists: the BAD suggests ondansetron can be considered for generalized pruritus, while the EADV/EDF S2k guideline recommends against serotonin receptor antagonists in chronic pruritus overall; given this discrepancy and limited evidence, I would reserve ondansetron for selected refractory cases after guideline-preferred options fail, documenting response and adverse effects [^112AsW14] [^113HJ4qZ].

> For cholestatic/hepatic pruritus specifically, let me first confirm the hepatology sequence: start with cholestyramine (bile acid sequestrant) after conservative measures; if inadequate, consider rifampin, naltrexone, or sertraline in stepwise fashion per society guidance; in PSC, always exclude/treat relevant dominant strictures before pharmacologic escalation, and reserve advanced interventions (e.g., phototherapy, nasobiliary drainage, extracorporeal therapies, transplantation) for intractable cases [^115VATt6] [^114gT7aV] [^112di2Sm] [^113ebpDk].

> In uremic pruritus, I should double-check the basics before medications: ensure adequate dialysis, correct calcium-phosphate balance, manage secondary hyperparathyroidism, and treat anemia; then consider gabapentinoids and adjunctive topical/phototherapy as needed [^111LkijD] [^1148gazg].

> For persistent diagnostic uncertainty with prominent nocturnal itch or sleep loss, I need to ensure comorbid insomnia and mood are addressed concurrently, as symptomatic therapy should proceed in parallel with the workup to prevent chronicity and central sensitization that can perpetuate itch even after the cause is treated [^114BE4X8] [^112tTwvW].

> Let me first confirm objective monitoring: use validated itch scales such as the 0–10 numerical rating scale (e.g. PP-NRS/WI-NRS), where a 2–4 point reduction is typically clinically meaningful, to track response across visits and therapies [^117JwiqT].

> Finally, I should summarize the red flags that change urgency: cholestatic symptoms or pregnancy (prompt bile acids), B symptoms/age > 60 with new-onset generalized itch (accelerate malignancy evaluation), immunosuppression or travel exposures (prioritize infectious testing), and rapidly progressive or aquagenic itch (consider hematologic causes); keeping these front-of-mind prevents premature closure and missed time-sensitive diagnoses [^111XYUnR] [^113w8Fsx] [^115J9SjV].

Systemic pruritus has a **broad differential** [^111XYUnR], spanning renal, hepatic, hematologic, endocrine, infectious, neurologic, drug-induced, and psychogenic causes [^114KEFY5] [^114BE4X8]. A **focused history, exam, and targeted labs** (CBC, CMP, LFTs, TSH, fasting glucose, HIV/HBV/HCV serologies) [^113w8Fsx] are essential [^114KEFY5]; obtain imaging and biopsy as indicated [^111XYUnR] [^112qkqxD]. Management should target the **underlying cause**, with symptomatic options including antihistamines [^112EiWPf], gabapentinoids [^1148gazg], antidepressants [^1146KnPG], and phototherapy [^116sW932].

---

## Renal causes

**Chronic kidney disease (CKD)** commonly causes uremic pruritus [^114KEFY5] that is often generalized and worse at night [^111XYUnR], while **dialysis-related pruritus** may reflect inadequate dialysis, hyperparathyroidism, or calcium-phosphate imbalance [^111LkijD].

---

## Hepatic causes

Hepatic causes are often **cholestatic liver diseases** [^117UtYWL] — primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy [^114KEFY5] — which frequently cause pruritus [^111XYUnR]. Chronic hepatitis B and C infections [^111XYUnR] can also present with pruritus [^114KEFY5], and pruritus may occur in chronic alcohol-related liver disease [^114KEFY5].

---

## Hematologic and oncologic causes

- **Polycythemia vera**: Aquagenic pruritus is characteristic [^114KEFY5] [^111XYUnR].

- **Hodgkin lymphoma**: Pruritus can precede other symptoms [^114KEFY5] [^113GC9u1] [^111XYUnR].

- **Myeloproliferative disorders**: Essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis may cause pruritus [^114KEFY5] [^113zfJCK].

- **Paraneoplastic syndromes**: Solid tumors (e.g. pancreatic, lung) can present with pruritus [^114KEFY5] [^113GC9u1].

---

## Endocrine and metabolic causes

- **Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism**: Both can cause generalized pruritus [^111XYUnR] [^114KEFY5].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Pruritus may result from xerosis or neuropathy [^111XYUnR] [^114KEFY5].

- **Hyperparathyroidism**: Associated with pruritus due to calcium-phosphate imbalance [^114KEFY5] [^114FxJ2y].

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Generalized pruritus is common [^114KEFY5] [^111XYUnR].

---

## Infectious causes

- **HIV infection**: Pruritus is common, often due to xerosis, drug reactions, or opportunistic infections [^115qwVFx] [^114KEFY5].

- **Hepatitis B and C**: Chronic infections can cause pruritus [^114KEFY5] [^111XYUnR].

- **Parasitic infections**: Strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, and scabies can cause generalized pruritus [^114KEFY5] [^113w8Fsx] [^115hHewQ].

---

## Neurologic causes

Neurologic causes include **small fiber neuropathy**, in which generalized pruritus results from nerve fiber damage [^115usUAU] [^114KEFY5]. Multiple sclerosis can present with pruritus [^111XYUnR], and central nervous system lesions after stroke may produce post-stroke pruritus [^114KEFY5].

---

## Drug-induced pruritus

Drug-induced pruritus is often precipitated by **opioids**, which can cause generalized itch without rash [^114b6Afb]. ACE inhibitors, statins, and antibiotics are also associated with pruritus [^114KEFY5], and many chemotherapeutic agents also cause pruritus [^114KEFY5] [^1129DEwk].

---

## Psychogenic pruritus

**Anxiety and depression** are commonly associated with generalized pruritus [^114KEFY5], and **somatoform disorders** (Functional itch disorder) can present with chronic pruritus [^114BE4X8].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured diagnostic approach** begins with a detailed history, medication review, and thorough skin examination [^114KEFY5]. Initial laboratory testing typically includes a CBC; renal and liver function tests; thyroid function tests; fasting glucose; and HIV, HBV, and HCV serologies [^111XYUnR] [^113w8Fsx]. Imaging with chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, or CT scan is warranted when malignancy or organ involvement is suspected [^111wngPg] [^111XYUnR], and skin biopsy is indicated for persistent unexplained pruritus or when a primary dermatologic disease is suspected [^112qkqxD].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause**, which is essential for long-term relief [^114KEFY5]. Symptomatic therapy includes antihistamines [^112EiWPf], gabapentin or pregabalin [^1148gazg], antidepressants [^1146KnPG], and phototherapy [^116sW932]. Non-pharmacologic measures such as emollients [^111BRfTw], trigger avoidance, and psychosocial interventions are also recommended [^1166xRyz].

---

In summary, systemic pruritus has a **broad differential**. A **structured diagnostic approach** and **targeted management** are essential for effective treatment.

### Chronic pruritus in the absence of skin disease: Pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^114BE4X8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus arises not only from dermatoses but also, in up to half of cases, from extracutaneous origins. A multitude of systemic, neurological, psychiatric, and somatoform conditions are associated with pruritus in the absence of skin disease. Moreover, pruritus is a frequently observed side effect of many drugs, making it difficult for physicians to make a correct diagnosis. Chronic pruritus patients frequently present to the dermatologist with skin lesions secondary to long-lasting scratching behavior, such as lichenification and prurigo nodularis. A structured clinical history and physical examination are essential to evaluate the pruritus, along with systematic, medical history-adapted laboratory and radiological tests carried out according to the differential diagnosis.

- **Symptomatic therapy**: For therapeutic reasons, symptomatic therapy should be promptly initiated parallel to the diagnostic procedures. Once the underlying factor(s) leading to the pruritus are identified, a targeted therapy should be implemented. Importantly, the treatment of accompanying disorders such as sleep disturbances or mental symptoms should be taken into consideration. Even after successful treatment of the underlying cause, pruritus may persist, likely due to chronicity processes including peripheral and central sensitization or impaired inhibition at the spinal level. A vast arsenal of topical and systemic agents targeting these pathophysiological mechanisms has been used to deter further chronicity. The therapeutic options currently available are, however, still insufficient for many patients.

### Itch: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic workup [^111XYUnR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Itch, or pruritus, is the uncomfortable sensation underlying the desire to scratch. It is a very common complaint in the general population that can result from dermatologic, systemic (e.g. renal, hepatobiliary, endocrine), paraneoplastic, neuropathic, and psychogenic etiologies. Chronic itch is associated with significant sleep disturbances and profoundly reduces overall quality of life. Certain populations, including the elderly and African Americans, are at increased risk of experiencing a heightened burden of itch.

Because of the variable clinical presentation and wide-ranging etiologies, itch presents a challenge for clinicians. The initial evaluation should include a complete blood count with differential, as well as hepatic, renal, and thyroid function testing along with diabetes screening. Further testing should be guided by history and physical examination findings. There should be a heightened concern for underlying malignancy in individuals older than 60 years of age who have a history of liver disease and diffuse itch of less than 12 months' duration.

For individuals with chronic pruritus of unknown origin, increased blood eosinophils may serve as a biomarker of T helper cell type 2 polarization and response to immunomodulator therapies. In this first part of a two-part continuing medical education series, we describe the broader epidemiology and specific conditions associated with itch, as well as the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup for patients with itch.

### Diffuse pruritic eruption and eosinophilia [^111xjjux]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Which is true for cutaneous manifestations of this systemic disease?
	- A. Cutaneous manifestations are the most common presenting finding.
	- B. Cutaneous manifestations occur when the systemic disease directly involves the skin.
	- C. Cutaneous manifestations are usually diagnosed after the systemic disease.
	- D. Cutaneous manifestations persist after treatment of the systemic disease.
	- E. Cutaneous manifestations that recur may signal relapse of the systemic disease.

- **Answers**:
	- A. Cutaneous manifestations are the most common presenting finding – Incorrect. Cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) are rarely the presenting clinical finding in HL patients (6.3% of cases); although if isolated pruritus is considered a PNS, this would be by far the most frequent presentation for this malignancy.
	- B. Cutaneous manifestations occur when the systemic disease directly involves the skin – Incorrect. Cutaneous PNS are not related to direct tumor invasion nor distant metastasis to skin but rather malignancy-induced immune dysfunction.
	- C. Cutaneous manifestations are usually diagnosed after the systemic disease – Incorrect. Most patients with cutaneous PNS lack constitutional symptoms and are diagnosed simultaneously with HL. Dermatologists should be aware of HL-associated cutaneous PNS where a timely diagnosis may improve prognosis.
	- D. Cutaneous manifestations persist after treatment of the systemic disease – Incorrect. Most PNS (such as pruritus and eczematous rashes) completely resolve with HL therapy. This patient had symptom resolution after 2 cycles of chemotherapy.

### Chronic prurigo including prurigo nodularis: New insights and treatments [^115dzryX]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic prurigo (CPG) is made clinically. However, the origin of chronic pruritus needs to be identified. Accordingly, it is essential to obtain a comprehensive medical history, which includes itch-specific details (e.g. onset of itch, itch intensity), as well as a careful assessment of medications, comorbidities, and psychiatric history.

During the physical examination, the distribution and type of pruriginous lesions need to be determined. Lesions can be single in number and localized to a single area, or they can be numerous and spread throughout the entire skin. The severity of chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG) is determined primarily by the number of lesions and can be objectively assessed using validated clinician-reported outcome tools such as the Prurigo Activity and Severity (PAS) score and Investigator's Global Assessments (IGA) for chronic prurigo.

The physical examination also aims to identify associated skin diseases that might have induced pruritus and thus are an etiological factor in CNPG. For the same reason, the examination should include a check of mucous membranes and palpation of the liver, kidneys, spleen, and lymph nodes. This can help identify any underlying systemic diseases contributing to CNPG.

To further investigate the potential underlying etiology of CNPG, a laboratory workup is recommended. This may involve conducting a blood count, including a differential blood count, measuring C-reactive protein (CRP), evaluating liver function, and other relevant tests.

### HIV-associated pruritus: Etiology and management [^115qwVFx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), life-threatening opportunistic infections have become less common in patients with HIV infection, and longevity has increased dramatically. With increased longevity, the challenges of living with a chronic disease have become more prominent in this patient population. Disorders such as fat redistribution and metabolic abnormalities can result from antiviral medications and from HIV disease itself. Pruritus is one of the most common symptoms encountered in patients with HIV.

The spectrum of skin diseases in such patients encompasses dermatoses of diverse etiologies; a few are peculiar to patients with HIV, while others are not. Some of these conditions may cause severe and sometimes intractable pruritus that provokes scratching, picking, disfigurement, sleep loss, and significant psychological stress. Moreover, the expense of ongoing medical treatments can be daunting. A skin rash can sometimes be the initial presentation of HIV infection or serve as a harbinger of disease progression. Causes of pruritus include:

- **Skin infections, infestations, and papulosquamous disorders**: Skin-related issues are common and can lead to severe discomfort.
- **Photodermatitis and xerosis**: These conditions can exacerbate skin irritation and lead to further complications.
- **Drug reactions**: Particularly common in patients who are HIV positive, presumably due to immune dysregulation, altered drug metabolism, and polypharmacy.
- **Lymphoproliferative disorders**: Occasionally cause pruritus.

Itching can also result from systemic diseases such as chronic renal failure, liver disease, or systemic lymphoma. The workup of pruritus should include a careful examination of the skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes.

### Urticarial lesions: If not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: Part I. Cutaneous diseases [^112dHgQ7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Acute urticaria is self-limiting, and a cause can be identified in many patients. Chronic urticaria is a long-lasting disease, and patients are commonly examined for an autoimmune origin and associated diseases. Although the diagnosis of urticaria is straightforward in most patients, it may pose some difficulties at times, and careful differential diagnosis with a number of conditions may be required. Urticarial syndromes comprise both cutaneous and systemic disorders. Part I of this two-part series focuses on the clinical and histologic features that characterize common urticaria and the cutaneous diseases that may manifest with urticarial lesions, which must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

- **Learning objectives**: After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish between the typical wheals of urticaria and urticarial lesions suggesting other diagnoses, and to assess patients with urticarial lesions in order to exclude or confirm other cutaneous diseases.

### Urticarial lesions: If not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: part II. Systemic diseases [^111Qcgrx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). High credibility.

There are a number of systemic disorders that can manifest with urticarial skin lesions, including urticarial vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes. All of these conditions may enter into the differential diagnosis of ordinary urticaria. In contrast to urticaria, urticarial syndromes may manifest with skin lesions other than wheals, such as papules, necrosis, vesicles, and hemorrhages. Lesions may have a bilateral and symmetrical distribution; individual lesions have a long duration, and their resolution frequently leaves marks, such as hyperpigmentation or bruising. Moreover, systemic symptoms, such as fever, asthenia, and arthralgia, may be present. The most important differential diagnosis in this group is urticarial vasculitis, which is a small-vessel vasculitis with predominant cutaneous involvement. Systemic involvement in urticarial vasculitis affects multiple organs (mainly joints, the lungs, and the kidneys) and is more frequent and more severe in patients with hypocomplementemia. Clinicopathologic correlation is essential to establishing a correct diagnosis.

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish urticarial lesions suggesting diagnoses other than common urticaria; assess patients with urticarial lesions, and suspect systemic diseases presenting with urticarial skin lesions.

### Mediators of pruritus during cholestasis [^114Ln9SQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Pruritus is a frequent symptom in patients with cholestatic liver diseases. Itching may be excruciating, seriously impairing quality of life, and can even induce suicidal ideation in the most severe cases.

The molecular mechanism of itch signal transduction in cholestasis is largely unclear. It may be caused or potentiated by compounds that accumulate in the circulation during cholestasis, which either directly or indirectly affect signaling in itch fibers. In the past, while bile salts and endogenous opioids have been proposed, they have never been proven as key factors in itch perception during cholestasis.

A screen for compounds in plasma from patients with various cholestatic conditions was performed to assess their capacity to activate neuronal cell lines. In these sera, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a potent neuronal activator, was identified. LPA is a very potent signaling phospholipid that can activate cells through various LPA receptors. Notably, samples from itchy cholestatic patients contained higher amounts of LPA. These elevated levels of LPA were attributed to increased levels of serum autotaxin, the enzyme that converts lysophosphatidylcholine into LPA. This is a striking finding as autotaxin has never been connected to itch perception thus far. Additionally, it was demonstrated that LPA, when injected intradermally, caused scratching behavior in mice.

Based on these results, it is hypothesized that during cholestasis, the expression of autotaxin is induced, leading to increased local formation of LPA near unmyelinated nerve endings.

### Pruritus in pregnancy [^112EGbR3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Pruritus in pregnancy is a common and burdensome symptom that may be the first sign of a pregnancy-specific pruritic disease, such as atopic eruption of pregnancy, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, or intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy. It can also be a dermatosis coinciding with pregnancy by chance. Despite its high prevalence, pruritus is often underrated by physicians, and data regarding the safety profiles of drugs for pruritus are very limited.

In this review, we illustrate the epidemiology, possible pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and diagnostic workup of various pregnancy-related diseases and discuss antipruritic treatments. The prevalence of pruritus in pregnancy demonstrates the importance of symptom recognition and the need for a holistic approach, taking into account both the potential benefits for the patient and the potential risks to the fetus.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^115LNnSt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis)**: The close association between itch and jaundice has been recognized since antiquity, with the ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia describing cholestatic itch in the second century. Itch associated with chronic liver disease is referred to as hepatic pruritus. When cholestasis significantly contributes to hepatic pruritus, it is also called cholestatic pruritus. The chronic liver diseases that may cause hepatic or cholestatic pruritus include cholestatic diseases (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, or hereditary pediatric cholestatic disorders) and other chronic liver diseases (e.g. chronic hepatitis C virus infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). A large-scale surveillance study conducted in Japan revealed that 40.3% of patients with chronic liver diseases complain of itch. The prevalence of itch varies among chronic liver diseases, with higher prevalences observed in overlap syndrome (60.0%), primary biliary cirrhosis (51.4%), chronic hepatitis C virus infection (45.4%), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (44.7%). In contrast, relatively lower prevalences are observed in alcoholic liver disease (24.3%) and inactive hepatitis B virus carriers (22.2%). Cholestatic pruritus typically affects the limbs and the back, although it can be generalized. Of note, hepatic pruritus can precede the appearance of jaundice.

The pathogenesis of hepatic itch remains unclear. Recent studies have indicated that abnormalities in lysophosph…

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^115E9U5X]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Itch, also known as pruritus, is one of the most prevalent symptoms observed in dermatological practices. Itch frequently arises from primary pruritic dermatoses, although it may also manifest in the absence of a primary pruritic skin rash. The latter itchy condition is referred to as "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese guidelines published in 2020. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus.

- **Localized cutaneous pruritus**: This is indicative of a neuropathic cause.
- **Generalized cutaneous pruritus**: This suggests underlying systemic diseases, drug-induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO). Systemic diseases associated with cutaneous pruritus include disorders of iron metabolism, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis), endocrine/metabolic diseases, hematological disorders, and malignant solid tumors.

CPUO is a term used to describe chronic itch that is often generalized and for which no underlying cause can be identified despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup. A variety of treatment approaches are available for cutaneous pruritus, including device-based physical therapies (such as phototherapy) and medications that act on the itch-perception processing pathway from the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, to the brain. This review presents an overview of the knowledge regarding cutaneous pruritus, from its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms to its management.

### Practical guidelines for the use of steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of chronic pruritus [^113eiStZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus in adult patients is both an underappreciated and difficult-to-treat condition. In the vast majority of cases, itch results from inflammatory skin disease and may respond to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies. Urticarial dermatitis is an under-recognized cause of chronic itch in the adult population. Patients with this disorder are characterized by prolonged, prednisone-responsive pruritus, often in the absence of substantial cutaneous findings. Skin findings, when present, can range from subtle, persistent urticarial lesions to excoriated papules, often intermixed with urticaria, eczematous change, and lichenification secondary to chronic scratching.

Hereby, we describe our algorithm for the evaluation and management of adult patients with refractory pruritus, particularly urticarial dermatitis. This includes evaluation for other etiologies of pruritus, pre-immunosuppression workup, and the use of azathioprine and other steroid-sparing agents for the treatment of recalcitrant itch.

The differential diagnosis is broad in a patient presenting with jaundice and pruritus, whose laboratory workup shows conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. A useful branch point is determining if the obstruction is extrahepatic or intrahepatic. A history inconsistent with an acute presentation and an unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound narrows the differential to intrahepatic causes of cholestasis. With findings of ductal dilatation and non-necrotising granulomas on biopsy, the leading differential for our patient included primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and biliary sarcoidosis.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^115bdb1Z]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

In instances where patients present with chronic itch and no underlying origin for pruritus can be determined despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup, a diagnosis of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) can be assigned. CPUO often features "generalized" itch, but the extent to which this condition is generalized varies. It is estimated that approximately 6% of patients with chronic pruritus can be diagnosed as having CPUO. This itch may occur at any age. The pathogenesis of CPUO remains naturally uncertain. Some CPUO patients show an immunologic profile skewed toward type 2 immunity, evidenced by peripheral eosinophilia and type 2–related lesional gene expressions. Treatment agents targeting type 2 inflammation have been shown to improve itch in CPUO, including JAK inhibitors and dupilumab. A recent study has reported that downregulation of metabolic pathways related to catecholamine biosynthesis and tryptophan biosynthesis is observed in patients with CPUO. Further studies are required to elucidate this issue.

### Pruritus in cholestasis: facts and fiction [^117UtYWL]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pruritus is a common symptom in patients with cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, or hereditary pediatric cholestatic disorders and may accompany, although less frequently, many other liver diseases. Recent findings indicate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a potent neuronal activator, and autotaxin (ATX; ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2), the enzyme which forms LPA, may form a key element of the long-sought pruritogenic signaling cascade in cholestatic patients suffering from itch. Serum ATX, but no other pruritogen candidate studied so far, correlates with pruritus intensity and responds to therapeutic interventions. In this comprehensive review, we provide a short update on actual insights in signal transmission related to pruritus and discuss pruritogen candidates in cholestasis. We also summarize evidence-based and guideline-approved as well as experimental therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from pruritus in cholestasis.

### 2020 guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous pruritus [^1116QfuT]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying itch are not fully understood. Physicians usually encounter difficulty controlling itch in generalized pruritus. Since only a small percentage of patients with generalized pruritus respond to antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists), a variety of itch mediators and mechanisms other than histaminergic signals are considered to be involved in itch for these non-responsive patients. In 2012, we created guidelines for generalized pruritus. Those guidelines have been updated and revised to make some of the definitions, diagnostic terms, and classifications more applicable to daily clinical practice. Cutaneous pruritus, as designated in these guidelines, is a disease characterized by itch without an observable rash.

Generalized pruritus (without skin inflammation) is defined as the presence of itch over a wide area and not localized to a specific part of the body. This entity includes idiopathic pruritus, pruritus in the elderly, symptomatic pruritus, pregnancy-associated pruritus, drug-induced pruritus, and psychogenic pruritus. Localized pruritus (without skin inflammation) represents fixed itch localized to a specific part of the body and includes anogenital pruritus, scalp pruritus, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. These guidelines outline the concepts and specify the diagnostic methods and treatments for cutaneous pruritus.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^114NGdFK]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnostic procedures for cutaneous pruritus involve several steps. The initial step is to ascertain that the presence of a primary rash is apparent on the skin. In the absence of a pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made. If a primary pruritic dermatosis is evident but the appropriate treatment for it does not alleviate the itch, the possibility of a coexistence of a pruritic dermatosis with cutaneous pruritus should be considered.

- **Diagnostic procedures**: The initial step is to ascertain whether the presence of a primary rash is present on the skin. In the absence of a pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made, and further examination determines which type of cutaneous pruritus the patient has. CKD‐aP refers to chronic kidney disease–associated pruritus.

Localized itch is favorably indicative of a neuropathic origin, whereas generalized itch suggests alternative forms of cutaneous pruritus. This includes cutaneous pruritus with underlying systemic disease(s), drug‐induced itch, psychogenic itch (functional itch disorder), and CPUO. A comprehensive examination for underlying systemic disease(s) is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Systematic review: Efficacy of therapies for cholestatic pruritus [^1166BiwV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

We comprehensively searched four major databases: EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. From their inception until 11 March 2023, these databases were searched to identify all relevant studies on cholestatic pruritus (CP) therapies. We also explored ongoing clinical trials related to CP therapies on ClinicalTrial.gov and reviewed conference proceedings. This was necessary because CP therapies have rapidly evolved in recent years, and new therapies may not have been fully documented in published literature. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of our review, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a widely recognized tool for conducting systematic reviews. We limited our search to articles published in English to ensure consistency in our review.

To capture the most relevant studies, we used a set of keywords that included 'pruritus', 'cholestasis', 'cholestatic pruritus', 'cholestasis associated pruritus', 'cholestatic liver disease', 'itch', and 'IBAT inhibitors' in our initial review.

- **Study eligibility**: The methods used in this study involved conducting a comprehensive literature search across various databases, with no limitations placed on the duration of the studies or the follow-up period. The search results were screened by two independent reviewers using a two-step process, which involved evaluating the title and abstract of each article, reviewing the full text of relevant articles, and examining the references cited within those articles.

### Practical approaches for diagnosis and management of prurigo nodularis: United States expert panel consensus [^114prQiE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disease characterized by intensely pruritic, raised, nodular lesions. Because there are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies specifically for PN, management is highly variable, and no consensus exists on treatment regimens.

- **Objective**: To provide practical guidance to help United States dermatologists diagnose and effectively treat patients with PN.

- **Methods**: We participated in a roundtable discussion to develop consensus recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of PN from a United States perspective.

- **Results**: The core findings in PN are the presence of firm, nodular lesions; pruritus lasting at least 6 weeks; and a history or signs, or both, of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing. The diagnostic workup involves a complete review of systems, considering potential systemic diseases, and assessment of disease severity, including disease burden and pruritus intensity. Treatment should be selected based on a patient's clinical presentation, comorbidities, and response to prior treatments and should address both neural and immunologic components of pruritus.

- **Limitations**: Data on PN are from anecdotal or small clinical trials, and all treatments are currently used off-label.

- **Conclusion**: An effective treatment approach for patients with PN should be based on clinical judgment and tailored to the individual needs of the patient.

### Cholestatic itch: Our current understanding of pathophysiology and treatments [^117AwLRN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Hepatic pruritus is common in liver conditions, including cholestasis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The pruritus can be severe enough to diminish sleep and decrease quality of life. The pathophysiology likely involves many molecules and receptors, including bile acids, bilirubin, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), endogenous opioids, and serotonin. Recent advances suggest a significant role of Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X4 (MRGPRX4) and autotaxin/LPA as key players in cholestatic pruritus. Further research is needed to develop increasingly targeted therapies with greater efficacy, especially given that many patients report itch refractory to various treatments. Cholestyramine was the only US FDA-approved drug for cholestatic pruritus until the recent approval of ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitors for use in the pediatric cholestatic conditions, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, and Alagille syndrome. Both medications decrease the bile acid pool. IBAT inhibitors are under investigation for broader use, and targeting LPA receptors and MRGPR4 are additional attractive options.

### Pruritus as a sign of systemic disease [^114FxJ2y]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Pruritus, one of the most common clinical manifestations in medicine, has been recognized for many centuries. Defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in the need to scratch, it is divided into acute and chronic stages, based on the duration of the clinical manifestation. Classically, pruritus is associated with cutaneous disorders; however, it may also accompany various systemic disorders, including renal, hepatic, hematologic, or oncologic, and be the first or solitary manifestation of an underlying systemic disease. Additionally, the clinical manifestation may occur as an adverse reaction to drug administration. The pathogenesis of itch is multifactorial, involving various neuromediators and cytokines, with a prominent role of the peripheral and central nervous system in its development.

Based on an underlying disorder, affected patients present different clinical patterns of pruritus. The diagnostic approach is based on detailed history taking and physical examination. Frequently, additional diagnostic measures, including laboratory or imaging tests, are performed, especially when the cause of pruritus is unknown. Pruritus remains a challenging clinical manifestation with significant importance for physicians managing systemic disorders.

### Prurigo nodularis imitators unmasked [^11731t93]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is characterized by chronic, nodular lesions on the extensor surfaces of the extremities and back. For experienced clinicians, the recognition of this diagnosis is usually not difficult; however, it is essential to consider differential diagnoses and to identify PN imitators. We report five patients with severe chronic pruritus who presented with skin lesions resembling PN. They were treated accordingly but were subsequently diagnosed with a different underlying disease, including nodular marginal zone lymphoma (1 case), delusional parasitosis (1 case), well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas arising among PN lesions (2 cases), and PN-like pemphigus foliaceus (1 case). Critical reassessment of the diagnosis of PN is important to avoid cognitive biases such as the availability bias, anchoring bias, or attribution bias, which could lead to delayed diagnosis of the actual disease, inappropriate treatment, and poorer outcome.

### Interventions for chronic pruritus of unknown origin [^116xy64i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Pruritus is a sensation that leads to the desire to scratch; its origin is unknown in 8% to 15% of affected patients. The prevalence of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) in individuals with generalized pruritus ranges from 3.6% to 44.5%, with the highest prevalence among the elderly. When the origin of pruritus is known, its management may be straightforward if an effective treatment for the causal disease is available. Treatment of CPUO is particularly difficult due to its unknown pathophysiology.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of interventions for CPUO in adults and children.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following up to July 2019: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for additional references to relevant trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We sought to include randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials that assessed interventions for CPUO, as defined in category VI ('Other pruritus of undetermined origin, or chronic pruritus of unknown origin') of the International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) classification, in children and adults. Eligible interventions were non-pharmacological or topical or systemic pharmacological interventions, and eligible comparators were another active treatment, placebo, sham procedures, or no treatment or equivalent (e.g. waiting list).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'Patient- or parent-reported pruritus…

### Mechanisms of pruritus in cholestasis: understanding and treating the itch [^115Mo57t]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Pruritus in cholestatic liver diseases can be a major burden and dramatically impair the quality of life of those affected. Here, we provide an update on the latest insights into the molecular pathogenesis of and novel therapeutic approaches for cholestasis-associated itch. Endogenous and exogenous small-molecule pruritogen candidates bind to their receptors on unmyelinated itch C-fibres in the skin.

Candidate pruritogens in cholestasis include certain lysophospholipids and sulfated progesterone metabolites, among others, whereas total bile acid or bilirubin conjugates seem unlikely to have a dominant role in the pathogenesis of cholestasis-associated pruritus. Transmission of itch signals via primary, secondary, and tertiary itch neurons to the postcentral gyrus and activation of scratch responses offer various targets for therapeutic intervention.

At present, evidence-based treatment options for pruritus in fibrosing cholangiopathies, such as primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist bezafibrate and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist rifampicin. In pruritus of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended and might be supported in the third trimester by rifampicin if needed. Alternatively, non-absorbable anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine, can be administered, albeit with poor trial evidence. Liver transplantation for intolerable refractory pruritus has become an extremely rare therapeutic strategy.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^114Ay6MS]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Various classifications of itch have been proposed based on criteria such as the duration of the condition, the underlying pathogenesis, the causes, the affected areas, and its characteristics.

- **Acute itch and chronic itch**: Itch that persists for a duration of fewer than 6 weeks is classified as acute itch. Chronic itch lasts for 6 weeks or more.

- **Chemical itch and mechanical itch**: The majority of itching sensations occur when sensory nerve fibers are activated by a single or combination of substances known as pruritogens. Furthermore, innocuous mechanical force can elicit an itching sensation, particularly in patients with chronic itch. The former type of itch is referred to as chemical itch and the latter is designated as mechanical itch.

- **Histaminergic itch and nonhistaminergic itch**: Itch-conveying sensory nerve fibers in the skin can be divided into two subsets: histaminergic nerves and nonhistaminergic nerves. Histaminergic nerves express histamine receptor H1R and are responsible for histamine-induced itch. Nonhistaminergic nerves show responsiveness to pruritogens other than histamine, leading to nonhistaminergic itch.

- **Inflammatory itch and neuropathic itch**: An itching sensation is usually associated with inflammatory conditions, particularly allergic inflammation (e.g. atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and contact dermatitis). The presence of inflammation facilitates the secretion of pruritogens from various sources.

### Neuropathic itch: Diagnosis and management [^115usUAU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus (CP) is a frequent symptom in the general population; in 8% of all patients, it has a neuropathic origin. CP is of neuropathic origin when nerve fiber damage is responsible for the symptom. The damage can be caused by compression or degeneration of the nerve fibers in the skin or extracutaneous in peripheral nerves or the central nervous system. There are significant differences in the pathogenesis and in the clinical presentation of neuropathic CP. Localized neuropathic CP, such as brachioradial pruritus or notalgia paresthetica, are due to a circumscribed nerve compression and are often limited to the corresponding dermatome. In contrast, generalized neuropathic CP, as seen in small fiber neuropathies, may be associated with a systemic or metabolic underlying disease. It is not always easy to establish the diagnosis because a variety of diseases can be responsible for this type of CP. The present study shows an overview of possible diseases, diagnostic tools, and the relevant therapy strategies.

### Pharmacological interventions for pruritus in adult palliative care patients [^115C55ge]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Pruritus is not the most prevalent symptom but is one of the most puzzling in palliative care patients. It can cause considerable discomfort and has a major impact on patients' quality of life. In the field of palliative care, pruritus occurs in patients with disparate underlying diseases, based on different pathological mechanisms, but ends in the same phenomenon. The pathogenesis of pruritus is complex and not fully elucidated, making it very difficult to treat effectively. Evidence-based treatment approaches are needed.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacological treatments for preventing or treating pruritus in adult palliative care patients.

- **Search methods**: A systematic literature search was performed up to January 2012 and updated in August 2012. The following databases were searched: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, DARE, CDSR) (2012, issue 8 of 12); MEDLINE (1950 to August 2012); EMBASE (1980 to August 2012) and three other databases. In addition, trial registries were searched, and the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews, and websites were checked. Investigators and specialists in pruritus and palliative care were contacted regarding unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of different pharmacological treatments on preventing or treating pruritus in palliative care patients were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed identified titles and abstracts.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pruritus [^113zfJCK]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de famille canadien (2017). High credibility.

Among other potential causes, generalized pruritus may result from various conditions such as scabies, polycythemia vera, Hodgkin's lymphoma, systemic mastocytosis, and malaria infection. Blood transfusions, chronic kidney disease, and shingles are other contributing factors. Viral infections like rabies, herpes virus 2, and herpes simplex are also known to trigger pruritus, in addition to West African and East African sleeping sickness.

Pruritus can arise from parasitic infections including kerion, threadworm infestation, strongyloidiasis, onchocerciasis, hookworm infection, mansonelliasis, lymphatic filariasis, dracunculiasis, cutaneous larva migrans, ankylostomiasis, acanthocheilonemiasis, phthiriasis, and tungiasis. Non-infectious conditions such as decompression sickness, chilblains, parasitophobia, functional disorders, and dermatitis artefacta can also lead to pruritus.

During pregnancy, conditions like polymorphic eruption of pregnancy and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy may cause itching. Other conditions include non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Dermatological disorders such as psoriasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, pemphigoid, multiple sclerosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, atopic dermatitis, and id reactions are known to cause pruritus as well.

Endocrine and metabolic disorders like hypoparathyroidism, pellagra, familial cold urticaria, primary cutaneous amyloidosis, and erythropoietic protoporphyria contribute to pruritus. Conditions such as Schamberg's disease, cholestatic liver disease, urticaria, transient acantholytic dermatosis, symptomatic dermatographism, prurigo nodularis, dyshidrotic eczema, and polymorphic light eruption also play a role.

Additional dermatological variants that may induce pruritus include pityriasis alba, pemphigoid gestationis, nummular dermatitis, notalgia paraesthetica, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, miliaria rubra, lichen striatus, lichen simplex chronicus, lichen aureus, kraurosis vulvae, and inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus. Furthermore, conditions such as Fox-Fordyce disease, fixed drug eruption, erythroderma, and erythema annulare centrifugum can be implicated as well.

Itch is a subjective and multidimensional experience, rendering it challenging to quantify. Moreover, there is currently a dearth of reliable biomarkers or objective tools for evaluating the severity of itch. Consequently, itch should be assessed based primarily on verbal expressions provided by patients. There are several major assessment tools for itch, as described below.

- **Numerical rating scale**: Patients are asked to rate their itch on an 11-point Likert scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 the worst itch imaginable. The score for itch intensity is provided out of 10, such as 7 of 10 or simply 7/10. The peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PP-NRS), also known as the worst itch numerical rating scale (WI-NRS), represents the individual's worst itch in the past 24 hours. Itch intensity measured with the numerical rating scale (NRS) can generally be categorized as follows:
	- No itch (NRS, 0)
	- Mild itch (NRS, 1–2)
	- Moderate itch (NRS, 3–6)
	- Severe itch (NRS, 7–8)
	- Very severe itch (NRS, 9–10)

	- Another widely used categorization:
	- No itch (NRS, 0)
	- Mild itch (NRS, 1–3)
	- Moderate itch (NRS, 4–6)
	- Severe itch (NRS, 7–10)

	- The PP-NRS is a widely utilized instrument in routine dermatological practices and clinical trials. The most appropriate threshold for defining a clinically relevant, within-person response is reported to be a ≥ 2- to 4-point change in the PP-NRS.

- **Visual analogue scale**: The visual analogue scale (VAS) consists of a horizontal 10-cm line with two endpoints of 0 (zero, no itch) at the left and 10 (worst imaginable itch) at the right. Patients indicate their level of itch by marking a point along the line, which is then measured in centimeters from the leftmost point to determine the itch intensity.

Treatment approaches acting on peripheral sensory nerves:

Antihistamines are well-established antipruritic agents that inhibit H1R, which is expressed by itch-transmitting peripheral sensory nerve fibers, and thus attenuates histaminergic itch. Histaminergic itch is a significant contributor to itch observed in urticaria and insect bites/stings. These forms of itch can be effectively treated with antihistamines. However, the majority of itching cases outside of these dermatoses may result from nonhistaminergic itch mechanisms, and, thus, antihistamines may not be the optimal treatment option.

Analgesics and anesthetics inhibit the activation of ion channels, particularly Na v channels, and the generation of action potentials (Figure 4). Topical creams containing lidocaine are available as over-the-counter antipruritics in Japan and other countries. Topical ketamine (10% or 5%)–amitriptyline (5%)–lidocaine (5%) (TKAL) has been demonstrated to alleviate both inflammatory itch (itch in atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) and neuropathic itch (brachioradial pruritus and other forms of neuropathic itch).

Use of coolants results in partial and transient alleviation of the itching sensation. They activate cold-sensing TRPM8-expressing nociceptors, which, in turn, stimulate Bhlhb-5-expressing itch-inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord (Figure 3). Topical formulations containing TRPM8 agonists menthol (1%–3%) and/or camphor are available over-the-counter in Japan and other countries. Of note, a subset of patients with chronic itch report exacerbation.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^113Maf2z]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Itch typically arises from inflamed skin, which may be the result of allergic inflammation or infectious skin conditions, such as fungal, parasitic, and viral infections. However, a certain population of patients with itch presents with uninflamed or normal‐appearing skin. These skin conditions may or may not result in secondary skin changes due to scratching.

This itch condition is referred to as "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese Dermatological Association's guideline, "pruritus with no underlying dermatosis", or "generalized pruritus without rash" if itch is generalized, according to the British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis (2018). Another synonymous term used is "pruritus on non‐diseased skin" in a position paper of the International Forum for the Study of Itch.

The Japanese guideline further categorizes cutaneous pruritus into two phenotypes: generalized cutaneous pruritus and localized cutaneous pruritus. Generalized pruritus refers to the presence of itch on a wide area of the body, while localized pruritus is defined as itch fixed and localized to a specific part of the body.

Hereinafter, the term cutaneous pruritus is used to describe itch without primary pruritic dermatosis and observable primary rash.

### Pruritus in the older patient: a clinical review [^1129DEwk]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Pruritus is a common problem among elderly people and, when severe, causes as much discomfort as chronic pain. Little evidence supports pruritus treatment, which limits therapeutic possibilities and results in challenging management problems.

- **Objectives**: To present evidence on the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of pruritus in the elderly and to provide an approach for generalist physicians caring for older patients with pruritus using the best available evidence.

- **Evidence review**: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched from 1946 to August 2013. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Systematic Review Data Repository were also searched from their inception to August 2013. References from retrieved articles were evaluated.

- **Findings**: More than 50% of elderly patients have xerosis (dry skin). Xerosis treatment should be included in the initial therapy for pruritus in all elderly patients. Calcium channel blockers and hydrochlorothiazide are important causes of pruritic skin eruptions in older patients. Neuropathic pruritus is infrequently considered but may cause localized itching (especially in the genital area) and generalized truncal pruritus (especially in patients with diabetes mellitus). Certain skin conditions, such as scabies, bullous pemphigoid, transient acantholytic dermatosis, and mycosis fungoides, are more common in elderly patients and should be considered in those with pruritus.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: It is important to evaluate elderly patients for dermatological and systemic conditions, considering the potential contributing factors to pruritus.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^113yTJc2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Causes and characteristics of cutaneous pruritus**: The causes of cutaneous pruritus are diverse, with some patients exhibiting a single cause, while others present with mixed causes. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus. Localized cutaneous pruritus is indicative of a neuropathic cause, whereas generalized cutaneous pruritus suggests underlying systemic diseases, drug-induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO).

- **Neuropathic itch**: Neuropathic itch, also called "neurologic itch", is primarily initiated, triggered, and/or caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. There are many subtypes of neuropathic itch. Neuropathic itch favors a localized or dermatomal distribution. Consequently, it is classified as localized cutaneous pruritus. However, in some cases, neuropathic itch can be generalized, resulting from neural sensitization, in which limited nerve damage contributes to the increase in neurotransmitter release and hyperexcitable spinal neurons. Given that neuropathic itch has its origin in nerve damage, it could be characterized by a predominance of nociceptive symptoms (e.g. stinging, burning, sunburn-like sensation, pain, and hurting). However, a recent study has indicated that these nociceptive symptoms are more evident in inflammatory itch rather than neuropathic itch.

We recommend that conPBC be considered in patients with cholestatic pruritus, cholestatic liver blood tests, and/or relevant autoantibodies in addition to the typical transaminitis of AIH. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: strong.

We recommend that a PSC/AIH variant syndrome be considered and an MRCP performed in all children and in adults with otherwise typical AIH who have biliary changes on biopsy, cholestatic liver blood tests, pruritus, suboptimal response to immune suppression, inflammatory bowel disease, or subsequent development of any of these features. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

We recommend that the revised and simplified International AIH Group (IAIHG) scoring systems not be used for diagnosis of variant syndromes. The Paris criteria (see Section N) can be used, but do not identify all patients. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: strong.

We recommend that when the two components of a variant syndrome present simultaneously but one is predominant, this should be the first treatment target — for example, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) if cholestatic features predominate. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

We recommend that combination therapy with UDCA and immune suppression (prednisolone and azathioprine as used in classic AIH) might provide the best rates of biochemical response, with less fibrosis progression. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

We recommend that patients with an overlap syndrome who have severe inte

### Chronic pruritus: A paraneoplastic SIGN [^113GC9u1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic itch could be a presenting sign of malignancy. Pruritus of lymphoma is the common prototype of paraneoplastic itch and can precede other clinical signs by weeks and months. Paraneoplastic pruritus has also been associated with solid tumors and is an important clinical symptom in paraneoplastic skin diseases such as erythroderma, Grover's disease, malignant acanthosis nigricans, generalized granuloma annulare, Bazex syndrome, and dermatomyositis. In any case with a high index of suspicion, a thorough work-up is required.

This review highlights the association between itch and malignancy and presents new findings related to pathophysiological mechanisms and the treatment of itch associated with malignancy. Combinative therapies reducing itch sensitization and transmission using selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, kappa opioids, and neuroleptics are of prime importance in reducing this bothersome symptom.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^1137S2So]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Itch, also known as pruritus, is one of the most prevalent symptoms observed in dermatological practices. Itch frequently arises from primary pruritic dermatoses, although it may also manifest in the absence of a primary pruritic skin rash. The latter itchy condition is referred to as "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese guidelines published in 2020. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus. Localized cutaneous pruritus is indicative of a neuropathic cause, whereas generalized cutaneous pruritus suggests underlying systemic diseases, drug‐induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO).

- **Systemic diseases**: Systemic diseases associated with cutaneous pruritus include disorders of iron metabolism, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis), endocrine/metabolic diseases, hematological disorders, and malignant solid tumors.

- **Chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO)**: CPUO is a term used to describe chronic itch that is often generalized and for which no underlying cause can be identified despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup.

- **Treatment approaches**: A variety of treatment approaches are available for cutaneous pruritus, including device‐based physical therapies (such as phototherapy) and medications that act on the itch-perception processing pathway from the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, to the brain.

This review presents an overview of the knowledge regarding cutaneous pruritus, from its underlying pathophysiology to its management.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^1125H8qB]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Pathophysiology of itch**: The itch pathway from the skin to the brain consists of four consecutive steps: the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, and the brain. These steps are essential for the sensation of itching.

The itch pathway involves various treatment approaches targeting these steps, which are currently in use in clinical practice. Chemical itch typically develops when itch events occur in the periphery. Such itch events include allergic skin inflammation (e.g. atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) and external stimuli (e.g. insect bites). These events facilitate the release of pruritogens from various cell types in the periphery.

Pruritogens include histamine and other non-histaminergic substances such as amines, neuropeptides, lipid mediators, and cytokines, particularly type 2 cytokines like interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and IL-31. These pruritogens stimulate sensory nerve fibers in the skin via their receptors, generating electrical signals (action potentials) through the opening of ion channels, including transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1), TRPV1, and voltage-gated sodium channels (Na v), particularly Na v 1.7.

### Pruritus: Diagnosis and management [^113paMho]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Pruritus is the sensation of itching and can be caused by dermatologic and systemic conditions. An exposure history may reveal symptom triggers. A thorough skin examination, including visualization of the finger webs, anogenital region, nails, and scalp, is essential. Primary skin lesions indicate diseased skin, while secondary lesions are reactive and result from skin manipulation, such as scratching.

An initial evaluation for systemic causes may include a complete blood count with differential, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, liver function tests, iron studies, fasting glucose or A1C level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Additional testing, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV screening, hepatitis serologies, and chest radiography, may also be appropriate based on the history and physical examination. In the absence of primary skin lesions, physicians should consider evaluation for malignancy in older patients with chronic generalized pruritus.

General management includes trigger avoidance, liberal emollient use, limiting water exposure, and administering oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. If the evaluation for multiple etiologies of pruritus is ambiguous, clinicians may consider psychogenic etiologies and consultation with a specialist.

### Pharmacological interventions for pruritus in adult palliative care patients [^116krQUD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2013 (Issue 6). Pruritus occurs in patients with disparate underlying diseases and is caused by different pathologic mechanisms. In palliative care patients, pruritus is not the most prevalent but is one of the most puzzling symptoms. It can cause considerable discomfort and affects patients' quality of life.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different pharmacological treatments for preventing or treating pruritus in adult palliative care patients.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) and MEDLINE (OVID) up to 9 June 2016, and Embase (OVID) up to 7 June 2016. In addition, we searched trial registries and checked the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews, and websites. We contacted investigators and specialists in pruritus and palliative care regarding unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of different pharmacological treatments, compared with a placebo, no treatment, or an alternative treatment, for preventing or treating pruritus in palliative care patients.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the identified titles and abstracts, performed data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality. We summarised the results descriptively and quantitatively (meta-analyses) according to the different pharmacological interventions and the diseases associated with pruritus. We assessed the evidence using GRADE.

The guidelines from the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) for 2018 emphasize the importance of psychosocial and behavioral interventions for patients experiencing psychogenic pruritus. It is recommended to provide education on avoiding trigger factors and to instruct on the application of treatments. Additionally, lifestyle interventions, relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, and behavior modification, such as habit reversal training, should be considered for distressed patients suffering from chronic pruritus likely of psychogenic origin.

### Pruritus in pregnancy [^115ct4c8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

In pregnancy, pruritus is the main dermatological symptom and should never be neglected. Patients presenting with pruritus need an exact workup to establish a proper diagnosis, which is not only essential for the well-being of the expectant patient but also to prevent negative outcomes for the fetus. Pruritus is the main symptom of pregnancy-specific dermatological diseases such as PEP, PG, AEP, and ICP, but may also coincide by chance with other diseases or even physiological changes in pregnancy.

- **Algorithmic approach**: The first step is to rule out other possible causes of pruritus; in the second step, the four specific dermatoses of pregnancy need to be differentiated.

A careful medical history with an emphasis on the location and temporal course of the pruritus often reveals important clues that, together with laboratory findings, may facilitate diagnosis and efficacious treatment. Treatment of pruritus in pregnancy requires prudent consideration of the benefits and risks of the available therapeutic regimens for the patient and fetus. All specialists involved (dermatologist, gynecologist, general practitioner, midwife) should cooperate closely to improve the management of pruritus in pregnancy.

### Itch in systemic disease: Therapeutic options [^117DgUe4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

A new pathophysiologically based classification of itch is proposed, which should help the clinician adopt a rational approach to diagnosis and management of generalized itch. Focusing on neurogenic itch (itch without visible rash), common causes are reviewed and guidelines for laboratory and radiologic investigation are proposed. A stepwise approach to the management of generalized itch resulting from systemic disease is recommended. Specifically, the relative merits of broad versus narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) are discussed, and the pros and cons of doxepin, opioid antagonists, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as paroxetine are considered.

Attention is drawn to some novel approaches, including bright-light phototherapy and molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) for selected patients with intractable itch caused by hepatic failure, and mirtazapine for nocturnal itch.

### Chronic pruritus in the absence of specific skin disease: An update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^112tTwvW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus is a major and distressing symptom of many cutaneous and systemic diseases and can significantly impair the patient's quality of life. Pruritus perception is the final result of a complex network involving dedicated nerve pathways and brain areas, and an increasing number of peripheral and central mediators are thought to be involved. Itch is associated with most cutaneous disorders and, in these circumstances, its management overlaps with that of the skin disease. Itch can also occur without associated skin diseases or primary skin lesions, but only with nonspecific lesions secondary to rubbing or scratching.

Chronic itch with no or minimal skin changes can be secondary to important diseases, such as neurologic disorders, chronic renal failure, cholestasis, systemic infections, malignancies, and endocrine disorders, and may also result from exposure to some drugs. The search for the cause of pruritus usually requires a meticulous step-by-step assessment involving careful history taking as well as clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Few evidence-based treatments for pruritus are available. Topical therapy, oral histamine H(1) receptor antagonists, and phototherapy with UV radiation can target pruritus elicitation in the skin, whereas antiepileptic drugs, opioid receptor antagonists, and antidepressants can block signal processing in the CNS.
