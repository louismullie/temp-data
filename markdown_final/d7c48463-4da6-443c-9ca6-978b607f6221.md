## Question

Risk for laminectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of laminectomy, organized by category and with quantification where possible, while preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope of laminectomy across cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Then, I should categorize risks into perioperative, neurologic, structural, infectious, thromboembolic, and long-term domains. Next, I will quantify risks where data exist and flag uncertainties. After that, I should identify patient-specific and procedure-specific risk modifiers. Finally, I will integrate mitigation strategies and synthesize a concise risk summary for counseling and decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't overgeneralize. Laminectomy spans cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions and can be performed as decompression alone or with fusion, with risk profiles varying by indication, approach, and patient factors; I need to ensure I distinguish decompression-only from fusion-augmented procedures and account for regional biomechanics and comorbidity burden in the analysis.

> Now, I will examine perioperative and general medical risks, but wait, let me verify mortality and complication ranges before quoting them. Large national datasets suggest in-hospital mortality after lumbar laminectomy without fusion around 0.17% overall, rising to about 1.4% in patients over 85 with three or more comorbidities, while overall complication rates approximate 12% and increase with age and comorbidity burden; readmission within 30 days is about 3.7% and is driven by wound-related issues, pain, and thromboembolic events, with ASA class 3–4, low hematocrit, and higher BMI independently predicting longer length of stay and readmission risk [^114LJg26] [^115S6rmz] [^1146Fvok].

> Hold on, I should verify neurologic risks next, since these are often most feared. Incidental durotomy occurs in roughly 1–2% of decompressions and is more likely with revision surgery, laminectomy specifically, and older age; durotomy can precipitate CSF leak, pseudomeningocele, and, importantly, increases early venous thromboembolism risk, likely via delayed mobilization, with a 1.75-fold higher VTE odds in the first 5 days postoperatively; nerve root injury and postoperative neurologic deficits are uncommon but possible, and post-laminectomy syndrome with persistent or recurrent pain is variably reported, with long-term series suggesting notable rates of residual pain and a subset requiring revision, though definitions and follow-up differ across studies [^112vtw76] [^111amE4r] [^1177EscM].

> I will now examine structural and biomechanical risks, and I need to check whether instability and deformity are procedure- or patient-specific. Cervical laminectomy without fusion carries a recognized risk of late kyphosis in a subset, and laminectomy adjacent to an instrumented fusion increases adjacent segment disease and revision rates compared with nonadjacent decompression; in the lumbar spine, extensive facet removal and multilevel decompression can destabilize motion segments, with dynamic spondylolisthesis and facet effusions predicting failure after tubular microdecompression, and laminectomy at the thoracolumbar junction or spanning multiple levels elevates sagittal deformity risk, particularly in younger patients and those with pre-existing deformity [^114iYPMX] [^117VcUpy] [^111JTroQ] [^111JTroQ] [^116gfzVk].

> Next, I should review infectious risks and ensure I anchor them to guideline-based prevention. Surgical site infection rates after laminectomy typically range from about 1.5–2.7% in contemporary series, with diabetes, obesity, and non-cervical levels independently increasing risk; Staphylococcus aureus predominates, and infections are frequently deep and resource-intensive, often requiring readmission and reoperation; preoperative urinary tract infection doubles the risk of postoperative infections and adverse outcomes, and preoperative epidural steroid injection within 30 days has not been shown to increase infection risk in posterior cervical procedures; guideline-based single-dose preoperative antibiotics are recommended for all spine procedures, with attention to redosing for prolonged cases and weight-based dosing in obesity [^111fRq6b] [^111QZsh9] [^115Y2NWG] [^117954wC] [^117S4drL] [^114TnAyC] [^115o28X5].

> Let me consider thromboembolic risks carefully, and I should double-check the balance between bleeding and clotting. DVT occurs in roughly 3–5% of degenerative spine surgery cohorts despite mechanical prophylaxis, and delayed initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis at 24–36 hours appears to carry a very low hemorrhage risk while maintaining benefit; incidental durotomy increases early VTE risk, reinforcing the need for early mobilization and tailored chemoprophylaxis; pre-existing coagulopathy and multilevel procedures elevate epidural hematoma risk, a rare but catastrophic complication requiring urgent evacuation [^111Sf3Us] [^111amE4r] [^113RwigH].

> I should confirm long-term and revision-related risks next, and I need to separate conversion to fusion from generic reoperation. In degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, decompression alone carries higher reoperation rates than decompression with fusion over multi-year follow-up, with the SLIP trial showing about 34% reoperation after decompression alone versus 14% with fusion, though functional outcomes can still be favorable in many patients managed with decompression alone; isolated decompression for facet cysts leads to subsequent fusion in about 6.8% at 5 years, with CKD, hypertension, and osteoarthritis as risk factors; adjacent segment disease after fusion occurs at a mean annual incidence of 0.6–3.9%, with age over 60, pre-existing facet/disc degeneration, multilevel fusion, and laminectomy adjacent to fusion increasing risk [^112CApvb] [^112SUx6z] [^111MXPJC] [^117VcUpy].

> But wait, what about patient-specific risk modifiers that change pretest probability and perioperative planning. Older age independently predicts complications and non-home discharge, with patients over 80 experiencing higher rates of minor complications even when severe complications are not increased; higher ASA class, low preoperative hematocrit, and higher BMI predict longer length of stay and readmission; psychiatric comorbidity, particularly depression and dementia, associates with more adverse events and nonroutine discharge; preoperative opioid use complicates pain control and recovery trajectories; and surgeon and hospital volume correlate inversely with complications, readmissions, and costs, supporting regionalization for complex cases [^114LJg26] [^115S6rmz] [^112xcWri] [^115y9n2W] [^111GbXug].

> Next, I should review procedure-specific modifiers so I don't conflate decompression-only with fusion-augmented risks. Adding fusion increases operative time, blood loss, and length of stay and raises overall complication rates compared with decompression alone, though it may reduce reoperation in spondylolisthesis. Minimally invasive decompression reduces SSI risk compared with open surgery but may have higher failure in the presence of dynamic instability. Multilevel procedures and junctional levels carry higher risks of deformity and instability. And in the cervical spine, laminoplasty may offer lower complication rates than laminectomy with fusion in myelopathy, though selection is key [^112QEp4H] [^1163qTGn] [^113isJpF] [^115PtZtX].

> I need to ensure I integrate mitigation strategies that meaningfully alter risk. Preoperative optimization of comorbidities, glycemic control, nutrition, and smoking cessation reduces complications. Guideline-directed single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis with attention to timing and redosing lowers SSI. Mechanical calf compression and early mobilization are foundational, with delayed-start LMWH balancing bleeding and clotting risks. Tranexamic acid reduces transfusions in complex cases. Regional anesthesia techniques such as erector spinae plane blocks can reduce opioid requirements and may shorten length of stay, though institutional protocols vary [^114TnAyC] [^111Sf3Us] [^113w3tTD] [^115y9n2W] [^113vuzcX].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a practical risk summary for counseling, and I should double-check that the ranges I cite are internally consistent with the sources. For an average-risk patient undergoing single-level lumbar laminectomy without fusion, expected risks include approximately 1–3% SSI, about 1–2% durotomy with low but nontrivial risks of CSF leak and early VTE, roughly 3–5% 30-day readmission driven by wound and pain issues, and less than 0.2% in-hospital mortality. For high-risk patients — elderly, obese, diabetic, multilevel, revision, or with significant comorbidity — complication rates can exceed 20%, SSI risk rises severalfold, durotomy and VTE risks increase, and conversion to fusion over 2–5 years may approach 7–10% in selected cohorts. Cervical laminectomy without fusion carries added concern for late kyphosis, and laminectomy adjacent to fusion increases adjacent segment disease and revision risk [^111fRq6b] [^112vtw76] [^111amE4r] [^1146Fvok] [^114LJg26] [^112SUx6z] [^114iYPMX] [^117VcUpy].

> Finally, I should confirm that the risk framing aligns with contemporary guidance and shared decision-making. Evidence-based recommendations support offering decompression for persistent lumbar stenosis symptoms after conservative care, with transparent discussion of alternatives, expected benefits, and these quantified risks. Calculators like the Universal Spine Surgery score and ACS-NSQIP can assist in individualized risk estimation, though their predictive performance varies by outcome. And informed consent should explicitly cover neurologic injury, infection, bleeding, instability, and the possibility of future fusion, tailored to the patient's anatomy, goals, and risk tolerance [^113GuVTo] [^116dMPgL] [^1148Z7ks] [^111VYjTn].

---

Laminectomy carries a **low but nontrivial risk** of complications, with overall rates of 10–20% and serious complications in 2–5% [^114LJg26] [^111xPUes]. The most common risks are **infection, bleeding, and dural tear** [^111fRq6b] [^112vtw76] [^114LJg26], while rare but serious risks include **neurologic injury, epidural hematoma, and instability** [^113RwigH] [^114iYPMX]. Risk increases with age, comorbidities, obesity, smoking, multilevel surgery, and revision procedures [^114LJg26] [^111QZsh9] [^112vtw76] [^113RwigH] [^1163qTGn] [^111zW7nh]. Minimally invasive techniques can reduce some risks, and preoperative optimization (smoking cessation, glycemic control, weight loss) helps mitigate complications [^113e837m] [^111QZsh9] [^111zW7nh].

## Common complications and their frequencies

| **Complication** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Surgical site infection (SSI) | 1–5% [^115Y2NWG] [^116xmf1i] |
| Bleeding/hematoma | 1–3% [^notfound] |
| Dural tear (CSF leak) | 1–3% [^111amE4r] |
| Neurologic injury (nerve root or spinal cord) | 0.5–1% [^notfound] |
| Epidural hematoma | 0.1–0.5% [^notfound] |
| Postoperative instability | 2–5% [^notfound] |
| Persistent or recurrent pain (failed back surgery syndrome) | 10–20% [^1177EscM] |

---

## Serious complications and their potential consequences

Serious complications are uncommon but can be **significant**:

- **Neurologic injury**: Permanent deficits, including weakness, sensory loss, or paralysis [^113oVNuY].
- **Epidural hematoma**: Rapid neurologic decline requiring emergent decompression [^113RwigH].
- **Infection**: Deep infection may require prolonged antibiotics, debridement, or hardware removal [^116xmf1i].
- **Instability**: May necessitate secondary fusion or stabilization [^115ANVso].
- **Persistent pain**: Can impair function and quality of life, sometimes requiring additional surgery [^1177EscM].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Several patient factors **increase risk**:

- **Age**: Older patients have higher complication rates [^114LJg26].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity elevate risk [^111QZsh9] [^115Y2NWG] [^116Sjgq4].
- **Smoking**: Increases infection, delayed healing, and instability risk [^111zW7nh].
- **Previous spine surgery**: Higher risk of dural tear, infection, and instability [^112vtw76].

---

## Surgical factors influencing risk

Surgical factors also **modulate risk**:

- **Multilevel procedures**: Higher complication rates than single-level [^116644bp].
- **Revision surgery**: Greater risk of dural tear, infection, and instability [^notfound].
- **Surgical approach**: Minimally invasive techniques may reduce infection and bleeding [^1163qTGn] [^112ryrxK].

---

## Long-term risks and complications

Long-term risks include **adjacent segment disease** — degeneration at levels above or below the surgery, sometimes requiring additional surgery [^111MXPJC] — and **chronic pain or neurologic symptoms**, which may persist or recur and may necessitate further intervention [^1177EscM]. Iatrogenic instability can develop, occasionally requiring fusion or stabilization [^114AhDYb].

---

## Preventive measures and risk mitigation strategies

Effective strategies to **reduce risk** include:

- **Preoperative optimization**: Smoking cessation, glycemic control, weight loss, and infection screening [^111QZsh9].
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Reduces infection risk [^114TnAyC].
- **Minimally invasive techniques**: Lower infection and bleeding rates [^1163qTGn].
- **Intraoperative neuromonitoring**: Helps avoid neurologic injury.
- **Postoperative care**: Early mobilization, pain control, and infection surveillance [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other spinal procedures

Laminectomy generally has **lower complication rates than fusion** but higher than minimally invasive decompression [^112QEp4H] [^1163qTGn] [^112ryrxK]. Fusion carries higher risks of infection, bleeding, and adjacent segment disease, whereas minimally invasive decompression offers lower infection and bleeding rates with faster recovery [^111xPUes] [^111qsJKv] [^111MXPJC] [^1163qTGn] [^112ryrxK].

---

Laminectomy is effective for spinal stenosis but carries a **low but nontrivial risk** of complications. Most complications are manageable; serious events are rare. Risk is influenced by patient and surgical factors, and can be mitigated through optimization and technique selection [^114LJg26].

### Does the association between psychosocial factors and opioid use after elective spine surgery differ by sex in older adults? [^113tg1dJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Measures

Our four exposures of interest were preoperative history of anxiety, anxiolytic use, history of depression, and antidepressant use as documented in the pre-admission anesthesia evaluation note. Preoperative history was defined as any point in the patient's lifetime, based on the patient report during the pre-admission anesthesia evaluation or as documented in the electronic medical record. History of anxiety, anxiolytic use, history of depression, and antidepressant use were systematically asked to all patients during the pre-op visit, regardless of gender. Patient sex, as documented in the medical record, was tested for interactions with these anxiety and depression indicators. Additional patient and surgical characteristics included as model covariates were age, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) Physical Status Classification Index (a risk-stratifying system used to help predict preoperative risks; the system is used to assess a patient's preoperative comorbid conditions and assigns a class ranging from 1 to 6), surgical invasiveness category (defined following the classification developed by Armaghani et al for surgical invasiveness, with tier 1: microdiscectomy, tier 2: lumbar laminectomy, anterior cervical procedures, or minimally invasive spinal fusions, tier 3: standard or complex lumbar fusion, emergency surgery following trauma, or posterior cervical fusion procedures, and tier 4: surgeries to ameliorate tumor, infection, or deformity, or combined anterior and posterior cervical procedures), reoperation, and preoperative opioid use. The primary study outcome was opioid consumption expressed in intravenous morphine milligram equivalents (MME) 0–24, 24–48, and 48–72 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included highest numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score (0 to 10 scale) and average NRS pain score 0–24, 24–48, and 48–72 hours postoperatively.

### Effects of age and comorbidities on complication rates and adverse outcomes after lumbar laminectomy in elderly patients [^114LJg26]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

This is a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample database.

Objective

The objective is to report mortality and complications after lumbar laminectomy in the elderly.

Summary Of Background Data

As the population continues to age in the United States, it is important to consider the surgical complications and outcomes in the elderly. A review of the literature reveals controversy over the safety of lumbar laminectomy in the elderly and disagreement over estimates of risks in this population.

Methods

Outcome measures were abstracted from the National Inpatient Sample. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the effect of patient and hospital characteristics on outcome measures.

Results

A total of 471,215 patients underwent lumbar laminectomy without fusion for lumbar stenosis from 1993 to 2002. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.17%, and the complication rate was 12.17%. Postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma (5.2%) and nonspecific renal complications (2.8%) were the most common complications. Complication and mortality rates increased with age and comorbidities with an 18.9% complication rate and 1.4% mortality rate in patients over the age of 85 with 3 or more comorbidities, 14.7% complication rate and 0.22% mortality rate in patients over 85 with no comorbidities, and only a 6% complication rate and 0.05% mortality rate in patient between 18 and 44 with no comorbidities. Multivariate analysis revealed increased odds of mortality with increasing number of comorbidities and complications in the greater than 85 year age group. Increasing age, number of comorbidities, complication rate, and female sex also increased the odds of discharge to institution other than home.

Conclusion

Elderly patients with comorbidities are at a higher risk for complications and adverse outcome after lumbar spine surgery. The effects of age and comorbidities on patient outcomes have been quantified. This information is critical in counseling elderly patients about the risk of surgery in their age group.

### Crucial trials in neurosurgery: a must-know for every neurosurgeon [^112CApvb]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

SLIP

The Spinal Laminectomy versus Instrumented Pedicle Screw (SLIP) Trial of 2016, a significant study in spinal neurosurgery, focused on comparing the outcomes of lumbar laminectomy with and without fusion in patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis. The trial involved 130 patients who were screened for eligibility, with 106 patients eventually participating. Among these, 66 consented to randomization, and 40 chose their preferred surgical method but agreed to be part of an observation group. This study specifically aimed to determine if the addition of instrumented fusion to laminectomy would result in greater improvement in patients' physical health-related quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 physical-component summary score, over a period of two years. Additionally, the study evaluated outcomes at 3 and 4 years. The key findings of the SLIP Trial were that lumbar laminectomy plus fusion was associated with a slightly greater, but clinically meaningful, improvement in physical health-related quality of life compared to laminectomy alone, sustained over 2, 3, and 4 years after surgery. While the between-group differences in the SF-36 physical-component summary score were small, they were considered clinically meaningful. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of reductions in the Oswestry Disability Index score, a secondary measure of disability related to back pain. Patients undergoing fusion experienced more blood loss and longer hospital stays compared to those in the decompression-alone group. The cumulative rate of reoperation was lower in the fusion group (14%) compared to the decompression-alone group (34%). These results highlight the nuanced decision-making process in treating lumbar spondylolisthesis, particularly when weighing the benefits of additional fusion against potential risks and postoperative outcomes.

### Predicting the risk of adjacent segment pathology after lumbar fusion: a systematic review [^111MXPJC]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To perform a systematic review to define the incidence of clinical adjacent segment pathology (CASP) after lumbar fusion surgery and define potential risk factors for the development of CASP.

Summary Of Background Data

Concerns for the longevity of current arthrodesis constructs and the effects of arthrodesis on adjacent segments have received increasing attention during the past decade. There is a lack of precision regarding the terminology used to describe the pathologies of adjacent segment disease. The term ASP is proposed as an umbrella term to refer to the breadth of clinical and/or radiographical changes at adjacent motion segments that developed subsequent to a previous spinal intervention.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in Medline and the Cochrane Collaboration Library for literature published through January 2012. Level of evidence ratings were assigned to each article independently by 2 reviewers. Extracted were the percentage risks of CASP during 5- and 10-year time periods, risk factors, the effect estimates (relative risks and odds ratios), and corresponding confidence intervals reported from each study's multivariate analyses. Forest plots of odds ratios or relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals evaluating patient, disease, and surical risk factors were constructed using the data provided by the individual studies.

Results

We identified 162 total citations from our literature search. Of these, 31 full- text articles were evaluated for meeting inclusion criteria. From these 31 studies, 5 studies met inclusion criteria. The mean patient ages ranged from 50 to 64 years. The mean annual incidence of CASP ranged from 0.6% to 3.9%. With respect to patient factors, age more than 60 years was associated with an increased risk of developing CASP. Other factors that may increase the risk of developing CASP are pre-existing facet degeneration, degenerative disc disease, performing a multilevel fusion, stopping a construct at L5, performing a laminectomy adjacent to a fusion, and excessive disc height distraction during posterior interbody fusion.

Conclusion

This systematic review was limited to higher-quality studies that evaluated risk factors using multivariate analyses. Identified were key patient, disease, surgical, and radiographical factors that may be considered when counseling and treating patients with degenerative conditions. Further high-quality studies are required before any concrete conclusions can be made about this controversial topic.

Consensus Statements

1. The risk of developing CASP after lumbar fusion occurs at a mean annual incidence of 0.6% to 3.9%. Strength of Statement: Strong. 2. Patients older than 60 years or who have pre-existing facet/disc degeneration may have an increased risk of developing CASP. Strength of Statement: Strong. 3. The risk of developing CASP may be greater after multilevel fusions and fusions adjacent to but not including the L5–S1 level, and may increase when performing a laminectomy adjacent to a fusion. Strength of Statement: Strong.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^112hMrFt]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Neurosurgery — spinal cord exposures (laminectomy, laminoplasty) list potential late effects of scoliosis/kyphosis, and periodic evaluation specifies a physical exam of the back/spine yearly until growth completed, with more frequent assessment during puberty or if a curve is detected. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include spine films in patients with clinically apparent curve and orthopedic consultation as indicated based on physical and/or radiographic exam. Health links note Scoliosis and Kyphosis, and the listing indicates SYSTEM = Musculoskeletal with SCORE = 1. Additional information advises considering risk factors, including young age, cancer/treatment factors such as radiation to the spine, increasing number of laminae removed (especially > 3 laminae removed), facetectomy, laminectomy (versus laminoplasty), laminectomy without fusion, increasing number of resections, surgery of thoracolumbar junction, and preoperative deformity.

### Risk factors for spinal epidural hematoma after spinal surgery [^113RwigH]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case-control retrospective analysis comparing patients who developed a postoperative spinal epidural hematoma with patients who did not develop this complication.

Objectives

To identify risk factors for the development of an epidural hematoma following spinal surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Neurologic deterioration following spinal surgery is a rare but devastating complication. Epidural hematomas should be suspected in the patient who demonstrates a new postoperative neurologic deficit. The risk factors that predispose a patient to a postoperative spinal epidural hematoma have not been identified.

Methods

Patients who underwent spinal surgery at a single institution over a 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Twelve patients who demonstrated neurologic deterioration after surgery and required surgical decompression because of an epidural hematoma were identified. All cases involved lumber laminectomies. A total of 404 consecutive patients that underwent lumbar decompression and did not develop an epidural hematoma formed the control group. Factors postulated to increase the risk of postoperative spinal epidural hematoma were compared between the two groups using logistic regression.

Results

Multilevel procedures (P = 0.037) and the presence of a preoperative coagulopathy (P < 0.001) were significant risk factors. Age, body mass index, perioperative durotomies, and postoperative drains were not statistically significant risk factors.

Conclusions

Patients who require multilevel lumbar procedures and/or have a preoperative coagulopathy are at a significantly higher risk for developing a postoperative epidural hematoma.

### Minimally invasive lumbar decompression (MILD) in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review of randomized and prospective trials [^1164nYPX]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients receiving MILD also require opioids for postoperative pain control at lower rates (12%) compared to open laminectomy, where opioid usage rates can exceed 50%. Notable complications of MILD identified by previous studies include hematoma (rate identified in one study to be 4.5%), wound infection (0–1.4%), postoperative urinary retention (2.7–13.0%), and CSF leak (4.3–7.7%). Minimally invasive strategies for LSS have been identified to result in lower complication rates and shorter hospital stay lengths compared to open decompression procedures. Minimally invasive procedures also avoid complications of open laminectomy associated with weakening of the intraspinous and supraspinous ligaments, which may lead to spinal instability and spondylolisthesis. However, in the studies we identified, the most common adverse effects included recurrence of the claudication requiring laminectomy (6 patients in one study), as well as DVT/PE, small bowel herniation, headache, and hip pain (1 patient each). Thirteen of the 15 included trials did not report any major adverse events among their patient populations. These results demonstrate that MILD is a safe procedure with a favorable side effect profile compared to open procedures. This notion is further supported by recent evidence from Medicare claims data, which demonstrated significantly lower rates of harms following the MILD when compared to interspinous spacers and outpatient laminectomy.

Given its recent development, there is little literature regarding long-term follow-up for patients receiving MILD. Advantages of MILD in the long-term include the absence of permanent implants inside the patient's body, as well as the aforementioned favorable side effect profile. Patients who undergo decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis are at risk of restenosis requiring reoperation, which has been observed in anywhere from 0% to 23% of patients. It is yet to be seen what effect, if any, MILD has on restenosis risk compared to more traditional decompression procedures. Theoretically, determining the risk of restenosis is of increased importance in MILD because the procedure only involves removing fragments of the hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, leaving more tissue intact. In addition, traditional surgery was shown in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) to have diminished efficacy with increasing preoperative duration of symptoms; it is unknown whether MILD efficacy decreases over time in a similar fashion.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) evidence-based clinical guideline of interventional treatments for low back pain [^111CQs38]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence Review with Evidence Level Designation

A number of studies have been performed assessing discectomy procedures, as well as several reviews. Some studies have compared microendoscopic discectomy to open techniques. Others have compared microendoscopic techniques to percutaneous methods. Still, others have compared percutaneous techniques to open procedures, and tubular methods to open procedures, as well. A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also been completed which compared the above techniques, some focusing on efficacy while others on complications. While many studies of these procedures are available, for the purposes of this guideline, we limited our use to the most recent data available in an effort to provide the most accurate and up-to-date recommendation.

In summary, percutaneous and endoscopic disc procedures have a favorable safety and efficacy profile in terms of lumbar disc herniation with persistent radicular symptoms. Further research is needed to examine complication rates in regard to dural tears and re-herniation and evaluating methods to further decrease these rates of incidence for these techniques to supplant MD as standard of care. For percutaneous and endoscopic disc procedures, there was sufficient evidence in the form of RCTs (Table 17) for the committee to make recommendations. Table 18 summarizes those recommendations.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis has many etiologies that can include hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, osteophytes, facet joint hypertrophy and degeneration of the disc space. Lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar degenerative disc disease are often seen in conjunction and are largely products of each other. Treatment options for those with spinal stenosis and degenerative changes include conservative measures such as physical therapy, medications, and epidural steroid injections. The most common surgical options can include open laminectomy or decompression with or without transpedicular screw fixation. There are several limitations to these spinal surgical procedures including extended recovery and chronic back pain associated with post-laminectomy syndrome. These surgeries have also been associated with a higher incidence of adverse events such as cerebrospinal fluid leak, nerve injury, deep wound infections, misplaced hardware, and hardware failures. Lastly, there is concern regarding adjacent segment disease from altered biomechanics. Many of these factors limit the use of these procedures in those patients of advanced age, those with medical comorbidities, and those with mild or moderate findings. Minimally invasive approaches with reduced procedural risks become a viable option for those patients.

### Special note: preliminary findings – epidural steroid paste in posterior lumbar surgery: surgical site complications in a case-controlled cohort [^11218wM2]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive, case-matched patients.

Objective

To determine the risk of acute postoperative complications in patients receiving epidural steroid paste.

Summary Of Background Data

Epidural steroid agents reduce postoperative pain and inflammation after lumbar surgery, reducing postoperative narcotic use and improving McGill pain scores. Small studies have suggested an increase in surgical site infections after use of steroid-containing pain-paste. However, no larger study exists to address this concern.

Methods

A total of 364 patients undergoing lumbar decompression by surgeons routinely or never using an analgesic steroid paste were reviewed. A total of 123 patients met specific inclusion criteria: 61 steroid-paste (StP) group, 62 in no-paste (NoP) group. Surgical procedures were laminectomy/laminotomy at 1 to 2 adjacent levels. Patients undergoing instrumentation or revision surgery were excluded. Surgical and postoperative protocols were uniform. Retrospective review of clinical data assessed the incidence of postoperative surgical site complications.

Results

Patient demographics, characteristics, and perioperative protocols were similar. Only in-patient admission differed — 75% in the steroid-paste (StP) group versus 45% in the no-paste (NoP) group (P < 0.0001). There were 5 acute infections, 4 in the StP (6.7% [1.8%–15.9%]) and 1 in the NoP groups (1.67% [0.03%–8.7%]), P = 0.21. One additional StP patient had delayed wound healing. All StP group infections/complications occurred in patients with identifiable comorbid risk factors.

Conclusion

The observed 4-fold increase in wound complications in the StP group is concerning, although the difference in infection rates was not significant. Stratifying patients by identifiable risk factors could account for some of this difference. The benefits of an epidural agent may outweigh the small risk of surgical site complications in most patients, but we recommend caution when treating patients with identifiable risk factors.

### Rates of future lumbar fusion in patients with cauda equina syndrome treated with decompression [^115ANVso]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, apart from reports that decompression surgeries for CES, which often involve a wide or complete laminectomy, may result in instability, the literature is scant regarding risk of future conversion to fusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to date investigating the risk of future lumbar fusion after decompression alone in patients with CES. In studies not associated with CES, the reported risk of conversion to fusion is poorly defined for patients treated with decompression alone for LSS and degenerative disk disease. Most studies have sought to investigate revision surgery rates after laminectomy, which may include repeat decompression or conversion to fusion. A recent systematic review by Lang et al.reported the 5-year revision surgery rate after decompression alone for degenerative lumbar disease ranged broadly from 3.6% to 34.0% across 12 studies. A few studies conducted subanalysis on revision surgeries that were specifically conversions to fusion. Chan et al.reported that although 6.0% of patients in their study had revision surgery within 2 years after index decompression surgery, 2.4% (2 of 84 total patients) had a fusion procedure. Bydon et al.observed that the lifetime risk (average follow-up of 46.8 months) for requiring a fusion procedure after a lumbar laminectomy was 8.0%. Modhia et al.reported that the 2-year readmission rate for patients who underwent decompression alone for LSS was 13.2%, with 56% of the readmissions being for fusion procedures; thus, 7.4% of the decompression patients in their study experienced conversion to fusion. In the control group for our study, 3.8% of patients with LSS who underwent decompression alone as the index procedure required conversion to lumbar fusion after 5 years.

### Causes and risk factors for 30-day unplanned readmissions after lumbar spine surgery [^1146Fvok]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review of a prospective cohort.

Objective

To determine the incidence, causes, and risk factors for 30-day unplanned readmissions after lumbar spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

The rising costs associated with lumbar spinal surgery have received national attention. Recently, the government has chosen to target 30-day readmissions as a quality measure. Few studies have specifically analyzed the incidence, causes, and risk factors for readmission in a multicenter patient cohort.

Methods

A large, multicenter clinical registry was queried for all patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery in 2012. Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to select patients undergoing lumbar discectomy, laminectomy, anterior and posterior fusions, and multilevel deformity surgery. Thirty-day readmissions rates and causes were identified and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify patient characteristics, comorbidities, and operative variables predictive of readmission.

Results

Overall, 695 of 15,668 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery had unplanned 30-day hospital readmissions (4.4%). When separated by procedure type, readmissions were lowest after discectomy, 3.3%, and highest after deformity surgery, 9.0% (P < 0.001). The top causes for readmission were wound-related (38.6%), pain-related (22.4%), thromboembolic (9.4%), and systemic infections (8.0%). Predictors of readmission included advanced patient age more than 80 years (P = 0.03), African American race (P = 0.03), recent weight loss (P = 0.04), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (P < 0.01), history of cancer (P = 0.04), creatinine more than 1.2 (P < 0.01), elevated ASA class (P = 0.01), operative time more than 4 hours (P = 0.01), and prolonged hospital length of stay more than 4 days (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Thirty-day unplanned readmission rates increased with procedure invasiveness. Both medical and surgical reasons contributed to readmission, many unavoidable. Surgeons should explore optimization measures for those at risk of early, unplanned readmission.

### Risk factors associated with development of urinary retention following posterior lumbar spinal fusion: special attention to the use of glycopyrrolate in anesthesia reversal [^1178SVd3]. Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

The study is designed as a retrospective cohort study.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors of postoperative urinary retention in spine surgery patients.

Summary Of Background Data

Postoperative urinary retention is a common complication in patients undergoing operative procedures requiring anesthesia. Current studies have shown significant risk factors for postoperative urinary retention, but most are nonmodifiable and subsequently of limited usefulness in preventing this complication. Several new studies have shown possible modifiable risk factors, but current data are inconsistent in terms of their statistical significance.

Methods

A total of 814 consecutive patients who underwent open posterior lumbar laminectomy and fusion were included in the retrospective cohort study. Pre, intra-, and postoperative characteristics were collected in all patients to identify risk factors for postoperative urinary retention.

Results

Glycopyrrolate use (odds ratio [OR] 2.60; P = 0.001), decreased body mass index (OR 0.96; P = 0.018), previous diagnosis of benign prostate hyperplasia (OR 3.34; P ≤ 0.001), and postoperative urinary tract infection (OR 5.60, P = 0.005) were associated with postoperative urinary retention. Previous history of lumbar spine surgery (OR 0.55; P = 0.019) was associated with decreased rates of postoperative urinary retention.

Conclusion

Glycopyrrolate use, benign prostate hyperplasia, and postoperative urinary tract infection were independent risk factors for postoperative urinary retention. The use of glycopyrrolate is a potentially modifiable risk factor for postoperative urinary retention. Level of Evidence: 3.

### Risk factors for surgical site infection complicating laminectomy [^111QZsh9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) following spinal surgery and to analyze the associations between a surgeon's years of operating experience and surgical specialty and patients' SSI risk.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

A tertiary care facility and a community hospital in Durham, North Carolina.

Patients

Each case patient who developed an SSI complicating laminectomy was matched with 2 noninfected control patients by hospital, year of surgery, and National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System risk index score.

Results

Forty-one case patients with SSI complicating laminectomy and 82 matched control patients were analyzed. Nonwhite race, diabetes and an elevated body mass index (BMI) were more common among case patients than among control patients. Subjects with a BMI greater than 35 were more likely to undergo a prolonged procedure, compared with case patients who had a BMI of 35 or less. The SSI rate for patients operated on by neurosurgeons was 28%, compared with 43% for patients operated on by orthopedic surgeons (odds ratio [OR], 0.5; p = 0.12). The number of years of operating experience were not associated with SSI risk. Multivariate analysis revealed diabetes (OR, 4.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.1–16.3]; p = 0.04), BMI greater than 35 (OR, 7.1 [95% CI, 1.8–28.3]; p = 0.005), and laminectomy at a level other than cervical (OR, 6.7 [95% CI, 1.4–33.3]; p = 0.02) as independent risk factors for SSI following laminectomy.

Conclusion

Diabetes, obesity, and laminectomy at a level other than cervical are independent risk factors for SSI following laminectomy. Preoperative weight loss and tight perioperative control of blood glucose levels may reduce the risk of SSI in laminectomy patients.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^115USzNS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidal vertebral infection — surgical approaches delineate approach-specific indications and risks: An anterior approach is appropriate when infection is confined to the disc space or vertebral body, is familiar to most spine surgeons with less morbidity, and most patients tolerate anterior cervical and retroperitoneal lumbar procedures extremely well; the entire disc and surrounding bones should be removed even if complete corpectomy is required. Lateral approaches provide access from T3 to L3, with thoracotomy or VATS exposing T3 through L2 and a lateral retroperitoneal approach accessing L1 through L4; if complete vertebral destruction is present, a corpectomy should be performed and the ventral epidural space and thecal sac should be exposed. Posterior approaches can be used for any segment and would usually be employed to decompress an epidural abscess, but a posterior-only decompression of a ventral epidural abscess should be performed with great caution; a laminectomy alone is unlikely to be effective and may contribute to spinal destabilization; posterior approaches are typically more painful, have a higher risk of poor wound healing and wound infection, require longer recovery, and dorsal incisions are prone to infection and poor healing in recumbent patients due to direct pressure and less effective wound care. The posterolateral approach has utility limited to the midthoracic region (T3–T8); in general it allows access to the vertebral body, lateral vertebral elements, and ventral, lateral, and posterior epidural space, but muscle dissection and longer incision length contribute to postoperative morbidity.

### Predicting surgical site infection after lumbar laminectomy and discectomy: a cutting-edge algorithmic approach by incorporating ensembled stacking into the current state-of-the-art for automated machine learning [^111FfRJF]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to this, the significance of age as a predictor highlighted the need for age-appropriate perioperative care modifications. Older patients may benefit from preoperative nutritional optimization, careful medication management to avoid immunosuppression, and potentially extended antibiotic prophylaxis in selected cases. The patient's age should be incorporated into preoperative risk assessment tools and may warrant consideration when planning the extent and duration of surgery.

The relative importance of these patient-specific factors over procedure-related variables (such as the use of the endoscope) suggested that the optimization of the perioperative management protocols may yield greater benefits for SSI prevention than modifications to surgical technique alone. This finding challenges the common focus on intraoperative factors and supports a more holistic approach to SSI prevention that begins well before the patient enters the operating room. These findings could be translated into a risk-stratification protocol where patients with multiple high-risk features (advanced age, smoking history, and anticipated lengthy procedures) receive enhanced preventive interventions. Such interventions should also include preoperative patient comorbidity optimization, chlorhexidine shower before surgery, hair clipping outside of the operating room, advanced wound closure techniques, extended antibiotic prophylaxis, modifications to post-surgical dressing practices, and more intensive postoperative monitoring. Additionally, these findings suggest that resource allocation for SSI prevention might be optimized by focusing on patient-specific risk factors rather than the universal application of costly interventions.

### Predicting surgical site infection after lumbar laminectomy and discectomy: a cutting-edge algorithmic approach by incorporating ensembled stacking into the current state-of-the-art for automated machine learning [^115aLUgp]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SSIs are a significant complication following lumbar laminectomy and discectomy that is routinely performed for managing adult DSD. The reported prevalence rates for SSIs in lumbar surgeries varied widely, ranging from 0.7 to 16%, depending on factors such as patient comorbidities, surgical technique, and perioperative management. SSIs can lead to serious complications, including prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, readmissions, and, in severe cases, hardware failure or the need for revision surgeries. These infections have also been reported to impair functional outcomes by delaying recovery and increasing pain and disability. Addressing SSIs in this patient population is crucial as the degenerative nature of the spinal pathology often predisposes patients to the prolonged requirement of management, potentially compounding the impact of infection on their quality of life. Additionally, a substantial proportion of patients undergoing lumbar surgeries are older adults with comorbidities, further increasing the risk of infection. Effective preventive strategies, such as strict aseptic techniques, perioperative antibiotic administration, and optimal postoperative care, are essential to minimize infection risks and improve clinical outcomes.

The findings of this study demonstrated the successful development of an accurate and reliable predictive model for SSIs following lumbar laminectomy and discectomy procedures to manage adult DSD. The stacked ensemble algorithmic model, which combined a stacked XGBoost model and an ensemble of XGBoost, neural network, CatBoost, LGBM, and RF models, achieved an mWA-AUROC of 0.994 and an accuracy of 98.7%.

The superior performance of the stacked ensemble model can be attributed to its ability to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple individual algorithms through the ensembling and stacking techniques. By integrating the predictive capabilities of these diverse models, the stacked ensemble was able to capture complex nonlinear relationships and effectively handle the inherent heterogeneity in the dataset. The high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (98.81%) of the stacked ensemble model demonstrated its ability to accurately identify both true positive and true negative cases, recognizing it as a valuable potential tool for clinical decision-making.

### The impact of surgeon volume on patient outcome in spine surgery: a systematic review [^111GbXug]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recently, strategies aimed at optimizing provider factors have been proposed, including regionalization of surgeries to higher volume centers and adoption of volume standards. With limited literature promoting the regionalization of spine surgeries, we undertook a systematic review to investigate the impact of surgeon volume on outcomes in patients undergoing spine surgery.

Methods

We performed a systematic review examining the association between surgeon volume and spine surgery outcomes. To be included in the review, the study population had to include patients undergoing a primary or revision spinal procedure. These included anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), anterior/posterior cervical fusion, laminectomy/decompression, anterior/posterior lumbar decompression with fusion, discectomy, and spinal deformity surgery (spine arthrodesis).

Results

Studies were variable in defining surgeon volume thresholds. Higher surgeon volume was associated with a significantly lower risk of postoperative complications, a lower length of stay (LOS), lower cost of hospital stay and a lower risk of readmissions and reoperations/revisions.

Conclusions

Findings suggest a trend towards better outcomes for higher volume surgeons; however, further study needs to be carried out to define objective volume thresholds for individual spine surgeries for surgeons to use as a marker of proficiency.

### Risk factors for spinal surgical-site infections in a community hospital: a case-control study [^112yq65a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize risk factors for surgical-site infection after spinal surgery.

Design

A case-control study.

Setting

A 113-bed community hospital.

Method

From January 1998 through June 2000, the incidence of surgical-site infection in patients undergoing laminectomy, spinal fusion surgery, or both increased at community hospital A. We compared 13 patients who acquired surgical-site infections after laminectomy, spinal fusion surgery, or both with 47 patients who were operated on during the same time period but did not acquire a surgical-site infection. Information collected included demographics, risk factors, personnel involved in the operations, length of hospital stay, and hospital costs.

Results

Of 13 case-patients, 9 (69%) were obese, 9 (69%) had spinal compression, 5 (38.5%) had a history of tobacco use, and 4 (31%) had diabetes. Oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (6 of 13; 46%) was the most common organism isolated. Significant risk factors for postoperative spinal surgical-site infection were dural tear during the surgical procedure and the use of glue to cement the dural patch (3 of 13 [23%] vs 1 of 47 [2.1%]; p = 0.02) and American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class of 3 or more (6 of 13 [46.2%] vs 7 of 47 [15%]; p = 0.02). Case-patients were more likely to have prolonged length of stay (median, 16 vs 4 days; P < .001). The average excess length of stay was 11 days and the excess cost per case was $12,477.

Conclusion

Dural tear and the use of glue should be evaluated as potential risk factors for spinal surgical-site infection. Systematic observation for potential lapses in sterile technique and surgical processes that may increase the risk of infection may help prevent spinal surgical-site infection.

### Explantation and simultaneous explantation-reimplantation of spinal cord stimulation paddle electrodes: complication rate and predisposing factors [^115s3UiJ]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a safe, effective, and reversible treatment for patients suffering from severe chronic pain unresponsive to conservative treatment, such as failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and painful neuropathy. Despite good efficacy and optimized patient selection, the explantation rate for all SCS electrodes is up to 38% and for surgically implanted SCS paddle electrodes is up to 25%. - The most common reasons for explantation are loss of benefit, infection, need for MRI, and hardware malfunction.

Although the risks involved in the implantation of SCS electrodes are well documented, there is scarce information about SCS explantations and their associated complications. We focused our study on surgically implanted SCS paddle electrodes that require an approach through a laminotomy or, in some centers, a laminectomy. Their considerable size and more invasive removal procedure can predispose patients to complications.

Typically for surgically implanted foreign bodies, the SCS electrode eventually becomes encapsulated. The dura below the electrode usually becomes thinner and frailer, which can lead to dural tear and cerebrospinal fluid leakage during explantation. Manipulation of scar tissue and the electrode can cause medullar contusion leading to neurological impairment. Reoperating on already damaged tissue makes hemostasis more challenging, predisposing to epidural hematoma formation and slower wound healing, increasing the risk of infection. Extended bone removal increases the risk of instability. All these risks must be considered and discussed with the patient when considering SCS paddle electrode removal.

In this study, we examined the surgical complications and the associated risk factors involved in the removal of SCS paddle electrodes.

### Minimally invasive decompression versus open laminectomy for central stenosis of the lumbar spine: pragmatic comparative effectiveness study [^11213vdj]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Stenosis of the lumbar spine is a highly prevalent condition that often results from a gradual, degenerative aging process. The clinical syndrome of the stenosis is characterised by low back pain and pain and numbness in the legs, and it is a common source of impaired walking and disability in older people (≥ 60 years). Sudden changes in symptomatology are uncommon, and an expectant or non-surgical approach is often chosen for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, with sparse motivation for surgery, or in whom the risk of surgery outweighs the potential benefits. Most patients with symptoms who are managed without surgery report no substantial change over the course of one year. Still, there is growing evidence that surgical decompression offers an advantage over non-surgical management for selected patients with persistent severe symptoms. Consequently, lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common indication for spinal surgery in elderly people, and as the oldest sector of the population continues to grow the prevalence of the condition is likely to increase.

Open laminectomy, often combined with medial facetectomy and foraminotomy, has traditionally been the standard treatment in patients without instability. In recent years less invasive procedures have emerged, and microdecompression through smaller incisions is frequently performed. As is often the case in surgery, the shift towards minimally invasive methods has not been backed by solid evidence. Except for a small and probably underpowered trial that reported promising results with bilateral microdecompression, no comparative studies have been performed. In the management of lumbar spinal stenosis it is essentially unknown if microdecompression is equivalent to the traditional laminectomy that it has replaced in many spine centres.

In this observational registry based equivalence study we compared clinical outcomes in patients with central stenosis of the lumbar spine treated with either open laminectomy or microdecompression.

### Posterior lateral arthrodesis as a treatment option for lumbar spinal stenosis: safety and early clinical outcomes [^112ro7T7]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the low complication rate observed in this study, PLSA may be a viable alternative to more invasive open surgical interventions for LSS. This is particularly relevant for elderly patients or those with significant comorbidities, who may be deemed high-risk for more extensive surgery. In addition, there is a biomechanical increase in the surface area of the spinal canal once this device is placed, In some cases this negates the need for a more invasive open decompression. In a study conducted by Proietti et al it was found that the complication rate in patients receiving surgery for lumbar stenosis was 14.77% with a higher incidence of major complications in the fusion group. In this study patients being treated for spondylolisthesis had a complication rate of 25.7%. In a prospective study conducted by Reis et al, 23% of patients experienced complications after undergoing spine surgery. Surgical site infection was the most common, accounting for 9% of cases. The risk of complications was higher among patients who underwent spine instrumentation compared to non-instrumented surgery (33% vs 22%). A recent prospective study analyzed 526 patients who underwent spinal surgery, examining clinical characteristics, comorbidities, surgical management, and outcomes. The overall postoperative complication rate was 26%, with revision surgery required in 12% of cases within 30 postoperative days. When compared with our data, it suggests that PLSA may be a safer alternative to lumbar decompression or fusion surgeries in patients with LSS with or without grade 1–2 spondylolisthesis.

LSS surgery aims to decompress the spinal canal while maintaining stability. Fusion is sometimes necessary, but it increases costs and risks. Patients undergo diagnostic tests before surgery to ensure they can withstand the operation. Surgical treatments have higher financial costs than nonoperative care, with costs not including follow-up care, skilled nursing facilities, physical therapy, and revision surgery. Lumbar laminectomy has an average hospital charge of $23,724, while laminectomy with fusion has a higher cost due to increased hospital stay, implant costs, and potential complications. Complex and simple fusion procedures have varying complication rates, hospital stays, and costs, with discharged patients often requiring nursing or rehabilitation homes. Between 8% and 10% of patients require revision surgery, with risks increasing based on the number of levels involved. The cost of revision fusion includes surgery, outpatient resource utilization, and indirect costs, such as missed work.

### Allogeneic transfusion requirements after autologous donations in posterior lumbar surgeries [^111qsJKv]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective study of blood transfusion practices after posterior lumbar spine surgery was performed.

Objectives

To determine the overall use rate of autologous blood donations for different spine surgeries, and to identify the risk of requiring additional allogeneic blood transfusions.

Summary Of Background Data

In an attempt to avoid allogeneic blood transfusions and its associated risks, patients frequently are asked to donate autologous blood before many elective spine surgeries. There is a lack of published data on the use rate for these autologous blood donations, and on their ability to prevent allogeneic blood exposure.

Methods

A retrospective review of hospital charts and blood bank records was conducted on 191 consecutive patients who had undergone three categories of lumbar spine surgery: laminectomy alone, laminectomy with a noninstrumented posterolateral fusion, and laminectomy with an instrumented posterolateral fusion.

Results

Nearly 80% of the autologous blood donated by patients who underwent simple laminectomies was wasted. However, the vast majority (70–90%) of patients who underwent fusion used their autologous blood. In the patients who underwent fusion, autologous blood donations decreased the risk of allogenic blood transfusions by 75% in noninstrumented fusions and 50% in instrumented fusions, as compared with the patients who elected not to donate blood before the fusion (P < 0.05). A substantial number of patients who underwent instrumented fusions (nearly 40%) required additional allogeneic blood transfusions despite predonation of blood.

Conclusions

Autologous blood donations are indeed advantageous in decreasing allogeneic blood usage of patients undergoing fusion, but additional methods of blood conservation (intraoperative salvage and preoperative erythropoietin) seem necessary to diminish the allogeneic blood requirements further, especially in those patients undergoing instrumented lumbar fusion.

### Cost-effectiveness and safety of interspinous process decompression (superion) [^111PrC16]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

For diagnosis of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are required, as physical examination and x-ray imaging do not have a high enough sensitivity or specificity. MRI is the most common imaging modality to assess LSS.

There are several treatment options for patients suffering from LSS, including surgical and nonsurgical care. Conservative, nonsurgical treatment consists of medication management, epidural steroid injections (ESIs), and physical therapy (PT). Surgical options include lumbar laminectomy and lumbar laminectomy with fusion. Historically, patients who fail conservative treatment would proceed to surgical intervention.

Interspinous spacer decompression offers a less invasive procedure for patients who fail conservative treatment before traditional, more invasive surgery. This review assesses these treatment modalities to investigate the current cost-effectiveness, safety, and performance of these modalities compared with the interspinous spacer procedure. See Table 1 for an overview of benefits and risks of the treatment modalities and Table 2 for a tabulation of costs associated with the treatment modalities.

### Radiographic characterization of OPLL progression in patients receiving laminoplasty with a minimum of two-years follow-up [^114jpSqK]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a cause of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) that is particularly common in East Asian countries, with a population prevalence of 0.4 to 3.0%. OPLL most often affects the C4 to C6 cervical levels, whilst classification is according to radiographic findings and includes continuous, mixed, segmental, and localized subtypes. Continuous and mixed OPLL have been shown to be associated with higher rates of progression. The exact pathogenesis of OPLL is unclear but suggested to be secondary to both genetic and environmental factors. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of collagen genes have been implicated in pathogenesis whilst dysfunction of human nucleotide pyrophosphatase (NPPS) is proposed to exacerbate tissue calcification. In addition to genetic factors, mechanical stress is a risk factor.

The current standard of care in the treatment of OPLL with neurological impairment is to offer surgical decompression. Direct anterior decompression may be more difficult to achieve when the ossified segment lies posterior to the vertebral body thereby requiring a corpectomy, and as adhesions between the OPLL and ventral dura increases the risk of dural tear and CSF leak. Therefore, when cervical spine alignment is favourable, indirect decompression via a posterior approach is may be preferred particularly in multilevel and/or congenital canal stenosis. For both anterior and posterior approaches, there is the concern that OPLL progression following surgery could lead to recurrence of compression followed by neurological deterioration.

With regards to posterior cervical surgery for OPLL, a recent meta-analysis of laminoplasty in comparison to laminectomy and fusion demonstrated similar neurological outcomes and range of motion after surgery. Shorter operation time and less blood loss was demonstrable following laminoplasty whilst cervical lordotic angle was higher following fusion. It has been reported that up to 70% of patients exhibit progression of OPLL following laminoplasty due to sparing of cervical motion. Nevertheless, recommending laminectomy and fusion when OPLL is treated via a posterior approach remains controversial as some authors have conversely demonstrate increased ossification following fusion, the clinical significance of post-operative OPLL progression remains conflicting, and outcomes at 2-years following laminoplasty remain good in spite of OPLL progression. An additional issue that remains unknown is how OPLL progression differs by cervical level, which has implications on surgical approach, planning, and execution. To address these issues, this study investigated the rates of radiological OPLL progression according to cervical level in patients receiving laminoplasty, with an average post-operative follow-up period exceeding 6-years.

### Preoperative urinary tract infection increases postoperative morbidity in spine patients [^117954wC]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Objective

Compare postoperative infection rates and 30-day outcomes in spine surgery patients with and without a preoperative urinary tract infection (UTI).

Summary Of Background Data

There is mixed evidence regarding safety and risks when operating on spine patients with a preoperative UTI.

Methods

Using data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, we identified all adult patients undergoing spine surgery between 2012 and 2017 with a preoperative UTI. Patients with other preoperative infections were excluded. Our primary outcome was any postoperative infection (pneumonia, sepsis, surgical site infection, and organ space infection). Our secondary outcomes included surgical site infections, non-infectious complications, return to operating room, and 30-day readmission and mortality. We used univariate, then multivariate Poisson regression models adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and case details to investigate the association between preoperative UTI status and postoperative outcomes.

Results

A total of 270,371 patients who underwent spine surgery were analyzed. The most common procedure was laminectomy (41.9%), followed by spinal fusion (31.7%) and laminectomy/fusion (25.6%). Three hundred fourty one patients had a preoperative UTI (0.14%). Patients with a preoperative UTI were more likely to be older, female, inpatients, emergency cases, with a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and a longer operating time (for all, P < 0.001). Patients with a preoperative UTI had higher rates of infectious and non-infectious complications, return to operating room, and unplanned readmissions (for all, P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in mortality (0.6% vs. 0.2%, P = 0.108). Even after controlling for demographics, comorbidities, labs, and case details, preoperative UTI status was significantly associated with more postoperative infectious complications (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.25–3.70, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Preoperative UTI status is significantly associated with postoperative infections and worse 30-day outcomes. Spine surgeons should consider delaying or cancelling surgery in patients with a UTI until the infection has cleared to reduce adverse outcomes.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery — Olsen (2003) case-control risk factors with standard cephalosporin or vancomycin: After laminectomy or spinal fusion, infections were identified between two and 83 days (median 14 days), with 53/1918 infections and an infection rate of 2.76% despite prophylaxis; multivariate analysis identified postoperative incontinence, body mass index, tumor resection, and posterior approach as independent risk factors, and morbid obesity was associated with higher observed risk (OR 5.2, 95% C. I. = 1.9–14.2).

### Erector spinae plane block improves postoperative recovery after laminectomy and discectomy surgery: a retrospective cohort study [^113vuzcX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The reduction in length of stay could imply a significant reduction in hospital costs. An occupied hospital bed at a neurology department in the Netherlands has a cost price (including overhead) of approximately €30 per hour (source Performation benchmark, 2019). So for single level laminectomy, this is a reduction in hospital costs of €720 per patient and for multilevel laminectomy €150 per patient. In the Netherlands, approximately 6000 laminectomies of 1 level and 4000 laminectomies of multiple levels are performed per year by neurosurgeons (, 2019). Implementing this regional anesthesia technique can save yearly up to € 5,000,000 in medical costs.

Discectomy and laminectomy can also be done under spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia with an intrathecal injection of morphine by the surgeon at the end of surgery. Intrathecal opioids have been demonstrated to provide excellent pain relief in patients undergoing lumbar laminectomy. However, in the PROSPECT guideline on postoperative pain after laminectomy by the ESRA the side effects of intrathecal opioids are called worrisome, particularly because this procedure is increasingly being performed as an outpatient procedure. "These potential side effects include — but are not limited to — respiratory depression, cardiovascular stress, cognitive dysfunction, delayed wound healing, urinary and gastrointestinal dysfunction, as well as the risk of acquired tolerance and long-term opioid use. Therefore, it is prudent to avoid intrathecal opioids". There are no studies yet comparing spinal anesthesia to general anesthesia plus ESP block.

Adjacent segment disease is another risk associated with spinal fusion. The 10-year prevalence of adjacent segment disease requiring surgical treatment following lumbar spinal fusion ranges from 22% to 27%, with a 2.5% incidence per year. There is some thought that issues related to spinopelvic alignment (e.g. significant pelvic incidence lumbar lordosis mismatch) or other intrinsic risk factors contribute to the likelihood of adjacent segment disease after fusion.

Staartjes and Schoder maintain that, although laminectomy with fusion may not be an appropriate treatment for the majority of patients with spinal stenosis accompanied by Grade 1 spondylolisthesis, there remains a subset of patients who would benefit from a combination of the two procedures. They assigned patients to treatment with laminectomy (N = 51) or laminectomy plus fusion (N = 51) using a decision-making protocol based on clinical history, location of nerve root compression, and facet angles/facet effusion to assign patients to receive one or both procedures. Results indicated a low rate of revision surgery for iatrogenic spondylolisthesis after laminectomy alone and positive patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Similar findings by Austevoll et al. suggested that a considerable number of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis can be treated with decompression alone.

Decompression laminectomy with fusion is significantly more expensive than laminectomy alone. For example, a cost-benefit analysis compared 320 patients with stenosis who underwent laminectomy with 344 patients with stenosis and spondylolisthesis who underwent laminectomy plus fusion and found that, over a two-year postsurgery period, the cost of the former procedure was $77,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, whereas the cost of the latter procedure was $115,000 per QALY gained. The authors note that $100,000 per QALY gained is often considered to be the maximum at which a procedure is considered to be cost-effective.

### Trends, major medical complications, and charges associated with surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis in older adults… [^111xPUes]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To examine trends in use of different types of stenosis operations and the association of complications and resource use with surgical complexity. Main Outcome Measures Rates of the 3 types of surgery, major complications, postoperative mortality, and resource use. Results Overall, surgical rates declined slightly from 2002–2007, but the rate of complex fusion procedures increased 15-fold, from 1. 3 to
19. 9 per 100 000 beneficiaries. Life-threatening complications increased with increasing surgical invasiveness, from 2. 3% among patients having decompression alone to
5. 6% among those having complex fusions. After adjustment for age, comorbidity, previous spine surgery, and other features, the odds ratio of life-threatening complications for complex fusion compared with decompression alone was 2.
95. A similar pattern was observed for rehospitalization within 30 days, which occurred for
7.

8% of patients undergoing decompression and 13. 0% having a complex fusion. Major medical complications were reported in 3. 1% of patients overall, and wound complications in

1. 2%. Mortality was 0. 4% within 30 days of discharge. Major medical complications and mortality increased modestly with increasing age and were generally similar for men and women. Major complications and mortality were slightly higher among nonwhite patients than among whites. Wound complications were not significantly associated with demographic factors. Major medical complications and mortality rose with increasing comorbidity. For example, major medical complications occurred in 5. 3% of patients with a comorbidity score of 3 or greater compared with
2. 5% among those with a score of 0. Complication rates were only modestly affected by comorbid diabetes, obesity, or chronic coronary disease.

However, complications and mortality were substantially greater among patients with chronic lung diseases than those without. Hospitalizations in the previous year strongly predicted complications and mortality. Complex fusion procedures had an odds ratio of 2. 95 for life-threatening complications compared with decompression alone. For wound complications, previous surgery and greater surgical complexity were the greatest risk factors after adjustment.

### Patient characteristics associated with increased postoperative length of stay and readmission after elective laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis [^115S6rmz]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort.

Objective

To identify factors that were independently associated with increased postoperative length of stay (LOS) and readmission in patients who underwent elective laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common pathology that is traditionally treated with decompressive laminectomy. Risk factors associated with increased LOS and readmission have not been fully characterized for laminectomy.

Methods

Patients who underwent laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis during 2011 and 2012 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Patient characteristics were tested for association with LOS and readmission using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with LOS more than 10 days were excluded from the readmission analysis as the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program only captures readmissions within 30 postoperative days, and the window for potential readmission was deemed too short for patients staying longer than 10 days.

Results

A total of 2358 patients who underwent laminectomy met inclusion criteria. The average age was 66.4 ± 11.7 years (mean ± standard deviation). Average postoperative LOS was 2.1 ± 2.6 days. Of those meeting criteria for readmission analysis, 3.7% of patients (86 of 2339) were readmitted within 30 days postoperatively. Independent risk factors for prolonged LOS were increased age (P < 0.001), increased body mass index (P = 0.004), American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3–4 (P = 0.005), and preoperative hematocrit less than 36.0 (P = 0.001). Independent risk factors for readmission were increased age (P = 0.013), increased body mass index (P = 0.040), American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3–4 (P < 0.001), and steroid use (P = 0.001). The most common reason for readmission was surgical site-related infections (25.0% of patients readmitted in 2012).

Conclusion

The identified factors associated with LOS and readmission after lumbar laminectomy may be useful for optimizing patient care.

### Different gabapentin and pregabalin dosages for perioperative pain control in patients undergoing spine surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112wW748]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Optimal pain control for spine surgery necessitates a multimodal approach, as emphasized by the guideline recommendations put forth by Peene et aland Waelkens et al. These studies underscore the significance of adopting a comprehensive strategy that combines various interventions to effectively manage pain and enhance patient outcomes. Peene et alnoted that although gabapentinoids have proven efficacy in managing pain in the patient population undergoing lumbar laminectomy, they are not recommended as the first line of treatment because of the substantial risk of important adverse effects, including sedation, dizziness, and visual blurring. It is important to consider the risk-benefit profile of gabapentinoids and exercise caution when prescribing them. Our study further contributes to this understanding by specifically examining the comparative effectiveness of different dosages of gabapentinoids in the context of spine surgery, providing additional insights into their use and helping clinicians make informed decisions regarding pain management strategies in this population. In contrast to the study by Waelkens et al, which concluded that gabapentinoids are not recommended as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen in complex spine surgery because of limited evidence and concerns regarding adverse effects. Our study found no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse effects when comparing different dosages of gabapentinoids in patients undergoing spine surgery. This suggests that, within the dosages evaluated, the use of gabapentinoids does not pose a greater risk of adverse effects compared with other pain medications. However, it is important to note that the potential for adverse effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, is still a concern with gabapentinoid use, as highlighted in the studies by Peene et aland Waelkens et al. Therefore, clinicians should carefully consider the risk-benefit profile of gabapentinoids and monitor patients closely for any adverse reactions when using these medications in the perioperative period. Our study adds to the existing literature by providing specific insights into the comparative effectiveness and safety of gabapentinoids in pain management during spine surgery, helping clinicians make informed decisions regarding their use in this context.

### Lumbar arthrodesis in elderly patients, is it a good option? A retrospective analysis of complications and pain improvement in a geriatric hospital [^114P7g3B]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar arthrodesis is a well-established surgical procedure for degenerative spinal diseases, but its use in patients over 75 remains controversial due to potential complications. This retrospective study evaluates complication rates and postoperative pain control in elderly patients.

Methods

A total of 150 patients over 75 years old underwent lumbar arthrodesis with laminectomy between 2015 and 2022 in a hospital in Galicia, Spain. Patients with tumors, infections, scoliosis, trauma, or prior spinal surgeries were excluded. Follow-up lasted three years and included clinical and imaging assessments.

Results

- Mean age: 78.9 years; 62% female.- Common comorbidities: hypertension (70.7%), osteoporosis (64.4%).- Postoperative complications: 5.3%, including infection, epidural hematoma, pseudoarthrosis, among others.- Significant pain improvement on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS): from 7.82 preoperatively to 2.41 postoperatively.- No statistically significant associations were found between age, number of surgical levels, or comorbidities and the presence of complications.

Conclusions

Lumbar arthrodesis with laminectomy in well-selected elderly patients over 75 may be a safe and effective option for pain relief. Advanced age alone does not imply a higher risk of complications. This study supports its use in geriatric populations under well-defined criteria.

### Predicting sagittal deformity after surgery for intramedullary tumors [^113isJpF]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Spinal deformity after surgery for intramedullary tumors is a potentially serious complication that may require subsequent fusion. The aim of this study was to determine whether there were risk factors that could be used to predict postoperative sagittal deformity.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective study of patients harboring an intramedullary tumor who had undergone surgery at a single center between 1985 and 2011. The main outcome of interest was the difference, at the last follow-up, between post- and preoperative measures of the Cobb angle formed by the superior and inferior limits of the laminectomy (ΔCobb).

Results

Sixty-three patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. The mean sagittal deformity, measured as described above, was 15.9° (range 0°-77°) at a mean follow-up of 85.4 months (range 4–240 months). Univariate analysis showed increased sagittal deformity in patients 30 years old or younger (21.9° vs 13.7°, p = 0.04), undergoing a laminectomy involving 4 or more levels (19.3° vs 12.1°, p = 0.04), and undergoing a laminectomy that included a spinal junction (20.8° vs 12.4°, p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that only age (p = 0.01) and the number of spinal levels involved in the laminectomy (p = 0.014) were significant and independent predictors of postoperative sagittal deformity. The linear regression equation drawn from this model allows one to quantitatively predict sagittal deformity for any follow-up time point after surgery.

Conclusions

Authors of this study developed a statistical tool that could be used to plan surgery and follow-up as regards the risk of sagittal spinal deformity in patients undergoing surgery for intramedullary tumors.

### Surgical management of lumbar spinal stenosis in patients over 80: is there an increased risk? [^116Sjgq4]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) represents the first cause of spinal surgery for the elderly and will increase with the aging population. Although the surgery improves quality of life, the procedure involves anaesthetic and operative risks. The aim of this study was to assess whether the postoperative complication rate was higher for elderly patients and to find confounding factors. We conducted a retrospective study including all LSS surgeries between 2012 and 2020 at the University Hospital of Caen. We compared two populations opposing patients aged over 80 with others. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a severe complication (SC). Minor complications were the secondary endpoint. Comorbidities, history of lumbar spine surgery and surgical characteristics were recorded. Nine hundred ninety-six patients undergoing surgery for degenerative LSS were identified. Patients over 80 were significantly affected by additional comorbidities: hypertension, heart diseases, higher age-adjusted comorbidity Charlson score, ASA score and use of anticoagulants. Knee-chest position was preferred for younger patients. Older patients underwent a more extensive decompression and had more incidental durotomies. Of the patients, 5.2% presented SC. Age over 80 did not appear to be a significant risk factor for SC, but minor complications increased. Multivariate analysis showed that heart diseases, history of laminectomy, AA-CCI and accidental durotomies were independent risk factors for SC. Surgical management for lumbar spinal stenosis is not associated to a higher rate of severe complications for patients over 80 years of age. However, preoperative risk factors should be investigated to warn the elderly patients that the complication risk is increased although an optimal preparation is the way to avoid them.

### Incidence and risk factors of anterior arch fracture of the atlas following C1 laminectomy without fusion [^1124e55i]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective multicenter study.

Objective

To identify the incidence of anterior arch fracture (AAF) of the atlas following C1 (first cervical vertebra) laminectomy without fusion, and its risk factors.

Summary Of Background Data

C1 laminectomy without fusion is a widely accepted surgical procedure performed to decompress the spinal cord that is compromised at the C1/C2 level, but without instability. Several case series have reported spontaneous AAF following this procedure. However, the incidence of post-laminectomy AAF and its risk factors have not been studied.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients who underwent C1 laminectomy without fusion in any of the four participating institutions between April 2002 and March 2016. The incidence of AAF following C1 laminectomy was determined, and the included patients were grouped into those who developed AAF (AAF group) and those who did not (non-AAF group). Patient demographics and radiographic parameters including subaxial cervical balance on x-ray (C2–7 sagittal vertical axis, C2–7 lordosis, C2–7 coronal cobb angle, and T1-slope), and morphology of the atlas on computed tomography (CT) scan were compared with the AAF and non-AAF groups.

Results

Seventy patients who underwent C1 laminectomy without fusion were included in the study. The incidence of AAF was 14.2% (10/70). Multivariate analysis revealed that a large inferior facet angle (IFA, defined as the coronal inclination angle of the C1/2 facet as measured on CT) and the presence of subaxial ankylosis (bony ankylosis below C2 on CT) were independent risk factors for AAF. There were no significant differences in the subaxial cervical balance as measured on x-ray between the AAF and non-AAF groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

The incidence of AAF after C1 laminectomy without fusion is not uncommon. Preoperative assessment using CT may identify patients at high risk of AAF.

### Predicting surgical site infection after lumbar laminectomy and discectomy: a cutting-edge algorithmic approach by incorporating ensembled stacking into the current state-of-the-art for automated machine learning [^111czRPd]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

While the stacked ensemble model demonstrated exceptional performance, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The dataset adopted for the analysis was imbalanced as only 1% (n = 26) of patients developed an SSI. Imbalanced datasets introduce several risks, including bias towards the majority class, which can lead to poor predictive performance for the minority class that often represents critical outcomes. They can also result in misleading performance metrics, such as accuracy, which may give a false sense of model effectiveness while masking inadequate learning from the minority class. Furthermore, the developed stacked ensembled algorithmic model may struggle to generalize to new data with different class distributions, leading to unreliable predictions. This imbalance can also increase the rates of false positives and false negatives, which can have serious implications in clinical decision-making.

The dataset was also limited to a specific geographic region and time period, which may not fully capture the diversity of patient populations and surgical practices across different healthcare settings. Validating the model's performance on external datasets from diverse clinical settings would further strengthen the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study focused on predicting SSIs following lumbar laminectomy and discectomy procedures for adult DSD management. Future research could explore the applicability of this approach to other spinal procedures and aetiologies, such as fusion surgeries and oncological ailments, to broaden the scope and utility of the predictive model. Another potential area for future investigation is the integration of the developed predictive model into clinical workflows and decision support systems. Evaluating the impact of the developed model on clinical decision-making, patient outcomes, and resource utilization in a real-world setting shall provide valuable insights into its practical implications and potential for widespread adoption. Although the current study did rely on a prospectively calculated dataset, more comprehensive data, including intraoperative details and postoperative surveillance data, such as iatrogenic durotomy and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, that have not been reported in the adopted dataset but are known to influence SSI rates, could enhance the predictive capabilities of the predictive algorithmic model and provide better risk prediction. Therefore, we plan to externally validate our developed algorithmic model in the near future on the comprehensive prospectively collected SSI tracking database maintained in our institution. We also plan to further optimize our institution's SSI protocol by exploring if the current 'high-risk' criteria for SSI require a stringent revision after externally validating the developed model on the prospectively calculated database.

### Risk factors for failure after lumbar tubular microdecompression without stabilization [^111JTroQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify radiographic and MRI imaging markers associated with failure after lumbar tubular microdecompression (LTM) without stabilization or fusion.

Background

LTM is a minimally invasive option for treating lumbar spine pathology without instability. Stabilization procedures are considered but may be associated with increased blood loss, risk of future adjacent segment disease, and higher costs and should be used only when required.

Methods

Four hundred sixty-eight patients undergoing LTM for central, lateral recess and foraminal/extraforaminal stenosis between 2014 and 2023, including unilateral laminotomy, unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompressions, and far lateral decompression, were included. Preoperative imaging was reviewed for evidence of static and dynamic degenerative spondylolisthesis, facet effusions, and synovial cysts. The primary outcome was failure following LTM, which was defined as undergoing fusion, open laminectomy, or revision LTM at the same level of the index procedure for recurrent symptoms during the exposure period. Poisson regressions were done and controlled for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status, with an offset for total follow-up time.

Results

Static spondylolisthesis was not associated with failure (1.00 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.03], P = 0.996), whereas increases in dynamic spondylolisthesis (1.13 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.26], P = 0.034) and facet effusions (1.22 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.48], P = 0.040) predicted increased risk for failure. Presence of spinal synovial cysts was not associated with failure (0.6 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.4], P = 0.469).

Discussion

The presence of dynamic spondylolisthesis and facet effusions suggest that decompression alone may result in a greater likelihood of failure, and the addition of stabilization procedures should be considered.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

### A systematic review of clinical and surgical predictors of complications following surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^113jQMPT]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Although generally safe and effective, surgery for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is associated with complications in 11%-38% of patients. Several predictors of postoperative complications have been proposed but few are used to detect high-risk patients. A standard approach to identifying "at-risk" patients would improve surgeons' ability to prevent and manage these complications. The authors aimed to compare the complication rates between various surgical procedures used to treat CSM and to identify patient-specific, clinical, imaging, and surgical predictors of complications.

Methods

The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature and searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1948 to September 2013. Cohort studies designed to evaluate predictors of complications and intervention studies conducted to compare different surgical approaches were included. Each article was critically appraised independently by 2 reviewers, and the evidence was synthesized according to the principles outlined by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group.

Results

A total of 5472 citations were retrieved. Of those, 60 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. These studies included 36 prognostic cohort studies and 28 comparative intervention studies. High evidence suggests that older patients are at a greater risk of perioperative complications. Based on low evidence, other clinical factors such as body mass index, smoking status, duration of symptoms, and baseline severity score, are not predictive of complications. With respect to surgical factors, low to moderate evidence suggests that estimated blood loss, surgical approach, and number of levels do not affect rates of complications. A longer operative duration (moderate evidence), however, is predictive of perioperative complications and a 2-stage surgery is related to an increased risk of major complications (high evidence). In terms of surgical techniques, higher rates of neck pain were found in patients undergoing laminoplasty compared with anterior spinal fusion (moderate evidence). In addition, with respect to laminoplasty techniques, there was a lower incidence of C-5 palsy in laminoplasty with concurrent foraminotomy compared with nonforaminotomy (low evidence).

Conclusions

The current review suggests that older patients are at a higher risk of perioperative complications. A longer operative duration and a 2-stage surgery both reflect increased case complexity and can indirectly predict perioperative complications.

### Does an unintended durotomy in metastatic spine surgery lead to shorter survival? [^112sJemP]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study aimed to report the incidence of an unintended durotomy in metastatic spine surgery, risk factors for an unintended durotomy, and the impact of unintended durotomy on perioperative and postoperative outcomes, particularly the risk of CNS recurrence. In our cohort, 5% had an unintended durotomy, and costotransversectomies were associated with increased risk of an unintended durotomy. Approximately 25% of patients with a durotomy had a postoperative CSF leak, requiring either a reoperation or lumbar drain. Regarding long-term outcomes, no differences were observed in LR, any spinal recurrence, OS, or new CNS metastasis, with 2 of 19 patients with durotomy developing new intradural or intracranial metastases. These findings indicate that unintended durotomy did not significantly affect long-term outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for extradural spinal metastasis.

Unintended durotomies during metastatic spine tumor surgery were rare and occurred in 5% of patients. Of these, 26% had a postoperative CSF leak requiring intervention, yet this did not delay the start of radiation. Moreover, patients with an unintended durotomy were more likely to have undergone a costotransversectomy. Reasons for this association may be that removing part of the rib exposes the lateral and ventral thoracic cord and is a more invasive approach that requires more bony resection than a laminotomy or transpedicular decompression alone. It is possible that the additional bony removal may have been performed in bigger tumors that required more cytoreduction. However, despite the enhanced visualization afforded by this technique, its technical complexity and extensive exposure render the dura more susceptible to unintended tears and injury. In a retrospective study of 116 patients, El Naga et alfound that the corpectomy and cage placement phases of the procedure present a particularly higher risk of dural tear and cord injury. Although we found no association with cage placement, the association with a more invasive surgery and higher risk of unintended durotomy makes intuitive sense. In any case, the benefits of a costotransversectomy, primarily due to improved access to the ventral epidural space, must be carefully weighed against the increased risk of an unintended durotomy.

### Two doses of tranexamic acid reduce blood transfusion in complex spine surgery: a prospective randomized study [^113w3tTD]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study.

Objective

To determine whether the use of 2 doses of tranexamic acid (TXA) can reduce perioperative blood loss and blood transfusions in low-risk adult patients undergoing complex laminectomy.

Summary Of Background Data

Complex laminectomy (multilevel laminectomy or laminectomy and instrumentation) is a procedure with a medium risk of blood loss, which may require allogeneic blood transfusion. Previous studies of TXA showed its inconsistent effectiveness in reducing blood loss during spine surgery. The negative results may stem from ineffective use of a single dose of TXA during long and complex operations.

Methods

80 adult (18–65 yr old) patients in Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand were enrolled and allocated into 2 groups (40 patients in each group) by computer-generated randomization. Patients with history of thromboembolic diseases were excluded. Anesthesiologists in charge and patients were blinded. Group I received 0.9% NaCl (NSS) or placebo and group II received 2 doses (15 mg/kg) of TXA. The first dose was administered before anesthesia induction and the second dose, after 3 hours. The assessed outcomes were the amount of perioperative blood loss and the incidence of blood transfusions.

Results

78 patients were analyzed (1 patient in each group was excluded) with 39 patients randomized to each group. There were no differences in patient demographics and pre and postoperative hematocrit levels. The total blood loss in the control group (NSS) was higher [900 (160, 4150) mL] than in the TXA group [600 (200, 4750) mL]. Patients in the control group received more crystalloid, colloid, and packed red blood cell transfusions. Within 24 hours, we observed a 64.6% reduction of blood transfusions (43.5% vs.15.4%, P = 0.006). No serious thromboembolic complications occurred.

Conclusion

2 effective doses (15 mg/kg) of TXA can reduce blood loss and transfusions in low-risk adults undergoing complex spine surgery.

### Informed consent for spine procedures: best practice guideline from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^116dMPgL]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion of Risk, Benefits, Alternatives and Recovery

The consent process will ideally strike a balance between the risks inherent to the procedure and the expected benefits. Establishment of realistic, beneficial outcomes is necessary for appropriate patient understanding of both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. At one end of the spectrum of a balanced discussion lies the patient knowing and understanding possible risks associated with the procedure. Critics of this line of thought state that this would merely confuse the patient, as without the proper medical background, patients may not comprehend this information. Therefore, this would lead to clouded judgement and an unbalanced decision process. The other end of this spectrum is reminiscent of the abolition of the patient's right to autonomy; that due to this lack of knowledge by the patient, the provider becomes the sole decision-maker. Risks which would affect the decision-making process of a reasonable patient should be elaborated, including anything that poses potential grave adverse consequences. With these rare occurrences, objective data regarding these risks should also be presented to the patient. Presenting such risks in forms of proportions (eg, 1 in 1000) rather than percentages (eg, 0.1%) may be beneficial to patient understanding. This discussion should also include an explanation of the safeguards against adverse consequences and steps to address concerns that may arise.

As previously discussed, alternatives to the proposed procedure should be addressed in this discussion. This includes the risk of potential harms associated with receiving no treatment for patients' established diagnoses. Alternatives should include the spectrum of possible treatments for their diagnosis, from no intervention to the most invasive option possible. For example, spinal stenosis is a common spine pathology that produces back and leg symptoms. Some treatment options for spinal stenosis include physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, percutaneous image-guided lumbar decompression, spinous process spacers, and open surgical decompression with or without fusion/instrumentation. When discussing the recommended treatment options with patients, it is highly advisable to present the alternative options on a spectrum of risks while discussing the potential benefits and drawbacks of the treatment options. Patients may be referred for consultation to another provider who has expertise in the proposed alternative treatment option.

Observational study.

Setting

Nationwide inpatient database in Japan, July 2010 to March 2018.

Patients

Patients undergoing one of 15 major elective orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, neurological, thoracic or cardiovascular surgical procedures.

Intervention

ICU admission on the day of surgery. ICU was defined as a separate unit providing critical care services with around-the-clock physician staffing and nursing, the equipment necessary for critical care and a nurse-to-patient ratio at least one to two.

Main Outcome

In-hospital mortality. Patient-level and hospital-level analyses were performed.

Results

Overall, 2 011 265 patients from 1524 hospitals were assessed. The cohort size ranged from 38 547 patients in 467 hospitals for surgical clipping for cerebral aneurysms to 308 952 patients in 599 hospitals for spinal fixation, laminectomy or laminoplasty. In the patient-level analyses, there were no significant mortality differences among patients undergoing the 12 major noncardiovascular surgical procedures, whereas postoperative ICU admission was associated with trends towards lower in-hospital mortality among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, risk difference -1.0% (95% CI -1.8 to -0.1) open aortic aneurysm repair, risk difference -0.6% (95% CI -1.3 to 0.1), and heart valve replacement, risk difference -0.7% (95% CI-1.6 to 0.1). In the hospital-level analyses, similar to the results of the patient-level analyses, a higher proportion of postoperative ICU admission at hospital level was associated with trends toward lower in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing the three cardiovascular surgical procedures.

Conclusion

This nationwide observational study showed that postoperative ICU admission was associated with improved survival outcomes among patients undergoing three types of cardiac surgery but not among patients undergoing low-risk elective surgery.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis 24 to 36 hours after degenerative spine surgery: risk of hemorrhage and venous thromboembolism [^111Sf3Us]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) started 24 to 36 hours after degenerative spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant postoperative complication best averted with dual mechanical/pharmacological prophylaxis. Pharmacological prophylaxis is widely used in patients with spinal cord injury, but there is no consensus on its role in degenerative spine surgery, particularly after laminectomy with the concurrent risk of epidural hematoma. The literature suggests a small but potentially devastating hemorrhage risk when LMWH is started within 24 hours of spine surgery. An intermediate strategy is delayed LMWH initiation to minimize hemorrhage risk and retain benefits of dual prophylaxis.

Methods

Operative reports of the senior author were retrospectively reviewed for all cases of cervical and lumbar laminectomy from 2007 to 2011. Single-level decompressions without fusion and all nondegenerative cases were excluded. Baseline and operative details were recorded. Mechanical prophylaxis was used throughout admission, and prophylactic LMWH was started postoperative day 1 at 10 PM. All cases of postoperative hemorrhage (epidural hematoma, superficial hematoma, persistent wound drainage), deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism were noted.

Results

A total of 367 patients underwent multilevel laminectomy or laminectomy and fusion for degenerative disease. VTE risk factors (age > 60 yr, smoking, obesity) were common. No patients receiving LMWH 24 to 36 hours after surgery developed postoperative hemorrhage (95% confidence interval: 0–0.8%). Nearly half of the study population underwent lower extremity ultrasonography or chest computed tomography, and acute VTE was diagnosed in 14 patients (3.8%; 95% confidence interval: 2.1–6.3).

Conclusion

LMWH prophylaxis seems to carry a very low hemorrhage risk when started 24 to 36 hours after spine surgery. Larger, prospective studies are needed to assess the safety of early delayed LMWH administration more definitively. Even with aggressive prophylaxis, patients undergoing fusion or multilevel laminectomy for degenerative disease are at significant risk for VTE.

### Incidental durotomy during spinal surgery: a multivariate analysis for risk factors [^112vtw76]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Multivariate analysis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate risk factors for incidental durotomy (ID) in modern spine surgery techniques.

Summary Of Background Data

ID, a relatively common complication of spine surgery, has been associated with postoperative complications such as durocutaneous fistulas, pseudomeningoceles, and arachnoiditis. Revision surgery may be necessary if the dural tear is not recognized and repaired during the initial procedure.

Methods

ID was prospectively documented in patients who underwent spine surgery at a single institution during a 2-year period (n = 4822). Patients with ID (n = 182) from lumbar or thoracolumbar cases were matched 1:1 to a control cohort without ID. Demographic, diagnostic, and surgical procedure data were retrospectively collected and analyzed.

Results

Multivariate analysis identified revision spine surgery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.84–8.06, P < 0.01), laminectomy (aOR: 3.82, 95% CI: 2.02–7.22, P < 0.01), and older age (aOR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04, P < 0.01) as independent risk factors for ID. Fusion (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35–0.99, P = 0.04), foraminectomy, (aOR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.25–0.69, P < 0.01), and lateral approach (aOR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14–0.61, P < 0.01) were independent protective factors.

Conclusion

Prior spine surgery, laminectomy, and older age were significant independent risk factors for ID. The recently developed lateral approach to interbody fusion was identified as a significant protective factor for ID, along with fusion and foraminectomy. These findings may help guide future surgical decisions regarding ID and aid in the patient informed-consent process.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines on patient selection and trial stimulation for spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic non-cancer pain [^116bjYZy]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trial conduct — lead approach, sedation, placement, and duration — includes the following graded recommendations. Percutaneous lead approach should be preferred for SCS trials, compared with any surgical approach (laminotomy or laminectomy), unless there are technical considerations based on patient factors. Grade B; Level of Certainty: Moderate. Either a permanent lead (staged) approach or a temporary lead approach, can be safely used for SCS trial; based on technical expertize, clinical factors, and local practice considerations. However, one needs to consider the potential for increased infection risk with permanent lead approach in association with prolonged trials. The number of percutaneous leads to be used for SCS trial should be based on the clinical judgment. Grade C; Level of Certainty: Low. Percutaneous SCS trial leads should not be inserted under GA or deep sedation due to the risk of spinal cord injury, unless there are specific technical challenges or patient factors. Grade D; Level of Certainty: Low. If trial leads were placed under GA or deep sedation (unable to elicit patient response), the specific indication should be noted in the patient record, along with use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring for appropriate placement with paresthesia-based systems. For SCS systems using paresthesia-based stimulation systems, lead placement should be guided by paresthesia coverage with attempts to capture 80% or more of painful areas. Grade B; Level of Certainty: Moderate. For SCS systems independent of paresthesia, final trial lead placement may be performed based on anatomical placement, with or without real time paresthesia testing. An SCS trial duration of more than 10 days is not recommended ordinarily, as extended duration is associated with higher risk of infection and usually has no clear advantages. Grade D; Level of Certainty: Moderate. We recognize that in some countries the duration of trial is stipulated as per their local/regional/country specific health regulatory authorities or payment systems and that may not be superseded.

### Erector spinae plane block improves postoperative recovery after laminectomy and discectomy surgery: a retrospective cohort study [^115y9n2W]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain management after spinal surgery remains complicated. Preoperative opioid use, is the strongest predictive risk factor for developing poorly controlled pain in spine surgery. Additionally, even in patients determined to be at low risk for poorly controlled pain, one third of all patients has poor pain control postoperatively. Fourteen percent of patients with disc herniation and about one third of patients with spinal stenosis has poorly controlled pain during the first 24 h after surgery. These findings explain why the erector spinae plane (ESP) block is increasingly studied in patients undergoing spine surgery, as it is a relatively easy technique to learn and implement for postoperative pain control in these patients. In our own experience the ESP block reduced postoperative pain and length of stay after posterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery. There is one animal study supporting this hypothesis. ESP block was associated with reduced perioperative opioid consumption, intraoperative adjuvant analgesic use and incidence of pharmacological interventions to treat cardiovascular complications in dogs undergoing a hemilaminectomy. In humans, this was confirmed by a meta-analysis showing a reduction in postoperative pain scores and opioid use in patients undergoing different types of spine surgery. Only one RCT on ESP block in patients undergoing lumbar disc herniation repair has been performed, which showed a reduction in postoperative morphine consumption. There are no studies yet on the effect of ESP block in patients undergoing laminectomy. Also, in studies on the effect of ESP block in spine surgery, length of stay is not frequently reported.

Functional recovery is the single most important target of recovery after surgery. Since discharge criteria after surgery are increasingly standardized, one can assume patients have reached an adequate and equal level of functional recovery at time of discharge. Therefore, the primary outcome parameter is length of hospital stay. In this study we evaluated the effect of the ESP block in patients undergoing laminectomy and discectomy. Our hypothesis is that the ESP block will decrease length of stay (LOS), reduce opioid need and improve numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the use of prophylactic antibiotics in spine surgery [^112EaZ3a]. The Spine Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

E. Wound drains — drain use and infection risk after single level procedures is addressed as follows: The use of drains is not recommended as a means to reduce infection rates following single level surgical procedures (Grade of Recommendation: I [Insufficient Evidence]). In a randomized controlled trial of drain use in 205 patients undergoing a single level laminectomy without fusion, the patients were randomized to determine whether they would receive a wound drain and there was no difference between the groups in terms of infection rates, and it was downgraded to Level II because it was substantially underpowered.

### Preoperative epidural steroid injection does not increase infection risk following posterior cervical surgery [^117S4drL]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to characterize the infection risk of preoperative epidural steroid injection (ESI) in patients undergoing posterior cervical surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

ESI is a helpful tool for alleviating pain and is often used as a diagnostic tool before cervical surgery. However, a recent small-scale study found that ESI before cervical fusion was associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection.

Materials and Methods

Patients from 2010 to 2020 with cervical myelopathy, spondylosis, and radiculopathy who underwent posterior cervical procedure including laminectomy, laminoforaminotomy, fusion, or laminoplasty were queried from the PearlDiver database. Patients who underwent revision or fusion above C2 or who had a diagnosis of neoplasm, trauma, or preexisting infection were excluded. Patients were divided on whether they received an ESI within 30 days before the procedure and subsequently matched by age, sex, and preoperative comorbidities. The χ² analysis was used to calculate the risk of postoperative infection within 90 days. Logistic regression controlling for age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, and operated levels was conducted within the unmatched population to assess infection risk for injected patients across procedure subgroups.

Results

Overall, 299,417 patients were identified with 3897 having received a preoperative ESI and 295,520 who did not. Matching resulted in 975 in the injected group and 1929 in the control group. There was no significant difference in postoperative infection rate in those who received an ESI within 30 days preoperatively and those who did not (3.28% vs. 3.78%, odds ratio = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.57–1.32, P = 0.494). Logistic regression accounting for age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, and levels operated demonstrated that injection did not significantly increase infection risk in any of the procedure subgroups.

Conclusions

The present study found no association between preoperative ESI within 30 days before surgery and postoperative infection in patients undergoing posterior cervical surgery.

### Psychiatric disorders and major spine surgery: epidemiology and perioperative outcomes [^112xcWri]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Analysis of the National Hospital Discharge Survey database from 1990 to 2007.

Objective

To evaluate the influence of preoperative depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, or dementia on in-hospital (1) adverse events, (2) mortality, and (3) nonroutine discharge in patients undergoing major spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Psychiatric comorbidity is a known risk factor for impaired health-related quality of life and poor long-term outcomes after spine surgery, yet little is known about its impact in the perioperative spine surgery setting.

Methods

Using the National Hospital Discharge Survey database, all patients undergoing either spinal fusion or laminectomy between 1990 and 2007 were identified and separated into groups with and without psychiatric disorders. Multivariable regression analysis was performed for each of the outcome variables.

Results

Between 1990 and 2007, a total estimated number of 5,382,343 spinal fusions and laminectomies were performed. The prevalence of diagnosed depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia among the study population increased significantly over time. Depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and dementia were associated with higher rates of nonroutine discharge. Depression, schizophrenia, and dementia were associated with higher rates of adverse events. Dementia was the only psychiatric disorder associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

Conclusion

Patients with preoperative psychiatric disorders undergoing major spine surgery are at increased risk for perioperative adverse events and posthospitalization care, but its effect in perioperative mortality is more limited. Presurgical psychological screening of candidates undergoing spine surgery might ultimately lead to the enhancement of perioperative outcomes in this growing segment of the US population.

### Treatment of chronic low back pain-new approaches on the horizon [^1177EscM]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

With a rising prevalence of chronic low back pain that is expected to rise with an aging population, new therapies are needed to bridge the current gap between conservative measurements and surgical interventions. It is important to remember that those discussed here, whether intravenous, subcutaneous, or via intradiscal injection, should they fail, do not preclude a patient from qualifying for surgical procedures. Spinal surgery, however, is not without potential serious morbidity risks. Post-laminectomy syndrome, also known as failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), is a pain that continues despite surgical intervention, and is a well-described complication with notable treatment failure rates. While individual reports vary on incidence of FBSS, the report with the longest follow-up (average 14.3 years) showed 74.6% of patients had mild residual pain and 12.7% of patients had frequent mild or occasional severe pain, despite treatment intervention. This study also mentioned that 10% of patients had to undergo a revision of their surgery. However, if further studies are found to provide long-term benefit and improvement to quality of life, it may be able to reduce patients who undergo spinal surgery, and the inherent morbidity and mortality involved with all surgical procedures. We believe that with these new therapeutic options, we can bridge the current gap between conservative/interventional procedures and surgeries in patients with chronic back pain.

### How decompression surgery improves the lower back pain in patient with lumbar degenerative stenosis: a propensity-score-matched analysis [^111aPnE3]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Multicenter retrospective case series of patients treated surgically for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).

Objective

We investigated how laminectomy improves lower back pain (LBP) and the factors associated with poor improvement.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar laminectomy is effective for alleviating neurological symptoms caused by LSS, whereas its effect on LBP is still controversial.

Methods

A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from 436 patients (age 72yrs, 69% males) who underwent laminectomy for LSS with 2years of follow-up. We analyzed the following risk factors for residual LBP by uni- and multivariate analyses: age, sex, smoking, occupation, comorbidities, frailty, joint replacement, vertebral fracture, DISH, HRQOL, complications, and the presence of spinal instability. The LBP of male and female patients was analyzed after propensity score matching of known confounders. Patient-reported outcomes (JOABPEQ and VAS scores) were obtained at baseline and the 2-year postoperative follow-up.

Results

LBP was significantly improved at 2years post operation (VAS change 2.3 [95% CI 2.0–2.6], P < 0.01). Fifty-five percent of the patients achieved an MCID, with 67% having no or mild LBP. In the multivariate analysis, sex and baseline LBP were independent risk factors (female: OR 1.9 [1.2–3.0], baseline LBP [VAS ≥ 7.5]: OR 1.9 [1.2–3.1]). Furthermore, the independent risk factors for severe baseline LBP were sex and mental status (female: OR 1.7 [1.1–2.7], P = 0.03, mental status: OR 3.8 [2.4–6.0], P < 0.01). However, an analysis of 102 pairs of propensity-score-matched male and female patients showed no difference in the improvement of LBP (male vs. female: VAS 3.8 ± 2.8 vs. 4.0 ± 2.9, P = 0.61, VAS change 3.1 ± 2.9 vs. 2.7 ± 3.0, P = 0.38).

Conclusion

Decompression surgery for LSS significantly improved LBP. Sex and baseline LBP were risk factors for residual LBP. However, when males and females were matched by confounders, no difference was found in the LBP after surgery. Patients with severe baseline LBP may need further evaluation for their mental status because these patients are likely to have mental problems that potentially contribute to persistent LBP. Level of Evidence: 4.

### Mortality in patients older than 65 years undergoing surgery for degenerative lumbar spine disease: a comparison with the general population [^114BbRCm]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

There is a wide range of options for the treatment of degenerative spinal disorders, given the wide range of diagnoses included in this very general entity (spinal stenosis, disc herniation, foraminal or lateral recess stenosis, among others). Two shorter and "less invasive" procedures (simple discectomy and laminectomy with their different variables -minimally invasive or open-) and a longer and more aggressive procedure, which also requires a more extended hospital stay and recovery time (vertebral fusion with its different variations -minimally invasive, open, interbody fusion, among others-), are the most frequently performed. The latter, a more complex technique, has been associated both with excess of hospital costs, and greater use of primary care in the long-term when performed on older patients.

Despite the patients' older age, the clinical results are satisfactory. However, a certain likelihood of complications has been reported, especially in patients over 80. Two recent studies evaluated the role of frailty in octogenarians undergoing lumbar spine surgery. They found a particular effect on short-term mortality (3 and 6 months) but no relevant differences in the long term. Regarding mortality, only two studies have compared the observed and expected mortality in older patients undergoing surgery for degenerative spine disease. The first analyzed 1-year mortality in a sample of 34418 patients older than 65 years and found a rate of 3.52%. The relative risk of death during this follow-up period, compared with the general American population, adjusted for age and sex, was less than 1 in most of the subgroups analyzed. Furthermore, mortality was higher in men and in patients with an increasing number of comorbidities. The other study mentioned above achieved a longer follow-up of 10 years in a sample of 1015 patients of all ages (538 were older than 60) in South Korea. The 10-year mortality in this study was 6%, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was less than 1 in all age groups older than 50 years (0.45 for ages 70 to 85). In both trials, therefore, the mortality or risk of mortality in older patients was lower than expected in the general population, adjusted for age and gender. However, neither study reported confidence intervals (CI) to determine whether these results were statistically significant.

### Incidental durotomy after posterior lumbar decompression surgery associated with increased risk for venous thromboembolism [^111amE4r]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incidental durotomies can occur during posterior lumbar decompression surgery. Not only can this slow patient recovery but many surgeons recommend a period of bed rest in these situations, which can further slow mobilization. This immobility might be associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after spinal surgery. This study aims to determine whether incidental durotomies are associated with increased risk of VTE in patients undergoing lumbar decompression surgery.

Methods

Adult patients undergoing laminectomy or laminotomy (excluding any with concomitant fusion procedures) for degenerative etiologies and with a minimum of 90-day follow-up were identified from the MSpine Pearldiver dataset. Incidental durotomies were identified based on hospital administrative coding, and patient demographics, comorbidities, and the occurrence and timing of VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and/or pulmonary embolism) were defined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

Of 156,488 lumbar decompression patients included in the study, incidental durotomies was noted for 2,036 (1.3%). Markedly more VTEs were observed in the first five days in the incidental durotomies group (P < 0.001) but not incrementally any day after (P > 0.05). On univariate analyses, a significant increased risk of VTE, DVT, and PE was observed (P < 0.001 for each). On multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex, and comorbidities, odds were significantly increased for VTE (Odds ratios = 1.75, P < 0.001) and DVT (OR = 1.70, P < 0.001) but not independently significant for pulmonary embolism.

Discussion

Patients who have incidental durotomies during lumbar laminectomy or laminotomy surgery were found to have increased odds of VTE, primarily in the first five days. Although not all factors associated with this could be directly determined, slower mobilization would seem to be a likely contributing factor. Increasing mobilization and/or adjusting chemoprophylaxis in this group would seem appropriately considered.

### Spine surgery in the ambulatory surgery center setting: value-based advancement or safety liability? [^115jFjwV]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Here, we systematically review clinical studies that report morbidity and outcomes data for cervical and lumbar surgeries performed in ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). We focus on anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical foraminotomy, cervical arthroplasty, lumbar microdiscectomy, lumbar laminectomy, and minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) and lateral lumbar interbody fusion, as these are prevalent and surgical spine procedures that are becoming more commonly performed in ASC settings. A systematic search of PubMed was conducted, using combinations of the following phrases: "outpatient", "ambulatory", or "ASC" with "anterior cervical discectomy fusion", "ACDF", "cervical arthroplasty", "lumbar", "microdiscectomy", "laminectomy", "transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion", "spine surgery", or "TLIF". In reviewing the available literature to date, there is ample level 3 (retrospective comparisons) and level 4 (case series) evidence to support both the safety and effectiveness of outpatient cervical and lumbar surgery. While no level 1 or 2 (randomized clinical trials) evidence currently exists, the plethora of real-world clinical data creates a formidable argument for serious investments in ASCs for multiple spine procedures.

### Performance assessment of the American college of surgeons risk calculator in metastatic spinal tumor surgery [^111VYjTn]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) surgical risk calculator performance in patients undergoing surgery for metastatic spine disease.

Summary Of Background Data

Patients with spinal metastases may require surgical intervention for cord compression or mechanical instability. The ACS-NSQIP calculator was developed to assist surgeons with estimating 30-day postoperative complications based on patient-specific risk factors and has been validated within several surgical patient populations.

Materials and Methods

We included 148 consecutive patients at our institution who underwent surgery for metastatic spine disease between 2012 and 2022. Our outcomes were 30-day mortality, 30-day major complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS). Predicted risk, determined by the calculator, was compared with observed outcomes using receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve (AUC) and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Analyses were repeated using individual corpectomy and laminectomy Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to determine procedure-specific accuracy.

Results

Based on the ACS-NSQIP calculator, there was good discrimination between observed and predicted 30-day mortality incidence overall (AUC = 0.749), as well as in corpectomy cases (AUC = 0.745) and laminectomy cases (AUC = 0.788). Poor 30-day major complication discrimination was seen in all procedural cohorts, including overall (AUC = 0.570), corpectomy (AUC = 0.555), and laminectomy (AUC = 0.623). The overall median observed LOS was similar to predicted LOS (9 vs. 8.5 d, P = 0.125). Observed and predicted LOS were also similar in corpectomy cases (8 vs. 9 d; P = 0.937) but not in laminectomy cases (10 vs. 7 d, P = 0.012).

Conclusions

The ACS-NSQIP risk calculator was found to accurately predict 30-day postoperative mortality but not 30-day major complications. The calculator was also accurate in predicting LOS following corpectomy but not laminectomy. While this tool may be utilized to predict risk short-term mortality in this population, its clinical value for other outcomes is limited.

### Risk factors analysis for spinal deformity following resection of intradural spinal cord tumors from posterior approach: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gfzVk]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The presented study aimed to identify risk factors for spinal deformity (SD) following resection of intradural spinal cord tumors via posterior approach.

Methods

Articles of interest were found in accordance with PRISMA guidelines utilizing the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Keywords such as "laminoplasty", laminotomy", laminectomy", tumor", resection", spinal deformity", kyphosis", intradural", intramedullary", extramedullary" were applied. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated for dichotomous variables.

Results

From eleven retrospective studies comprising 715 patients, with mean age 17.1 years, 183 developed postoperative SD. Younger age (25 years or below; OR 4.03; p < 0.0001;13 years and below; OR 3.72; p = 0.003) was associated with an elevated risk of SD development. Patients in the age group of > 5 and ≤ 21 years old showed increased risk in the non-fusion subgroup only (OR 9.36; p = 0.02). Preoperative SD was a strong predictor of postoperative SD (OR 12.19; p = 0.0007), particularly accentuated in the non-fusion subgroup (OR 22.14; p < 0.00001). In the non-fusion subgroup, intramedullary tumor location emerged as a significant risk factor for SD (OR 3.67; p = 0.04). Involvement of the thoracolumbar junction increased the risk of postoperative SD (OR 3.11; p = 0.04). In the fusion subgroup, surgery encompassing at least 3 spinal levels elevated the risk of SD (OR 9.18; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Risk factors for postoperative spinal deformity include younger age, preoperative SD, thoracolumbar junction involvement, extensive decompression, and intramedullary tumor location. These findings provide insights for clinicians in strategizing optimal surgical strategies for patients with high risk of SD development.

### Laminectomy with fusion is associated with greater functional improvement compared with laminectomy alone for the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112QEp4H]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and Meta-analysis.

Objective

To compare outcomes and complications profile of laminectomy alone versus laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS).

Summary Of Background Data

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is a common cause of back pain and functional impairment. DLS is associated with high monetary (up to $100 billion annually in the US) and nonmonetary societal and personal costs. While nonoperative management remains the first-line treatment for DLS, decompressive laminectomy with or without fusion is indicated for the treatment-resistant disease.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE for RCTs and cohort studies from inception through April 14, 2022. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute risk of bias tool. We generated odds ratio and standard mean difference estimates for select parameters.

Results

A total of 23 manuscripts were included (n = 90,996 patients). Complication rates were higher in patients undergoing laminectomy and fusion compared with laminectomy alone (OR: 1.55, P < 0.001). Rates of reoperation were similar between both groups (OR: 0.67, P = 0.10). Laminectomy with fusion was associated with a longer duration of surgery (Standard Mean Difference: 2.60, P = 0.04) and a longer hospital stay (2.16, P = 0.01). Compared with laminectomy alone, the extent of functional improvement in pain and disability was superior in the laminectomy and fusion cohort. Laminectomy with fusion had a greater mean change in ODI (-0.38, P < 0.01) compared with laminectomy alone. Laminectomy with fusion was associated with a greater mean change in NRS leg score (-0.11, P = 0.04) and NRS back score (-0.45, P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Compared with laminectomy alone, laminectomy with fusion is associated with greater postoperative improvement in pain and disability, albeit with a longer duration of surgery and hospital stay.

### Radiotherapy and surgery: can this combination be further optimized for patients with metastatic spine disease? [^114AhDYb]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment strategies

Historically, surgery for spinal metastases was used to achieve local tumor control through aggressive debulking-, or en-bloc resections. The alternative surgical option was to merely alleviate cord compression through a posterior laminectomy. However, retrospective studies demonstrated that both surgical interventions were beneficial only in a minority of patients, with the majority developing recrudescent pain and neurological symptoms after surgery. The improvement of systemic therapies and newer radiotherapy techniques, such as SBRT, preclude the need for large and morbid surgery to achieve local tumor control. Major vertebral resections, particularly in cases of radioresistant metastases, are often no longer indicated, leaving mechanical instability and neural element compression as the two primary indications for spinal metastases surgery today.

Patients with neurological symptoms resulting from metastatic spinal cord compression are assessed using the Bilsky grading scale, to evaluate the severity of the compression. Selected patients with high-grade Bilsky are treated with decompressive surgery (with or without stabilization) followed by radiotherapy. The goal of surgery is to relieve epidural compression by opening the bony spinal canal and creating additional space, thereby alleviating symptoms related to spinal cord compression. Creating additional space around the spinal cord or cauda equina can be achieved through various surgical approaches, ranging from posterolateral laminectomy to costotransversectomy and partial anterior corpectomy. The choice of approach varies for each individual case and depends primarily on tumor location and surgeon preference. The evidence for surgical treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression is provided principally by Patchell et alwho reported patients with symptomatic high-grade spinal cord compression experienced significantly better functional outcomes when they underwent surgery followed by radiotherapy compared to those who received only radiotherapy. Notably, radiosensitive tumors were excluded in this randomized-controlled trial.

Patients with spinal instability resulting from spinal metastases and pathological fractures are most often assessed using the spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS), which evaluates multiple variables to provide a stability score. Patients exhibiting a high spinal instability neoplastic score often require instrumentation to stabilize their spine. Additionally, certain decompressive techniques, such as transpedicular and costotransverse approaches, are inherently destabilizing and often require subsequent stabilization. The goal of surgery is to restore alignment and spine stability, thereby reducing mechanical pain, preventing further damage or deformity of the spine, and lowering the risk of secondary neurological deficits. In most cases, restoring alignment and spine stability can be achieved through open or percutaneous implantation of a pedicle screw system, which serves to immobilize affected and unstable vertebrae through spinal fixation.

### Spinal stenosis: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^114cDxTV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar spinal stenosis is being diagnosed increasingly in older people as advanced imaging studies become more widely available and clinicians become more familiar with the presentation of this common condition. For symptomatic patients, the goal of treatment is pain relief and improved function, but there is little empiric evidence to support many of the common interventions used. The relative risks and benefits of various surgical and nonsurgical treatments are poorly understood, and the result has been wide variations in the evaluation and treatment of spinal stenosis across geographic regions. Current practice recommendations are based on expert opinion that incorporates available evidence into existing clinical and biologic paradigms. For most individuals, initial treatment should focus on patient education, medications to control pain, and exercise and physical treatments to regain or maintain activities of daily living. Surgical treatment most commonly is considered in patients not improving with nonsurgical care. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with spinal stenosis. The addition of fusion with or without instrumentation is considered when spinal stenosis is accompanied by degenerative spondylolisthesis or related to concerns about instability. We review the available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical interventions, and highlight comparative results wherever applicable.

### Risk of subsequent fusion after isolated decompression of lumbar facet cysts [^112SUx6z]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar facet cysts represent a potential source of nerve root compression in elderly patients. Isolated decompression without fusion has proven to be a reasonable treatment option in properly indicated patients. However, the risk of lumbar fusion after isolated decompression and facet cyst excision has yet to be elucidated.

Methods

The PearlDiver database was reviewed for patients undergoing isolated laminectomy for lumbar facet cyst from January 2015 to December 2018 using Current Procedural Terminology coding. Patients undergoing concomitant fusion or additional decompression, as well as those diagnosed with preexisting spondylolisthesis or without a minimum of 5-year follow-up, were excluded. Rates of subsequent lumbar fusion and potential risk factors for subsequent fusion were identified. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, chi square test, and multivariate logistic regression. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results

In total, 10,707 patients were ultimately included for analysis. At 5-year follow-up, 727 (6.79%) of patients underwent subsequent lumbar fusion after initial isolated decompression. Of these, 301 (2.81% of total patients, 41.4% of fusion patients) underwent fusion within the first year after decompression. Multivariate analysis identified chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and osteoarthritis as risk factors for requiring subsequent lumbar fusion at 5 years following the index decompression procedure (P < 0.033; all).

Conclusion

Patients undergoing isolated decompression for lumbar facet cysts undergo subsequent lumbar fusion at a 5-year rate of 6.79%. Risk factors for subsequent decompression include chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. This study will assist spine surgeons in appropriately counseling patients on expected postoperative course and potential risks of isolated decompression.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^115sQ8fg]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 perioperative antithrombotic management — lumbar interlaminar epidural injection after warfarin cessation is illustrated by a case in which warfarin (Coumadin) was discontinued 7 days earlier with preoperative INR of 1.0, followed by post-procedural epidural hematoma and neurologic decline. Weakness occurred 18 hours after the procedure, laminectomy was performed within 4 hours of emergency room arrival, and total time from injection to the operating room was approximately 35 hours. Outcome included a permanent foot drop, and the authors described that spinal stenosis and the interlaminar approach seem to be significant risk factors; the epidural hematoma developed despite discontinuation of warfarin 7 days before the surgery.

### Surgical treatment of single-level lumbar stenosis is associated with lower 2-year mortality and total cost compared with nonsurgical treatment: a risk-adjusted, paired analysis [^115C6HLz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Spine surgery has demonstrated cost-effectiveness in reducing pain and restoring function, but the impact of spine surgery relative to nonsurgical care on longer-term outcomes has been less well described. Our objective was to compare single-level surgical treatment for lumbar stenosis, with or without spondylolisthesis, and nonsurgical treatment with respect to patient mortality, resource utilization, and health-care payments over the first 2 years following initial treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of the Medicare National Database Fee for Service Files from 2011 to 2017 was performed. A 2-year prediction of mortality risk (risk stratification index, RSI) was used as a measure of patient baseline health. Patients (88%) were matched by RSI and demographics. Mortality, spine-related health-care utilization, and 2-year total Medicare payments for patients undergoing surgical treatment were compared with matched patients undergoing nonsurgical treatment.

Results

We identified 61,534 patients with stenosis alone and 83,813 with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Surgical treatment was associated with 28% lower 2-year mortality compared with matched patients undergoing nonsurgical treatment. Total Medicare payments were significantly lower for patients with stenosis alone undergoing laminectomy alone and for patients with stenosis and spondylolisthesis undergoing laminectomy with or without fusion compared with patients undergoing nonsurgical treatment. There was no significant difference in mortality when fusion or laminectomy was compared with combined fusion and laminectomy. However, laminectomy alone was associated with significantly lower 2-year payments when treating stenosis with or without spondylolisthesis.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment for stenosis with or without spondylolisthesis within the Medicare population was associated with significantly lower mortality and total medical payments at 2 years compared with nonsurgical treatment, although residual confounding could have contributed to these findings.

### Laminectomy adjacent to instrumented fusion increases adjacent segment disease [^117VcUpy]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort.

Objective

To determine if performing a simultaneous laminectomy at an unfused level adjacent to an instrumented fusion increases the risk of adjacent segment disease (ASD).

Summary Of Background Data

Laminectomy adjacent to instrumented fusion has uncertain outcomes. The increased mechanical forces at the unfused laminectomy may lead to more ASD. Few studies have examined the development of ASD with regard to laminectomy performed adjacent to instrumented fusions.

Materials and Methods

Seven hundred eighty-nine patients underwent instrumented lumbar fusion and laminectomy at the same level(s) (n = 676) or with an additional adjacent level laminectomy (n = 113) with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Diagnoses were degenerative spondylosis (n = 241), degenerative spondylolisthesis (n = 485), and isthmic spondylolisthesis (n = 63) in addition to central stenosis. Primary outcome measures included development of ASD, time to development of ASD, revision surgery, and time to revision surgery.

Results

The adjacent laminectomy group developed ASD at a significantly greater rate of 57.5% (n = 65), compared with 35.2% (n = 238) of the nonadjacent laminectomy group (P < 0.001). The revision surgery rate was also greater in the adjacent laminectomy group (22.1% vs. 13.5%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in time to revision surgery (31.1 vs. 32.6 mo, P = 0.71) or time to ASD development (31.2 vs. 32.3 mo, P = 0.72). ODI and VAS scores did not differ, nor did patient baseline demographics including sex, BMI, Charleston Comorbidity Index, and tobacco use. The exception was the average age of the adjacent laminectomy group was 67.6 years while the average age of the nonadjacent laminectomy group was 62.3 years (P < 0.001). However, age was not found to be an independent predictor of ASD development (P = 0.44).

Conclusion

Surgeons should be cautious when performing a laminectomy adjacent to an instrumented fusion, as this increases the rate of ASD as well as revision surgery.

### Risk factors for surgical site infection in spinal surgery [^116xmf1i]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this study was to identify specific independent risk factors for surgical site infections (SSIs) occurring after laminectomy or spinal fusion.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective case-control study of data obtained in patients between 1996 and 1999 who had undergone laminectomy and/or spinal fusion. Forty-one patients with SSI or meningitis were identified, and data were compared with those acquired in 178 uninfected control patients. Risk factors for SSI were determined using univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression. The spinal surgery-related SSI rate (incisional and organ space) during the 4-year study period was 2.8%. Independent risk factors for SSI identified by multivariate analysis were postoperative incontinence (odds ratio [OR] 8.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9–22.8), posterior approach (OR 8.2, 95% CI 2–33.5), procedure for tumor resection (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.7–22.3), and morbid obesity (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.9–14.2). In patients with SSI the postoperative hospital length of stay was significantly longer than that in uninfected patients (median 6 and 3 days, respectively; p < 0.001) and were readmitted to the hospital for a median additional 6 days for treatment of their infection. Repeated surgery due to the infection was required in the majority (73%) of infected patients.

Conclusions

Postoperative incontinence, posterior approach, surgery for tumor resection, and morbid obesity were independent risk factors predictive of SSI following spinal surgery. Interventions to reduce the risk for these potentially devastating infections need to be developed.

### Development of a risk prediction model with improved clinical utility in elective cervical and lumbar spine surgery [^1148Z7ks]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort.

Objective

We present a universal model of risk prediction for patients undergoing elective cervical and lumbar spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies illustrate predictive risk models as possible tools to identify individuals at increased risk for postoperative complications and high resource utilization following spine surgery. Many are specific to one condition or procedure, cumbersome to calculate, or include subjective variables limiting applicability and utility.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of 177,928 spine surgeries (lumbar (L) Ln = 129,800; cervical (C) Cn = 48,128) was constructed from the 2012 to 2016 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. Cases were identified by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for cervical fusion, lumbar fusion, and lumbar decompression laminectomy. Significant preoperative risk factors for postoperative complications were identified and included in logistic regression. Sum of odds ratios from each factor was used to develop the Universal Spine Surgery (USS) score. Model performance was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and tested on 20% of the total sample.

Results

Eighteen risk factors were identified, including sixteen found to be significant outcomes predictors. At least one complication was present among 11.1% of patients, the most common of which included bleeding requiring transfusion (4.86%), surgical site infection (1.54%), and urinary tract infection (1.08%). Complication rate increased as a function of the model score and ROC area under the curve analyses demonstrated fair predictive accuracy (lumbar = 0.741; cervical = 0.776). There were no significant deviations between score development and testing datasets.

Conclusion

We present the Universal Spine Surgery score as a robust, easily administered, and cross-validated instrument to quickly identify spine surgery candidates at increased risk for postoperative complications and high resource utilization without need for algorithmic software. This may serve as a useful adjunct in preoperative patient counseling and perioperative resource allocation.

### Epidural abscess: a propensity analysis of surgical treatment strategies [^111tZayg]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Observational analysis of retrospectively collected data.

Objective

A retrospective study was performed in order to compare the surgical profile of risk factors and perioperative complications for laminectomy and laminectomy with fusion procedures in the treatment of spinal epidural abscess (SEA).

Summary Of Background Data

SEA is a highly morbid condition typically presenting with back pain, fever, and neurologic deficits. Posterior fusion has been used to supplement traditional laminectomy of SEA to improve spinal stability. At present, the ideal surgical strategy-laminectomy with or without fusion-remains elusive.

Methods

Thirty-day outcomes such as reoperation and readmission following laminectomy and laminectomy with fusion in patients with SEA were investigated utilizing the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program database. Demographics and clinical risk factors were collected, and propensity matching was performed to account for differences in risk profiles between the groups.

Results

Seven hundred thirty-eight patients were studied (608 laminectomy alone, 130 fusion). The fusion population was in worse health. The fusion population experienced significantly greater rate of return to the operating room (odds ratio [OR] 1.892), with the difference primarily accounted for by cervical spine operations. Additionally, fusion patients had significantly greater rates of blood transfusion. Infection was the most common reason for reoperation in both populations.

Conclusion

Both laminectomy and laminectomy with fusion effectively treat SEA, but addition of fusion is associated with significantly higher rates of transfusion and perioperative return to the operating room. In operative situations where either procedure is reasonable, surgeons should consider that fusion nearly doubles the odds of reoperation in the short-term, and weigh this risk against the benefit of added stability.

### Assessing 10-year risk of revision surgery and postoperative complications following thoracic or lumbar fusion surgery in HIV-positive patients [^114iSngc]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

To evaluate the 10-year risk of revision surgery and postoperative complications in HIV-positive patients undergoing thoracic or lumbar fusion, compared to matched HIV-negative controls.

Summary Of Background Data

As HIV-positive patients live longer due to advancements in antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of spinal degenerative and deformity-related conditions has risen. While prior studies suggest higher complication rates in HIV-positive individuals undergoing spine surgery, long-term outcomes following thoracic or lumbar fusion remain poorly characterized.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using a national claims database of over 170 million patients (2010–2023). Patients who underwent thoracic or lumbar fusion were categorized into deformity fusion (≥ 4 levels) or degenerative fusion (< 4 levels). HIV-positive patients were matched 2:1 with HIV-negative controls by age, gender, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Complications were assessed at 30 and 90 days postoperatively. Long-term outcomes, including revision surgery and complication-related procedures, were evaluated over 10 years using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

A total of 3,538 HIV-positive patients and 903,713 controls were identified, with 3,534 HIV-positive patients matched to 7,064 controls. HIV-positive patients had lower rates of acute kidney injury, urinary tract infections, myocardial infarction, and infection at 30 and 90 days. However, they showed slightly increased rates of deep vein thrombosis, dysesthesia, and motor deficits. Over 10 years, no significant differences were observed in all-cause revision surgery (HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.75–1.22, P = 0.731), decompressive laminectomy, or instrumentation removal between cohorts.

Conclusion

HIV-positive status, when well-managed, does not significantly increase the risk of short- or long-term complications or revision procedures after thoracic or lumbar fusion. These findings support the surgical viability of spinal fusion in HIV-positive patients and advocate against exclusion from operative care based solely on HIV status.

### Predicting surgical site infection after lumbar laminectomy and discectomy: a cutting-edge algorithmic approach by incorporating ensembled stacking into the current state-of-the-art for automated machine learning [^111zW7nh]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The implementation of the current SOTA for aML, coupled with the incorporation of ensembled stacking techniques, represented a cutting-edge approach in the field of SSI prediction for spine surgery. By leveraging the power of these advanced ML methods, the developed model can potentially enhance clinical decision-making, guide targeted preventive strategies, and ultimately improve patient outcomes — both generally and in the specific context of spine surgery. While our model identifies known risk factors (operative time, smoking status, and age), its practical value lies in the precision with which it quantifies individual patient risk, enabling truly personalized preventive strategies. In clinical practice, this algorithm could be implemented as a point-of-care decision support tool integrated into electronic health records. Preoperatively, surgeons could use the model to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from targeted interventions such as more aggressive smoking cessation programs, nutritional optimization, or consideration of minimally invasive approaches to reduce operative time. Intraoperatively, the model could inform decisions about antibiotic redosing protocols, wound closure techniques, and drain placement. Postoperatively, resources for wound monitoring and follow-up could be allocated based on individualized risk profiles, with high-risk patients receiving more intensive surveillance. This personalized approach represents a shift from current one-size-fits-all prevention strategies to precision medicine in surgical infection prevention. While this study focused specifically on SSI prediction following lumbar procedures, the methodological framework that we have developed has broader implications for diagnostic and predictive modeling across various clinical domains. The ensemble stacking approach demonstrated here could be adapted to predict other postoperative complications including but not limited to thromboembolic events, surgical complications, and medical complications. Beyond complications, this framework could also potentially be applied to predict clinical outcomes, length of stay, readmission risk, and response to specific interventions. Specifically, similar approaches could be developed to predict cerebrospinal fluid leaks, neurological deficits, and hardware failure. The ability to leverage multiple algorithms through ensembling and stacking techniques allows for capturing complex relationships in clinical data that might be missed by traditional statistical methods or single-algorithm approaches, making this methodology particularly valuable for conditions with multifactorial etiologies and heterogeneous patient populations.

### Risk factors for surgical site infections following adult spine operations [^115Y2NWG]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors for surgical site infections (SSIs) after spine operations. DESIGN Case-control study of SSIs among patients undergoing spine operations. SETTING An academic health center. PATIENTS We studied patients undergoing spinal fusions or laminectomies at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2009. We included patients who acquired SSIs meeting the National Healthcare Safety Network definition. We randomly selected controls among patients who had spine operations during the study period and did not meet the SSI definition. RESULTS In total, 54 patients acquired SSIs after 2,309 spine operations (2.3 per 100 procedures). SSIs were identified a median of 20 days after spinal fusions and 17 days after laminectomies; 90.7% were identified after discharge and 72.2% were deep incisional or organ-space infections. Staphylococcus aureus caused 53.7% of SSIs. Of patients with SSIs, 64.9% (fusion) and 70.6% (laminectomy) were readmitted and 59.5% (fusion) and 64.7% (laminectomy) underwent reoperation. By multivariable analysis, increased body mass index, Surgical Department A, fusion of 4–8 vertebrae, and operation at a thoracic or lumbar/sacral level were significant risk factors for SSIs after spinal fusions. Lack of private insurance and hypertension were significant risk factors for SSIs after laminectomies. Surgeons from Department A were more likely to use nafcillin or vancomycin for perioperative prophylaxis and to do more multilevel fusions than surgeons from Department B. CONCLUSIONS SSIs after spine operations significantly increase utilization of healthcare resources. Possible remediable risk factors include obesity, hypertension, and perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;1458–1467.

### Methodology for the systematic reviews on an adjacent segment pathology [^114rNjHE]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

A systematic review.

Objective

To provide a detailed description of the methods undertaken in the systematic search and analytical summary of adjacent segment pathology (ASP) issues and to describe the process used to develop consensus statements and clinical recommendations regarding factors associated with the prevention and treatment of ASP.

Summary Of Background Data

We present methods used in conducting the systematic, evidence-based reviews and development of expert panel consensus statements and clinical recommendations on the classification, natural history, risk factors, and treatment of radiographical and clinical ASP. Our intent is that clinicians will combine the information from these reviews with an understanding of their own capacities and experience to better manage patients at risk of ASP and consider future research for the prevention and treatment of ASP.

Methods

A systematic search and critical review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published on the classification, risk, risk factors, and treatment of radiographical and clinical ASP. Articles were screened for relevance using a priori criteria, and relevant articles were critically reviewed. Whether an article was included for review depended on whether the study question was descriptive, one of therapy, or one of prognosis. The strength of evidence for the overall body of literature in each topic area was determined by 2 independent reviewers considering risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision of results using a modification of the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Findings from articles meeting inclusion criteria were summarized. From these summaries, consensus statements or clinical recommendations were formulated among subject experts through a modified Delphi process using the GRADE approach.

Results

A total of 3382 articles were identified and screened on 14 topics relating to the classification, risks, risk factors, and treatment of radiographical and clinical ASP. Of these, 127 met our predetermined inclusion criteria and were used to answer specific clinical questions within each topic. Lack of precision in the terminology related to adjacent segment disease and critical evaluation of definitions used across included articles led to a consensus to use ASP and suggest it as a standard. No validated comprehensive classification system for ASP currently exists. The expert panel developed a consensus definition of radiographical and clinical ASP (RASP and CASP). Some of the highlights from the analyses included the annual, 5- and 10-year risks of developing cervical and lumbar ASP after surgery, several important risk factors associated with the development of cervical and lumbar ASP, and the possibility that some motion sparing procedures may be associated with a lower risk of ASP compared with fusion despite kinematic studies demonstrating similar adjacent segment mobility following these procedures. Other highlights included a high risk of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) following long fusions for deformity correction, postsurgical malalignment as a potential risk factor for RASP and the paucity of studies on treatment of cervical and lumbar ASP.

Conclusion

Systematic reviews were undertaken to understand the classification, risks, risk factors, and treatment of RASP and CASP and to provide consensus statements and clinical recommendations. This article reports the methods used in the reviews.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^116644bp]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Decompressive Laminectomy Without Fusion

Decompressive laminectomy without fusion is considered the gold standard surgical procedure for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis in the absence of other complicating spine pathology that is refractive to conservative treatment. With the patient in a prone position, imaging is used to guide the exposure and partial removal of the lamina, spinous process, facet joints, and soft tissue. Preservation of at least 50% of each facet joint and sufficient pars is necessary to avoid iatrogenic instability.

An updated, evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis found sufficient evidence to recommend surgical intervention for moderate to severe lumbar stenosis following failure of nonsurgical treatment. The SPORT, a multicenter randomized controlled trial (N = 289) with an observational cohort (N = 365) that evaluated surgical vs nonoperative treatment of stenosis, reported similar results at up to four years of follow-up. Patients who were treated surgically had significantly greater improvement in pain and function than did patients who were treated more conservatively. However, long-term analysis of patients in the randomized trial suggested diminishing benefits of surgery between four and eight years of follow-up, whereas outcomes for the observational cohort remained stable.

Although a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized clinical trials that studied the effectiveness of conservative vs surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis found that the latter group had better clinical outcomes at one year, they also had a higher complication rate throughout the follow-up period. Further, there was a wide range of surgical and conservative methods used among the studies, and the authors were unable to conclusively recommend one approach over another.

Another challenge regarding the surgical treatment of spinal stenosis relates to whether single-level or multilevel laminectomy is more appropriate for multilevel disease. Two recent studies have suggested that single-level surgery is the preferred procedure for such patients. More specifically, in a prospective, multicenter cohort study of 141 patients, 23% of whom underwent single-level laminotomy and 77% of whom underwent multilevel decompression, the latter group was associated with significantly less favorable stenosis symptoms and function score, with no significant difference with respect to all other outcomes of interest between the two groups. Similarly, a retrospective study of 114 patients by Adilay and Guclu found that those undergoing single-level laminectomy (N = 48) experienced better recovery, in terms of disability score, pain score, and walking duration, than did those undergoing multilevel laminectomy (N = 64). The authors also reported that complications and postoperative spondylolisthesis were higher in the latter group.

### Does minimally invasive surgery have a lower risk of surgical site infections compared with open spinal surgery? [^1163qTGn]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) ranges from 1.9% to 5.5% in most large series. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been postulated to reduce SSI rates.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Is MIS associated with a lower incidence of SSI compared with open spinal surgery? (2) Are there other independent risk factors associated with SSI? (3) What bacteria are most common in spinal SSI?

Methods

Medical records of 2299 patients who underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, laminectomy, or discectomy were analyzed and selected for a nested case-control analysis. Twenty-seven cases with SSI were matched with 162 control subjects without SSI stratified based on procedure performed within 28 days of the case's date of surgery. Patients were identified from an institutional database at a tertiary care hospital. MIS involved spinal procedures performed through a tubular retractor system. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

Patients undergoing open spinal surgery were 5.77 times more likely to develop SSI compared with MIS approaches (odds ratio [OR], 5.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0–32.7; p = 0.048). Also, from the multivariate regression model, diabetes (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.3–17.0; p = 0.018), number of levels operated on (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.6–7.5; p = 0.001), and body mass index (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.3; p = 0.010) were predictive of an increased risk in SSI. Staphylococcus aureus was most frequently identified, being present in 12 of 21 (52.4%) patients in whom positive cultures were obtained. Four of the 12 patients had methicillin-resistant S aureus infection.

Conclusions

In our series, MIS has a lower incidence of SSI. The risk factors predictive of SSI should be further evaluated in well-designed prospective trials.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines on patient selection and trial stimulation for spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic non-cancer pain [^117GhE9Z]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trial approaches — lead type and anesthesia — are outlined, stating that an SCS trial is usually carried out using percutaneously placed leads, even if the final implant involves a paddle lead, and if paddle leads are used, they are likely to be permanent leads placed usually under general anesthesia (GA). Use of minimally invasive technique with avoidance of GA is possible, but it can be challenging. The neuromodulation appropriateness consensus committee (NACC) guidelines suggest that when the risk-to-benefit ratio favors deep sedation or GA, then intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) should be considered, and practice parameters note that, under GA, conscious patient cannot describe paresthesia coverage or react to changes in stimulation parameters or intraoperative events, which might increase risk of neurologic injury. Position statements specify that insertion of paddle leads using laminectomy/laminotomy approach for an SCS trial is not common; in general, this approach requires the need for sedation or anesthesia beyond locoregional anesthesia, which may not allow paresthesia mapping; performance of laminectomy/laminotomy may be associated with higher procedural pain, complications, higher resource consumption and surgical expertise. Position statements also state that insertion of percutaneous leads under GA or deep sedation increases the risk of spinal cord or neural injury.

### Analysis of reasons for medical malpractice litigation due to laminectomy [^1142UiLv]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify the incidence and characteristics of malpractice lawsuits pertaining to laminectomy performed either as a stand-alone operation or concurrent with another procedure by querying the Westlaw Edge and VerdictSearch databases. Malpractice claims analysis is performed by several medical specialties to provide insight into patient values, methods to improve quality of care, and risk factors for litigation pertaining to specific procedures or treatments.

Methods

Westlaw and VerdictSearch were queried using the keywords "laminectomy" and "spine". Claims were reviewed, with the inclusion criteria defined as a case filed between 2000 and 2022 that involved the plaintiff's basis of litigation resting on a claim of medical malpractice due to laminectomy. Additional collected data included the case date, verdict ruling, state or federal location of the filed claim, sustained injuries, and payment or settlement amount.

Results

After review of 4732 cases, 201 were identified as malpractice claims due to laminectomy. The most common reasons for litigation were delayed or denied treatment (n = 106), procedural errors (n = 38), inadequate management of postlaminectomy syndrome (n = 26), and incorrect procedural selection (n = 14). Regarding the verdict ruling, 47.3% (n = 95) of cases ruled in favor of the defendant, 9.0% (n = 18) resulted in a mixed ruling, 15.9% (n = 32) ruled in favor of the plaintiff, and 9.5% (n = 19) were resolved with an out-of-court settlement. An average payment of $4,530,277 resulted from the cases that ruled in favor of the plaintiff, while out-of-court settlements yielded an average payment of $1,193,146.

Conclusions

This study suggests that there are several well-documented risk factors for malpractice claims attributed to laminectomy. The study findings suggest that prompt and accurate diagnosis, coordination of care, timely referral for surgical intervention, and understanding of the indications versus limitations of conservative therapy may help to mitigate the risk of litigation associated with laminectomy.

### Predicting surgical site infection after lumbar laminectomy and discectomy: a cutting-edge algorithmic approach by incorporating ensembled stacking into the current state-of-the-art for automated machine learning [^111fRq6b]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical site infections (SSIs) following spinal procedures have a pooled incidence rate between 1.5 and 2.7% and are a significant source of morbidity due to the risk of reinfection. These postoperative complications can lead to prolonged hospital stays, increased treatment costs, and even patient mortality. Accurately predicting the risk of SSIs is crucial for implementing targeted preventive measures, optimizing patient management, and improving overall surgical outcomes.

Traditionally, clinicians have relied on traditional statistical models, such as logistic regression (LR), to identify risk factors and predict the likelihood of SSIs. However, these conventional approaches may be limited in their ability to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships inherent in large, heterogeneous datasets. The emergence of automated machine learning (aML) techniques offers a promising avenue to develop more robust and accurate predictive models for neurosurgical interventions.

In this study, we aimed to leverage the statistical capabilities of aML by incorporating ensembled stacking techniques into the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for aML. The goal was to create a cutting-edge algorithmic model that could reliably predict the risk of SSIs following lumbar laminectomy and discectomy procedures for adult DSD management. By combining the strengths of multiple individual ML algorithmic models through ensembling and stacking, we hypothesized that the predictive performance of the output model would be superior to that of standalone algorithmic models.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^112ryrxK]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Other Decompression Techniques

Because of the challenges associated with decompressive laminectomy, there is interest in developing minimally invasive lumbar decompression techniques, including uni- or bilateral laminotomy and spinous process–splitting laminectomy. Such procedures are typically performed through a small incision using an endoscope or microscope, permitting preservation of soft tissue and bony anatomy. They have been the focus of small, uncontrolled, and generally single-center studies. For example, two different randomized trials comparing micro-endoscopic decompressive laminectomy with conventional open laminectomy found that the former was associated with less operative blood loss, shorter hospital stay and time to mobilization, lower likelihood of needing opioids for postoperative pain, less muscle destruction, and less low back and leg pain at final follow-up. However, data regarding long-term efficacy are limited.

Even in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) associated with stable low-grade degenerative spondylolisthesis, lower reoperation and fusion rates, less progression of listhetic slip, and greater patient satisfaction were seen in patients undergoing minimally invasive decompression compared with those undergoing open surgery.

Decompressive Laminectomy with Fusion

Single- or multilevel decompressive laminectomy with fusion is typically reserved for patients whose stenosis is exacerbated by spondylolisthesis, a condition where a vertebral body slips anteriorly or posteriorly relative to the adjacent vertebral body. However, a recent prospective cohort study (N = 83) found that patients with lumbar stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis who were treated using spinal process osteotomy without fusion experienced significant postoperative improvement in pain and disability, suggesting that fusion is not always necessary. Only 10% of the cohort required subsequent fusion at a mean follow-up of three months.

The Spinal Laminectomy vs Instrumented Pedicle screw (SLIP) study was a randomized prospective trial at five centers comparing laminectomy vs laminectomy with fusion for stenosis with Grade 1 spondylolisthesis. Overall, patients treated with laminectomy plus fusion had superior health-related quality of life outcomes at two, three, and four years after surgery. Those patients treated with simple lumbar spine decompression had a one-in-three risk of a second operation to fuse the spine at the level of the prior decompressive laminectomy. The patients treated with fusion had a 14% rate of reoperation associated with the development of adjacent-level disease. Overall, this study demonstrates that patients are better served with the addition of fusion, but that 70% of patients treated with decompression alone also did well.

### Laminoplasty versus laminectomy and posterior fusion for cervical myelopathy: a meta-analysis of radiographic and clinical outcomes [^115PtZtX]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Meta-analysis.

Objective

This meta-analysis investigates the outcomes of laminoplasty (LP) and laminectomy with fusion (LF) to guide effective patient selection for these 2 procedures.

Background

Although LF traditionally offers the ability for excellent posterior decompression, it may alter cervical spine biomechanics and increase the risk of adjacent segment degeneration. LP aims to preserve the natural kinematics of the spine but has not been universally accepted, and may be associated with inadequate decompression, neck pain, and recurrent stenosis.

Materials and Methods

PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar (pages 1–20) were searched up until March 2024. The outcomes studied were surgery-related outcomes [operative time (OR) time, estimated blood loss (EBL), and length of stay], adverse events (overall complications, C5 palsy, and reoperations), radiographic outcomes (cervical lordosis, cervical sagittal vertical axis, and T1 slope angle), and patient-reported outcome measures (Neck Disability Index, Visual Analog Scale for neck pain, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association).

Results

Twenty-two studies were included in this meta-analysis, of which 19 were retrospective studies, 2 were prospective nonrandomized studies, and 1 was a randomized controlled trial. A total of 2128 patients were included, with 1025 undergoing LP and 1103 undergoing LF. Patients undergoing LP experienced significantly shorter operative time (P = 0.009), less EBL (P = 0.02), a lower rate of overall complications (P < 0.00001) and C5 palsy (P = 0.003), a lower T1 slope angle (P = 0.02), and a lower Neck Disability Index (P = 0.0004). No significant difference was observed in the remaining outcomes.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis demonstrates that for cervical myelopathy, LP has the benefits of shorter operative time time, less EBL, and reduced incidence of C5 palsy as well as overall complication rate. Given these findings, LP remains an important surgical option with a favorable complication profile in patients with cervical myelopathy, although careful patient selection is still paramount in choosing the right procedure for individual patients.

### Minimally invasive decompression versus open laminectomy for central stenosis of the lumbar spine: pragmatic comparative effectiveness study [^113e837m]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of symptomatic stenosis of the lumbar spine are not fully established, but it has been reported that leg pain in the setting of low back pain affects 12–21% of older adults. Management of the stenosis has broad medical relevance, with a large industry evolving around the different treatment options. The rate of surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis per 100 000 US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older was 135.5 in 2007. For many non-surgical approaches such as physical exercises, patient education, physiotherapy, lumbar corsets, and analgesic treatment there are no high quality trials to assess efficacy in the management of lumbar spinal stenosis. A recent study showed that the common practice of epidural injections provided no benefit in the management of lumbar spinal stenosis. In addition to implementing minimally invasive surgery, some surgeons have shifted towards more complex fusion procedures for lumbar spinal stenosis believing this will improve stability and long term outcomes. This trend is backed by scarce evidence, and complex procedures are generally more invasive and can involve greater risks of complications and longer hospital stays, which in turn lead to higher healthcare costs. In light of our favourable results, upfront decompression and fixation in patients without spondylolisthesis may seem overly aggressive. If there are concerns about later instability we believe that surgeons should choose from the minimal invasive spectrum of decompressive procedures. Microdecompression consistently shows good clinical results, now adding equivalence to laminectomy at one year follow-up and a beneficial risk profile. Theoretically, microdecompression may also induce less postoperative instabilityand reduce the need for later spinal instrumentation.

Strengths and limitations of this study

The major strengths of this study are the pragmatic study design based on prospective registry data in an everyday clinical setting, large sample size, re-evaluation of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in a large subgroup, and protocol based statistical analyses with blinded assessment of main outcome measures. The main limitation was the lack of randomised treatment allocation. Although propensity score matching adjusts for known interactions, while unlikely, residual or introduction of confounding cannot be ruled out. Another weakness was the loss to follow-up of 19% of participants regarding Oswestry disability index scores at 12 months. A previous study on a similar population from the NORspine registry showed no difference in outcomes between responders and non-responders.

Conclusion

The effectiveness of microdecompression is equivalent to laminectomy in the surgical treatment of central stenosis of the lumbar spine. Favourable outcomes were observed at one year in both treatment groups.
