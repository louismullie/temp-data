## Question

What questions should be asked of a patient presenting to the office following a motor vehicle accident with neck pain, lower back pain, and a concussion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what questions should be asked of a motor vehicle crash patient presenting to the office with a concussion, neck pain, and low back pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of injury and immediate event details to anchor risk stratification. Then, I should screen urgently for red flags that mandate emergent action. Next, I will inventory concussion symptoms across domains, followed by a targeted cervical spine assessment and a review of lower back symptoms. After that, I should gather prior history and baseline function, assess psychosocial and functional factors, and apply standardized tools. Finally, I will clarify current stage of recovery and care to date, decide on imaging and activity guidance, and summarize the key questions to ensure comprehensive, biopsychosocial coverage [^117SX1wt] [^112YmHk2] [^113tzw2x].

> Let me first confirm the crash dynamics because the collision type, direction of forces, restraint use, seating position, speed, airbag deployment, head strike, entrapment, and immediate symptom onset materially influence the likelihood and pattern of head, cervical, and thoracolumbar injuries; I need to check whether this was rear-end, frontal, side-impact, or rollover, and whether there was alcohol or medication exposure that could confound symptom reporting or risk assessment [^117SX1wt] [^113tzw2x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding red flags; I should double-check for severe midline cervical tenderness, focal neurologic deficits, gait or balance disturbance, bowel or bladder changes, dysarthria or dysphagia, and visual loss, while also screening for concussion danger signs like rapidly worsening headache, repeated vomiting, seizures, escalating confusion, or CSF otorrhea/rhinorrhea, any of which would prompt emergent imaging or transfer according to neck pain and head injury guidance [^113rMUix] [^113zDrdG] [^113tzw2x] [^116wzcsg].

> Next, I will examine the full concussion symptom spectrum in physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep domains; I need to verify headache characteristics and photophobia/phonophobia, dizziness and balance problems, nausea, visual disturbances, tinnitus, fatigue and sleep changes, cognitive slowing or fogginess, concentration and memory problems, as well as irritability, anxiety, sadness, and emotional lability, since a structured inventory improves detection and monitoring of symptom trajectories [^113tzw2x] [^1143HLjm].

> I should now perform a targeted neck assessment because whiplash-associated disorders frequently coexist with concussion and can perpetuate headache, dizziness, and visual-provoked symptoms; let me verify pain location and severity, mechanical exacerbation, stiffness or spasm, radicular features, and whether neck motion triggers headaches or dizziness, while also considering validated cervical tests and recognizing that new or worsened neck pain after concussion is common and associated with slower recovery [^115P5mao] [^113cAx4Q] [^114GjXSU] [^115AbTJS].

> For lower back pain, I need to check location, intensity, mechanical aggravators, and any leg radiation, paresthesia, weakness, or saddle anesthesia, and I should confirm whether there was direct seat impact or flexion-extension loading; wait, I should verify whether any neurologic deficits are present because that would change the urgency and potential need for spine imaging in line with blunt spine trauma recommendations [^112YmHk2].

> Let me consider premorbid and baseline factors next; I should confirm history of prior concussions, migraine, neck or back disorders, ADHD or learning disorders, mood or anxiety conditions, sleep problems, and substance use, since these coexisting conditions can intensify and prolong cognitive and somatic symptoms, and higher initial symptom load consistently predicts persisting post-concussive symptoms [^115SVLAp] [^1142Ay3Z] [^112KMDe1].

> I will now examine psychosocial context and functional impact; I need to assess pain beliefs, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, work demands, job security, financial and family stressors, and litigation, while screening for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidality, because these factors strongly influence disability risk and recovery trajectories after whiplash and concussion and warrant early, concurrent management when identified [^114Vmqtx] [^117ADqcn] [^111j8GQm] [^115bAnGS].

> Next, I should review standardized tools to quantify symptoms and track change; let me verify that a post-concussion inventory such as the Rivermead or SCAT5 is used, neck disability is captured with the NDI, dizziness with the DHI if present, pain catastrophizing with the PCS, and psychological screening with PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PCL-5, alongside sleep instruments like ISI or PSQI, since these validated measures guide targeted interventions over time [^115GcEJ3] [^1143HLjm].

> Now I need to determine current stage of recovery and what management has been provided; I should double-check whether the patient had ED or urgent evaluation, what imaging was obtained, what medications were prescribed, whether physical therapy or concussion rehabilitation started, and what activity and return-to-work instructions were given; but wait, strict rest beyond a couple of days can delay recovery, so I should confirm a plan for graded, sub-symptom threshold cognitive and physical activity rather than prolonged inactivity [^1142Ay3Z] [^114JfkgE] [^111FMH17].

> Initially, I might think that all post-crash head or neck symptoms require immediate imaging; hold on, I should verify guideline-directed indications instead, using clinical decision rules and red flag screening, reserving cervical CT/MRI/X-ray for suspected acute blunt trauma with concerning features or follow-up scenarios, and avoiding nonactionable tests like routine brain biomarkers in mTBI outside research settings [^112YmHk2] [^115UA9xb].

> I need to ensure driving and work guidance is individualized; let me confirm whether symptoms like blurred vision, dizziness, fatigue, impaired cognition, or headache are present before clearing return to driving, and I should encourage timely, accommodated return to productive activity or work that does not risk re-injury, with clear documentation of functional limits and graded progression [^116NPBmw] [^115WbavP] [^1164Gz2Z].

> For persisting symptoms, I should double-check for alternative or co-contributing etiologies after 30 days, consider short trials of vestibular/oculomotor rehabilitation for dizziness and balance problems, and, if cognitive inefficiencies persist despite treating sleep, pain, mood, and headaches, I should consider a short, clinician-directed cognitive rehabilitation trial, adjusting course based on response [^111D3Ajj] [^112QGhW5] [^112afgha].

> Finally, to synthesize the key questions, I will reconfirm the essentials: mechanism specifics and immediate symptoms; targeted red-flag screening for cervical and intracranial danger signs; a structured concussion symptom inventory across physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep domains; a focused cervical evaluation for pain, neurologic signs, and cervicogenic provocation; a lower back assessment for radicular or cauda equina features; prior injuries and comorbidities with baseline function; psychosocial stressors and functional limitations; validated outcome tools for quantification; and a clear picture of current care, imaging, medications, rehabilitation, rest/activity dosing, and triggers and relievers, ensuring that the plan aligns with evidence-based concussion and neck pain guidance [^1143HLjm] [^113rMUix] [^115GcEJ3] [^1142Ay3Z] [^112YmHk2].

For a patient presenting following a motor vehicle accident with neck pain, lower back pain, and concussion, the clinician should ask about **mechanism of injury** (impact direction, speed, restraints, head strike, loss of consciousness) [^112YmHk2] [^117SX1wt], **red flag symptoms** (weakness, numbness, bowel/bladder changes, severe headache, vision changes, vomiting, confusion, seizures) [^113rMUix] [^1178RbjV], and **pain characteristics** (location, radiation, severity, aggravating/relieving factors, prior neck/back pain) [^113zDrdG]. Also assess **concussion symptoms** (headache, dizziness, nausea, balance, memory, concentration, sleep, mood) [^113tzw2x] [^1143HLjm], functional impact (work, driving, daily activities) [^115WbavP] [^116NPBmw], and screen for comorbidities (psychiatric, sleep, prior injuries) [^114Vmqtx] [^115SVLAp]. This structured approach ensures detection of serious injury, guides imaging, and supports safe return-to-activity planning [^112YmHk2] [^1164Gz2Z].

---

## Mechanism of injury and accident details

Understanding the **mechanism of injury** is critical for assessing serious injury risk and guiding further evaluation and imaging [^112YmHk2] [^117SX1wt].

- **Can you describe the accident?** (direction of impact, speed, use of seatbelt, airbag deployment, head strike)
- **Did you lose consciousness or have amnesia?** (duration, confusion, disorientation) [^117GCZrq]
- **Were you able to exit the vehicle independently?** (need for extrication, ambulance transport) [^111p2o8Q]

---

## Red flag symptoms indicating serious injury

Identifying **red flag symptoms** is essential for ruling out serious spinal or neurological injuries requiring urgent intervention [^113rMUix] [^1178RbjV].

- **Do you have any weakness, numbness, or tingling?** (arms, legs, hands, feet) [^113rMUix]
- **Have you experienced bowel or bladder changes?** (incontinence, retention) [^113rMUix]
- **Are you experiencing severe headache, vision changes, vomiting, confusion, or seizures?** [^113tzw2x]
- **Do you have difficulty walking, balancing, or coordinating movements?** [^116wzcsg]

---

## Neck pain assessment

A detailed assessment of neck pain helps identify potential **cervical spine injuries**, including whiplash-associated disorders, by characterizing the pain (location, radiation, severity, character) and noting aggravating or relieving factors (movement, rest, medications). It should also review prior neck injuries or chronic neck pain and associated symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, or visual disturbances [^115P5mao] [^113cAx4Q].

---

## Lower back pain assessment

Assessing lower back pain helps identify potential **lumbar spine injuries or radiculopathy** by characterizing the pain (location, radiation, severity, character), including precipitating and alleviating factors. The assessment should also screen for leg pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness suggestive of radicular involvement, and review prior back injuries or chronic back pain [^111p2o8Q].

---

## Concussion symptom assessment

A comprehensive **concussion symptom assessment** is essential for identifying and managing mild traumatic brain injury [^113tzw2x].

- **Are you experiencing headaches, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting?** [^113tzw2x]
- **Do you have balance problems, sensitivity to light or noise, or visual disturbances?** [^115PFTp7]
- **Are you experiencing memory problems, difficulty concentrating, or mental fogginess?** [^115GcEJ3]
- **Have you noticed mood changes, irritability, anxiety, or depression?** [^114Vmqtx]
- **Are you having trouble sleeping or feeling unusually fatigued?** [^1143HLjm]

---

## Functional impact and daily activities

Assessing the **functional impact** of symptoms helps guide management and return-to-activity planning by clarifying how symptoms affect daily activities (work, school, household tasks) and whether the patient can drive safely given dizziness, vision problems, or cognitive impairment. Assess whether the patient has returned to work or school, what accommodations are needed, and any difficulties with self-care or mobility [^115WbavP] [^116NPBmw].

---

## Psychological and emotional assessment

Psychological factors significantly influence recovery and should be assessed and managed appropriately by screening for **anxiety, depression, or accident-related stress** and for any history of psychological conditions (e.g. anxiety, depression, PTSD). Ask about sleep disturbances or fatigue, and explore concerns about recovery or returning to normal activities [^114Vmqtx] [^115bAnGS].

---

## Past medical history and comorbidities

Understanding the patient's **medical history and comorbidities** is essential for comprehensive care and requires reviewing chronic medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, arthritis) and any previous injuries or surgeries involving the neck, back, or head. Confirm current medications and supplements, and elicit any allergies or adverse reactions to medications [^113RCjA4] [^115SVLAp].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Providing **education and counseling** is essential for patient understanding and adherence to treatment plans and should include explaining the nature of concussion, neck and back injuries, and discussing expected recovery timelines and warning signs that warrant urgent care. Provide guidance on activity modification, return-to-work planning, and driving safety, and address patient questions and concerns regarding recovery and prognosis [^117D9WHM] [^1153jqrB].

---

A structured clinical interview for patients presenting following a motor vehicle accident with neck pain, lower back pain, and concussion should include questions about the mechanism of injury, red flag symptoms, detailed pain assessment, concussion symptoms, functional impact, psychological factors, medical history, and patient education. This approach ensures **comprehensive evaluation**, identification of serious injuries, and appropriate management planning [^117GCZrq] [^113rMUix].

Concussions can be associated with a wide range of symptoms and conditions, such as retinal hemorrhage, lightheadedness, and loss of consciousness. They may lead to gait disturbance, headache, anxiety, seizure, and agitation. Additional symptoms include anisocoria, neck pain, and slurred speech. Emotional and psychological fluctuations, such as depression, emotional lability, and aggressive behavior, are also common.

Physical symptoms might consist of vomiting, memory impairment, dizziness, insomnia, sleeping disorders, and fatigue. Concussions can also result from or be exacerbated by sports participation, alcohol consumption, and falls. Other symptoms include nausea, phonophobia, cervical spine injury, scalp laceration, blurred vision, and impulsivity.

Individuals with concussions might experience diplopia, numbness, photophobia, confusion, loss of balance, and difficulty concentrating, among others. Tinnitus, hearing loss, and disorientation are also possible consequences, emphasizing the broad impact of this condition on one's neurological and physical health.

Obtain a direct assessment of the most prominent symptoms or impairments, including:

- **Headache and neck pain**: Perform a physical examination of the head and cervical spine.
- **Mood**: Assess for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other trauma- and stressor-related disorders.
- **Sleep**: Obtain a sleep assessment.
- **Vestibular function and balance and/or oculomotor function**: Conduct a vestibular oculomotor screening.
- **Cognitive symptoms**: Evaluate for memory loss and attention.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC|mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^115tHi4F]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

This section covers the time period beginning the day after the injury and continuing up to return to play (RTP). Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a treatable condition. The majority of athletes with SRC recover within a typical timeframe: currently defined as two weeks for adults and up to four weeks for children. The number and severity of initial symptoms are the best predictors for the duration of recovery after SRC.

During this time, symptom-specific interventions can be implemented while recovery is monitored. It is also important that pre-existing, coexisting, or resulting comorbidities are addressed, such as headache, anxiety, depression, and cervical spine pain.

Evidence suggests that strict rest after SRC slows recovery and increases the probability of prolonged symptoms. After a brief period of relative rest (24–48 hours), athletes may gradually and progressively resume cognitive and physical activity, provided it does not produce new symptoms or exacerbate existing symptoms. Recent studies have shown that progressive moderate aerobic exercise within the first week helps safely speed recovery. Cognitive work should be modified or limited to activities that do not produce or exacerbate symptoms.

- **Return to driving**: No widely accepted return-to-driving protocols exist. Driving is a complex process involving the coordination of cognitive, visual, and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual perception, insight, and memory, which can all be affected by SRC. A decision on driving status should be part of the monitoring period.

- **Medication**: Medications are routinely prescribed following sport-related concussions; however, the excerpt is cut off here.

### Work disability after whiplash: A prospective cohort study [^117ADqcn]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

This study was a prospective cohort study aiming to investigate the consequences of neck pain after motor vehicle accidents in terms of work disability and its relationship with symptom and work-related factors.

Previous research on work disability related to whiplash has been very heterogeneous, often limited in sample size, and has shown wide variability in results. A relationship has been suggested between poor recovery or persistent work disability after whiplash and factors such as female gender, older age, marital status, heavy manual work, self-employment, prior psychological problems, subjective complaints of poor concentration, pain catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia.

- **Methods**: Individuals with neck complaints after involvement in traffic accidents, who initiated compensation claim procedures with a Dutch insurance company (n = 879), were sent questionnaires (Q1) concerning the accident, the injuries they had sustained, their complaints at that time, and questions regarding work and disability. The course of complaints and work disability was monitored at 6 (Q2) and 12 months (Q3) after the accident.

- **Results**: A total of 58.8% of the population with neck complaints studied was work-disabled after the accident. Age and impaired concentration complaints after 1 month were found to be related to work disability at 1 year, independent of physical complaints and work characteristics.

- **Conclusion**: Age and concentration complaints were important independent predictors of long-lasting work disability.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: Concussion in sport [^111ivaas]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of the statement is to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. It aims to establish the level of evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and pinpoint areas requiring additional research.

- **Importance of an AMSSM statement**: Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. They are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

- **Definition**: Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. It is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) that is generally self-limited and at the less severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

- **Pathophysiology**: Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. Experimental evidence suggests that the concussed brain is less responsive to further injury or stress.

### Neck injury comorbidity in concussion-related emergency department visits: A population-based study of sex differences across the life span [^115AbTJS]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of death and disability in the United States, with approximately 3.5 million new injuries occurring each year, accompanied by an annual estimated economic cost of more than $70 billion, including both indirect and direct medical costs. The majority of these injuries (75%) are mild in severity and are frequently referred to as concussions. The overall incidence of TBI is higher among males; however, clinical studies have shown that females are at a higher risk of concussions in sports with similar rules. Furthermore, the length of recovery post-injury has been found to be longer among females, who are also more likely to experience persistent symptoms for more than a month.

At the time of writing, although there has been an abundance of research on TBI and concussion, there is a paucity of studies assessing the prevalence of comorbid neck injuries among males and females with concussions across the lifespan and by cause of injury.

- **The role of comorbid neck injury**: The important role of a co-occurring (comorbid) neck injury, specifically to the cervical spine region, with concussion is reflected in the latest consensus statement on sports-related concussions. Literature supports that whiplash-associated disorders and concussions share similar clinical presentations and have been found to commonly co-occur. In addition, the cervical spine region is particularly vulnerable to concussion due to its proximity to the head and the lack of protection relative to other regions, such as the thoracic and lumbosacral regions of the spine. Evidence also supports that females have weaker and anatomically distinct neck structures, which may contribute to the higher risk and prevalence of such injuries in women.

### Whiplash: Are you at risk for ongoing pain or disability [^111tFvYM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Have you recently sustained an injury and been diagnosed with whiplash or a whiplash-associated disorder? If so, you may be wondering what your recovery will be like. If health care providers could identify, soon after the initial injury, which patients would probably improve naturally over time and which ones would not, they could better manage the patient's treatment in the early stages of recovery. A study published in the April 2015 issue of JOSPT provides new insights into this challenge, which may help improve decision making for providers and outcomes for patients.

### Incidence of neck pain in patients with concussion in a pediatric emergency department [^1172hbzw]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were (1) to determine the frequency of neck pain in patients diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion in a pediatric level 1 trauma center emergency department (ED), (2) to identify variables associated with neck pain in this population, and (3) to report on aspects of care received in the ED, including imaging and medication use.

This research is a retrospective chart review of 652 patients presenting to a pediatric ED with a diagnosis of concussion/mTBI. Charts were reviewed for the following information: baseline demographic information, mechanism of injury, cause of mTBI, presence or absence of neck pain, point tenderness in the neck on physical examination, and whether the patient followed up within our health system in the 6 months after injury. Charts were also reviewed for other concussion-related symptoms, medication given in the ED, imaging performed in the ED, cervical spine clearance in the ED, and referrals made. For those patients who did have follow-up appointments within our system, additional chart review was performed to determine whether they sought follow-up treatment for symptoms related to concussion/neck pain and the duration of follow-up. Statistical analyses focused on the prevalence of neck pain in the sample. We subsequently explored the degree to which neck pain was associated with other collected variables.

Of 652 patients, 90 (13.8%) reported neck pain. Acceleration/deceleration injury and motor vehicle accident were predictive of neck pain. Neck pain was less common in those reporting other outcomes.

### High-risk chief complaints II: Disorders of the head and neck [^1178RbjV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Of the many different complaints of patients presenting to the emergency department, some of the most difficult to diagnose and manage involve pathology of the head and neck. Often, diagnoses of conditions affecting this part of the body are elusive, and occasionally, even once the diagnosis has been made, the management of these disorders remains challenging. This article addresses some of the high-risk chief complaints of the head and neck regarding diagnosis and management. These complaints include headache, seizure, acute focal neurologic deficits, throat and neck pain, ocular emergencies, and the difficult airway.

### Assessing the clinical utility of the question, "Is your child/are you back to normal?" in pediatric concussion symptom resolution [^1127Fres]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

This study investigates the relationship between the general question, "Is your child/are you back to normal?" and a validated post-concussive symptom scale when assessing symptom resolution following a concussion. Children with acute concussion were enrolled during an emergency department visit. Sensitivity and specificity analyses compared the true/false question, "My child is/I am back to normal", at 3 days post-injury with the Concussion Symptom Inventory (CSI; gold standard). A total of 201 participants were enrolled in the study with complete data.

- **Sensitivity and specificity results**: The true/false questions of "My child is/I am back to normal" had sensitivities of 78.4% and 59.3% and specificities of 75.0% and 86.4% for caregiver and child responses, respectively, when compared with their corresponding CSI.

This study demonstrates that asking a parent or child if the child is back to normal has poor sensitivity and modest specificity in determining if a child's symptoms have resolved within 3 days of sustaining a concussion relative to a standardized symptom scale.

### Living concussion guidelines: Guideline for concussion & prolonged symptoms for adults 18 years of age or older: 2017 April update [^115GcEJ3]. ConcussionsOntario (2017). High credibility.

The 2017 LCG guidelines recommend assessing cognitive difficulties in patients with a history of concussion. This assessment should consider the impact of such difficulties on functional areas, such as performance at work or school and completing tasks within the home and community. A focused clinical interview regarding symptoms is suggested. Additionally, utilize a validated post-concussion questionnaire — such as the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms, the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, or the SCAT5 — to assess and track symptoms.

### Underlying Ehlers-Danlos syndrome discovered during neuro-ophthalmic evaluation of concussion patients: A case series [^1127Lw3J]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Patient 6 is a 49-year-old woman who presented to the W-TBI clinic in April 2017 after being injured in a motor vehicle accident in February 2017. The patient could not recall whether she had lost consciousness following the accident. In the days following the accident, she started noticing nausea and headaches while reading on the computer, increased somnolence, and worsening discomfort with motion, sound, or lights. The patient had an MRI and CT following the accident, both of which were read as normal.

At her initial appointment, the patient noted that she had enjoyed reading before the accident, but now could only use a computer for five-minute intervals before becoming nauseous and experiencing headaches. Her past medical history was notable for breast cancer, migraines, rectal bleeding, gastric polyps, and dyspepsia. Her review of systems was positive for fatigue, IBS, more headaches since the accident, increased urinary frequency, burning pain in neck and shoulders, sound sensitivity, worse bruxism since the injury, poor balance, insomnia, and cognitive impairments.

The patient was diagnosed with convergence insufficiency and postconcussion syndrome and prescribed home-based orthoptic therapy. In June 2017, she was re-evaluated and demonstrated little improvement in her symptoms or upon examination. She did report some improvement in her fatigue, sleeping, and cognition. Continued orthoptic training was recommended, and the patient returned in October 2017 reporting further improvement in reading, driving, and computer use. However, she stated she was not yet fully recovered.

### The association between a lifetime history of a neck injury in a motor vehicle collision and future neck pain: A population-based cohort study [^116o55DS]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this population-based cohort study was to investigate the association between a lifetime history of neck injury from a motor vehicle collision and the development of troublesome neck pain. Evidence suggests that individuals with a history of neck injury in a traffic collision are more likely to experience future neck pain; however, these results may suffer from residual confounding. Therefore, there is a need to test this association in a large population-based cohort with adequate control of known confounders.

We formed a cohort of 919 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults with no or mild neck pain in September 1995. At baseline, participants were asked if they ever injured their neck in a motor vehicle collision. Six and twelve months later, we asked about the presence of troublesome neck pain (grade II-IV) on the chronic pain grade questionnaire.

Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate the association between a lifetime history of neck injury in a motor vehicle collision and the onset of troublesome neck pain while controlling for known confounders. The follow-up rate was 73.5% (676/919) at six months and 63.1% (580/919) at one year. We found a positive association between a history of neck injury in a motor vehicle collision and the onset of troublesome neck pain after controlling for bodily pain and body mass index (adjusted HRR = 2.14; 95% CI 1.12–4.10). Our analysis suggests that a history of neck injury in a motor vehicle collision is a risk factor for developing future troublesome neck pain.

### Whiplash continues its challenge [^114FGDWZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

There have been many advances in the management of neck pain disorders, but a personal frustration as a clinician and researcher in the field is that the incidence of full recovery following a whiplash injury, as a result of a motor vehicle crash, has not increased and, subsequently, the rate of transition to chronic neck pain has not lessened. The commentaries in this special issue reflect the multifaceted nature of whiplash-associated disorders and the wide-ranging research in the field. While management of whiplash, especially the challenge of lessening the rate of transition to chronicity, has yet to be achieved, the picture is becoming clearer. This should give great confidence and some hope to individuals with whiplash-associated disorders who have long-term pain and functional disability that after the next decade of research and clinical development, the outcomes following whiplash are likely to be vastly improved.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC / mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^1142Ay3Z]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Persisting symptoms after SRC: The majority of athletes with SRC recover within the typical timeframe, currently defined as 2 weeks for adults and up to 4 weeks for children. PSaSRC is defined as symptoms that last longer than the typical timeframe.

The pathophysiology underlying PSaSRC is not entirely understood. It is thought that PSaSRC is not caused by a single pathologic process, but rather an interaction of post-injury symptoms that are complicated by pre-existing, coexisting, and/or resulting biopsychosocial factors.

It is important to perform a thorough evaluation for other etiologies of the symptoms, so these may be identified and treated appropriately.

- **Factors that may be associated**: Greater odds of developing PSaSRC include:

	- High symptom load immediately after injury
	- Prolonged strict cognitive and physical rest (more than a few days) after the concussion
	- Unrecognized, untreated, or inadequately treated initial SRC
	- Suffering another direct impact to the head or from transmitted (indirect) forces from the body to the head while still symptomatic from a concussion
	- Personal or family history of migraine or mood disorder
	- Premorbid diagnosis of learning difficulties
	- Family and social stressors
	- Increased baseline level of SRC symptoms (pre-SRC)

Of all these risk factors, pre-existing mood disorder and high symptom load immediately after injury have been shown to be the most consistent predictors of PSaSRC.

Athletes who are removed from activity immediately after the injury seem to be less likely to develop PSaSRC than those who continue to play immediately after the concussion.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: Concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists over not only the incidence of long-term risks from multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injuries. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to base these decisions. This has resulted in the existence of numerous published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes. Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. The delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### Catastrophizing and causal beliefs in whiplash [^111j8GQm]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

This prospective cohort study investigates the role of pain catastrophizing and causal beliefs regarding the severity and persistence of neck complaints after motor vehicle accidents.

In previous research on low back pain, somatoform disorders, and chronic fatigue syndrome, pain catastrophizing and causal beliefs were found to be related to perceived disability and prognosis. It has also been argued that culturally dependent symptom expectations are responsible for a chronic course of whiplash.

Individuals involved in traffic accidents who initiated compensation claim procedures with a Dutch insurance company were sent questionnaires (Q1) containing the Neck Disability Index, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and the Causal Beliefs Questionnaire-Whiplash. Of 1252 questionnaires dispatched, 747 (59.7%) were returned. Only car occupants with neck complaints were included in this study (n = 140). Complaints were monitored using additional questionnaires administered 6 (Q2) and 12 months (Q3) after the accident.

Pain catastrophizing and causal beliefs were related to the severity of whiplash disability. The severity of initial complaints was related to both the severity and persistence of whiplash complaints. Attributing initial neck complaints to whiplash was found to predict the persistence of disability at 6 and 12 months follow-up, over and above the severity of the initial complaints.

The results suggest that causal beliefs may play a major role in the persistence of neck complaints post-accident.

### The new concussion in sport guidelines are here. But how do we get them out there [^117QSZLV]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

**How do doctors want to be informed**: Given the importance of doctors, both as recognized experts responsible for implementing concussion guidelines mentioned in the consensus statement and as an important and preferred source of information recognized by both players and parents, we surveyed general practitioners about their concussion knowledge and their preferred sources of information. None of the surveyed practitioners indicated 'peer-review medical journal' as a major source of concussion information. Moreover, the vast majority of preferred sources were not linked to organizations or professionals most commonly associated with sport and its delivery. Instead, they wanted to obtain their information from recognized medical and medical education sources.

### Factors influencing the injury pattern and injury severity after high speed motor vehicle accident — a retrospective study [^117SX1wt]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

Motor vehicular accidents (MVA) are the leading cause of death among people under 40 years of age. Despite improvements in car safety and driver awareness of the use of safety devices, fatalities and severe injuries continue to occur.

- **Material and methods**: From 1997 to 2004, 13,678 patients after MVA were admitted to our institution. Out of this cohort, 584 (4.3%) patients suffered blunt major trauma, defined as an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16 and at least one life-threatening injury in one body region. Preclinical data were recorded in 458 patients matching the inclusion criteria. The circumstances of the trauma scene, such as weather conditions, were analyzed, as well as technical crash data such as the direction of impact, security devices used, and type and severity of automobile damage. In a retrospective trial, the influence of preclinical variables on the injury pattern and on injury severity was investigated.

- **Results**: A total of 314 (68.6%) patients were male and 144 (31.4%) were female. Injury severity (p = 0.015) and rate of multiple injuries (p = 0.012) were higher in patients after side-impact crashes. If automobiles with SIPS were used, injury severity was significantly reduced in the case of side-impact crashes (p = 0.003). Patients after frontal impact crashes had a higher rate of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to the overall cohort (p = 0.014). Patients suffering blunt aortic dissection (n = 29) were involved in frontal crashes with seat belt use (p < 0.001). If patients were entrapped, injury severity (p = 0.021) and rate of multiple injuries (p = 0.018) were significant.

### Can the neck contribute to persistent symptoms post concussion? A prospective descriptive case series [^112mpGv3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms post-concussion can arise from a range of sources, including the neck. There is little description of neck assessment findings in people with persistent symptoms post-concussion.

- **Objectives**: To assess people with persistent symptoms following a concussion and determine whether the neck has also been injured, and to evaluate the potential of the neck to contribute to their symptoms.

- **Methods**: A consecutive series of participants (n = 20) referred for neck assessment were prospectively recruited by two providers of a multidisciplinary concussion service for people with persistent symptoms. Data were collected at the initial assessment and upon completion of neck treatment, which included standard questionnaires (Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, Neck Disability Index, Dizziness Handicap Inventory), patient-reported measures of headache, dizziness, and neck pain, physical examination findings, and details of comorbidities.

- **Results**: Participants were evaluated at a mean of 7.5 weeks post-concussion (median, 5 weeks). On neck assessment, 90% were considered by the clinician to have a neck problem contributing to their symptoms. Multiple findings were consistent with this view, including moderate-to-severe Neck Disability Index scores (mean ± SD, 33.4 ± 9.5 points), frequent neck pain (85%), frequent moderate-to-severe pain on occiput-C4 segmental assessment (85%), a positive flexion-rotation test (45%), and muscle tenderness (50%-55%).

- **Conclusion**: Multiple findings were indicative of neck injury, particularly involving the neck area in the participants studied.

### Frequency of primary neck pain in mild traumatic brain injury/concussion patients [^113NufC7]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

To determine the frequency of neck pain overall and relative to other symptoms, the study focused on patients presenting to a level I trauma center emergency department (ED) with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). It also aimed to identify the predictors of primary neck pain within this population.

This cohort study was conducted in a level I trauma center ED, involving patients who exhibited symptoms of mTBI after exposure to an event that could have caused mTBI (N = 95). The frequency of self-reported neck pain was measured using the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) symptom questionnaire at intervals of less than 3, 8, 15, and 45 days post-injury. Primary neck pain was defined in two ways: (1) neck pain rated as equal to or greater in severity than all other SCAT3 symptoms, and (2) neck pain worse than all other symptoms.

The results indicated that the frequency of any reported neck pain was 68.4%, 50.6%, 49%, and 41.9% within 72 hours and at 8, 15, and 45 days, respectively. The frequency of primary neck pain, defined by equal or worse/worse definitions, was 35.8%/17.9%, 34.9%/14.5%, 37%/14.8%, and 39.2%/10.8% across the four follow-up assessments. Participants who sustained their injuries in motor vehicle collisions reported a higher rate of primary neck pain compared to those with other mechanisms of injury.

A sizable percentage of patients presenting to level I trauma center EDs with mTBI report neck pain, which is commonly rated as similar to or worse than other mTBI-related symptoms. Primary neck pain is more prevalent after motor vehicle collisions than with other mechanisms of injury.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^115P5mao]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, particularly in initial assessments, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining assessments of impairments in body function when evaluating a patient with neck pain over an episode of care. These assessments help establish baselines, monitor changes over time, and assist in clinical decision-making to rule in or rule out the following conditions:

- **Neck pain with mobility deficits**: Cervical active ROM, cervical flexion-rotation test, cervical and thoracic segmental mobility tests.
- **Neck pain with headache**: Cervical active ROM, cervical flexion-rotation test, upper cervical segmental mobility testing.
- **Neck pain with radiating pain**: Neurodynamic testing, the Spurling's test, the distraction test, the Valsalva test.
- **Neck pain with movement coordination impairments**: Cranial cervical flexion and neck flexor muscle endurance tests.

### How do we meet the challenge of whiplash [^111RWMve]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

A previous special issue of JOSPT (October 2016) discussed whiplash regarding the clinical problems and research surrounding prevention, biomechanics of injury, emergent care, imaging advancements, recovery pathways and prognosis, pathogenesis of post-trauma pain, acute and chronic management, and new predictive clinical tools. While great strides have been made in the field of whiplash and are continuing in earnest, a key group of clinicians and academics have recognized that inconsistent outcomes in published literature hamper our ability to meaningfully synthesize research findings, leading to results of systematic reviews that provide very few concrete clinical recommendations. We are optimistic that improved outcomes for people with whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) are attainable in the near future, as interdisciplinary research efforts continue to align internationally, new mechanisms are identified and explored, and advanced statistical techniques allow complex questions to be answered in clinically meaningful ways.

### Missed emergency department diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury in patients with chronic pain after motor vehicle collision [^1143xjHp]. Pain Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, is the most common presentation of TBI in the emergency department (ED), but a diagnosis of mTBI may be missed in patients presenting with other acute injuries following a motor vehicle collision (MVC).

- **Objective**: To estimate the frequency of missed diagnoses of mTBI in patients seen in the ED after MVC who later developed chronic pain syndromes.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: An interventional pain management clinic.

- **Methods**: Data were drawn from information collected during standardized intake assessments completed by 33 patients involved in an MVC referred to a community-based clinic for chronic pain management. The prevalence of missed mTBI and postconcussion syndrome (PCS) were estimated based on the clinical diagnosis, which included reviewing acute care medical records, the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) scores, and patient-reported injury history.

- **Results**: There was a high prevalence of presumed mTBI in this sample (69.7%) of patients involved in an MVC, but an acute care diagnosis was made in only 39.1% of cases. Patients diagnosed with mTBI at acute care had significantly lower PCS symptom scores than patients whose diagnosis was missed (P < 0.05). Diagnostic brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) was more frequently ordered (P < 0.05) in patients diagnosed with mTBI. Using a modified RPQ developed for use with chronic pain patients, 54.5% of the sample met criteria for PCS.

### The prevalence and influence of new or worsened neck pain following a sport-related concussion in collegiate athletes: A study from the CARE consortium [^114GjXSU]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Neck pain in a concussion population is an emerging area of study that has been shown to have a negative influence on recovery; however, this effect has not yet been studied in collegiate athletes.

- **Hypothesis**: New or worsened neck pain is common following a concussion (> 30%), negatively influences recovery, and is associated with patient sex and level of contact in sport.

- **Study design**: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: Varsity-level athletes from 29 National Collegiate Athletic Association member institutions, as well as non-varsity sport athletes at military service academies, were eligible for enrollment. Participants completed a preseason baseline assessment and follow-up assessments at 6 and 24 to 48 hours following a concussion, when they were symptom-free, and when they returned to unrestricted play. Data collection occurred between January 2014 and September 2018.

- **Results**: A total of 2163 injuries were studied. New or worsened neck pain was reported with 47.0% of injuries. New or worsened neck pain was associated with patient sex (higher in female athletes), an altered mental status after the injury, the mechanism of injury, and what the athlete collided with. The presence of new/worsened neck pain was associated with delayed recovery. Those with new or worsened neck pain had 11.1 days of symptoms versus 8.8 days in those without (P < .001). They were also less likely to have a resolution of self-reported symptoms in ≤ 7 days (P < .001). However, the mean duration of the return-to-play protocol was not significantly different for those with new or worsened neck pain.

### Discovery of unsuspected thyroid pathologic conditions after trauma to the anterior neck area attributable to a motor vehicle accident: relationship to use of the shoulder harness [^11737KHo]. Endocrine Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Objective: To alert physicians to the possibility of antecedent trauma to the neck in patients presenting with a thyroid nodule or with symptoms and signs related to the thyroid gland.

Methods: We present five case reports in which the cause of thyroid nodular disease was suspected to have been trauma to the anterior neck area during an earlier motor vehicle accident in which the shoulder harness impacted the neck.

Results: In five female patients, shoulder harness trauma from an automobile accident led to the subsequent discovery of a thyroid lesion. Four of the five patients underwent surgical removal of the thyroid nodule. Although traumatic injury of the thyroid may be common, we found only one report in the medical literature regarding the discovery of a thyroid nodule or thyroiditis in the setting of traffic accident-related trauma to the thyroid gland.

Conclusion: In the initial assessment of patients with thyroid nodular disease, we emphasize the importance of obtaining a detailed and comprehensive history, including inquiry about trauma to the neck. Prompt diagnostic accuracy will help avoid unnecessary costs and risks in the workup of such patients.

### Association between symptom burden at initiation of a graduated return to activity protocol and time to return to unrestricted activity after concussion in service academy cadets [^112yZSc3]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Consensus and position statements recommend that concussed patients be asymptomatic upon the initiation of the graduated return to activity (RTA) protocol. However, a significant number of concussed patients begin their RTA protocols while endorsing symptoms.

- **Purpose**: To characterize symptom endorsement at the beginning of the RTA protocol and examine the association between symptom endorsement and RTA protocol duration in service academy cadets.

- **Study design**: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort study was conducted with cadets at 3 US service academies. Postconcussion symptom inventories were recorded upon the initiation of an RTA protocol. The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool Symptom Inventory was used to classify participants into three groups (0 symptoms, 1 symptom, and ≥ 2 symptoms) upon initiation of the RTA protocol. The primary outcome of interest was RTA protocol duration. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated to estimate RTA protocol duration by symptom endorsement, sex, varsity status, academic break, and time to graduated RTA initiation. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between symptom endorsement at the initiation of the RTA protocol and RTA protocol duration (α < .05).

- **Results**: Data were analyzed from 966 concussed cadets (36% women). Headache (42%) and faintness/dizziness (44%) were the most commonly endorsed symptoms on the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-Third Edition and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, respectively.

### Predictors of clinical recovery from concussion: A systematic review [^115H58Vo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The review protocol was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (protocol ID: CRD42016041479). The broad initial review questions provided by the scientific leadership committee of the Concussion in Sport Group were:

1. What are the key modifiers of concussion outcomes?
2. What factors are associated with a poorer prognosis or future risk following concussion?
3. How do we best quantify the role of these modifiers?
4. How many concussions are too many?
5. How do sex differences impact concussion management?

Given the breadth of the initial questions, we narrowed the focus of this review to predictors of clinical outcome. We defined outcome as "clinical recovery and return to activities and sports". We examined different types of predictor variables.

- **Effect modification**: Occurs when the magnitude of the effect of concussion on clinical recovery (i.e. the association) differs depending on the level of a third variable (i.e. the effect modifier variable).
- **Intermediary variables**: Factors involved in the causal pathway between exposure (injury) and outcome (clinical recovery).
- **Confounding variables**: Factors independently associated with the outcome (clinical recovery) and independently associated with the exposure (concussion), but they are not involved in the causal pathway between exposure and outcome. Confounding variables have a bidirectional association with both the exposure (concussion) and the outcome (clinical recovery).

### Sports medicine update: Concussion [^112JH3Ze]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

A systematic approach is required for patients with a suspected concussion. Although standardized tools can aid in assessment, the diagnosis of concussion remains a clinical one. At the time of diagnosis, patients should be given both verbal and written reviews of the common symptoms of concussion, the expected course of recovery, as well as strategies to manage symptoms. Most patients benefit from a brief period of rest, followed by a gradual reintroduction of activities, and a graduated return-to-sport protocol. Patients with prolonged recovery from a concussion may benefit from exercise, vestibular, and cognitive rehabilitation programs.

### Higher neck pain intensity and the presence of psychosocial factors are more likely when headache is present following a whiplash injury: A case-control study [^113C2UXv]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

A whiplash injury is defined as the acceleration-deceleration mechanism that produces a transfer of energy to the neck, usually provoked by a rear-end car collision, which can lead to a variety of symptoms and clinical manifestations known as whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). Whiplash injuries are common and contribute substantially to the impairment and disability resulting from traffic injuries. It has been estimated that prevalence is up to 400 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year in Europe.

According to the International Headache Society (IHS), "headache attributed to whiplash" is a headache that appears within 7 days after the accident or a previous headache that worsens during this period. Indeed, headache is one of the most common symptoms following a whiplash injury. The prevalence of headache is reported to be up to 60% 7 days after the accident, and 23%, 30%, and 38% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, and is one of the most common symptoms after neck pain.

Several factors such as neck pain intensity, disability, anxiety, depression, female sex, or a previous history of headache are associated with post-whiplash headache. However, the possible role of psychosocial factors contributing to the presence of headache or worsening of headache following a whiplash trauma remains unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, there is a need to assess psychosocial factors concerning headache shortly following a whiplash injury. The aim of the present study was to analyze neck pain and headache intensity, neck disability, and kinesiophobia.

### Quality of life and post trauma symptomatology in motor vehicle accident survivors: The mediating effects of depression and anxiety [^115bAnGS]. Depression and Anxiety (2004). Low credibility.

This study examined the respective contributions of depression, anxiety, and post-trauma symptoms as factors that reduce quality of life (QOL) among 111 individuals who had experienced a serious motor vehicle accident. Correlations and structural equation modeling were used to assess whether the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms directly influences QOL, and whether depression and anxiety mediate this relationship. Results indicated that post-trauma symptomatology negatively affects QOL, with depression and anxiety serving as mediating factors.

### A descriptive analysis of disorders in patients 17 years following motor vehicle accidents [^117THtaj]. European Spine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) are described and analyzed 17 years after involvement in a motor vehicle accident. A self-report questionnaire was mailed to 121 patients registered at emergency departments in Gothenburg in 1983 due to neck complaints following a car collision. The questionnaire contained items on symptoms related to WAD, treatment, work disability, involvement in settlement of claims, medical disability, and the Neck Disability Index (NDI).

Of the 121 patients, 108 (89%) chose to participate in the study. Fifty-nine (55%) had residual disorders referable to the original accident. Neck pain, radiating pain, and headache were the most common symptoms. One-third of the patients with residual symptoms suffered from work disability, compared to 6% in the group without residual disorders. All 25 patients who had reached a final claim settlement (42%) had a poor outcome, and 15 of these patients had been assigned a medical disability ranging from 5 to 30%. Patients with WAD reported a significantly higher score on the NDI than those without residual disorders. There was no significant correlation between the patients' degree of medical disability and the scores on the NDI.

The results of the study show that approximately half of the patients with neck complaints following motor vehicle accidents in Gothenburg in 1983 experienced frequent residual symptoms 17 years after the accident, mostly comprising neck pain, radiating pain, and headache. These residual disorders contributed to the patients' overall disability.

### Neck injury comorbidity in concussion-related emergency department visits: A population-based study of sex differences across the life span [^11459p2E]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

This study found that females aged 15–49 years, who were injured in a motor vehicle crash (MVC), had significantly higher odds of comorbid neck injury. This may reflect the fact that individuals are not legally allowed to drive until the age of 16 in Ontario. Similarly, our results indicated that females aged 10–39 years, who were injured in a sports-related activity, had significantly higher odds of a comorbid neck injury compared with males, possibly reflecting participation in sports among younger adults. These findings encourage additional research to understand how best to prevent head and neck injuries for this population, including sex-specific prevention or harm reduction strategies. Such strategies could include improving protective equipment in sports for both males and females and enhancing safety measures for motor vehicle drivers, occupants, or cyclists.

Data on other hypothesized variables, including the mechanism and cause of injury (i.e. MVC, sports injuries) and residence in rural neighborhoods, were significantly associated with neck injury comorbidity in all concussion-related emergency department (ED) visits, holding all other variables constant. This is consistent with previous studies, which reported higher odds of sustaining a neck injury in MVC and sports-related incidents compared with all concussion-related injuries. Furthermore, the results of our study suggest that females have a higher risk of sustaining a comorbid neck injury across all causes of injury. Additionally, our study indicates that although overall rates for neck injury were lower for intentional injuries, females who suffer a concussion from an intentional act still face considerable risks.

Regarding specific circumstances for concussion, particularly in pediatric patients, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend counseling patients and families during preparticipation athletic examinations, as well as patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and their families, that recovery from mTBI might be delayed in the presence of the following factors:

- **Premorbid history of mTBI**: Impacts recovery timelines.
- **Lower cognitive ability**: Especially in patients with an intracranial lesion.
- **Neurological or psychiatric disorder**: Can complicate recovery.
- **Learning difficulties**: Affect the management of recovery.
- **Increased pre-injury symptoms**: May result in extended recovery periods.
- **Family and social stressors**: Contribute to recovery challenges.

### National Football League Head, Neck and Spine Committee's concussion diagnosis and management protocol: 2017–18 season [^115wu7B9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

One of the National Football League's (NFL) Head, Neck and Spine Committee's principal goals is to create a 'best practice' protocol for concussion diagnosis and management for its players. The science related to concussion diagnosis and management continues to evolve, thus the protocol has evolved contemporaneously. The Fifth International Conference on Concussion in Sport was held in Berlin in 2016, and guidelines for sports concussion diagnosis and management were revised and refined. The NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee has synthesized the most recent empirical evidence for sports concussion diagnosis and management, including the Berlin consensus statement, and tailored it to the game played in the NFL. One of the goals of the committee is to provide a standardized, reliable, efficient, and evidence-based protocol for concussion diagnosis and management that can be applied in this professional sport during practice and game day. In this article, the end-of-season version of the 2017–18 NFL Concussion Diagnosis and Management Protocol is described along with its clinical rationale. Immediate actions for concussion program enhancement and research are reviewed. It is the committee's expectation that the protocol will undergo refinement and revision over time as the science and clinical practice related to concussion in sports crystallize.

### Analysis of concussions with persisting symptoms caused by motor vehicle crashes in 136 vehicle occupants shows that females are vulnerable road users [^111Vmz2V]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2025). Low credibility.

The authors are aware of the difficulty in accurately assessing recovery when patient compliance creates data gaps. The new system that we recently reported represents an attempt to utilize as much data as possible to characterize recovery based on what is known about the duration of suffering from symptoms in patients with unknown recovery.

In general, patients with C+PCS from an MVC were highly symptomatic, experiencing an average of 13.4 (SD = 7.9) PCS, distributed among three symptom categories. Somatic symptoms were most common (mean = 7.0, SD = 4.2), followed by neuropsychiatric (mean = 4.28, SD = 2.9), and cognitive (mean = 2.2, SD = 1.7). The four types of MVCs did not differ significantly concerning concussion recovery and symptom variables.

One patient had only one symptom, three patients had only two symptoms, with the remainder having three or more symptoms. The number and prevalence of each of the specific 53 reported symptoms included somatic (n = 26), cognitive (n = 12), and neuropsychiatric (n = 15) categories.

- **Somatic symptoms**: The three most prevalent were headache (n = 115, 84.6%), sensitivity to light (n = 96, 70.6%), and sensitivity to noise (n = 90, 66.2%).

- **Cognitive symptoms**: The most common were memory problems (n = 95, 69.9%), concentration difficulties (n = 74, 54.4%), and mental fogginess (n = 39, 28.7%).

- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Anxiety (n = 99, 72.8%), irritability (n = 77, 56.6%), and depression (n = 76, 55.9%) were the most prevalent.

### Onset of neck pain following a motor vehicle accident: A case-control study [^112P41GT]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the relative contribution of constitutional (individual) factors, pre-accident health, psychological and workplace psychosocial factors, and accident-related (mechanical) factors in the development of neck pain (whiplash) following a motor vehicle accident, we conducted a case-control study of drivers (ages 17–70 years) who reported a motor vehicle accident to their insurance company. A self-report mailed questionnaire was used to retrospectively collect information on the driver's pre- and post-accident health, details of the accident, and other exposure data. Case/control status (post-accident neck pain) was ascertained using a preshaded manikin.

In total, 26% of drivers reported post-accident neck pain. Women, younger individuals, and those with a history of neck pain were more likely to report neck pain following their accident (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.98, 2.28; OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96, 2.74; OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.09, 2.81, respectively). In addition, several accident-related and psychosocial factors were independently associated with reporting post-accident neck pain:

- **Collision from behind**: (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.41, 4.62).

- **Vehicle stationary at impact**: (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.12, 3.33).

- **Collision severity**: (upper vs lowest tertile: OR 16.1, 95% CI 8.64, 30.1).

- **Not being at fault**: (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.49, 4.59).

- **Monotonous work**: (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.19, 4.04).

Based on these eight factors, the likelihood of having neck pain increased from 7% with or equal to five. Development of neck pain following a motor vehicle accident is a complex interaction of various factors.

### The initial assessment and management of the multiple-trauma patient with an associated spine injury [^111p2o8Q]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

This study provides a review and summary of relevant literature from multiple disciplines. The objective is to offer readers evidence-based guidelines on the initial assessment and treatment of multiple-trauma patients with associated spinal column injuries.

Early operative stabilization of isolated spinal column injuries has decreased hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay. However, early intervention has not consistently led to improved neurologic outcomes. The timing of spinal column stabilization in multiple-trauma patients remains a topic of discussion.

The study reviews published English literature from 1990 to the present, using keywords such as spinal trauma, multiple-trauma with spinal injury, timing of spinal injury treatment, spinal fracture management, and Advanced Trauma Life Support.

The conclusions emphasize that treating polytrauma patients with associated spinal column injuries requires strict adherence to Advanced Trauma Life Support principles. Once life- and limb-threatening injuries are identified and addressed, spinal column assessment and neurologic protection must be prioritized. Early spinal stabilization can be safely performed in multiple-trauma patients at medical centers with 24-hour available and familiar medical and ancillary staff.
