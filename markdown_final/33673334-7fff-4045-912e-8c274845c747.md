## Question

A 36-year-old African American G1P0010 presents to her gynecologist for an annual visit. She has a medical history of hypertension, for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide. The patient's mother had breast cancer at age 68, and her sister has endometriosis. At this visit, the patient's temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 138/74 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 13/min. Her BMI is 32.4 kg/m^2. Pelvic exam reveals a nontender, 16-week sized uterus with an irregular contour. A transvaginal ultrasound is performed and demonstrates a submucosal leiomyoma. This patient is at most increased risk of which of the following complications?
A. Infertility
B. Uterine prolapse
C. Endometrial cancer
D. Iron deficiency anemia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which complication is most increased in a 36-year-old woman with a large submucosal uterine fibroid, and to choose among infertility, uterine prolapse, endometrial cancer, and iron deficiency anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fibroid's size and location and how that drives symptoms. Then, I should verify the classic complications of submucosal fibroids, especially bleeding and fertility effects. Next, I will review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of iron deficiency anemia in women of reproductive age with heavy menstrual bleeding. After that, I should compare the relative risks of the listed options against each other. Finally, I will confirm the most likely complication and outline the clinical implications for diagnosis and management.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical features. A 16-week-sized uterus with an irregular contour and a submucosal leiomyoma on ultrasound means a large fibroid that distorts the endometrial cavity, which is the setup most strongly associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and related sequelae, including iron deficiency anemia, in reproductive-age women [^notfound].

> I will now examine the mechanism linking submucosal fibroids to anemia. Submucosal fibroids protrude into the cavity, increase endometrial surface area, impair contractile mechanisms, and often cause menorrhagia; chronic blood loss then depletes iron stores and leads to iron deficiency anemia, which is a well-described complication in this setting and a common reason for presentation and treatment decisions in women with fibroids [^111sFJG3].

> Next, I should review how common iron deficiency anemia is in women of reproductive age and whether fibroids are a major contributor. Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and is particularly prevalent among women of childbearing potential due to menstrual blood loss; fibroids are a frequent and clinically important cause of that blood loss, reinforcing the causal pathway in this patient [^111sFJG3] [^111FSCEk] [^111DRFhc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to compare the other options. Infertility can be associated with submucosal fibroids because cavity distortion impairs implantation, but infertility is not the most common complication and is less likely than iron deficiency anemia in a general outpatient population with fibroids; uterine prolapse is not driven by fibroid location and is not a typical complication of submucosal fibroids; endometrial cancer risk is not increased by fibroids per se, and the patient lacks red flags such as postmenopausal bleeding or atypical endometrial thickening, so malignancy risk remains low in this context [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the hierarchy of risk one more time. Given the large size, submucosal location, and the patient's reproductive age, the most probable and clinically consequential complication is iron deficiency anemia from chronic menorrhagia. The other options are either less likely or not directly attributable to a submucosal fibroid in this scenario, so the balance of probability and pathophysiology favors iron deficiency anemia as the answer [^111sFJG3].

> I should confirm the clinical implications. If anemia is present, I would check a CBC, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP to confirm iron deficiency and exclude anemia of chronic disease. If confirmed, treat with iron repletion and address the source of bleeding, with fibroid-directed therapy considered based on symptoms and fertility goals, consistent with contemporary guidance on iron deficiency anemia management and fibroid care pathways [^111whJmb] [^115bHVQo].

---

The most likely complication in this patient is **iron deficiency anemia** due to chronic blood loss from a large submucosal fibroid [^1114HXZG]. Submucosal fibroids are the most symptomatic type and commonly cause **heavy menstrual bleeding**, leading to iron deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The other options are less likely: infertility is possible but less common with a single submucosal fibroid; uterine prolapse is not associated with submucosal fibroids; and endometrial cancer risk is not increased by fibroids.

---

## Pathophysiology of iron deficiency anemia in submucosal fibroids

Submucosal fibroids protrude into the uterine cavity, **disrupting the endometrial lining** and causing **heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)** [^1114HXZG]. Chronic blood loss leads to iron deficiency anemia, characterized by microcytic, hypochromic anemia with low ferritin and transferrin saturation [^111sFJG3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting iron deficiency anemia

Clinical studies consistently show that submucosal fibroids cause **heavy menstrual bleeding** and iron deficiency anemia [^1114HXZG]. A large fibroid (16-week size) further increases the risk of significant blood loss and anemia [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other complications

| **Complication** | **Likelihood in this patient** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Iron deficiency anemia | High | Submucosal fibroids cause heavy menstrual bleeding, leading to chronic iron loss [^111sFJG3] |
| Infertility | Moderate | Submucosal fibroids can impair implantation, but a single fibroid is less likely to cause infertility |
| Uterine prolapse | Low | Submucosal fibroids do not significantly increase the risk of uterine prolapse |
| Endometrial cancer | Low | Fibroids do not increase the risk of endometrial cancer |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Given the high likelihood of iron deficiency anemia, the patient should be evaluated with a **complete blood count (CBC), ferritin, and transferrin saturation** [^114zFjPX]. If anemia is confirmed, initiate **iron supplementation** (oral or intravenous) and address the underlying cause — in this case, the submucosal fibroid — with medical or surgical management [^1177mVnZ] [^116DCPpr].

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### Management of iron deficiency [^1177mVnZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a decrease in erythropoiesis caused by a deficit in total body iron. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia worldwide. According to the World Health Organization guideline, IDA affects 30% of the world's population, indicating that it is a problem requiring attention.

Iron deficiency can be divided into 3 stages: prelatent iron deficiency, latent iron deficiency (also called iron-deficient erythropoiesis), and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). At the first stage, iron intake lower than the required amount causes progressive depletion of iron storage primarily in the liver and muscle cells. Patients at this stage generally have no symptoms, and the diagnosis of iron deficiency is made when levels of serum ferritin (the storage form of iron) decrease below 20 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0). Sustained iron storage depletion leads to the second stage of iron deficiency, iron-deficient erythropoiesis, in which iron deficiencies progress and begin to affect erythropoiesis. Despite an increased transferrin level, serum iron level decreases along with transferrin saturation. Erythropoiesis impairment appears when the serum iron level decreases to less than 50.3 μg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.179) and transferrin saturation is less than 16%. Hemoglobin level is still within the normal range until the development of the IDA stage. Iron storage levels deplete to the point that they can no longer support the hemoglobin production and generate enough red blood cells (RBCs). Iron deficiency impairs RBC synthesis and hemoglobin production, leading to anemia.

### U-shaped association between maternal hemoglobin and low birth weight in rural Bangladesh [^116u5Bzt]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common cause of anemia in pregnant women is iron-deficiency anemia and it is often assumed that over 50% of all cases of maternal anemia in high-prevalence regions like Bangladesh can be attributed to iron deficiency alone. Iron deficiency has been independently associated with LBW outcomes because the mother's body does not have sufficient iron stores to adequately expand the red blood cell mass and support the growth of the placenta and developing fetus. This is especially true for iron deficiency before conception and early in the first trimester. Routine iron supplementation and nutrition education has been shown to effectively reduce the incidence of LBW in iron-deficient populations. However, the impact of anemia on LBW may not be as robust in places where the prevalence of iron deficiency is not common as has been suggested in Bangladesh. The high rate of mild to moderate anemia in this cohort could be secondary to a condition such as thalassemia rather than iron deficiency. Of note, thalassemia-related anemia may not have as large an impact on LBW rates as iron-deficiency anemia.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^11531s8p]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

4.4.3 Inflammatory bowel disease

Anaemia is common in children with IBD and it can be considered a biomarker of disease activity. Prevalence rates are reported as high as 78% in newly diagnosed children with IBD. There are several aetiologies of IDA in IBD (Table 3). IDA and ACD are the two most common types of anaemia in IBD and can often co‐exist. In addition, in IBD patients, FID (Table 4) can mimic IDA. In FID, iron stores may be barely adequate, but iron is not available for erythropoiesis. This may be due to ACD, where iron release from macrophages back into the circulation is blocked due to increased hepcidin, or to erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents, where the release of iron into the circulation may not be rapid enough to support erythropoiesis. The pathophysiology of anaemia in IBD is based on the dysregulation of iron homoeostasis and the pivotal role of hepcidin. Limited luminal iron is absorbed from oral diet or supplements because epithelium iron stores are saturated. Therefore, in IBD, oral iron supplements are unlikely to improve blood iron status.

Table 3
Aetiologies of IDA in IBD.

Table 4
Various tests used to differentiate IDA from ACD and FID.

A recent study has shown that many children with IBD suffer from anaemia and micronutrient deficiencies at diagnosis and some fail to recover after 1 year despite being in clinical remission. The prevalence of deficiencies in this cohort at diagnosis and 1‐year follow‐up, respectively, were among others iron (56% and 27%), ferritin (39% and 27%), vitamin D (22% and 13%), vitamin A (25% and 25%), vitamin E (5% and 4%), copper (17% and 27%), vitamin B12 (2% and 5%) and RBC folate (1% and 17%). Anaemia was present in 57% and 25% at diagnosis and 1‐year follow‐up, respectively. Each of these micronutrients plays several roles not only in anaemia and the course of disease. Vitamin B12 deficiency in children with IBD can be secondary to extensive terminal ileum resection, dietary restriction in vegans, intestinal inflammation, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Therefore, in patients at risk for vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency (e.g. small bowel disease or resection), both micronutrients should be monitored at least annually, or if macrocytosis is present, especially in the absence of thiopurine use.

### Alternate day versus daily oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency anemia: a randomized controlled trial [^115sg8NY]. Scientific Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The study Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA was published by Elamparithi Pasupathy and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Sci Rep. This study is related to the following diseases: Iron deficiency anemia. In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the trial question was: is alternate day oral iron therapy superior to daily oral iron therapy in patients with iron deficiency anemia? In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the population was: 200 patients. The inclusion criteria were patients with iron deficiency anemia. The key exclusion criteria were CKD; chronic liver disease; HF; malignancy; hemolytic anemia; pregnancy; blood transfusions within past 3 months; severe anemia requiring transfusion. In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the interventions were: n = 100 alternate day iron therapy (120 mg elemental iron tablets on alternate days for 8 weeks) n = 100 daily iron therapy (single tablet of 60 mg elemental iron daily for 8 weeks). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in mean improvement in hemoglobin level at week 8 (1.05 g/dL vs. 1.36 g/dL; AD -0.31 g/dL, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.51). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in improvement in ferritin level at week 4 (30.84 ng/mL vs. 17.69 ng/mL; AD 13.15 ng/mL, 95% CI -12.52 to 38.82) No significant difference in proportion of patients with at least 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin at week 8 (17.71% vs. 22.45%; ARD -4.74, 95% CI -15.84 to 6.36). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in other adverse events. significant difference in nausea at week 4 (10.3% vs. 2%). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the conclusion was: in patients with iron deficiency anemia, alternate day iron therapy was not superior to daily iron therapy with respect to mean improvement in hemoglobin level at week 8.

### Hypertension… [^115XQ3mL]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

High blood pressure is classified as primary hypertension or secondary hypertension. About 90–95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to non-specific lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol use. The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary hypertension, defined as high blood pressure due to a clearly identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills. The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy. The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 130/80 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefit and others finding unclear or no benefit. High blood pressure affects 33% of the population globally.

About half of all people with high blood pressure do not know that they have it. In 2019, high blood pressure was believed to have been a factor in 19% of all deaths. Hyperthyroidism frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite, fast heart rate, bulging eyes, and tremor. Renal artery stenosis may be associated with a localized abdominal bruit to the left or right of the midline, or in both locations. Coarctation of the aorta frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms, or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses. Pheochromocytoma may cause abrupt episodes of hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pale appearance, and excessive sweating. Pregnancy Hypertension occurs in approximately 8–10% of pregnancies. Two blood pressure measurements six hours apart of greater than 140/90 mmHg are diagnostic of hypertension in pregnancy.

High blood pressure in pregnancy can be classified as pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia. Women who have chronic hypertension before their pregnancy are at increased risk of complications such as premature birth, low birthweight or stillbirth. Women who have high blood pressure and had complications in their pregnancy have three times the risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to women with normal blood pressure who had no complications in pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition in the second half of pregnancy characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine. It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all maternal deaths globally. Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of death of the baby around the time of birth. In contrast, gestational hypertension is defined as new-onset hypertension in the second half of pregnancy without protein in the urine.

Exercise during pregnancy is generally safe and may improve outcomes in hypertension during pregnancy, and may prevent gestational hypertension and related complications. Failure to thrive, seizures, irritability, lack of energy, and difficulty in breathing can be associated with hypertension in newborns and young infants. In older infants and children, hypertension can cause headache, unexplained irritability, fatigue, failure to thrive, blurred vision, nosebleeds, and facial paralysis. Causes Primary hypertension Primary hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors. More than 2000 common genetic variants with small effects on blood pressure have been identified in association with high blood pressure, as well as some rare genetic variants with large effects on blood pressure.

### Endometriosis… [^117WV3b5]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and medical imaging; however, a definitive diagnosis is made through laparoscopy. Other causes of similar symptoms include pelvic inflammatory disease, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia. Endometriosis is often misdiagnosed and many patients report being incorrectly told their symptoms are trivial or normal. Patients with endometriosis see an average of seven physicians before receiving a correct diagnosis. Worldwide, around 10% of the female population of reproductive age are affected by endometriosis. Asian women are more likely than White women to be diagnosed with endometriosis. The exact cause of endometriosis is not known. Possible causes include problems with menstrual period flow, genetic factors, hormones, and problems with the immune system. Thoracic endometriosis occurs when endometrium-like tissue implants in the lungs or pleura around the lungs.

When it occurs in the lungs, common signs and symptoms are blood discharge from the lungs during menstruation and nodules which become bigger during menstruation. When it is found in the pleura, symptoms may be a collapsed lung during or outside of menstruation and bleeding into the pleural space. Further symptoms are a cyclical cough and cyclical shoulder pain. Most often, the endometriosis is found in the right lung. Stress may be a contributing factor or a consequence of endometriosis. Sciatic endometriosis, also called catamenial or cyclical sciatica, is a rare form where endometriosis affects the sciatic nerve. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through MRI or CT-myelography. A 20-year study involving 12, 000 women with endometriosis found that individuals under 40 are three times more likely to develop heart problems compared to their healthy peers.

Endometriosis increases the risk of developing ovarian and thyroid cancers compared to women without the condition, and slightly increases the risk of breast cancer. The mortality rates associated with endometriosis are low, with unadjusted and age-standardized death rates of 0. 1 and
0. 0 per 100, 000, respectively. Risk factors Genetics Endometriosis is a heritable condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, a genetic disorder of polygenic/multifactorial inheritance acquired via affected genes from either a person's father or mother. For example, children or siblings of women with endometriosis are at higher risk of developing endometriosis themselves; low progesterone levels may be genetic, and may contribute to a hormone imbalance. Individuals with an affected first-degree relative have an approximate six-fold increase incidence of endometriosis.

There are many findings of altered gene expression and epigenetics, but both of these can also be a secondary result of, for example, environmental factors and altered metabolism. Examples of altered gene expression include that of miRNAs. Autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions Endometriosis patients show a significantly increased risk of autoimmune, autoinflammatory, and mixed-pattern psoriatic diseases, with two studies in 2025 pointing to the connection. One of the studies suggested that the chances of receiving a diagnosis of at least one of the autoimmune conditions for those with endometriosis was around twice that of a control cohort. The linked conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, coeliac disease, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis. This reinforces the view that there is a genetic correlation between endometriosis and osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis, and a potential causal link to rheumatoid arthritis.

### Evidence gaps for the global problem of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age [^1141fBG3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The symptom of heavy menstrual bleeding and the frequently associated condition of iron deficiency (ID) individually and collectively adversely impact the lives of women and girls of reproductive age in various ways. The insidious but sometimes profound effects of periconceptual ID on the developing fetus may continue throughout the individual's life with consequences that are also felt by families, friends, and society at large. Unfortunately, in most instances, current healthcare policies are not designed to address the plethora of issues in a fashion that will result in meaningful improvement in health and other outcomes that affect both individuals and society. Identification and prioritization of the many evidence gaps will be an essential component of the strategy for change. This article identifies and describes the evidence gaps and provides direction for investigators and those involved in healthcare policy.

### Prevention of iron deficiency in infants and toddlers [^116AsYHT]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of nutritional iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers has declined dramatically since 1960. However, satisfaction with this achievement must be tempered because iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers is associated with long-lasting diminished mental, motor, and behavioral functioning. Additionally, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in one- to three-year-old children seems to be increasing. The exact relationship between iron deficiency anemia and the developmental effects is not well understood, but these effects do not occur until iron deficiency becomes severe and chronic enough to produce anemia. At that point, treatment with iron can reverse the anemia and restore iron sufficiency, yet the poorer developmental functioning appears to persist. Therefore, intervention should focus on the primary prevention of iron deficiency. In the first year of life, measures to prevent iron deficiency include completely avoiding cow's milk, starting iron supplementation at four to six months of age in breastfed infants, and using iron-fortified formula when not breastfeeding. Low-iron formula should not be used. In the second year of life, iron deficiency can be prevented by use of a diversified diet that is rich in sources of iron and vitamin C, limiting cow's milk consumption to less than 24 oz per day, and providing a daily iron-fortified vitamin. All infants and toddlers who did not receive primary prevention should be screened for iron deficiency. Screening is performed at nine to 12 months, six months later, and at 24 months of age. The hemoglobin/hematocrit level alone detects only patients with enough iron deficiency to be anemic. Screening by erythrocyte protoporphyrin or red-cell distribution width identifies earlier stages of iron deficiency. A positive screening test is an indication for a therapeutic trial of iron, which remains the definitive method of establishing a diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^112exuV8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Iron deficiency, with or without anemia, affects almost half of pregnancies worldwide, adversely impacting maternal and fetal outcomes. In North America, the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is reported to be greater than 50%, and nearly 12% of pregnancies are affected by iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with an increased risk of maternal complications, including preterm labor, cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and maternal death, as well as fetal complications, like low birth weight and small for gestational age. Iron deficiency anemia is influenced by social determinants of health, such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, nutritional status, and food insecurity. Thus, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) examined the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with or without anemia in asymptomatic pregnant individuals, to update its previously published recommendations from nearly a decade ago.

In the evidence review and updated recommendation statement, the USPSTF extended its review to include the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency without anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant individuals. Additionally, the evidence review and recommendation statement, examined studies on the relationship between change in maternal iron status and improvement in infant and maternal outcomes in pregnant individuals with iron deficiency with or without anemia. After reviewing the literature, the USPSTF did not find sufficient evidence that screening and supplementation for iron deficiency, with or without anemia, during pregnancy improved maternal and infant health outcomes (I statement). Additionally, they found insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation in pregnant individuals to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes (I statement).

As cohort studies suggest an association between latent (or nonanemic) iron deficiency and maternal and neonatal morbidity, it is timely and relevant that the USPSTF included iron deficiency without anemia in this evidence review. This is a critical step to better understand these associations and the optimal ways to supplement or treat pregnant persons with iron deficiency. However, the USPSTF was unable to find adequate studies to address 4 of 5 key questions, highlighting a significant gap in knowledge. As a result, their ability to make recommendations was inherently limited. The absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of a negative association. Rather, this void emphasizes the value and need for additional studies addressing screening and supplementation.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^111FSCEk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

### Predictors of anemia in women of reproductive age: biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^113m9ZtW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The estimated prevalence of iron deficiency on the basis of inflammation-adjusted ferritin values ranged from 19% to 38% in all countries except in Georgia where the prevalence was < 2% (Table 2). The prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia was > 10% in 4 countries (Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Laos, and Liberia) in the high-infection group. The adjustment of ferritin for inflammation increased the proportion of women with iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia in all countries and infection groups. The largest change in iron deficiency was observed in the moderate-infection group where the prevalence increased by 8.4 percentage points. Despite this large increase in the prevalence of iron deficiency, the largest change in iron-deficiency anemia was observed in the high-infection group where the prevalence increased by 3.5 percentage points (Figure 1, Supplemental Figure 2).

### Anemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [^116py442]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CAUSES OF ANEMIA

Anemia in diabetic patients with CKD may result from one or more mechanisms. Vitamin deficiencies such as folate and B12 are relatively uncommon, and clinical practice guidelines do not recommend routine measurement of these serum levels. (See below.) The major causes of anemia in CKD patients are iron and erythropoietin deficiencies and hyporesponsiveness to the actions of erythropoietin.

Iron deficiency

Iron deficiency in the general population is a common cause of anemia and is prevalent in patients with diabetes and CKD. In these same patients, dietary deficiency, low intestinal absorption, and gastrointestinal bleeding may result in absolute iron-deficiency anemia. Recent analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV suggest that up to 50% of patients with CKD stages 2–5 have absolute or relative (functional) iron deficiency. In CKD, both absolute and relative iron deficiency are common. Absolute iron deficiency is defined as a depletion of tissue iron stores evidenced by a serum ferritin level < 100 ng/ml or a transferrin saturation of < 20%. Functional iron deficiency anemia is adequate tissue iron defined as a serum ferritin level ≥ 100 ng/ml and a reduction in iron saturation. The latter is more common and is strongly associated with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and impaired tissue responsiveness to erythropoietin, which can inhibit iron transport from tissue stores to erythroblasts. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 enhance production and secretion of hepcidin, a hepatic protein that inhibits intestinal iron absorption and impairs iron transport from the reticuloendothelial system to bone marrow. In addition, erythropoietin, which normally enhances iron transport from macrophages to the blood stream, is impaired, thereby exacerbating relative iron deficiency.

Erythropoietin deficiency and hyporesponsiveness

Both deficiency and hyporesponsiveness to erythropoietin contribute to anemia in diabetic patients with CKD. The cause of erythropoietin deficiency in these patients is thought to be reduced renal mass with consequent depletion of the hormone. Hyporesponsivness is defined clinically as a requirement for high doses of erythropoietin in order to raise blood Hb level in the absence of iron deficiency. It is believed to represent impaired antiapoptotic action of erythropoietin on proerythroblasts. Possible causes of this erythropoietin hyporesponsiveness include systemic inflammation and microvascular damage in the bone marrow. However, some studies suggest that other factors (i.e. autonomic failure) may play a role in impaired erythropoietin production or secretion by failing kidneys.

### Iron-deficiency anemia and the cycle of poverty among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women in the inner city [^117Sk3VB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia appears to be extremely high among female injection drug users in the inner city who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) infections. Iron deficiency and its associated anemia may contribute to reduced energetic efficiency, lower aerobic capacity, decreased endurance, and fatigue. In practical terms, the functional limitations of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia may affect the ability of women to participate in work, school, social, and family activities. Iron deficiency may contribute to the cycle of poverty in the inner city by limiting the ability of women to work, earn money, and afford iron-rich sources of food. Although iron supplementation may prevent or treat iron deficiency, the use of iron supplements needs to be approached with caution in women with HIV and HCV infections.

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Management of iron deficiency in children, adults, and pregnant individuals: evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations [^116Nz14H]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16–17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.

### Identification and management of iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department [^112GAqCt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in the United States and worldwide. Yet, clinical guidelines for the identification and management of this disorder in the emergency department are lacking.

Objective Of Review

This clinical review examines strategies for identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department, with a focus on the role of oral iron therapy, intravenous iron therapy, as well as red blood cell transfusion. The article highlights both the available evidence on this topic and the need for future research.

Discussion

The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has important clinical implications and, although testing is generally straightforward, it may be under-recognized. The scant literature available describing emergency department practice patterns for iron deficiency anemia suggests there is room for improvement. In particular, intravenous iron may be underutilized and red blood cell transfusions administered too liberally.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency anemia is common and many patients can be treated effectively with oral iron. For selected patients with moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia, intravenous iron is safe and more effective than oral iron. Red blood cell transfusions should be used rarely for hemodynamically stable patients with iron deficiency irrespective of hemoglobin levels.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^114qPT3h]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and classification of iron deficiency

Two types of ID need to be distinguished: absolute, and functional ID,– (Figure 3).

Figure 3
The concept of absolute and functional iron deficiency.

Absolute ID reflects depleted iron stores, often with intact iron homoeostasis mechanisms and erythropoiesis. The commonest causes are: low-dietary iron, impaired gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and GI blood loss, menorrhagia (Figure 3). Functional ID reflects inadequate iron supply to meet the demand despite normal or abundant body iron stores, because iron is trapped inside cells of the reticuloendothelial system and is unavailable for cellular metabolism, (Figure 3). It is believed to be mainly caused by pro-inflammatory activation with hepcidin overproduction (see above).–

Approximately 80% of the total body iron is in the erythron, being a component of haemoglobin. Reduced iron delivery to erythroblasts and reticulocytes limits erythropoiesis, and ID is the commonest cause of anaemia. Diagnostic algorithms have been developed to optimize the detection and classification of ID, and to monitor iron stores to provide adequate and optimal management of anaemia. –

### Breast and ovarian cancer… [^113DRvVP]. Wikipedia (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast and ovarian cancer does not necessarily imply that both cancers occur at the same time, but rather that getting one cancer would lead to the development of the other within a few years. Women with a history of breast cancer have a higher chance of developing ovarian cancer, vice versa. Breast cancer refers to the uncontrolled division of breast cells. It is possible for both males and females to get breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer women face. Risk Factor Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer HBOC is an inherited cancer syndrome which produces more breast cancer and ovarian cancer in genetically related families. Mutations in BReast CAncer 1 and BReast CAncer 2 are significantly related. The lifetime risk of a female developing breast and/or ovarian cancer increases if she inherits a harmful mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2, but the severity depends on the type of mutation.

Each year, about 3% of breast cancers and 10% of ovarian cancers result from inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, most BOC are non-inherited, so most women who have BOC do not have HBOC. It is estimated that less than 1% of the general population has a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Mutations in other tumor suppressor genes like TP53, PTEN, CDH1, ATM, CHEK2 and PALB2, and oncogenes like KRAS, BRAF and ERBB2 have also been linked with an increased risk of HBOC. HBOC is considered when multiple cases of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and/or pancreatic cancer occur in the same family. In families with 4 or more cases of breast cancer diagnosed before age 60, the chance of having HBOC is about 80%. The risk would be even higher for women who have close blood relatives with breast cancer.

Women with a first-degree female relative who has been diagnosed with breast cancer would have a risk that is two times higher than the general population, particularly if the FDR was diagnosed early in life. They also show 32% higher risk when they have five or more third-degree relatives. A similar trend is seen in ovarian cancer, where women with FDRs diagnosed with ovarian cancer shows a risk three times higher than the general population. Families of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry backgrounds have an increased risk of HBOC. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are 10 times more common in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.
2. 5% of individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry have such mutations. Genetic testing is available for testing mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Methods include sequence analysis and gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis. However, most BOC occur by chance without a known cause, so genetic testing is only recommended for people with family history suggesting HBOC.

Use of hormone replacement therapy Hormone replacement therapy includes both estrogen and progesterone. They are used for treating menopausal symptoms. A woman exposed to estrogen either endogenously or exogenously for a long period of time has an increased risk of developing BOC. Studies suggest that using HRT in postmenopausal women for more than five years increases the risk of breast cancer. It also increases the risk of ovarian cancer. 4% of ovarian cancers are linked to HRT use. Women with family histories of breast cancer show a higher risk of breast cancer when using HRT. Progestin-containing hormonal treatments after a bilateral risk-reducing oophorectomy may increase risk of breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers. Contraceptives The use of oral contraceptives by women with BRCA2 mutations shows 75% increased breast cancer risk, especially in long-term users. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system increases breast cancer risk in all women.

Oral iron is less likely to be effective in patients with more severe degrees of villous atrophy, and IV iron may be indicated in these patients or in patients with more severe symptoms of iron deficiency; IV iron also may be indicated in patients whose iron stores do not recover sufficiently with oral iron and a strict gluten-free diet, and appropriate evaluation of other micronutrient deficiencies, sources of chronic blood loss, or anemia of chronic inflammation should be undertaken in patients whose iron stores are slow to recover.

It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^112kTtQT]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron plays an important role in many biological functions. Absolute iron deficiency results from a severe reduction or absence of iron stores. Functional iron deficiency occurs in the presence of adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability (thus, it is not a true deficiency of body stores). Although most research has focused on adverse outcomes among people with iron deficiency and anemia, iron deficiency affects nonerythropoietic tissue, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, in the absence of anemia. Iron deficiency has been associated with restless leg syndrome, decreased physical capacity, impaired neurocognitive function, heart failure, all-cause mortality, and other adverse outcomes independent of anemia.

Infants and children, people of childbearing potential, and people with certain conditions, such as anemia, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, have high rates of iron deficiency. The prevalence of iron deficiency outside these groups and the potential underlying causes remain unclear. Moreover, the prevalence of functional iron deficiency has not been determined. Iron deficiency can be prevented or treated through dietary interventions or nonprescription iron supplements, but the current use of nonprescription iron supplements and dietary iron intake and iron deficiency prevalence have not been studied. These estimates are needed to identify populations at risk of iron deficiency–related adverse outcomes, inform screening recommendations, and establish research priorities. We estimated the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency and iron supplement use in the US from 2017 to 2020 across age, sex, and comorbidity categories.

### Pathways for the regulation of hepcidin expression in anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia in vivo [^112tatvx]. Haematologica (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Increased levels of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis, contribute to the diversion of iron underlying the anemia of chronic disease. Yet hepcidin levels are low in anemia of chronic disease with concomitant true iron deficiency. Here we clarify the different underlying pathways regulating hepcidin expression under these conditions in vivo.

Design and Methods

We used rat models of iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease and anemia of chronic disease with concomitant true iron deficiency and investigated upstream signaling pathways controlling hepcidin transcription in the liver. Protein and mRNA levels of iron metabolism genes and genes involved in SMAD1/5/8 and STAT3 signaling were determined by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.

Results

SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and in parallel hepcidin mRNA expression were increased in anemia of chronic disease but significantly down-regulated in anemia of chronic disease with concomitant iron deficiency, either on the basis of phlebotomy or dietary iron restriction. Iron deficiency resulted in reduced bone morphogenetic protein-6 expression and impaired SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and trafficking, two key events for hepcidin transcription. Reduced SMAD1/5/8 activity in association with phlebotomy was paralleled by increased expression of the inhibitory factor, SMAD7, dietary iron restriction appeared to impair hepcidin transactivating SMAD pathways via reduction of membrane bound hemojuvelin expression.

Conclusions

This study evaluated hepcidin signaling pathways in anemia of chronic disease with/without concomitant iron deficiency in vivo. While iron deficiency in general decreased bone morphogenetic protein-6 expression, phlebotomy or dietary iron restriction inhibited inflammation driven SMAD1/5/8 mediated hepcidin formation by different pathways, indicating alternate hierarchic signaling networks as a function of the mode and kinetics of iron deficiency. Nonetheless, iron deficiency inducible regulatory pathways can reverse inflammation mediated stimulation of hepcidin expression.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^116j2MUD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Third, oral iron is well-established as a safe and effective treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of the lack of studies of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in a screen-detected population, the USPSTF, focused primarily on supplementation doses, with most included studies using doses between 20 and 50 mg of elemental iron. Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy, and the increased iron requirements, these doses are likely insufficient for adequate treatment and resulted in the lack of benefit observed. Future studies should evaluate the outcomes of iron supplementation in 3 distinct groups: participants who are iron replete, participants who are iron deficient without anemia, and participants with iron deficiency anemia. We recommend that future guidelines focused on the management of iron deficiency in pregnancy should include literature that differentiates between supplementation for prevention and treatment for diagnosed iron deficiency. In addition, future reviews should distinguish between supplemental and treatment doses of oral and intravenous iron and their impacts on outcomes. Guidance on appropriate supplementation (including formulation, dosage, and timing) is also necessary due to the lack of consensus and the variability in dosing strategies found in the literature.

As the rates of iron deficiency during pregnancy increase, so too may pregnancy morbidity. Given these significant implications for public health, it is critical to conduct additional studies to examine the advantages and disadvantages of screening for and treating subclinical iron deficiency. To harmonize future study findings, it is important to standardize the diagnostic cutoff values for iron deficiency across different populations and settings and clearly differentiate between indications for supplementation vs treatment. This will also help improve the identification and treatment of at-risk individuals, address disparities in care, and ultimately mitigate adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes.

### Anemia and iron deficiency in heart failure: current concepts and emerging therapies [^114xcoSD]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia and iron deficiency are important and common comorbidities that often coexist in patients with heart failure. Both conditions, together or independently, are associated with poor clinical status and worse outcomes. Whether anemia and iron deficiency are just markers of heart failure severity or whether they mediate heart failure progression and outcomes and therefore should be treated is not entirely clear. Treatment of anemia in patients with heart failure with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has been evaluated intensively during the past several years. Unfortunately, these agents did not improve outcomes but were associated with a higher risk of adverse events. Iron deficiency in patients with heart failure can be absolute, when total body iron is decreased, or functional, when total body iron is normal or increased but is inadequate to meet the needs of target tissues because of sequestration in the storage pool. Whereas iron replacement is appropriate in patients with anemia resulting from absolute iron deficiency, it has been unclear whether and how absolute or functional iron deficiency should be treated in nonanemic patients with heart failure. Recently, small studies found that administration of intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and absolute or functional iron deficiency with or without anemia improves symptoms and exercise capacity, but long-term outcomes and safety data are not yet available. In this review, we discuss the causes and pathogenesis of and treatment options for anemia and iron deficiency in patients with heart failure.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

### Hydrochlorothiazide… [^1113qNDD]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide, sold under the brand name Hydrodiuril among others, is a diuretic medication used to treat hypertension and swelling due to fluid build-up. Other uses include treating diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis and to decrease the risk of kidney stones in hypercalciuria. Hydrochlorothiazide is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase effectiveness. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide medication which inhibits reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions from the distal convoluted tubules of the kidneys, causing a natriuresis. This initially increases urine volume and lowers blood volume. It is believed to reduce peripheral vascular resistance. Potential side effects include poor kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, including low blood potassium, and, less commonly, low blood sodium, gout, high blood sugar, and feeling lightheaded with standing. Two companies, Merck & Co.

and Ciba Specialty Chemicals, state they discovered the medication which became commercially available in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic drug and is relatively affordable. In 2023, it was the sixteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 31 million prescriptions. Mechanism of action Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules, leading to increased excretion of sodium and water, along with potassium and hydrogen ions. This diuretic action reduces plasma volume, decreases cardiac output, and lowers blood pressure. Medical uses Hydrochlorothiazide is used for the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, symptomatic edema, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis. It is also used for the prevention of kidney stones in those who have high levels of calcium in their urine.

Multiple studies suggest hydrochlorothiazide could be used as initial monotherapy in people with primary hypertension; however, the decision should be weighed against the consequence of long-term adverse metabolic abnormalities. Doses of hydrochlorothiazide of 50 mg or less over four years reduced mortality and development of cardiovascular diseases better than high-dose hydrochlorothiazide and beta-blockers. A 2019 review supported equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy in hypertension, although thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness and safety profiles than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Low doses of hydrochlorothiazide as first‐line therapy for hypertension were found to reduce total mortality and cardiovascular disease events over a four-year study.

Hydrochlorothiazide appears be more effective than chlorthalidone in preventing heart attacks and strokes. Hydrochlorothiazide is less potent but may be more effective than chlorthalidone in reducing blood pressure. More robust studies are required to confirm which drug is superior in reducing cardiovascular events. Side effect profile for both drugs appear similar and are dose dependent. The combination of fixed-dose preparation such as losartan/hydrochlorothiazide has added advantages of a more potent antihypertensive effect with additional antihypertensive efficacy at the dose of 100 mg/25 mg when compared to monotherapy. Adverse effects
- Hypokalemia, or low blood levels of potassium are an occasional side effect.

1.7 Iron deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease

Iron deficiency affects between 13 and 90% of patients with IBD, depending on the population that is studied, eg, in‐ or outpatients, active or quiescent, as well as severity of the disease. 4 The main causes of iron deficiency in IBD arise from impaired GI iron absorption due to chronic inflammation, bowel resection (especially in Crohn's disease), disease triggered malnutrition and (mainly chronic) blood loss. 27 As with nephrologists, not all gastroenterologists fully appreciate the importance of managing iron deficiency. This may be because the role of iron deficiency anemia in IBD is not fully understood — evidence often depends on the selected patients from tertiary referral centers, including: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; hospitalized patients versus outpatients; or patients with and without surgical interventions. 27, 64 Iron deficiency can be easily corrected before the onset of anemia; however, the current evidence base focuses on iron deficiency anemia and its treatment. 22

Iron deficiency anemia is recognized as one of the most common complications and extra‐intestinal manifestations of IBD. However, over 50% of patients who are diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia are not treated. 65 In a recent survey, it was shown that approximately one‐third of patients diagnosed with IBD, who are unsure of their anemia status, do not discuss the possibility of developing iron deficiency anemia with healthcare professionals. 22 In this same survey, patients attributed weakness and chronic fatigue to both IBD and iron deficiency anemia. 22 Chronic fatigue associated with iron deficiency anemia may be debilitating and has been suggested to be the primary cause of impaired QoL in anemic IBD patients, to the same extent as other symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. 22, 27, 66 Notably, improvements in iron status with IV iron treatment have led to significantly improved QoL in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, according to IBD QoL questionnaire scores (P < 0.001) and SF‐36 physical (P < 0.001) and mental component (P = 0.024) scores. 18 Furthermore, changes in Hb levels (but not the activity of the underlying disease) were associated with significant changes in SF‐36 (P = 0.005) and IBD QoL questionnaire (P = 0.009) scores in IBD patients with iron deficiency anemia. 67

Pediatric heart failure (HF) — iron deficiency and anemia management includes that screening for anemia at the time of diagnosis of HF in children and at ongoing regular intervals is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence C), and screening for iron deficiency in children with HF is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence B). Intravenous iron supplementation is reasonable for the treatment of iron deficiency in pediatric patients with HF (Class IIa, Level of evidence B), and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to treat anemia in pediatric patients with HF is reasonable if anemia persists once iron stores are replete (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116yAa5W]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) present the official recommendations and highlight epidemiology, physiology, and evaluation considerations. U.S. epidemiology is detailed: In the United States in 1999–2000, 2% of men aged 16–69 years, 12% of women aged 12–49 years, and 9% of women aged 50–69 years were iron deficient, and 4% of women aged 20–49 years and 3% of women aged 50–69 years had IDA. The overall prevalence of IDA in North America in 2010 was estimated at 2.9%. Iron physiology notes that the normal total body iron content varies between 300 and 1,000 g and that about 1–2 mg of iron is lost daily through desquamation of skin and enteric cells or through minor blood loss. Gastrointestinal malignancy is the most serious potential cause, and in most adults without an obvious source of blood loss, evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract for a source of chronic blood loss or malabsorptive process is indicated. There is significant practice variability in the initial gastrointestinal evaluation of IDA. The next update for these guidelines is anticipated 3 years from publication (2023).

### Predictors of anemia in women of reproductive age: biomarkers reflecting inflammation and nutritional determinants of anemia (BRINDA) project [^1171zWVu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our results on factors associated with anemia were based on the analysis of individual-level biomarker data and, as such, differ from other recently-published multicountry analyses by Kassebaum et al. and Petry et al. Kassebaum et al. estimated the contribution of numerous risk factors to anemia by estimating the "hemoglobin shift" or impact of a risk factor on hemoglobin concentrations; systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used to estimate the hemoglobin shift for each risk factor. The authors showed that iron deficiency was the single greatest contributor to anemia globally but that other factors (e.g. malaria and helminths) also contributed substantially to the anemia burden in some regions. Although the authors used a rigorous approach, their model could not take into account the severity of iron deficiency in each country. Contrarily, the analysis by Petry et al. focused solely on the contribution of iron deficiency to anemia. By conducting a meta-analyses of 23 national-level data sets containing results of anemia and iron deficiency, they showed that, in nonpregnant WRA, 37% of anemia was attributable to iron deficiency, and the proportion of anemia that was attributable to iron deficiency was lowest (∼18%) in women in countries where anemia was a severe public health problem. Similar to the findings by Kassebaum et al. there was considerable variability in the proportion of anemia that was attributable to iron deficiency by region.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^112oTzg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of Monoferric for treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, actively-controlled clinical trials performed in a total of 3050 patients with IDA of different etiology. Trial 1 included patients with IDA who had intolerance to oral iron or who had had unsatisfactory response to oral iron or for whom there was a clinical need for rapid repletion of iron stores. Trial 2 included patients with IDA who had non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). In these two 8-Week trials, patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose. Monoferric was intravenously administered as a single dose of 1000 mg.

Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients Who Had Intolerance to Oral Iron or Who Had Unsatisfactory Response to Oral Iron

In Trial 1 (NCT02940886) 1512 adult patients with IDA caused by different etiologies, who had documented intolerance or lack of response to oral iron or screening hemoglobin (Hb) measurement sufficiently low to require repletion of iron stores were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose. Adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with baseline Hb ≤ 11 g/dL, TSAT < 20%, and s-ferritin < 100 ng/mL were eligible for enrollment. The median age of patients was 44 years (range 18–91) and 89% were women.

The efficacy of Monoferric was established based upon the change in Hb from baseline to week 8. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for change in Hb from baseline to Week 8 (Table 2).

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^1159a5aK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

Evaluation of related anemia — Major morbidities of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include symptomatic anemia and associated fatigue; the health care provider must also identify and treat any coexisting causes of anemia, and standard assessments should be performed to look for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if possible, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels, and bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

Bivariate associations between anemia and iron and vitamin A deficiencies

Only in the high-infection group was the anemia prevalence greater than the iron-deficiency prevalence. In the groups with moderate and low infection burdens, the prevalence of iron deficiency was nearly 3 times greater than the respective group's anemia prevalence. Despite the relatively higher prevalence of iron deficiency in the high-infection group, the contribution of iron deficiency to anemia, as measured via the proportion of anemic women with concurrent iron deficiency, increased with a declining infection burden from 35.1% in the high-infection group to 65.3% in the moderate-infection group, to 71.0% in the-low infection group (Figure 1). When calculated with the use of unadjusted ferritin concentrations, the proportion of anemic women with iron deficiency was markedly lower as 26.4%, 48.8%, and 46.4% in the groups with low, moderate, and high infection burdens, respectively (Supplemental Figure 2).

Anemia was most consistently associated with iron deficiency and vitamin A insufficiency (Table 3). The prevalence of anemia was higher in iron-deficient women in all countries and all infection groups. For the high-, moderate-, and low-infection groups, the anemia prevalence of iron-deficient women was 1.8, 3.7, and 10.7 times higher, respectively, than that of their iron-replete counterparts (Supplemental Table 2).

In multivariable models, longer EBF was significantly associated with ID, but not with IDA or anemia, although IDA patterns were similar to ID. Odds of all outcomes were also significantly increased among lower-birth-weight infants and males (vs. females). Odds of ID and IDA were significantly lower among infants whose mothers were employed as well as among infants whose mothers had completed a university education. Older infants had significantly higher odds of IDA and anemia. (Table 3.)

### Age and sex-based impacts of maternal iron deficiency on offspring's cognitive function and anemia: a systematic review [^114fGsK8]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a recognized global health concern, particularly impactful during pregnancy where the mother serves as the primary source of iron for the developing fetus. Adequate maternal iron levels are crucial for fetal growth and cognitive development. This review investigates the correlation between maternal iron deficiency and cognitive impairment and anemia in offspring, considering age and gender differentials. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were queried using keywords "maternal", "iron", "gender/sex", and "cognition". The review included studies on human and animal subjects where maternal iron deficiency was the exposure and offspring cognitive function and anemia were outcomes. Out of 1139 articles screened, fourteen met inclusion criteria. Twelve studies highlighted cognitive deficits in offspring of iron-deficient mothers, with females generally exhibiting milder impairment compared to males. Additionally, two studies noted increased anemia prevalence in offspring of iron-deficient mothers, particularly affecting males and younger individuals. The findings suggest that male offspring are at higher risk of both anemia and cognitive dysfunction during youth, while females face increased risks in adulthood. Thus, maternal iron deficiency elevates the likelihood of anemia and cognitive impairments in offspring, underscoring the importance of addressing maternal iron status for optimal child health.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2). These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

FIGURE 2
Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels. Case 1: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow up. At age 26 (6 years post‐diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range. Case 2: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32‐year‐old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non‐pregnancy periods. Case 3: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (totalling 5800 mg FS at 200 mg/dose) was administered every 2 months, maintaining ferritin > 500 μg/L for nearly a decade, with Hb within the reference range. Diagnosis of IRIDA was made at t = 5 when she was 41 years old. Ferritin and TSAT varied widely, likely due to chronic inflammation (CRP ~25 mg/L). In the final years (following t = 15), heavy menstrual bleeding led to a Hb decline, requiring additional IV iron therapy (totalling 1700 mg FCM).

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^116mQBMR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency among adults in the US?

Findings

This cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 8021 US adults estimated that absolute iron deficiency affects 14% and functional iron deficiency affects 15% of adults in the US. Absolute iron deficiency most often affects young women, whereas functional iron deficiency affects women and men of all ages.

Meaning

These findings suggest that absolute and functional iron deficiency represent common public health problems, and further research on the role of functional iron deficiency in adverse health outcomes and on iron deficiency screening strategies is needed.

### Cancer… [^1114r9nr]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

These infectious agents include Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HPV, Epstein–Barr virus, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus. Human immunodeficiency virus does not directly cause cancer but it causes immune deficiency that can magnify the risk due to other infections, sometimes up to several thousandfold. The benefits of screening for breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. More personalized therapies that harness a patient's immune system are emerging in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Palliative care is a medical specialty that delivers advanced pain and symptom management, which may be particularly important in those with advanced disease. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps.

Ulceration can cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such as coughing up blood, anemia or rectal bleeding, blood in the urine, or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen. Systemic symptoms Systemic symptoms may occur due to the body's response to the cancer. This may include fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or skin changes. Some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness, known as cachexia. Some cancers, such as Hodgkin's disease, leukemias, and liver or kidney cancers, can cause a persistent fever. Some systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known as paraneoplastic syndromes.

Common paraneoplastic syndromes include hypercalcemia, which can cause altered mental state, constipation and dehydration, or hyponatremia, which can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headaches, or seizures. Environmental or lifestyle factors that caused cancer to develop in an individual can be identified by analyzing mutational signatures from genomic sequencing of tumor DNA. For example, this can reveal if lung cancer was caused by tobacco smoke, if skin cancer was caused by UV radiation, or if secondary cancers were caused by previous chemotherapy treatment. Cancer is generally not a transmissible disease. Exceptions include rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors. However, transmissible infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, Epstein–Barr, HPV and AIDS infections, can contribute to the development of cancer.
- Human T-cell leukemia virus-1.
- Merkel cell polyomavirus Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in
- Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.
- Colibactin, a genotoxin associated with Escherichia coli infection. Some of these syndromes include: certain inherited mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer, among others. Statistically for cancers causing most mortality, the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer when a first-degree relative has been diagnosed with it is about 2. The corresponding relative risk is

1. 5 for lung cancer, and 1. 9 for prostate cancer. For breast cancer, the relative risk is 1. 8 with a first-degree relative having developed it at 50 years of age or older, and 3.

### An effective and efficient testing protocol for diagnosing iron-deficiency anemia preoperatively [^114zFjPX]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron-deficiency anemia is a common perioperative condition and increases perioperative morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis and treatment are important. This retrospective cohort study tested the hypothesis that a newly developed preprocedure evaluation protocol diagnoses more patients with iron-deficiency anemia than the traditional practice of obtaining a complete blood count followed by iron studies.

Methods

The preprocedure anemia evaluation is an order for a complete blood count and reflex anemia testing, which can be completed with a single patient visit. A hemoglobin concentration of 12g/dl or less with serum ferritin concentration less than 30ng/ml or transferrin saturation less than 20% defined iron-deficiency anemia. Northwestern Medicine's database was queried for preoperative clinic patients, age 16 to 89 yr, before (2015 to 2016) and after (2017 to 2018) protocol implementation. The proportion of patients diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia before and after the preprocedure anemia evaluation implementation was compared.

Results

Before implementing the protocol, 8,816 patients were screened with a traditional complete blood count. Subsequent iron studies at the providers' discretion diagnosed 107 (1.2%) patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Some patients were still screened with a complete blood count after implementing the protocol; 154 of 4,629 (3.3%) patients screened with a complete blood count and 738 of 2,828 (26.1%) patients screened with the preprocedure anemia evaluation were diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia. The preprocedure anemia evaluation identified a far larger proportion of patients with iron-deficiency anemia than did the traditional complete blood count when compared both before (relative risk [95% CI], 21.5 (17.6 to 26.2); P < 0.0001) and after (7.8 [6.6 to 9.3]; P < 0.0001) its implementation.

Conclusions

The preprocedure anemia evaluation improved identification of iron-deficiency anemia preoperatively. It is more effective and efficient, allowing anemia evaluation with a single patient visit.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^113dPd1h]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although a recent clinical trial in adults with iron deficiency anaemia showed no added benefit from ascorbic acid, this may not exclude its potential benefit in IRIDA. Moreover, reported cases showed varying outcomes with this combination therapy. Iron should be taken apart from certain foods (e.g. dairy products, fibres) and medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, calcium supplements, antacids), which can reduce iron availability by forming insoluble complexes. Alternate‐day dosing may reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which for iron‐deficient adult women has been described to last for approximately 24 h after iron intake.

In absolute iron deficiency anaemia, a weekly haemoglobin increase of approximately 0.8 g/dL is expected; however, in IRIDA, this haemoglobin increase in time is likely lower due to reduced iron availability. We define IRIDA non‐responders as those with less than a 1 g/dL haemoglobin increase after 4 weeks of oral therapy. As extended use appears more effective, oral supplementation should be continued for at least 3 months before considering switching to IV therapy. However, in practice, most patients diagnosed with IRIDA have already completed multiple unsuccessful attempts at oral iron supplementation. For these children, if they have been compliant with the prescribed therapy, reinitiating or extending oral therapy for 3 months is unnecessary. Instead, we recommend initiating IV iron therapy as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.
