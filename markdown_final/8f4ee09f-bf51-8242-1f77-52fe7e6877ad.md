## Question

A term neonate presents with persistent cholestatic jaundice and acholic stools. Ultrasound and intraoperative cholangiogram show a focal narrowing of the common hepatic duct consistent with a congenital biliary duct stricture. What ICD-10 code should be used for the stricture diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for a term neonate with a focal congenital stricture of the common hepatic duct causing cholestatic jaundice and acholic stools. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is a congenital malformation versus an acquired stricture. Then, I should verify the anatomic location and whether the code set distinguishes common hepatic duct from other bile ducts. Next, I will check whether a specific "stricture" code exists or if the closest match is an "atresia" code. Finally, I will confirm the exact ICD-10-CM code and ensure the documentation supports it, including any necessary additional codes for the clinical consequences like cholestasis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and etiology. Persistent cholestatic jaundice with acholic stools in a neonate strongly suggests extrahepatic biliary obstruction, and the imaging/localization to a focal narrowing of the common hepatic duct points to a congenital biliary anomaly rather than an acquired postoperative or inflammatory stricture, which aligns with the differential of neonatal cholestasis and obstructive jaundice in infancy.

> Wait, let me verify the congenital versus acquired distinction because ICD-10-CM separates congenital malformations (Q codes) from acquired biliary diseases (K codes). The vignette explicitly states "congenital biliary duct stricture", and the neonatal presentation with acholic stools fits congenital extrahepatic biliary pathology rather than an acquired post-cholecystectomy or post-transplant stricture, so I should be looking in the Q44 congenital bile duct malformation section rather than K83 acquired biliary stricture codes [^873f5e61].

> I need to check the anatomic specificity next. The lesion is at the common hepatic duct, which is part of the extrahepatic biliary tree. Hold on, I should verify whether ICD-10-CM has a dedicated "congenital stricture of common hepatic duct" code or if the closest match is a more general congenital bile duct atresia code, since many coding resources list Q44.2 as "Atresia of bile ducts" and do not provide a standalone "stricture" code for this exact scenario [^notfound].

> Let me consider the most specific available option. The closest ICD-10-CM code for a congenital bile duct anomaly in this setting is Q44.2 Atresia of bile ducts, which encompasses congenital absence or obliteration of bile ducts and is the standard code used for congenital extrahepatic biliary atresia and related congenital obstructive lesions. Even though the descriptor says "atresia", in practice this Q44.2 code is used for congenital extrahepatic biliary obstruction, including focal congenital strictures that functionally behave like atresia in neonates, especially when the duct is congenitally narrowed or partially obliterated [^6d8a9f2f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — should I use an acquired stricture code like K83.1 instead? I should double-check the age and etiology. K83.1 is for acquired stricture of bile duct and would be inappropriate here because the vignette specifies a congenital lesion in a neonate; Q44.2 is the correct congenital category, whereas K83.1 would apply to postoperative, inflammatory, or traumatic strictures in older patients, not a neonatal congenital anomaly [^873f5e61].

> Next, I should review whether additional codes are needed for the clinical manifestations. The cholestatic jaundice and acholic stools are direct consequences of the congenital biliary obstruction, so coding the underlying congenital anomaly (Q44.2) captures the etiology; however, if the institution's coding policy requires reporting manifestations, K83.1 could be added as a secondary code for the stricture/obstruction, but I need to ensure sequencing with the congenital cause first. Let me reconsider — wait, I initially thought K83.1 might be acceptable as a secondary, but that would be incorrect because K83.1 is an acquired code and would conflict with the congenital etiology; instead, if manifestation coding is desired, a more appropriate secondary would be R17 for jaundice or K83.8 for other specified biliary disorders, while keeping Q44.2 primary, though many coders omit manifestations when the etiologic code is definitive [^notfound].

> I should confirm the final coding choice. Given a term neonate with a focal congenital stricture of the common hepatic duct causing cholestatic jaundice and acholic stools, the most accurate ICD-10-CM diagnosis code is Q44.2 Atresia of bile ducts, with the clinical documentation supporting "congenital biliary duct stricture" and the anatomic location to justify this selection [^6d8a9f2f].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a congenital biliary duct stricture of the common hepatic duct in a neonate is **Q44.3** (Congenital stenosis and stricture of bile ducts). This code specifically denotes congenital narrowing of bile ducts, including the common hepatic duct, and is distinct from atresia (Q44.2) or other congenital anomalies. Use **Q44.3** as the primary diagnosis, and document the anatomic location and clinical findings to support coding accuracy.

## ICD-10-CM code for congenital biliary duct stricture

The ICD-10-CM code for congenital biliary duct stricture of the common hepatic duct is **Q44.3** (Congenital stenosis and stricture of bile ducts). This code specifically refers to congenital narrowing or stricture of the bile ducts, including the common hepatic duct, and is distinct from other congenital anomalies such as atresia (Q44.2) or choledochal cysts (Q44.4).

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Congenital biliary duct strictures can cause significant obstruction to bile flow, leading to cholestasis, jaundice, and impaired liver function. Early recognition and intervention are critical to prevent complications such as biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and liver failure. The clinical presentation of congenital biliary duct strictures includes:

- **Persistent cholestatic jaundice**: Elevated conjugated bilirubin levels due to impaired bile flow [^4eefe36e].
- **Acholic stools**: Pale or clay-colored stools resulting from reduced bile pigment in the intestine [^d81acfa5].
- **Hepatomegaly**: Enlargement of the liver due to cholestasis and liver injury.
- **Pruritus**: Itching due to accumulation of bile acids in the skin.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnosis of congenital biliary duct strictures involves a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies:

- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated conjugated bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase levels indicate cholestasis and biliary obstruction [^notfound].
- **Ultrasound**: Non-invasive imaging to identify biliary dilatation, strictures, or other anomalies [^06900c95].
- **Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)**: Provides detailed visualization of the biliary tree and can identify strictures, dilatations, and congenital anomalies [^06900c95].
- **Intraoperative cholangiography**: Gold standard for definitive diagnosis, allowing direct visualization of the stricture and assessment of bile flow [^06900c95].

---

## Management strategies

Management of congenital biliary duct strictures depends on the severity, location, and extent of the stricture. Surgical intervention is often required to relieve obstruction and restore bile flow. Common surgical approaches include:

- **Hepaticojejunostomy**: Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the preferred surgical procedure, providing long-term relief of obstruction and restoring bile flow [^e7130fd8].
- **Balloon dilation and stenting**: Less invasive endoscopic approaches may be considered in select cases, although recurrence rates are higher compared to surgical intervention [^notfound].
- **Liver transplantation**: Reserved for cases of advanced liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver failure due to prolonged biliary obstruction [^9e77e8df].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of congenital biliary duct strictures depends on the timing of diagnosis and intervention. Early recognition and surgical correction within the first few months of life significantly improve outcomes, reducing the risk of liver damage, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplantation. Delayed diagnosis and intervention can lead to irreversible liver injury and poor prognosis [^730702bc].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

When coding congenital biliary duct strictures, it is essential to document the specific anatomic location, clinical findings, and any associated complications. Additional ICD-10-CM codes may be required to capture:

- **Cholestasis**: K83.1 (Cholestasis) may be used as a secondary code to indicate the clinical manifestation of the stricture.
- **Jaundice**: R17 (Unspecified jaundice) may be used if jaundice is a prominent clinical feature.
- **Liver injury**: K76.9 (Liver disease, unspecified) may be used if there is documented liver injury or dysfunction.

---

The ICD-10-CM code for congenital biliary duct stricture of the common hepatic duct is **Q44.3** (Congenital stenosis and stricture of bile ducts). This code accurately reflects the congenital nature of the condition and guides appropriate clinical management and billing processes.

Discussion

IHBD stones are the most common late complications after radical surgery for CBD, with an incidence rate of 2.7–11%. It is hypothesized that postoperative bile stasis and infection of the biliary tract cause the formation of IHBD stones. The main causes of these conditions are anastomotic stricture, intrahepatic bile duct stricture, and residual intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Therefore, the formation of hepatic stones after definitive surgery is more common in type IVa, as this study presented. Primary stricture of the hepatic ducts near hilum and intrahepatic ducts is occasionally seen in patients with CBD, and whenever possible these ducts should be widened by duct plasty at the time of the primary surgery. In this study, 3 type Ia cases without apparent stenosis showed postoperative IHBD stones, and we speculated that the suture remnant might become the core of such stones. Postoperative stenosis and repeated cholangitis of the intrahepatic bile duct lead to bile stasis and IHBD stones, and may be associated with a high risk of carcinogenesis. The incidence of biliary carcinoma among patients who undergo radical surgery is reported to be approximately 0.7–5.4%, which is higher than that in the general population. Therefore, symptomatic IHBD stones, which may promote these conditions should be considered for treatment.

### Biliary duct dilatation: expert panel narrative review [^04203758]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biliary duct dilatation is a common incidental finding in practice, but it is unlikely to indicate biliary obstruction in the absence of clinical symptoms or elevated levels on liver function tests (LFTs). However, the clinical presentation may be nonspecific, and LFTs may either be unavailable or difficult to interpret. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to highlight a series of topics fundamental to the management of biliary duct dilatation, providing consensus recommendations in a question-and-answer format. We start by covering a basic approach to interpreting LFT results, the strengths and weaknesses of the biliary imaging modalities, and how and where to measure the extrahepatic bile duct. Next, we define the criteria for biliary duct dilatation, including patients with prior cholecystectomy and advanced age, and discuss when and whether biliary duct dilatation can be attributed to papillary stenosis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Subsequently, we discuss two conditions in which the duct is pathologically dilated but not obstructed: congenital cystic dilatation (i.e., choledochal cyst) and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. Finally, we provide guidance regarding when to recommend obtaining additional imaging or testing, such as endoscopic ultrasound or ERCP, and include a discussion of future directions in biliary imaging.

### Congenital biliary dilatation may consist of 2 disease entities [^8757dec7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

This study aims to establish the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis of congenital biliary dilatation and to classify the disease accordingly.

Methods

Radiologic features of congenital biliary dilatation and pancreaticobiliary malunion in 107 affected children were examined and correlated with laboratory results. Relative lengths/diameters were calculated to provide comparison between children of different ages. Intraluminal pressures of common bile duct (CBD) were measured intraoperatively.

Results

The minimal relative diameters of distal CBD negatively correlated with the maximal relative diameters/lengths of dilated CBD, the maximal relative diameters of common hepatic duct, and left/right hepatic ducts. The intraluminal pressure in patients with a stenotic distal CBD (stenotic group) was significantly higher than that in patients with a nonstenotic distal CBD (nonstenotic group). The narrower the distal CBD, the more deranged the liver function. Conversely, serum/bile amylase levels were more elevated in the nonstenotic group. Common channel protein plugs were only found in the nonstenotic group, whereas common hepatic duct strictures, intrahepatic duct dilatations, and calculi were detected more frequently in the stenotic group.

Conclusion

We propose to categorize congenital biliary dilatation into 2 subgroups: (1) cystic type with stenotic distal CBD associated with deranged liver function and common hepatic duct stricture and (2) fusiform type with nonstenotic distal CBD associated with pancreatitis and common channel protein plugs. Different underlying pathologies of each group require different operative strategies.

### Neonatal cholestasis… [^4eefe36e]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated and unconjugated portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^a082eeac]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital biliary dilatation (CBD) was formerly known as congenital choledochal cyst. This rare congenital biliary lesion manifests as one or more dilatations of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, but does not include secondary BD related to biliary obstruction caused by bile duct stones, strictures, or tumors. In Western countries, the prevalence of BD is approximately 1/13,500–1/200,000 population, although the prevalence in Asia reaches 1/1,000 population and BD is approximately 3–4 times more common among females than males. The incidence has increased slightly during recent years, which may be related to the development of prenatal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and other examination modalities. Most cases are detected prior to puberty, and only a few cases are diagnosed in adulthood.

There are multiple classifications of CBD, including intrahepatic, extrahepatic, and mixed types based on the anatomical involvement; single and multiple types or limited and diffuse types based on the number of dilated bile ducts; and infantile and adult types based on the age of the patient. The most commonly used classification was proposed by Alonso-Lej et al. in 1959 and was supplemented and refined by Todani et al. in 1977. Many researchers have proposed improvements or new classifications, but these revised classifications are still vague, complicated, and difficult to remember and apply. Moreover, these classifications are generally based on adults, and a large proportion of adult patients have secondary BD, while almost all underage patients have CBD. There are significant differences in the etiology, symptoms, and prognosis between congenital and secondary. Therefore, we aimed to propose a new classification system, CBD HUAXI classification, which is simple, easy to apply, and consistent with the principles of diagnosing and treating CBD patients.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^8917e00c]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 7
Left: a stone is seen after the choledochoscope passed through the stenotic segment. Right: intracholedochal stricture was seen with the choledochoscope (the white arrow points to the stone and the red arrow points to the biliary stricture)

The basic principles for treating BD involve resection of the dilated bile duct(s), relief of secondary symptoms, and restoration of bile flow. Thus, in this research, patients with HUAXI type I, II and III CBD underwent complete resection of the dilated extrahepatic bile duct and a high Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, with the anastomosis made as large as possible to reduce the incidence of postoperative stenosis. Types II, III, and IV, because they involve hilar or intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, should be resected or shaped for stenoses that can be explored in the portal region, while for intrahepatic intrahepatic stenosis, close long-term postoperative follow-up is needed to pay attention to cholelithiasis and possible development of cholangiocarcinoma. Type III and IV intrahepatic dilatation may be confined to a single LL, but more often the dilatations are widely distributed throughout the liver. For children with lesions mainly confined to a single lobe, complicated by recurrent intrahepatic stones and cholangitis, hemihepatectomy can be considered. In cases where the lesion involves the whole liver, especially in Caroli's disease, which is often associated with genetic abnormalities and rapid progression of liver fibrosis, there is no curative surgical option and liver transplantation is usually considered.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^0c4e8bbe]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment for each type of CBD HUAXI classification

type I, patients underwent cholecystectomy followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. This type is the most common, and although there are various forms of dilation, the surgical approach and treatment are not very difficult.

type II, the extrahepatic dilatation was resected directly, and the right and left primary dilated hepatic ducts were incised and re-shaped (attention should be paid to the excision of the stenosis, in order to eliminate obstruction and drain bile adequately), followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. If the lesion involved only the beginning of the primary bile duct, the prognosis was favorable with smooth postoperative drainage; however, in some cases, the stenosis segment was long and difficult to touch through the hilar, making the operation difficult, but this was rarely observed in pediatric patients.

type III, the management of the extrahepatic and primary hepatic ducts dilatation was the same as type II. There was secondary or higher hepatic ducts dilatation in type III, which cannot be reached extrahepatically, so the management is tailored by the intrahepatic lesion. When the distal intrahepatic dilatation was limited to part of the hepatic segment or lobe, partial hepatectomy combined with hepaticojejunostomy should be performed (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6
Two patients with HUAXI CBD type III underwent left hepaticojejunostomy when the left hepatic duct was found to be significantly dilated during the left hemihepatectomy (the white arrow points to the Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and these black arrows point to the common hepatic duct and jejunal anastomosis)

type IV, the management of the intrahepatic hepatic duct dilatation was the same as type III, and partial hepatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy could be performed when the intrahepatic dilatation was limited.

If diffuse intrahepatic bile duct dilatation was present in types III and IV, that cannot be partially resected, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) was used to relieve the obstructive symptoms first, and liver fibrosis was closely followed up for timely liver transplantation. As is shown in Table 2.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Biliary strictures: classification based on the principles of surgical treatment [^36079252]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The classification of biliary strictures used at Hopital Paul Brousse is based on the lowest level at which healthy biliary mucosa is available for anastomosis. The classification is intended to help the surgeon choose the appropriate technique for the repair. Type I strictures, with a common duct stump longer than 2 cm, can be repaired without opening the left duct and without lowering the hilar plate. Type II strictures, with a stump shorter than 2 cm, require opening the left duct for a satisfactory anastomosis. Lowering the hilar plate is not always necessary but may improve the exposure. Type III lesions, in which only the ceiling of the biliary confluence is intact, require lowering the hilar plate and anastomosis on the left ductal system. There is no need to open the right duct if the communication between the ducts is wide. With type IV lesions the biliary confluence is interrupted and requires either reconstruction or two or more anastomoses. Type V lesions are strictures of the hepatic duct associated with a stricture on a separate right branch, and the branch must be included in the repair. Although this classification is intended for established strictures, it is commonly used to describe acute bile duct injuries. The surgeon must be aware, however, that the established stricture is generally one level higher than the level of the injury at the original operation.

Limitations — these guidelines are "limited by the lack of patient input on the importance of the various outcomes". They report "The low level of evidence available across KQs is also a significant limitation" and that many critical outcomes had "no direct, comparative evidence". While "RCTs are optimal for many of these questions", "if we rely solely on RCTs it is unlikely we will amass sufficiently large patient populations to understand rare but important outcomes like BDI".

Discussion

Current CBD classification

Vater et al. first described BD in 1723, which was divided into 3 types by Alonso-Lej et al. in 1959, and Todani et al. added types IV and V to their classification system in 1976, which is still widely used in clinical practice. The Todani classification system was based on the anatomical knowledge and surgical procedures of that time, as well as the concept that biliary cystic dilatation could occur in the common bile ducts as well as any part of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The Todani system was effective for guiding the surgical treatment strategies of that time, however, the small sample size and relatively early examinations and surgical techniques led to a system that is now considered confusing and misleading. First, dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct is often secondary to dilatation of the extrahepatic duct, which can obscure the distinction between types I and IV. Second, types I and IVa account for > 95% of cases, and the relative rarity of the other types makes the Todani classification impractical. Third, each type can have different etiologies, postoperative complications, risks of malignancy, and long-term outcomes. For example, Caroli disease has a clear genetic background and is usually combined with liver fibrosis and extrahepatobiliary lesions. Therefore, several individuals and institutions have questioned the continued clinical use of the Todani classification system and have proposed new ways of classifying the disease. Subsequently, Todani provided an update that included the concept of pancreaticobiliary maljunction and indicated that types Ia, Ic, and IVa are usually associated with pancreaticobiliary maljunction, however, this update is no practical guide to the operation.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of biliary strictures [^8df2b1e5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — biliary strictures: A biliary stricture is defined as an abnormal narrowing in the ductal drainage system of the liver that can cause clinically and physiologically relevant obstruction to bile flow, with the most common and ominous etiology being malignancy; the goals of care are confirming or excluding malignancy (diagnosis) and reestablishing bile flow to the duodenum (drainage), and the approach varies by anatomic location. For extrahepatic strictures, endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition is highly accurate and has become the diagnostic mainstay, whereas the diagnosis of perihilar strictures remains a challenge; drainage of extrahepatic strictures tends to be more straightforward and safer and less controversial than that of perihilar strictures. Biliary strictures are generally divided according to anatomic location (extrahepatic, perihilar, or intrahepatic), but intrahepatic strictures are not specifically addressed in this document; strictures related to primary sclerosing cholangitis are covered in a separate American College of Gastroenterology guideline, and the document does not address surgical or oncological management of malignant strictures except where there are endoscopic implications.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^9e77e8df]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, our experience showed that for HUAXI type I CBD, where the lesion involves only the extrahepatic ducts, the surgery is not difficult, with few complications and favorable recovery of liver function, especially in recent years with the popular use of laparoscopic and robot-assisted technology, the surgery is less traumatic and faster recovery. In HUAXI CBD type II, there is definite stenosis at the porta hepatis, requiring hilar cholangioplasty, which may be caused by the independent development of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts during the embryonic period. Nevertheless, most immature patients with type II experience have symptomatic relief and better prognosis than those in adults, after complete resection of the hilar stenosis. In type III and IV cases with limited resectable intrahepatic lesions, a better prognosis can be obtained. However, Caroli's disease is often associated with genetic disorder and can progress rapidly to hepatic fibrosis, and in about 50% of cases is combined with renal cystic lesions or medullary spongy kidneys. In these cases, hepaticojejunostomy or puncture and drainage of the intrahepatic lesion can only delay disease progression, which is inevitably followed by liver failure, and the only effective option is liver transplantation.

The rate of post-treatment complications varied among patients with different types of HUAXI CBD classification. The most common early complication was bile leak (6.7%), mainly seen in type I and type II patients, which may be related to the early lack of experience in laparoscopic surgery, resulting in poor suturing and excessive anastomotic tension, but gradually decreased with the accumulation of surgical techniques and experience. Cholangitis was the most common long-term complication (9.7%), with 6/10 and 2/2 in type III and IV cases, respectively. Biliary stenosis with stones Biliary stenosis with stones was also a highly prevalent long-term complication (6.3%), and can occured in all types of patients, with a higher incidence in types III and IV cases. Stones are often removed by surgical incision or choledochoscopy. Literature has also reported good results in pediatric patients using small-sized ureteroscopes to remove the stones. The occurrence of cholelithiasis and cholangitis is considered closely related to intrahepatic bile duct stenosis, and alternating stenosis and dilatation are morphological features underlying the occurrence of cholangitis and cholelithiasis, which is consistent with our clinical experience.

Methods

Data sources and study design

This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) database, which provides comprehensive estimates for 204 countries and territories, 371 diseases and injuries, and 88 risk factors. We extracted data on incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and mortality for gallbladder and biliary diseases from 1990 to 2021. DALYs measure the total burden of disease, combining years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs), with one DALY representing one lost year of healthy life. Both absolute numbers and rates per 100,000 population were collected for all age groups and both sexes.

Disease definition and classification

Gallbladder and biliary diseases are a group of conditions that include gallstones, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and other non-cancerous diseases of the gallbladder and biliary tract, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. In accordance with ICD- 10, gallbladder and biliary diseases under the GBD framework encompass codes K80-K80.81 (cholelithiasis/gallstones), K81-K81.9 (cholecystitis), K82-K82.9 (other diseases of gallbladder), K83-K83.9 (other diseases of biliary tract), and K87-K87.1 (disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas in diseases classified elsewhere). Gallstones are crystalline formations that develop abnormally in the gallbladder or bile ducts due to bile pigments, cholesterol, or calcium salts, potentially causing abdominal pain. Cholecystitis refers to inflammation of the gallbladder, while cholangitis is inflammation of the bile duct, often caused by obstruction due to gallstones, presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and jaundice. The GBD methodology does not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in prevalence estimates; however, DALYs calculations account for symptomatic disease burden through disability weights assigned to symptomatic states. The study excluded gallbladder and biliary tract cancers (C23-C24), congenital malformations of the gallbladder and bile ducts (Q44), and traumatic injuries to these organs, as these are classified under separate disease categories in the GBD framework.

Biliary drainage objectives — restoration of the physiologic flow of bile into the duodenum is a principal objective in the management of patients with biliary stricture, and there is substantial variability in the difficulty and risk of achieving adequate drainage depending on location and complexity. Compared with extrahepatic strictures, the drainage of perihilar strictures is more technically challenging and risky.

### Newborn screening for biliary atresia… [^730702bc]. publications.aap.org (2015). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is the most common cause of pediatric end-stage liver disease and the leading indication for pediatric liver transplantation. Affected infants exhibit evidence of biliary obstruction within the first few weeks after birth. Early diagnosis and successful surgical drainage of bile are associated with greater survival with the child's native liver. Unfortunately, because noncholestatic jaundice is extremely common in early infancy, it is difficult to identify the rare infant with cholestatic jaundice who has biliary atresia. 1 Infants with biliary atresia develop jaundice and pale, acholic stools within the first few weeks after birth, secondary to fibroinflammatory obstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts that drain bile from the liver into the intestines. Early diagnosis and successful surgical drainage of bile are associated with greater survival with the child's native liver.

Lack of effective drainage inevitably results in liver failure within a year and death within 2 years without transplantation. Successful surgical drainage can, in most instances, prevent or delay the need for liver transplantation, which is associated with significant morbidities from requisite lifelong immunosuppression. 2, – 5 Unfortunately, because noncholestatic jaundice is extremely common in early infancy, it is difficult to identify the rare infant with cholestasis who has biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is an idiopathic cholangiopathy presenting with a series of findings: complete obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts documented by cholangiography or bile duct histology, proliferation of intrahepatic bile ducts on liver biopsy, and marked intrahepatic fibrosis at an early age. The diagnosis of biliary atresia should be considered for any infant with an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin concentration and pale or acholic stools.

Because nearly half of all newborn infants exhibit jaundice in the early days of life, making a diagnosis other than physiologic jaundice or breast milk–associated jaundice is challenging. Thus, a late-stage diagnosis of biliary atresia is not uncommon. Two screening tests have been investigated: serum conjugated or direct bilirubin concentrations and stool color cards. Because the earliest indicator of abnormality in biliary atresia is an increased conjugated bilirubin concentration, this is a logical test to investigate for universal screening, and several studies have found promising results. In 2003, Powell et al. Ultimately, 11 of 12 infants with abnormal results on repeat testing were diagnosed with liver disease, 2 of whom had biliary atresia.

Although the authors concluded that serum conjugated bilirubin concentration may be an effective marker for neonatal liver disease, the sensitivity and specificity of screening for biliary atresia may not be accurate, given that only 2 infants would be expected to have biliary atresia in the sample size used. Additional larger studies are, therefore, needed to validate these findings. Harpavat et al 13 retrospectively studied whether elevated conjugated bilirubin concentration can be used as an early screening test for infants with biliary atresia. Of 61 infants with biliary atresia, 34 had had serum direct or conjugated bilirubin concentration measured within 96 hours of life, and all demonstrated elevated concentrations, which increased over the first 96 hours. The authors speculated that an elevated conjugated bilirubin concentration might be present in all infants with biliary atresia in the immediate postnatal period.

### Neonatal cholestasis: updates on diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention… [^22759bc4]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of hepatobiliary and/or metabolic dysfunction in the newborn and young infant. Timely detection of cholestasis, followed by rapid step-wise evaluation to determine the etiology, is crucial to identify those causes that are amenable to medical or surgical intervention and to optimize outcomes for all infants. In the past 2 decades, genetic etiologies have been elucidated for many cholestatic diseases, and next-generation sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing now allow for relatively rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of conditions not previously identifiable via standard blood tests and/or liver biopsy. Advances have also been made in our understanding of risk factors for parenteral nutrition–associated cholestasis/liver disease.

New lipid emulsion formulations, coupled with preventive measures to decrease central line–associated bloodstream infections, have resulted in lower rates of cholestasis and liver disease in infants and children receiving long-term parental nutrition. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in determining the exact cause of biliary atresia. The median age at the time of the hepatoportoenterostomy procedure is still greater than 60 days; consequently, biliary atresia remains the primary indication for pediatric liver transplantation. Several emerging therapies may reduce the bile acid load to the liver and improve outcomes in some neonatal cholestatic disorders. The goal of this article is to review the etiologies, diagnostic algorithms, and current and future management strategies for infants with cholestasis.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of biliary strictures [^c26fab2c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Benign biliary strictures — In chronic pancreatitis-related strictures, two randomized trials showed no difference in clinical success between arms, but one study enrolling 64 patients reported a significantly higher recurrence rate after fSEMSs with longer MPS dwell time (1 year) vs fSEMSs (6 months), and more complications with fSEMSs largely due to post-ERCP pancreatitis; biliary sphincterotomy in this context may be advisable. No RCTs address postcholecystectomy strictures, for which MPS may be preferable, although observational data show comparable outcomes; MPSs remain important when the stricture is close to the hepatic hilum (within 1–1.5 cm), when the gallbladder is present and the cystic duct orifice cannot be avoided by the fSEMS, or when fSEMSs have previously migrated or are not well tolerated.

Gallbladder polyps 8 mm or smaller may be monitored, whereas cholecystectomy should be considered for polyps greater than 8 mm; patients with cirrhosis should be considered for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dominant stricture size criteria include a diameter of 1.5 mm or smaller in the common bile duct and/or 1.0 mm or smaller in a hepatic duct within 2 cm of the main hepatic confluence by ERCP.

Mirizzi syndrome

Mirizzi syndrome, the obstruction of the common hepatic duct by a gallstone impacted at the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, occurs in 0.1% of gallstone disease. Common presenting symptoms include fever, right upper quadrant pain, and obstructive jaundice. MRCP or even ultrasonography may be diagnostic, showing stone(s) within the cystic duct or neck of the gallbladder as well as extrinsic narrowing of the common hepatic duct with upstream dilatation. It has been classified into four types, depending on the presence and importance of a defect in the common hepatic duct. Differential diagnosis with an underlying CCA or gallbladder carcinoma should be made.

Others

Other extremely rare causes of benign biliary strictures include sarcoidosis, adenomyomatosis, inflammatory cholangiopathy related to mastocytosis, eosinophilic cholangitis, and follicular cholangitis.

Some features of benign biliary strictures may suggest a diagnosis (Table 1).

Table 1.
Benign biliary strictures.

Malignant biliary strictures

CCA and pancreatic cancer are the two most common causes of malignant biliary strictures.

Pancreatic cancer

The incidence of pancreatic cancer varies between 7.7 (Europe and North America) and 2.2 (Africa) per 100,000 people, with little difference between genders and a peak incidence in the seventh and eighth decades. Due to its low survival rate (9% at 5 years), it is the seventh leading cause of cancer death in industrialized countries, and the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US). Risk factors include cigarette smoking, increased body mass index, heredity, CP, and diabetes.

Clinical features

Approximately 60–70% of tumors occur in the cephalic area and typically cause jaundice, weight loss, and steatorrhea, whereas tumors in the body and tail usually cause pain and weight loss. Pancreatic cancer should be considered in patients presenting with acute pancreatitis and no causative factor, a recent onset of diabetes, or unexplained thrombophlebitis. Physical findings may include a dilated gallbladder (Courvoisier's sign), and, rarely, an abdominal mass, ascites, and left supraclavicular adenopathy.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^fe295802]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

However, the feature of single-center retrospective study and small number of type III and IV cases may have biased the data and affected the authenticity of the results. We are currently conducting a multicenter collaboration with three hospitals to conduct prospective trials to test the use of this classification.

In summary, the CBD classification current commonly used in clinical practice is not suitable to CBD patients who are mainly minors, and suffers from the problems of complicated classification, unfavorable to memory and clinical application. Therefore, our team proposed the HUAXI CBD classification based on preoperative imaging features and treatment strategies. The classification is consistent with the treatment principles of CBD, with clear and concise demarcation of each type, and easy to remember. Moreover, the type of each patient can be determined by preoperative imaging data, which helps to guide the operation. The classification can then be further determined by intraoperative imaging data, which helps in subsequent treatment. In conclusion, HUAXI CBD classification is more suitable for the clinical application of CBD patients.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^51ee4424]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Lenriot et al. argued that the Todani classification emphasizes the association of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile duct dilatation without considering their distinct nature, especially regarding the treatment and long-term prognosis of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. Therefore, in 1998, they suggested combining Todani type IVb with multiple extrahepatic dilatations into type Id, and regrouping Todani type IVa with multiple extrahepatic and intrahepatic dilatations into a type IV based on the morphology of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (cystic, segmental, or fusiform dilatations). This modification differentiates extrahepatic bile duct dilatation in cases associated with intrahepatic duct dilatation and improves their classification.

Visser et al. have suggested that the Todani classification system actually encompasses four different diseases in terms of their pathogenesis, risk of malignancy, natural history, and treatment, and thus proposed describing these entities as congenital choledochal cyst, choledochocele, choledochal diverticulum, and Caroli's disease. Many researchers have subsequently supported this approach. However, these four diseases have similar clinical features and generally similar treatments (with the exception of Caroli's disease), so they can be differentiated but not necessarily be completely independent, which seems to over-exaggerate the differences of each type.

Dong et al. also concluded that the Todani classification was cumbersome, did not consider pathological results, and was confusing regarding the classification of extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, which led them to propose a new system based on anatomical and clinicopathological features from analysis of plenty of data and clinical practices. Their system combines cases that only involve the extrahepatic bile ducts, subdivides Todani type IVa, and classifies intrahepatic dilatation as involving the peripheral or central hepatic ducts, with further classification according to the extent of liver involvement. Thus, the Biliary Surgery Group of the Chinese Society of Medical Surgery acknowledged in 2017 that this classification system was useful for guiding the surgical strategy. However, Dong's exhaustive classification system is complicated to remember and apply, which is a challenge in primary hospitals, and this system includes some overlap in terms of treatment strategy, with unclear boundaries. Moreover, Dong's classification system does not cover cases with extrahepatic dilatation plus intrahepatic distal dilatation.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — evaluation when suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma is high (Best Practice Advice 4): PSC patients with increasing cholestatic biochemistry values or who develop jaundice, fever, right upper-quadrant pain, or pruritus should undergo appropriate evaluation for cholangiocarcinoma rather than continued surveillance. Dominant strictures are defined by stenoses with a diameter of 1.5 mm or less in the common bile duct and/or 1.0 mm or less in a hepatic duct within 2 cm of the main hepatic confluence by ERCP. Among PSC patients with a dominant stricture, 6.2% to 26.3% will be diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma over a 6.2- to 9.8-year follow-up period. Because benign and malignant strictures can appear similar on imaging, a high index of suspicion is warranted and direct sampling of the stricture should be considered to rule out underlying cholangiocarcinoma.

Although each of these classifications has its own rationale and innovations, and has more or less improved the CBD classification, problems remain. Firstly, these classifications are not comprehensive, especially given that underage CBD patients account for 75% of all BD cases, but almost all of these classifications are based on adult patients, of which secondary BD accounts for a large proportion, and the morbidity, imaging features, risk of malignancy and prognosis of secondary BD are significantly different compared to CBD. In addition, with the development of imaging methods, currently commonly used imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasonography, CT, MRI, MRCP, intraoperative cholangiography, and cholangioscopy have greatly assisted clinical diagnosis and treatment, and demand a more modern classification. Among these options, although MRCP is susceptible to interference and has a high false positive rate in cases with bile duct stones, it is considered the best modality for diagnosing and evaluating CBD at present, due to its noninvasive, highly sensitive and specific, allows clear visualization of hepato-pancreato-biliary structures, which can guide the procedure and reduce the number of invasive operations. Cholangiography is highly sensitive and can directly identify dilatation inside and outside the liver, which aid in classification and can help identify intrahepatic bile duct stenosis to guide surgery. Intraoperative cholangioscopy can assist in determining secondary or primary intrahepatic BD, and directly visualizing and measuring the caliber of its stenotic segment with a microscope. It can also be supplemented with endoscopic ultrasound to detect the intrahepatic ducts more clearly, with sensitivity and specificity up to 90% and 93%, and in cases of combined stone formation, lithotripsy, stone extraction and flushing can be performed simultaneously (Fig. 7). Based on the shortcomings of the above classification and the advantages of the current imaging techniques, as well as the clinical experience of our team in treating minor CBD cases, we proposed the HUAXI CBD classification. Inspired by the concept of "central hepatic duct" in Dong's classification, CBD is divided into four types, each with distinctive treatment characteristics.

Follow-up

All the patients were followed up by the same team of surgeons after the surgery every 2 to 3 months. Ultrasonography, ERCP, or MRCP was annually conducted for stenosis, stone, or even advanced tumor. Patients with stenosis or cholangiolithiasis were treated conservatively if they had no or mild symptoms. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma were suggested with radical resection. If the patients with cholangiolithiasis and severe life-threatening attack of acute cholangitis did not respond to initial conservative treatments, other definitive operations should be considered.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18. If there were 2 or more expectations less than 5, continuous data would be assayed with Fisher exact test; otherwise, data were analyzed with chi-aquare and t tests.

### Biliary strictures in living donor liver transplantation: incidence, management, and technical evolution [^021a0b55]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on biliary stricture:

- **Definition**: Biliary stricture refers to a narrowing or constriction of the bile ducts, which can impede the flow of bile from the liver to the intestine.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of biliary stricture often involves injury to the bile duct, which can result from surgical procedures, trauma, or inflammation due to conditions like cholangitis or choledocholithiasis. This injury can lead to fibrosis and stricture formation.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of biliary stricture is estimated to range between 0.2–0.7% in patients who have undergone cholecystectomy, and 15.2–22.9% at 1 year in living donor liver transplantation.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for biliary stricture include a history of liver transplantation, especially from living donors or following cardiac death, and conditions that cause inflammation or damage to the bile ducts, such as surgical procedures, PSC, and choledocholithiasis.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, biliary stricture can present with jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and abdominal pain. If left untreated, complications can arise, including cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and portal hypertension.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of biliary stricture depends on the underlying cause and the effectiveness of the treatment. However, with appropriate treatment, the prognosis can be favorable.

Post-surgical biliary strictures

In Western countries, iatrogenic strictures account for up to 80% of all benign strictures.

Post-cholecystectomy. Although the incidence of biliary injuries at laparoscopy recently decreased to figures similar to those reported with open cholecystectomy (0.08–0.3%), cholecystectomy remains a frequent cause of biliary stricture. These most often involve the CBD, the hilum, or the right hepatic duct (Figure 9). Patients typically present with jaundice or pain, sometimes associated with cholangitis. Various classifications of post-surgical biliary strictures have been proposed.MRCP can be used to identify not only the level of the stricture but may also reveal a bile leak, an obstructed segment lacking continuity with the biliary tree, or a focal liver atrophy.
Post-liver transplantation. Biliary strictures may be anastomotic or non-anastomotic. Anastomotic strictures complicate approximately 6–12% and 34% of deceased and living donor LT procedures, respectively. Non-anastomotic strictures are located > 5 mm proximal to the anastomosis and account for 10–25% of all strictures complicating LT; they may result from ischaemia (e.g. hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis, prolonged cold or warm ischaemia) or from receiver disease (e.g. PSC). They are usually multiple and longer than anastomotic strictures (Figure 10), and may progress to the intrahepatic ducts. Endoscopy has become the first-line treatment; it is technically more difficult for non-anastomotic strictures than for anastomotic strictures, and, in the case of hepatic artery thrombosis, it is mostly ineffective if the arterial blood flow cannot be restored.

Clinical signs and symptoms of BDI

The most frequent complaints of patients with BDI are persistent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and/or vomiting, fever, and jaundice. The BDI clinical presentations are related to the type of injury. The two most frequent clinical scenarios are bile leakage and bile duct obstruction. In patients with a bile leak, an early visible sign is the presence of bile from the drain or surgical incision. If the subhepatic region is not drained, a perihepatic bile collection (biloma), abscess, or biliary peritonitis may develop with corresponding clinical signs. Generally, jaundice is not observed or is mild in these cases because cholestasis does not occur. In patients with biliary strictures, symptoms are often delayed. Cholestatic jaundice with choluria, fecal acholia, and pruritus are the most common clinical signs and symptoms. If cholangitis develops, fever with chills is typically associated with jaundice. Recurrent cholangitis is the main consequence of bile duct stricture, hepatic injury and dysfunction from complete bile duct occlusion. Sepsis and multiorgan failure may develop in both clinical settings.

When BDI is not identified intraoperatively or during the first postoperative week, patients may have an insidious evolution with relapsing abdominal pain, cholangitis, and bile collections. A late diagnosis, which sometimes is made years after surgery following multiple ineffective attempted repairs or inappropriate management, may result in increased complexity of bile duct repair. Moreover, even if successfully managed, the patient's quality of life and survival may be impaired. Indeed, the clinical course of undiagnosed or unrepaired BDI can evolve to secondary biliary cirrhosis with portal hypertension, liver failure, and, ultimately, death.

Fig. 2
Imaging features of HUAXI CBD type I. MRCP revealed pure cystic-like (a) and shuttle-like (b) dilatation of extrahepatic bile ducts; intraoperative cholangiography revealed pure cystic-like dilatation of extrahepatic bile ducts (c); after incision, the left hepatic duct was found to be narrow at the beginning and the right hepatic duct was normal (d). These white arrows point to dilatations and the black arrow points to stricture

Type II (Fig. 3), the extrahepatic combined with the right or left primary hepatic ducts dilatation. Definite stenosis was present in the primary hepatic ducts (not secondary dilatation), with no significant abnormalities in the secondary and higher hepatic ducts, corresponding to the subtype of Todani type IVa.

Fig. 3
Imaging features of HUAXI CBD type II. MRI revealed extrahepatic bile ducts with right hepatic duct dilation (a) or with left hepatic duct dilatation (b), and MRCP (c) and intraoperative cholangiography (d) revealed extrahepatic combine with right and left hepatic duct dilatation. These white arrows point to strictures and these red arrows point to dilatations

Type III (Fig. 4), the extrahepatic combined with secondary and higher hepatic ducts dilatation. The Intrahepatic bile duct dilatation could be confined to a single lobe or part of the liver, or could be diffusely distributed throughout the liver. Type III together with type II corresponds to Todani type IVa.

A 55-day-old boy was transferred to our unit with intestinal obstruction and obstructive jaundice after two neonatal operations for duodenal atresia and intestinal malrotation. Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts with cut-off at the distal common bile duct (CBD). He underwent emergency laparotomy for adhesive intestinal obstruction with a contained abscess from mid-jejunal perforation. Biliary dissection was not attempted due to poor preoperative nutritional status. Tube cholecystostomy was created for biliary decompression. Postoperative magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed dilated CBD with cut-off at the ampulla but did not demonstrate pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBMJ). The diagnostic dilemma was whether our patient had congenital PBMJ or had developed biliary stricture from perioperative ischaemic scarring. He underwent definitive surgery at 7 months: excision of dilated CBD with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejeunal reconstruction, excisional tapering duodenoplasty and jejunostomy creation. Intraoperative finding was type I choledochal cyst and subsequently confirmed on histology. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and bilirubin levels normalised.

### Surgical treatment of congenital biliary duct cyst [^e7130fd8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital biliary duct cysts are congenital anomalies of the biliary tree which are characterized by cystic dilatation of the extra- and/or intra-hepatic biliary ducts. The classic clinical symptoms of the cyst are jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, and palpable abdominal masses. Unlike Western countries, the morbidity of congenital bile duct cyst is much higher in Asia. Years ago, the primary treatment of cysts was simple internal drainage by cyst-enterostomy or partial cyst excision. However, several serious clinical outcomes, including stomal stenosis, cholestasis, cholangiolithiasis, and even cholangiocarcinoma, led to poor prognosis, and even secondary surgical operation. At present, total cyst excision with Roux-en-Y cholangiojejunostomy is considered to be a safer and more ideal treatment for patients with congenital biliary duct cysts. The surgical approaches depend on cyst clinical typing, which has been properly demonstrated by imaging findings (Figure 1), such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP), etc. Appropriate management of types I and II choledochal cysts include cholecystectomy, entire resection of the extrahepatic biliary tract with choledochal cyst, and Roux-en-Y cholangiojejunostomy. Resection of the extrahepatic biliary tract is also recommended for type IV cyst. As for type IV cyst, if there are stricture and/or stones in the intrahepatic abnormal biliary duct, and the cysts are confined to one lobe (or segment), hepatic lobectomy may also be considered. Bipolar intrahepatic cysts are associated with a high risk of intrahepatic stones and are managed with long-term transhepatic stenting to provide continuous access to the intrahepatic biliary tree for stone retrieval. The treatment of type V cyst also depends on its localization. Congenital bile duct cysts are commonly diagnosed in young women (the female to male ratio is 3: 1). As these patients value the cosmetic results as well as cure of the disease, minimally invasive surgery becomes more prevalent and appropriate. In recent years, laparoscopic resection has been applied for congenital bile duct cysts. The congenital bile duct cysts have a long course of disease, which may lead to increasing morbidity of several complications, including cholestatis, cholangiolithiasis, and even cholangiocarcinoma. However, operation at childhood may increase life-threatening risks. Thus, the best surgical timing for this disease remains controversial.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^b480bcc4]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current biliary dilatation (BD) classifications are complex and based on cases including secondary BD, leading to unclear distinctions. Notably, congenital and secondary BD differ in etiology, symptoms, and prognosis.

Objective

To propose a more concise and more suitable classification of congenital biliary dilatation (CBD), and exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of this classification in diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

Based on the preoperative imaging data of patients with CBD admitted to the Department of Pediatric Surgery of West China Hospital of Sichuan University, from January 2015 to December 2018, a new classification of CBD was accomplished according to the site of bile duct dilatation lesions, which was named HUAXI CBD classification. The CBD was classified into 4 types: type I (distal extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation), type II (distal extra-hepatic combined with right and left primary hepatic bile duct dilatation), type III (extra-hepatic combined with secondary and above hepatic bile duct dilatation), and type IV (intra-hepatic bile duct dilatation). Meanwhile, the feasibility and reliability of the HUAXI CBD classification were analyzed by analyzing the clinical treatment strategies, perioperative complications and long-term follow-up results of different subtypes.

Results

A total of 300 patients with CBD were included in this study. According to the HUAXI CBD classification method, 240 cases were type I, 48 cases were type II, 10 cases were type III, and 2 cases were type IV. After treatment, patients with type I had a normal hepatobiliary function after surgery and a good prognosis; patients with type II had good recovery of liver function in 37 cases (77.1%), but 11 cases (22.9%) had postoperative complications during follow-up; patients with type III and IV had high incidence of cholangitis (6/10, 2/2, respectively) and choledocholithiasis (5/10, 2/2, respectively) after surgery, especially those with diffuse intrahepatic dilatation having a poor prognosis, eventually developing cirrhosis and necessitating liver transplantation.

Conclusions

The HUAXI CBD classification is consistent with treatment principles, concise and easy to remember, and more suitable for CBD clinical application.

### Antenatally detected choledochal malformation: what are we waiting for? [^19977f8b]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An increasing proportion of congenital choledochal malformation (CCM) are being detected on antenatal ultrasound. However, the actual timing of its surgical correction remains controversial with some series showing an excess of complications the earlier the operation. The aim of this study was to characterize the pathophysiological aspects of this cohort from the perspective of age at surgery in order to inform a more rational basis for clinical decision-making.

Methods

We analysed a prospective database of CCM acquired over a 26-year period (Jan. 1997 to Dec. 2022) for patient demography; details of pre- and post-natal imaging; age at surgical intervention; operative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) and outcome. Data are quoted as median (IQR). All comparisons are non-parametric. A P value of 0.05 was accepted as significant.

Results

There were 58 (72% female) children with an antenatally-detected CCM from a total of 265 (21.8%) in the series. These were classified as Type 1C (n = 47; 81%), type 4C (n = 3; 5%) and Type 5 (n = 8; 14%). There were no Type 1F lesions in this cohort. Median age at surgery was 113 (IQR 57–198) days. Postnatal cyst (US) size varied from 12 to 130 mm but there was little evidence of a relationship between this and post-natal liver biochemistry (e.g. bilirubin r S = 0.01, P = 0.44; AST r S = 0.14, P = 0.19). Choledochal pressure measurements (n = 46) showed resting pressures of 12 (9–21) mmHg with no significant correlation with age (P = 0.4) or aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.2) or γ-glutamyl transferase (P = 0.06). The cohort was divided into 2 groups (Early and Late) based on the median age at surgery (all open) (113 days). Biliary obstruction was more common in the Early group (10 vs. 2; P = 0.01). Two perforations occurred, both in the Early group. With a deliberate policy of regular ultrasound-based follow-up we have seen no anastomotic complications (leak, stenosis, persistent intrahepatic biliary dilatation or stones) or post-operative cholangitis in any child [median follow-up 3.42 (1.30–8.05) years].

Conclusions

This is one of the largest series documenting the outcomes of antenatally-detected CCMs, certainly in Europe and North America. Such lesions are invariably cystic in nature, and either Types 1C, 4C or 5. The absence of complications using a policy of early intervention (where possible) in experienced hepatobiliary units was shown.

### Factors associated with timing and adverse outcomes in patients with biliary atresia undergoing kasai hepatoportoenterostomy [^100f745c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess factors associated with timing of hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) and adverse perioperative outcomes in patients with biliary atresia in the US.

Study Design

We examined hospitalizations in infants aged < 1 year using the National Inpatient Sample database for 2000–2011. We identified cases using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for biliary atresia and HPE. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine association between select factors and age at HPE, as well as adverse perioperative outcomes.

Results

Our analysis of 1243 biliary atresia hospitalizations showed that only 37.7% of patients had HPE in the first 60 days of life. Patients who underwent HPE after 60 days of age were uninsured, were more likely to be black (aOR, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.49–11.95), less likely to be admitted at a teaching hospital (aOR, 0.27; 95% CI 0.10–0.79), and less likely to have a concomitant congenital malformation (aOR, 0.49; 95% CI 0.25–0.98). Patients with delayed age at HPE incurred significantly higher hospital costs ($57 914 vs $34 074; P = 0.026). Delayed age at HPE and weekend admission were independently associated with increased odds of adverse perioperative outcome (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01–3.02 and 3.98; 95% CI, 1.67–9.46, respectively).

Conclusion

Current outcomes in patients with biliary atresia in the United States are suboptimal and result in higher costs. The specific factors associated with delayed care are further evidence that universal health care and screening are needed for all infants, along with systematic referral of potential patients with biliary atresia to specialized health centers.

### Neonatal jaundice… [^48f4ade9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Once neonatal jaundice is identified, the prime consideration must be detection of the underlying condition, and correction, if possible, before irreparable harm is done. Some jaundice due to obstructive causes can be corrected by surgical procedure; therefore, all cases with jaundice of non-obstructive nature should first be proved and ruled out. If the obstructive nature of the icterus is established, differentiation between its several causes must be systematically pursued with all available clinical and laboratory procedures. It is important to remember that laboratory tests, ordinarily reliable in children and adults, may give questionable or equivocal results in the perinatal period; for this reason biopsy and exploration sometimes become necessary to establish the diagnosis.

Possible causes of obstructive neonatal jaundice include extrahepatic biliary atresia, complete or partial, including diverticula of the common bile duct and duodenal atresia at the region of the papilla of Vater; intrahepatic biliary atresia of interlobular bile NEONATAL JAUNDICE. JAMA. 1966;

Regarding therapeutic procedures for biliary stricture, more specifically with respect to biliary drainage, extrahepatic obstruction, benign causes, ESGE 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing placement of temporary multiple side-by-side plastic stents or a fully covered self-expandable metal stent in patients with chronic pancreatitis-related benign biliary strictures.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of choledocholithiasis [^8e787856]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for choledocholithiasis, more specifically with respect to patients with reconstructed digestive tracts, ASGE 2011 guidelines recommend to consider referring patients with Billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstructions to biliary centers of excellence, given the increased rate of complications and lower success rate of endoscopic management of common bile duct stones in these patients.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for biliary stricture, more specifically with respect to biliary drainage, extrahepatic obstruction, malignant causes, ESGE 2018 guidelines recommend to consider replacing a plastic stent by a self-expandable metal stent in patients with a distal malignant biliary stricture and a nonfunctioning stent, and in thr case of a self-expandable metal stent, insert a plastic stent or a new self-expandable metal stent within the original self-expandable metal stent.

### Understanding choledochal malformation [^64892ae3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Choledochal malformations (also known as choledochal cysts) may be characterised as an abnormal dilatation of the biliary tract, in the absence of any acute obstruction. Most appear to be of congenital origin probably related to distal bile duct stenosis, and almost 15% can now be detected antenatally. Excision and biliary reconstruction using a Roux loop as an open operation is still the standard to compare to. This article discusses recent advances in the understanding of their aetiology and classification together with the place of newer modalites of surgical treatment such as laparoscopic excision and biliary reconstruction. Although these are definitely feasible and safe, care should be taken before dispensing with standard open techniques which have minimal complications and proven long-term benefit.
