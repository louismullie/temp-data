## Question

Diabetic Retinopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diabetic retinopathy management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease classification and staging to anchor decisions. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for panretinal photocoagulation versus anti-VEGF therapy. Next, I will examine combination strategies and special scenarios like vitreous hemorrhage and perioperative vitrectomy. After that, I need to consider systemic risk factor optimization and screening intervals. Finally, I will synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations and highlight uncertainties and future directions, making sure I double-check key figures and citations along the way.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework and staging, because treatment hinges on severity and the presence of diabetic macular edema. Diabetic retinopathy spans nonproliferative and proliferative stages, with vision-threatening disease defined by proliferative DR and/or center-involved DME, and severity is typically graded using the ETDRS Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, which guides both prognosis and therapy selection [^73864d9d] [^5d4566ad].

> I will now examine the historical standard of care for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which has long been panretinal photocoagulation based on the DRS and ETDRS showing substantial reductions in severe vision loss. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit: the DRS demonstrated about a 50% reduction in severe vision loss with PRP, and ETDRS refined timing and intensity, establishing PRP as the cornerstone for high-risk PDR [^21c0ae83] [^2d9db52a].

> Next, I should review the modern challenge to PRP: intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Protocol S showed ranibizumab was noninferior to PRP for mean visual acuity change at 2 years, with better peripheral visual field preservation and fewer DME events, though PRP had fewer injections and visits. Hold on, I should verify the durability: 5-year data showed similar visual acuity outcomes between groups, with less visual field loss and less vision-impairing DME in the ranibizumab arm, supporting anti-VEGF as a durable alternative in appropriately selected patients [^0325afce] [^6e21d28e] [^e3b17cbf].

> Let me consider the comparative effectiveness signals carefully. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently show anti-VEGF achieves better or comparable visual acuity versus PRP, with advantages in neovascular regression and reduced vitreous hemorrhage, though certainty varies and some differences are modest. I should double-check that these effects align with guideline positions, which increasingly recognize anti-VEGF as a reasonable first-line option in PDR, particularly when DME is present or when field-sparing is a priority [^d76a2b32] [^0c0816a7] [^1342b66e] [^877725a8].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot adhere to frequent injections or is at high risk of loss to follow-up. I need to ensure I weigh adherence and access, because real-world data show higher loss to follow-up with PRP and with certain sociodemographic factors, and anti-VEGF-treated patients who drop out may fare worse than PRP-treated patients who are lost, underscoring the need to match modality to patient logistics and reliability [^4a1fd055] [^68471109].

> Now, I should review combination therapy and special scenarios. In vitreous hemorrhage from PDR, initial aflibercept was noninferior to upfront vitrectomy with PRP over 24 weeks, with convergence by 2 years, suggesting anti-VEGF can be a reasonable initial strategy in selected cases. For perioperative vitrectomy, pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduces early and late postoperative vitreous hemorrhage and may improve visual outcomes, which is useful when hemorrhage risk is high. And in severe NPDR, anti-VEGF can improve DRSS and delay progression, though functional benefits and cost-effectiveness remain debated, so I should frame this as an option rather than a blanket recommendation [^94ec6c4e] [^b0f18d08] [^37643d90] [^c3a9c432].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating everyone with anti-VEGF. I should confirm the role of PRP in contemporary practice. PRP remains the standard for many patients, especially with high-risk PDR, poor adherence potential, or when rapid, definitive neovascular regression is needed, and it offers durable effects with typically one or few sessions, albeit with predictable field loss. Guidelines still endorse PRP as first-line in high-risk PDR, with anti-VEGF as an alternative or adjunct based on patient factors and DME status [^5d55fb5f] [^e660e298] [^68968ce7].

> I need to check systemic risk factor optimization, because it meaningfully modifies retinopathy risk and progression. Intensive glycemic control reduces incident retinopathy and slows progression, though the effect wanes once retinopathy is established, and blood pressure control reduces new retinopathy but has mixed effects on progression to PDR. Statins are associated with lower DR prevalence and fewer invasive interventions, and fenofibrate shows consistent reductions in DR progression in type 2 diabetes, so I should reinforce these alongside ocular therapy [^d95f77e6] [^b884ef54] [^0a967d34] [^cc9275c0].

> Next, I should review screening and follow-up intervals, since timing of detection and surveillance shapes outcomes. For no retinopathy or mild NPDR, annual exams are generally sufficient, whereas moderate NPDR warrants 6–12 months, severe NPDR every 3–6 months, and PDR every 2–4 months. Very severe NPDR carries a near 50% 1-year risk of progression to high-risk PDR, justifying closer monitoring and consideration of earlier treatment in select cases [^fcd3c01d] [^5d4566ad] [^ac9e33c8].

> Let me synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations, and I should double-check that they align with high-quality evidence. For high-risk PDR, treat promptly with either PRP or anti-VEGF, choosing based on DME presence, adherence capacity, cost, and patient preference. For PDR without DME, either PRP or anti-VEGF is reasonable, with PRP favored when durability and fewer visits are prioritized, and anti-VEGF favored when field preservation is important or DME coexists. For severe NPDR, consider earlier PRP or anti-VEGF in selected patients after discussing trade-offs. Across all stages, optimize glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids, and coordinate follow-up to mitigate loss to follow-up [^1342b66e] [^877725a8] [^68968ce7] [^e60b6727].

> I should confirm key uncertainties and future directions so counseling is balanced. Longer-term durability of anti-VEGF monotherapy beyond 5 years remains less certain than PRP's established permanence, cost and treatment burden can be prohibitive, and we need better risk stratification to identify which patients with NPDR or early PDR benefit most from early anti-VEGF. Emerging agents like faricimab and brolucizumab may extend durability, and AI-enabled screening can expand access, but equitable delivery and adherence support will determine real-world impact [^6e21d28e] [^cefa7b78] [^06182534] [^dc527c14].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: PRP remains a highly effective, durable standard for PDR, while anti-VEGF therapy is a validated alternative that can preserve peripheral vision and reduce DME, with the best outcomes when treatment is individualized to disease severity, DME status, adherence, and patient preferences, and when combined with rigorous systemic risk factor control and structured follow-up [^0325afce] [^6e21d28e] [^1342b66e] [^877725a8].

Diabetic retinopathy is a **progressive microvascular complication** of diabetes that can lead to vision loss [^526bb2e2]. Early detection via regular screening and strict control of glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids are essential to slow progression [^e60b6727]. For proliferative disease, **panretinal photocoagulation remains the gold standard** [^2d9db52a], while anti-VEGF agents are effective alternatives or adjuncts, especially with diabetic macular edema [^0325afce] [^d76a2b32]. Individualized treatment should balance efficacy, safety, and patient factors, with close follow-up to prevent relapse [^2630a0ea].

---

## Pathophysiology

Diabetic retinopathy arises from chronic hyperglycemia, which triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular changes: hyperglycemia causes **microvascular damage** with pericyte loss, capillary nonperfusion, and ischemia [^526bb2e2]; ischemia drives **VEGF upregulation**, promoting neovascularization and leakage [^6a9ca631]; and inflammation and oxidative stress accelerate neurovascular injury and barrier breakdown [^526bb2e2].

---

## Clinical classification

The **ETDRS severity scale** classifies diabetic retinopathy into non-proliferative (NPDR) and proliferative (PDR) stages:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Mild NPDR | Microaneurysms only |
| Moderate NPDR | More than just microaneurysms but less than severe NPDR |
| Severe NPDR | Hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, venous beading, or IRMA |
| PDR | Neovascularization or vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage |

---

## Risk factors

- **Glycemic control**: Poor control (high HbA1c) is the strongest modifiable risk factor [^93773526].
- **Duration of diabetes**: Longer duration increases risk [^526bb2e2].
- **Hypertension**: Increases progression risk [^notfound].
- **Dyslipidemia**: Associated with higher risk and progression [^notfound].
- **Renal disease**: Nephropathy correlates with progression [^93773526].

---

## Screening and diagnosis

Regular screening is critical because early disease is often asymptomatic. Recommended intervals are **annual screening** for all patients with diabetes, with shorter intervals for more advanced disease or poor control [^fcd3c01d]. Diagnostic methods include dilated fundus examination, color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) for macular edema, and fluorescein angiography for neovascularization [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Systemic control

Optimize **glycemic control** to reduce progression risk [^d95f77e6]; target **blood pressure** to less than 140/90 mmHg when feasible [^b884ef54]; and manage **dyslipidemia** with statins, which may reduce progression and interventions [^0a967d34].

---

### Local therapies

- **Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)**: Gold standard for PDR; reduces severe vision loss by ~50% [^2d9db52a] [^21c0ae83].
- **Anti-VEGF agents**: Ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab are effective for PDR and DME; noninferior to PRP in many outcomes [^0325afce] [^d76a2b32].
- **Vitrectomy**: For advanced disease with vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment [^a598bc53].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

- **Longer-acting anti-VEGF agents**: Faricimab and brolucizumab show promise for extended durability [^cefa7b78].
- **Gene therapy**: Under investigation to target VEGF pathways [^notfound].
- **Neuroprotection**: Agents to preserve retinal neurons are being studied [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

With timely detection and appropriate treatment, **90–95% of vision loss from diabetic retinopathy is preventable** [^0b07ca08]. However, progression can occur despite treatment, especially with poor systemic control or advanced disease [^68471109].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Patient education on the importance of **regular screening**, **systemic control**, and **adherence to therapy** is essential. Barriers such as cost, access, and **loss to follow-up** must be addressed to optimize outcomes [^4a1fd055].

---

Diabetic retinopathy is a **preventable cause of blindness**; **early detection**, **systemic risk factor control**, and **individualized local therapy** are key to preserving vision.

Background

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a complication of diabetic retinopathy that can cause blindness. Although panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the treatment of choice for PDR, it has secondary effects that can affect vision. An alternative treatment such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), which produces an inhibition of vascular proliferation, could improve the vision of people with PDR.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-VEGFs for PDR.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to April 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-VEGFs to another active treatment, sham treatment or no treatment for people with PDR. We also included studies that assessed the combination of anti-VEGFs with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or the mean difference (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs with 1005 participants (1131 eyes) of whom 57% were men. The median number of participants per RCT was 40 (range 15 to 261). The studies took place in Asia (three studies), Europe (two studies), the Middle East (seven studies), North America (three studies) and South America (three studies). Eight RCTs recruited people eligible for PRP, nine RCTs enrolled people with diabetes requiring vitrectomy and one RCT recruited people undergoing cataract surgery. The median follow-up was six months (range one to 12 months). Seven studies were at high risk of bias and the remainder were unclear risk of bias in one or more domains. Very low quality evidence from one study of 61 people showed that people treated with bevacizumab and PRP were less likely to lose 3 or more lines of visual acuity at 12 months compared with people treated with PRP alone (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.81). People treated with anti-VEGF had an increased chance of gaining 3 or more lines of visual acuity but the effect was imprecise and compatible with no effect or being less likely to gain vision (RR 6.78, 95% CI 0.37 to 125.95). No other study reported these two outcomes. On average, people treated with anti-VEGF (bevacizumab, pegaptanib or ranibizumab) had better visual acuity at 12 months compared with people not receiving anti-VEGF (MD -0.07 logMAR, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02; 5 RCTs, 373 participants, low quality evidence). There was some evidence to suggest a regression of PDR with smaller leakage on fluorescein angiography but it was difficult to estimate a pooled result from the two trials reporting this outcome. People receiving anti-VEGF were less likely to have vitreous or pre-retinal haemorrhage at 12 months (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.65; 3 RCTs, 342 participants, low quality evidence). No study reported on fluorescein leakage or quality of life. All of the nine trials of anti-VEGF before or during vitrectomy investigated bevacizumab; most studies investigated bevacizumab before vitrectomy, one study investigated bevacizumab during surgery. People treated with bevacizumab and vitrectomy were less likely to lose 3 or more lines of visual acuity at 12 months compared with people given vitrectomy alone but the effect was imprecise and compatible with no effect or being more likely to lose vision (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.14; 3 RCTs, 94 participants, low quality evidence). People treated with bevacizumab were more likely to gain 3 or more lines of visual acuity (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.17; 3 RCTs, 94 participants, low quality evidence). On average, people treated with bevacizumab had better visual acuity at 12 months compared with people not receiving bevacizumab but there was uncertainty in the estimate (the CIs included 0; i.e. were compatible with no effect, and there was considerable inconsistency between studies; MD -0.24 logMAR, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.01; 6 RCTs, 335 participants, I(2) = 67%; low quality evidence). People receiving bevacizumab were less likely to have vitreous or pre-retinal haemorrhage at 12 months (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.52; 7 RCTs, 393 participants, low quality evidence). No study reported on quality of life. Reasons for downgrading the quality of the evidence included risk of bias in included studies, imprecision of the estimates, inconsistency of effect estimates and indirectness (few studies reported at 12 months). Adverse effects were rarely reported and there was no evidence for any increased risk with anti-VEGF but given the relatively few studies that reported these, and the low event rate, the power of the analysis to detect any differences was low.

Authors' Conclusions

There was very low or low quality evidence from RCTs for the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF agents when used to treat PDR over and above current standard treatments. However, the results suggest that anti-VEGFs can reduce the risk of intraocular bleeding in people with PDR. Further carefully designed clinical trials should be able to improve this evidence.

### A paradigm shift in the management approaches of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: role of anti-VEGF therapy [^1b8d5c60]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

For the majority of PDR cases, the mainstay treatment remains laser; however, there is growing evidence on the benefits offered by anti-VEGF injections regardless of Diabetic Macula Oedema (DME) presence or absence. As the treatment landscape for PDR is evolving, this narrative review aims to combine currently available knowledge on anti-VEGF agents and their role in the management of PDR. It emphasises the risk-benefit evaluation of various approaches employed for PDR management and discusses consensus statements for managing a few clinical scenarios in the context of PDR.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^d76a2b32]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an advanced complication of diabetic retinopathy that can cause blindness. It consists of the presence of new vessels in the retina and vitreous haemorrhage. Although panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the treatment of choice for PDR, it has secondary effects that can affect vision. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), which produces an inhibition of vascular proliferation, could improve the vision of people with PDR.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-VEGFs for PDR and summarise any relevant economic evaluations of their use.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. We did not use any date or language restrictions. We last searched the electronic databases on 1 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-VEGFs to another active treatment, sham treatment, or no treatment for people with PDR. We also included studies that assessed the combination of anti-VEGFs with other treatments. We excluded studies that used anti-VEGFs in people undergoing vitrectomy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias (RoB) for all included trials. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or the mean difference (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 15 new studies in this update, bringing the total to 23 RCTs with 1755 participants (2334 eyes). Forty-five per cent of participants were women and 55% were men, with a mean age of 56 years (range 48 to 77 years). The mean glycosylated haemoglobin (Hb1Ac) was 8.45% for the PRP group and 8.25% for people receiving anti-VEGFs alone or in combination. Twelve studies included people with PDR, and participants in 11 studies had high-risk PDR (HRPDR). Twelve studies were of bevacizumab, seven of ranibizumab, one of conbercept, two of pegaptanib, and one of aflibercept. The mean number of participants per RCT was 76 (ranging from 15 to 305). Most studies had an unclear or high RoB, mainly in the blinding of interventions and outcome assessors. A few studies had selective reporting and attrition bias. No study reported loss or gain of 3 or more lines of visual acuity (VA) at 12 months. Anti-VEGFs ± PRP probably increase VA compared with PRP alone (mean difference (MD) -0.08 logMAR, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.04; I² = 28%; 10 RCTS, 1172 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Anti-VEGFs ± PRP may increase regression of new vessels (MD -4.14 mm 2, 95% CI -6.84 to -1.43; I² = 75%; 4 RCTS, 189 eyes; low-certainty evidence) and probably increase a complete regression of new vessels (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.24; I² = 46%; 5 RCTS, 405 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Anti-VEGFs ± PRP probably reduce vitreous haemorrhage (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.90; I² = 0%; 6 RCTS, 1008 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Anti-VEGFs ± PRP may reduce the need for vitrectomy compared with eyes that received PRP alone (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93; I² = 43%; 8 RCTs, 1248 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Anti-VEGFs ± PRP may result in little to no difference in the quality of life compared with PRP alone (MD 0.62, 95% CI -3.99 to 5.23; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, 382 participants; low-certainty evidence). We do not know if anti-VEGFs ± PRP compared with PRP alone had an impact on adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). We did not find differences in visual acuity in subgroup analyses comparing the type of anti-VEGFs, the severity of the disease (PDR versus HRPDR), time to follow-up (< 12 months versus 12 or more months), and treatment with anti-VEGFs + PRP versus anti-VEGFs alone. The main reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence included a high RoB, imprecision, and inconsistency of effect estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Anti-VEGFs ± PRP compared with PRP alone probably increase visual acuity, but the degree of improvement is not clinically meaningful. Regarding secondary outcomes, anti-VEGFs ± PRP produce a regression of new vessels, reduce vitreous haemorrhage, and may reduce the need for vitrectomy compared with eyes that received PRP alone. We do not know if anti-VEGFs ± PRP have an impact on the incidence of adverse events and they may have little or no effect on patients' quality of life. Carefully designed and conducted clinical trials are required, assessing the optimal schedule of anti-VEGFs alone compared with PRP, and with a longer follow-up.

### Progressive changes in diabetics and their management [^4ed7833a]. Eye (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is increasing worldwide due to an increasing number, and prolonged survival, of diabetic patients. Many effective treatments for different types and stages of retinopathy exist. However, there is patchy delivery of care, inconsistent screening, and unresolved questions about several management questions. This article discusses the current state of knowledge about therapeutics in diabetic retinopathy, and highlights areas where further studies and evidence base is required.

### Laser photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^2d9db52a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which high blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina. Sometimes new blood vessels grow in the retina, and these can have harmful effects; this is known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Laser photocoagulation is an intervention that is commonly used to treat diabetic retinopathy, in which light energy is applied to the retina with the aim of stopping the growth and development of new blood vessels, and thereby preserving vision.

Objectives

To assess the effects of laser photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy compared to no treatment or deferred treatment.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where people (or eyes) with diabetic retinopathy were randomly allocated to laser photocoagulation or no treatment or deferred treatment. We excluded trials of lasers that are no longer in routine use. Our primary outcome was the proportion of people who lost 15 or more letters (3 lines) of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as measured on a logMAR chart at 12 months. We also looked at longer-term follow-up of the primary outcome at two to five years. Secondary outcomes included mean best corrected distance visual acuity, severe visual loss, mean near visual acuity, progression of diabetic retinopathy, quality of life, pain, loss of driving licence, vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors selected studies and extracted data.

Main Results

We identified a large number of trials of laser photocoagulation of diabetic retinopathy (n = 83) but only five of these studies were eligible for inclusion in the review, i.e. they compared laser photocoagulation with currently available lasers to no (or deferred) treatment. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one study in the UK and one study in Japan. A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies. The majority of participants in four of these trials were people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy; one trial recruited mainly people with non-proliferative retinopathy. Four of the studies evaluated panretinal photocoagulation with argon laser and one study investigated selective photocoagulation of non-perfusion areas. Three studies compared laser treatment to no treatment and two studies compared laser treatment to deferred laser treatment. All studies were at risk of performance bias because the treatment and control were different and no study attempted to produce a sham treatment. Three studies were considered to be at risk of attrition bias. At 12 months there was little difference between eyes that received laser photocoagulation and those allocated to no treatment (or deferred treatment), in terms of loss of 15 or more letters of visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.11; 8926 eyes; 2 RCTs, low quality evidence). Longer term follow-up did not show a consistent pattern, but one study found a 20% reduction in risk of loss of 15 or more letters of visual acuity at five years with laser treatment. Treatment with laser reduced the risk of severe visual loss by over 50% at 12 months (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86; 9276 eyes; 4 RCTs, moderate quality evidence). There was a beneficial effect on progression of diabetic retinopathy with treated eyes experiencing a 50% reduction in risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64; 8331 eyes; 4 RCTs, low quality evidence) and a similar reduction in risk of vitreous haemorrhage (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.85; 224 eyes; 2 RCTs, low quality evidence). None of the studies reported near visual acuity or patient-relevant outcomes such as quality of life, pain, loss of driving licence or adverse effects such as retinal detachment. We did not plan any subgroup analyses, but there was a difference in baseline risk in participants with non-proliferative retinopathy compared to those with proliferative retinopathy. With the small number of included studies we could not do a formal subgroup analysis comparing effect in proliferative and non-proliferative retinopathy.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that laser photocoagulation is beneficial in treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We judged the evidence to be moderate or low, depending on the outcome. This is partly related to reporting of trials conducted many years ago, after which panretinal photocoagulation has become the mainstay of treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Future Cochrane Reviews on variations in the laser treatment protocol are planned. Future research on laser photocoagulation should investigate the combination of laser photocoagulation with newer treatments such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs).

### American society of retina specialists clinical practice guidelines on the management of nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema [^e60b6727]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Retina Specialists clinical practice guidelines — scope and systemic optimization for diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema: The guidance focuses on management of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) without diabetic macular edema (DME), noting that DME is the most common cause of visual impairment in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and that separate guidelines address DME, while screening, imaging, and vitreoretinal surgery are not detailed. Background epidemiology notes that more than 30 million people live with diabetes in the United States and that the National Eye Institute estimates that 7.7 million also have DR, with values projected to double by 2050. For systemic optimization, the evidence for optimizing systemic glycemic and cardiovascular factors is well established for decreasing mortality and morbidity and should be reinforced with visits with the retina specialist, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends glycemic, blood pressure, and serum lipid optimization to reduce the risk or slow the progression of DR. The Diabetic Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) definitively established the relationship between hyperglycemia and DR in patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Ocular anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy: overview of clinical efficacy and evolving applications [^0437e5db]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Ocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy represents one of the most significant advances in modern medicine. The introduction and widespread use of ocular anti-VEGF therapy for age-related macular degeneration heralded a new era in the treatment of vascular and exudative diseases of the retina. Its expanding indications now include diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, two vision-threatening forms of diabetic retinopathy. It is widely anticipated that ocular anti-VEGF therapy could spark a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm for diabetic retinopathy. However, despite its clear efficacy shown in clinical trials, the dynamic landscape of evolving medical, ethical, and economic issues related to this new treatment suggests significant challenges ahead. In this article, we provide a discussion of this topic as part of this two-part Bench to Clinic narrative. Here, our Clinic contribution provides an overview of the current evidence from clinical trials on anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy, and highlights the hopes and fears of this new treatment from clinical and public health standpoints. In the Bench narrative that precedes this contribution, Simó et al. provide an overview of the role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.

### American society of retina specialists clinical practice guidelines on the management of nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema [^2630a0ea]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Retina Specialists diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema — conclusions and treatment selection: One universal recommendation is to discuss the importance of glycemic and cardiovascular optimization with all patients. In nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) without DME, anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment can improve the DRSS level, particularly in severe disease; whether this translates into long-term visual benefit with improvement in quality of life in the real world is yet to be determined, but it stands as a legitimate treatment option, and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) could be considered for some patients, with close observation appropriate for many patients. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) without DME, PRP has been traditional, but there is now strong evidence that anti-VEGF treatment is a noninferior option; PRP and anti-VEGF agents are both useful tools, either as monotherapies or in combination, depending on patient variables. Strong suggestions for incorporating anti-VEGF treatment include clinically significant DME, and strong suggestions for incorporating PRP include inability for close follow-up and/or preference to avoid frequent injections over the long term, and the authors recommend a thoughtful approach for the individual patient.

### Guidelines on diabetic eye care: the international council of ophthalmology recommendations for screening, follow-up, referral, and treatment based on resource settings [^3c975622]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global epidemic and affects populations in both developing and developed countries, with differing health care and resource levels. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of DM and a leading cause of vision loss in working middle-aged adults. Vision loss from DR can be prevented with broad-level public health strategies, but these need to be tailored to a country's and population's resource setting. Designing DR screening programs, with appropriate and timely referral to facilities with trained eye care professionals, and using cost-effective treatment for vision-threatening levels of DR can prevent vision loss. The International Council of Ophthalmology Guidelines for Diabetic Eye Care 2017 summarize and offer a comprehensive guide for DR screening, referral and follow-up schedules for DR, and appropriate management of vision-threatening DR, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative DR, for countries with high- and low- or intermediate-resource settings. The guidelines include updated evidence on screening and referral criteria, the minimum requirements for a screening vision and retinal examination, follow-up care, and management of DR and DME, including laser photocoagulation and appropriate use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors and, in specific situations, intravitreal corticosteroids. Recommendations for management of DR in patients during pregnancy and with concomitant cataract also are included. The guidelines offer suggestions for monitoring outcomes and indicators of success at a population level.

### The unmet need for better risk stratification of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^bb72c3a9]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment options are lacking in non‐proliferative retinopathy; in those receiving treatment, therapy is largely limited to pan‐retinal photocoagulation 11. Pan‐retinal photocoagulation reduces the risk of visual loss and blindness, in most cases preserving rather than improving visual acuity. Pan‐retinal photocoagulation is also associated with some decline in visual function, which may affect the person's ability to drive as well as other aspects of day‐to‐day living 11, 12. Furthermore, active disease, such as vitreous haemorrhages, may still develop during or after pan‐retinal photocoagulation treatment; therefore, treatment is usually deferred until non‐proliferative retinopathy is severe 11, 12. As most studies report the use of pan‐retinal photocoagulation for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, there is a lack of data specifically reporting the efficacy of pan‐retinal photocoagulation for non‐proliferative retinopathy 11. Recent trials show promise for intravitreal anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments in severe non‐proliferative retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NCT00473382, NCT00473330 and NCT014899189), although these trials also include people with diabetic macular oedema. Despite the recent approval given to the VEGF inhibitor ranibizumab for diabetic retinopathy 13, it is not yet clear what role ranibizumab will play in non‐proliferative retinopathy treatment. Another concern is that intravitreal injections are invasive and inconvenient, and usually require the person to travel to a hospital for treatment. Alternative treatments that are effective at all stages of diabetic retinopathy and may help to prevent progression to sight‐threatening disease are therefore desirable, particularly treatments that can be administered outside of a clinical setting such as oral or topical formulations. In this paper, we review the current non‐proliferative retinopathy classification systems and consider how these could be optimized with risk stratification strategies based on the current understanding of retinal lesions.

### American society of retina specialists clinical practice guidelines on the management of nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema [^dad9b829]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Nonproliferative (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) without diabetic macular edema (DME) affect millions of individuals living with diabetes throughout the world. There is increasing data on various management strategies for such patients, but there is limited consensus on how the data should be adopted into clinical practice.

Methods

This literature review and editorial presents and synthesizes the current evidence for various management paradigms for NPDR and PDR without DME.

Results

Retina specialists are an integral member of the diabetes management team, and should encourage patients on the importance of glycemic and cardiovascular optimization for both systemic and retinopathy risk factor reduction. The diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) is now an approvable endpoint for clinical trials in the United States, therefore becoming more clinically relevant. For PDR without DME, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) established the standard of care with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Laser parameters have since evolved to include less intense and earlier intervention. Studies have recently demonstrated that anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment of PDR is effective at regressing neovascularization and improving DRSS levels in many patients. Further evidence is required to determine optimal treatment frequency, duration, and retreatment criteria, in the real world. There are concerns for adverse events in patients being lost to follow up during anti-VEGF treatment. For NPDR without DME, the standard of care has been a wait-and-watch approach. Data within the DRS and the ETDRS suggest that PRP for severe NPDR can be an option for select patients as well. Multiple clinical trials have now demonstrated that anti-VEGF treatment can improve the DRSS score in NPDR. Further studies are required to assess whether this positively affects long-term visual outcomes, and whether the benefits outweigh the risks in the real world for routine use.

Conclusions

There is cumulative evidence demonstrating the efficacy of various treatment options for NPDR and PDR without DME. Currently, patients would most likely benefit from thoughtful management strategies that are tailored to the individual patient.

### The unmet need for better risk stratification of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^83a61f05]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Progression of non‐proliferative retinopathy to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy and blindness is preventable, particularly when detected at an early stage 7, therefore, the prediction and prevention of progression are crucial. Currently, in the UK, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists guidelines recommend annual screening for all people with diabetes 9; however, this may be too infrequent for people at high risk of rapid progression to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy and too frequent for those at a low risk of progression to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy 10, suggesting that a new method for identifying diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes is needed. Identifying people with the greatest risk of progression and greatest potential to benefit from treatment is of the utmost importance; healthcare resources must be prioritized for those who need regular follow‐up and timely treatment during this diabetes epidemic.

### Ranibizumab for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^53eb150e]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of blindness in young adults. Prior to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, the treatment of DR was based on control of systemic factors and laser photocoagulation. Over the past decade, the use of anti-VEGF agents has revolutionized the treatment of DR, including diabetic macular edema (DME). Areas covered: Ranibizumab has been proven to be effective for the treatment of DME in large clinical trials, while patients in these studies have been assessed in terms of DR severity change. In this review, evidence from randomized trials regarding the use of ranibizumab for DR treatment is presented. Expert opinion: A comprehensive presentation of randomized clinical trials evaluating ranibizumab for DR indicates that it is effective and safe, offering improvement of DR severity in both non-proliferative and proliferative forms. However, there is no general consensus regarding the exact treatment regimen in patients with DR, while the effect of ranibizumab on the progression of retinal ischemia remains unclear.

### Diabetic retinopathy [^12d785f1]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a common and specific microvascular complication of diabetes, and remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged people. It is identified in a third of people with diabetes and associated with increased risk of life-threatening systemic vascular complications, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. Optimum control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and possibly blood lipids remains the foundation for reduction of risk of retinopathy development and progression. Timely laser therapy is effective for preservation of sight in proliferative retinopathy and macular oedema, but its ability to reverse visual loss is poor. Vitrectomy surgery might occasionally be needed for advanced retinopathy. New therapies, such as intraocular injection of steroids and antivascular endothelial growth-factor agents, are less destructive to the retina than are older therapies, and could be useful in patients who respond poorly to conventional therapy. The outlook for future treatment modalities, such as inhibition of other angiogenic factors, regenerative therapy, and topical therapy, is promising.

### Panretinal photocoagulation vs intravitreous ranibizumab for proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a randomized clinical trial [^0325afce]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is the standard treatment for reducing severe visual loss from proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, PRP can damage the retina, resulting in peripheral vision loss or worsening diabetic macular edema (DME).

Objective

To evaluate the noninferiority of intravitreous ranibizumab compared with PRP for visual acuity outcomes in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial conducted at 55 US sites among 305 adults with proliferative diabetic retinopathy enrolled between February and December 2012 (mean age, 52 years; 44% female; 52% white). Both eyes were enrolled for 89 participants (1 eye to each study group), with a total of 394 study eyes. The final 2-year visit was completed in January 2015.

Interventions

Individual eyes were randomly assigned to receive PRP treatment, completed in 1 to 3 visits (n = 203 eyes), or ranibizumab, 0.5 mg, by intravitreous injection at baseline and as frequently as every 4 weeks based on a structured re-treatment protocol (n = 191 eyes). Eyes in both treatment groups could receive ranibizumab for DME.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mean visual acuity change at 2 years (5-letter noninferiority margin; intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary outcomes included visual acuity area under the curve, peripheral visual field loss, vitrectomy, DME development, and retinal neovascularization.

Results

Mean visual acuity letter improvement at 2 years was +2.8 in the ranibizumab group vs +0.2 in the PRP group (difference, +2.2; 95% CI, -0.5 to +5.0; P < .001 for noninferiority). The mean treatment group difference in visual acuity area under the curve over 2 years was +4.2 (95% CI, +3.0 to +5.4; P < .001). Mean peripheral visual field sensitivity loss was worse (-23 dB vs -422 dB; difference, 372 dB; 95% CI, 213–531 dB; P < .001), vitrectomy was more frequent (15% vs 4%; difference, 9%; 95% CI, 4%-15%; P < .001), and DME development was more frequent (28% vs 9%; difference, 19%; 95% CI, 10%-28%; P < .001) in the PRP group vs the ranibizumab group, respectively. Eyes without active or regressed neovascularization at 2 years were not significantly different (35% in the ranibizumab group vs 30% in the PRP group; difference, 3%; 95% CI, -7% to 12%; P = 0.58). One eye in the ranibizumab group developed endophthalmitis. No significant differences between groups in rates of major cardiovascular events were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, treatment with ranibizumab resulted in visual acuity that was noninferior to (not worse than) PRP treatment at 2 years. Although longer-term follow-up is needed, ranibizumab may be a reasonable treatment alternative, at least through 2 years, for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

### Anti-VEGF injections vs. panretinal photocoagulation laser therapy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0c0816a7]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2025). Medium credibility.

Topic

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The outcomes examined are changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), neovascularization (NV), central macular thickness (CMT), and adverse outcomes.

Clinical Relevance

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-aged adults globally. At present, no consensus has been reached on the optimal choice for the treatment of PDR.

Methods

Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CiNAHL were searched for articles from their inception to June 2023 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. The review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42023437778). Tool data analysis was performed using RevMan software version 5.4 (Review Manager [RevMan] [computer program], The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020). Randomized control trials (RCTs) of PDR patients treated with anti-VEGF, PRP, or a combination were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Rob2 assessment tool (revised tool for risk of bias in randomized trials), and certainty of evidence was assessed with the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Nineteen studies were included, with 1361 patients (n = 1788 eyes) treated for PDR with either anti-VEGF (n = 274), PRP (n = 482), or combination (n = 320). Our results show more favorable BCVA outcomes with anti-VEGF compared with PRP at 3 months (mean difference [MD] = 2.35 letters; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18–3.52; I² = 0%) and 12 months follow-up (MD = 3.39 letters; 95% CI, 0.63–6.14; I² = 26%). Combination treatment showed better BCVA outcomes compared with PRP at 12 months (MD = 4.06 letters; 95% CI, 0.26–7.86; I² = 0%). Combination showed lower CMT at 3 months (MD = -33.10 μm; 95% CI, -40.12 to -26.08; I² = 25%) and 6 months (MD = -34.28 μm; 95% CI, -55.59 to -12.97; I² = 85%) compared with PRP, but CMT results were similar at 12 months. Complete regression of total NV (NVT) was more likely with anti-VEGF compared with PRP (odds ratio = 6.15; 95% CI, 1.39–27.15; I² = 80%). Posttreatment vitreous hemorrhage, vitrectomy, and increased intraocular pressure events were similar between the anti-VEGF and combination groups compared with PRP; however, macular edema results favored the anti-VEGF over the PRP group. Using the GRADE assessment, BCVA evidence was rated to be of moderate certainty, whereas CMT and NVT evidence certainty was rated as very low.

Conclusion

Anti-VEGF and combination treatments could be regarded as alternative approaches to PRP alone in the management of PDR after engaging in a shared decision-making process based on patients' adherence, diabetic macular edema status, and preference. Limitations of this meta-analysis include the heterogeneity in participants' characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcome reporting between studies. Further RCTs should be conducted to compare the effectiveness of these treatments in the long term.

### Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy [^2a862c45]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The International Diabetes Federation advises regular eye examinations every one to two years for people with diabetes and no retinopathy (IDF 2021). Once DR develops, the frequency of assessments should be increased depending on the severity of the retinopathy and level of control of systemic factors (Fred Hollows Foundation 2015). Currently, treatment options for NPDR are scarce (Royle 2015); treatment is most often only given when PDR or diabetic macular oedema (DMO) have ensued.

The Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) demonstrated that risk of severe visual loss in people with HRC‐PDR was reduced by 50% at two and five years with laser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment (Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group 1987). A Cochrane intervention review also verified that PRP is beneficial in reducing vision loss and progression in PDR (Evans 2014). PRP involves burning the retina, avoiding the macula (the area responsible for the central sight), with spots of laser, leading to regression of new vessels following treatment. The exact mechanism of action of PRP remains unclear, but it is presumably due to the reduced oxygen requirement of the less extensive viable retina post‐treatment, and diminished growth factor production resulting from ablation of the ischaemic retina (Doft 1984). PRP generally preserves rather than improves vision and may be associated with adverse side effects, such as diminished peripheral vision, night vision, or both, and exacerbation of DMO.

### Different lasers and techniques for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^c8487f90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic progressive disease of the retinal microvasculature associated with prolonged hyperglycaemia. Proliferative DR (PDR) is a sight-threatening complication of DR and is characterised by the development of abnormal new vessels in the retina, optic nerve head or anterior segment of the eye. Argon laser photocoagulation has been the gold standard for the treatment of PDR for many years, using regimens evaluated by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). Over the years, there have been modifications of the technique and introduction of new laser technologies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different types of laser, other than argon laser, and different laser protocols, other than those established by the ETDRS, for the treatment of PDR. We compared different wavelengths; power and pulse duration; pattern, number and location of burns versus standard argon laser undertaken as specified by the ETDRS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the search was 8 June 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) using standard argon laser for treatment of PDR compared with any other laser modality. We excluded studies of lasers that are not in common use, such as the xenon arc, ruby or Krypton laser.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed Cochrane guidelines and graded the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 11 studies from Europe (6), the USA (2), the Middle East (1) and Asia (2). Five studies compared different types of laser to argon: Nd:YAG (2 studies) or diode (3 studies). Other studies compared modifications to the standard argon laser PRP technique. The studies were poorly reported and we judged all to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The sample size varied from 20 to 270 eyes but the majority included 50 participants or fewer. Nd:YAG versus argon laser (2 studies): very low-certainty evidence on vision loss, vision gain, progression and regression of PDR, pain during laser treatment and adverse effects. Diode versus argon laser (3 studies): very-low certainty evidence on vision loss, vision gain, progression and regression of PDR and adverse effects; moderate-certainty evidence that diode laser was more painful (risk ratio (RR) troublesome pain during laser treatment (RR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.51; eyes = 202; studies = 3; I² = 0%).0.5 second versus 0.1 second exposure (1 study): low-certainty evidence of lower chance of vision loss with 0.5 second compared with 0.1 second exposure but estimates were imprecise and compatible with no difference or an increased chance of vision loss (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.04, 44 eyes, 1 RCT); low-certainty evidence that people treated with 0.5 second exposure were more likely to gain vision (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 7.28, 44 eyes, 1 RCT) but again the estimates were imprecise. People given 0.5 second exposure were more likely to have regression of PDR compared with 0.1 second laser PRP again with imprecise estimate (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.48, 32 eyes, 1 RCT). There was very low-certainty evidence on progression of PDR and adverse effects'. ight intensity' PRP versus classic PRP (1 study): vision loss or gain was not reported but the mean difference in logMAR acuity at 1 year was -0.09 logMAR (95% CI -0.22 to 0.04, 65 eyes, 1 RCT); and low-certainty evidence that fewer patients had pain during light PRP compared with classic PRP with an imprecise estimate compatible with increased or decreased pain (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.93, 65 eyes, 1 RCT)'. ild scatter' (laser pattern limited to 400 to 600 laser burns in one sitting) PRP versus standard 'full' scatter PRP (1 study): very low-certainty evidence on vision and visual field loss. No information on adverse effects'. entral' (a more central PRP in addition to mid-peripheral PRP) versus 'peripheral' standard PRP (1 study): low-certainty evidence that people treated with central PRP were more likely to lose 15 or more letters of BCVA compared with peripheral laser PRP (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 13.46, 50 eyes, 1 RCT); and less likely to gain 15 or more letters (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.08) with imprecise estimates compatible with increased or decreased risk'. entre sparing' PRP (argon laser distribution limited to 3 disc diameters from the upper temporal and lower margin of the fovea) versus standard 'full scatter' PRP (1 study): low-certainty evidence that people treated with 'centre sparing' PRP were less likely to lose 15 or more ETDRS letters of BCVA compared with 'full scatter' PRP (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50, 53 eyes). Low-certainty evidence of similar risk of regression of PDR between groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27, 53 eyes). Adverse events were not reported'. xtended targeted' PRP (to include the equator and any capillary non-perfusion areas between the vascular arcades) versus standard PRP (1 study): low-certainty evidence that people in the extended group had similar or slightly reduced chance of loss of 15 or more letters of BCVA compared with the standard PRP group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.28, 270 eyes). Low-certainty evidence that people in the extended group had a similar or slightly increased chance of regression of PDR compared with the standard PRP group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.31, 270 eyes). Very low-certainty information on adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Modern laser techniques and modalities have been developed to treat PDR. However there is limited evidence available with respect to the efficacy and safety of alternative laser systems or strategies compared with the standard argon laser as described in ETDRS.

### Impact of anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic macular oedema on progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy: data-driven insights from a multicentre study [^329fe64a]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO) are among the leading causes of incident sight impairment and blindness in the working age population.

Treatment of DMO and PDR has evolved over the last few decades after pivotal laser treatment trials. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has become the standard of care for managing DMO. Notably, DMO can be present in cases with any degree of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and evidence has shown that anti-VEGF injections reduce DR progression rates and improve DR severity score (DRSS). However, despite rigorous and intensive intravitreal anti-VEGF DMO treatment protocols in clinical trials, progression to PDR still occurs in treated eyes, though at lower rates. Moreover, preventive treatment with anti-VEGF in patients with non-PDR (NPDR) and no DMO shows that DMO and/or PDR incidence risk is not eliminated.

Little is known about how DMO anti-VEGF treatment regimens impact PDR risk outside clinical trials, whether the effect of repeated anti-VEGF injections accumulates or persists after treatment cessation, and whether the same PDR surveillance recommendations apply for DMO treated eyes. In this context, accounting for the exposure to anti-VEGF injections is important in patients with DR. Estimating the effect of intravitreal anti-VEGF for DMO treatment on PDR risk with real-world data is challenging due to confounding, variability in treatment regimens, uncertainty about cumulative effect, and the uncertain relevance of injections given at different time intervals. Methods that incorporate duration, number and timing of exposures have been suggested as the preferred approach to account for exposure effects. Novel methods model the history of drug exposure, such as the weighted cumulative exposure (WCE), flexibly representing the exposure's past effect on current risk through recency-weighted exposures.

The present study addresses a significant gap in our knowledge by utilising real-world, rather than modelled, data to examine the impact of anti-VEGF exposures on progression to PDR in individuals where the indication for anti-VEGF injections was DMO. We report PDR incidence rates (IRs) at the point of care to support clinical decision-making for patients receiving courses of intravitreal injections, which may last for years, and may occur in treatment pathways where the peripheral retina is not examined at every clinic visit.

### Diabetic retinopathy and the use of laser photocoagulation: is it cost-effective to treat early? [^c551f915]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) is usually administered at the high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HR-PDR) stage to preserve vision.

Administering PRP at an earlier stage of retinopathy (severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy) could be more cost-effective than delaying PRP until the HR-PDR stage.

A high-quality research trial of laser treatment at an earlier stage (before HR-PDR develops) in combination with antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs in reducing adverse effects is needed.

### Advances in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^6eae0152]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

As the diabetes epidemic in the United States continues to worsen, so too does the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is divided broadly into nonproliferative and proliferative stages, with or without vision-threatening macular edema. Progression to proliferative DR is associated with vision loss that is often irreparable, and a rapid decline in health-related quality of life. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is upregulated in the diabetic eye, and has been identified as a key driver of DR pathogenesis. With this perspective, we review the published phase III clinical trial data of anti-VEGF therapies approved for the treatment of DR in the United States. Using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale, in which an improvement of ≥ 2 steps is considered clinically significant, approximately one-third of patients with DR and macular edema experience this level of improvement after 1 year of treatment with either ranibizumab or aflibercept. The rates of clinically significant DR improvement with ranibizumab could be twice that in the subgroup of patients with moderately severe or severe nonproliferative DR and macular edema. These clinical trial data indicate that intraocular inhibition of VEGF is a rational approach for the management of DR.

### Diabetic retinal disease [^06182534]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus that is clinically characterized by changes in retinal microvasculature. Diabetic retinopathy is now better defined as diabetic retinal disease (DRD), as diabetes mellitus affects not only the retinal microvasculature but the whole retina, including neurons and glia. A global concerted effort to study preclinical and clinical signs of DRD and their association with visual acuity and patient-reported vision-related quality of life, and the integration of these features with systemic health and biochemical milieu in people with diabetes mellitus is underway. The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Retina Network trials and other researchers have provided substantial robust evidence on the current management of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy that includes proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema. Progress is also being made to develop, evaluate and implement cost-effective strategies for personalized screening, treatment and monitoring, incorporating artificial intelligence as clinical decision support tools, where appropriate. In addition, novel therapies and modes of delivery are being evaluated to increase durability of interventions and improve affordability to improve vision-related quality of life and reduce the global burden of blindness owing to DRD.

### A paradigm shift in the management approaches of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: role of anti-VEGF therapy [^5aa9f348]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the leading causes of vision loss globally. It principally causes upregulation of pro-angiogenic, proinflammatory, and vascular permeability factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to neovascularisation. The advanced stage of DR or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is of more concern, as it leads to vitreous haemorrhage and traction retinal detachment. Various risk factors associated with PDR include hyperglycemia, hypertension, neuropathy, dyslipidemia, anaemia, nephropathy, and retinal complications of drugs used for diabetes. Current management approaches for PDR have been stratified and involve pan-retinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy, and anti-VEGF agents. Given the emerging role of anti-VEGF agents as a favourable adjunct or alternative therapy, they have a critical role in the management of PDR. The review emphasises current management approaches for PDR focusing on anti-VEGF therapy. The review also highlights the risk/benefit evaluation of the various approaches employed for PDR management in various clinical scenarios.

### A review of anti-VEGF agents for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^2105bb6e]. Eye (2014). Low credibility.

Previous research has implicated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Although many studies reviewed the use of anti-VEGF for diabetic macular oedema, little has been written about the use of anti-VEGF for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This study is a review of relevant publications dealing with the use of anti-VEGF for the treatment of PDR. The articles were identified through systematic searches of PUBMED and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. At the end of each section, we summarized the level of evidence of the scientific literature. Off-label use of anti-VEGF agents was found to be beneficial in PDR, especially in cases with neovascular glaucoma, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, and before vitrectomy. The disadvantages of the use of anti-VEGF are its short-effect duration, causing tractional retinal detachment in cases with pre-existing pre-retinal fibrosis and endophthalmitis in rare cases. There is no conclusive evidence from large randomized trials regarding the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment in PDR. However, numerous case series, sound biochemical mechanism of action, and increasing experience with using anti-VEGF drugs can be used to support the ongoing use of this treatment modality in selected patients.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy — treatment course, progression, and follow-up show that in Protocol S at 2 years, 42% of PRP-treated eyes and 34% of ranibizumab-treated eyes demonstrated progression of PDR with vitreous hemorrhage most common. Follow-up adherence was problematic, with only two-thirds of living participants completing 5 years in Protocol S and a real-world lost-to-follow-up rate of 25% at 4 years. Combination therapy was common: in Protocol S, 58% of those assigned to PRP also received anti-VEGF for DME, and in CLARITY, 40% of participants had PRP at baseline before randomization.

Diabetic retinopathy — treatment modalities and long-term outcomes: Panretinal laser photocoagulation has been the primary treatment for proliferative retinopathy for decades and provides enduring effects, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies also inhibit neovascularization, and after 5 years of follow-up the rate of visual field sensitivity loss is equivalent between drug- and laser-treated groups; vitrectomy effectively restores vision for many with persistent vitreous hemorrhage, scarring, and detachment, and diabetic macular edema without proliferative retinopathy is not commonly treated with repeated anti-VEGF injections.

### Rationale and application of the protocol S anti-vascular endothelial growth factor algorithm for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^4af2540f]. Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To present the rationale, guidelines, and results of ranibizumab treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) Protocol S.

Design

Post hoc analyses from a randomized clinical trial.

Participants

Three hundred five participants (394 study eyes) having PDR without prior panretinal photocoagulation (PRP).

Methods

Intravitreous ranibizumab (0.5 mg) versus PRP for PDR. Ranbizumab-assigned eyes (n = 191) received monthly injections for 6 months unless resolution was achieved after 4 injections. After 6 months, injections could be deferred if neovascularization was stable over 3 consecutive visits (sustained stability). If neovascularization worsened, monthly treatment resumed. Panretinal photocoagulation could be initiated for failure or futility criteria.

Main Outcome Measures

Neovascularization status through 2 years.

Results

At 1 month, 19% (35 of 188) of ranibizumab-assigned eyes showed complete neovascularization resolution and an additional 60% (113) showed improvement. At 6 months, 52% (80 of 153) showed neovascularization resolution, 3% (4) were improved, 37% (56) were stable, and 8% (13) had worsened since the last visit. Among eyes with versus without resolved neovascularization at 6 months, the median (interquartile range) number of injections between 6 months and 2 years was 4 (1–7; n = 73) versus 7 (4–11; n = 67; P < 0.001). Injections were deferred in 68 of 73 eyes (93%) meeting sustained stability at least once during the study; 62% (42 of 68) resumed injections within 16 weeks after deferral. At 2 years, 43% (66 of 154) showed neovascularization resolution, 5% (7) showed improvement, 23% (36) were stable, and 27% (42) had worsened since the last visit. Only 3 eyes met criteria for failure or futility through 2 years.

Conclusions

The DRCR.net treatment algorithm for PDR can provide excellent clinical outcomes through 2 years for patients initiating anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy for PDR. When choosing between anti-VEGF and PRP as first-line therapy for PDR, treatment decisions should be guided by consideration of the relative advantages of each therapeutic method and anticipated patient compliance with follow-up and treatment recommendations.

### Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy [^0eed9194]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Inclusion criteria

Eligible study designs included prospective or retrospective cohort and case‐control longitudinal studies including participants who have not had previous treatment for DR. Although we initially planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating therapeutic interventions to prevent progression of DR where there was a control, untreated arm, ultimately we decided not to include these (see Differences between protocol and review). We also included studies based on longitudinal registry data. It was a mandatory requirement for inclusion in the review that studies had to evaluate prognostic factors specifically for the development and progression of PDR, as opposed to generalised progression of DR.

Studies investigating general microvascular complications of diabetes but including a subset of data related to factors involved in the development of PDR were eligible for inclusion if specific information on this group (PDR) was given.

Exclusion criteria

We excluded case reports, as they would have introduced selection bias, and editorials and letters to editors not containing primary data. We did not include cross‐sectional studies, as this type of study design is less appropriate for the evaluation of prognostic factors for the development or progression of disease.

Targeted population

The target population consisted of adults (≥ 18 years of age) of any gender with NPDR or PDR with less than HRC‐PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Studies including participants of all ethnicities, geographical locations, and socioeconomic status were eligible for inclusion. Any appropriate studies including a subset of relevant participants were considered as potentially eligible if data from this subset were given separately.

### Fenofibrate-a potential systemic treatment for diabetic retinopathy? [^cc9275c0]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review clinical and experimental data for fenofibrate as a possible systemic treatment for diabetic retinopathy.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Review of clinical studies focused on 2 major randomized controlled trials: the FIELD (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes)-Eye studies. Progression was defined in FIELD as laser treatment for proliferative retinopathy or macular edema or increase by ≥ 2 steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale, and in ACCORD-Eye as ≥ 3 steps (ETDRS scale) or proliferative disease requiring laser or vitrectomy treatment. Experimental studies investigating the mode of action of fenofibrate were reviewed.

Results

The 2 trials included 11 388 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, of whom 5701 were treated with fenofibrate (± statin) for up to 5 years. Fenofibrate reduced first laser treatment by 31% (P = 0.0002), and progression of diabetic retinopathy with absolute reductions of 5.0% over 5 years (P = 0.022, FIELD) and 3.7% over 4 years (P = 0.006, ACCORD-Eye). There was greater benefit in patients with than without preexisting retinopathy. The putative mechanisms implicated in the mode of action of fenofibrate involve lipid and nonlipid pathways, including beneficial effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, blood-retinal barrier breakdown, and neuroprotection.

Conclusions

There are now robust and consistent clinical data to recommend fenofibrate as an adjunctive treatment for early diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, taking into account the risks vs benefits of therapy. Further elucidating its mode of action will help to refine how best to use fenofibrate in the management of diabetic retinopathy.

### Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy [^93773526]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by neurovascular degeneration as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so-called "new vessels", at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high-risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC-PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one-fourth to one-third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre-retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre-retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight-threatening PDR stage. OBJECTIVES: To determine risk factors for the development of PDR and HRC-PDR in people with diabetes and DR.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The date of the search was 27 May 2022. Additionally, the search was supplemented by screening reference lists of eligible articles. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case-control longitudinal studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR, in people who have not had previous treatment for DR. The target population consisted of adults (≥ 18 years of age) of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR with less than HRC-PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full-text articles, to determine eligibility; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We considered prognostic factors measured at baseline and any other time points during the study and in any clinical setting. Outcomes were evaluated at three and eight years (± two years) or lifelong. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form that we developed and piloted prior to the data collection stage. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias. We conducted meta-analyses in clinically relevant groups using a random-effects approach. We reported hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and risk ratios (RR) separately for each available prognostic factor and outcome, stratified by different time points. Where possible, we meta-analysed adjusted prognostic factors. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework. MAIN RESULTS: We screened 6391 records. From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty-five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case-control studies. Twenty-three studies evaluated participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 19 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years. We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies. There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta-analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes (< 12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low- (LDL) and high- (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC-PDR. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR; therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight-threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.

### Using the past to inform the future: anti-VEGF therapy as a road map to develop novel therapies for diabetic retinopathy [^901aad6f]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

For the last 20 years, managing the metabolic deregulation induced by diabetes has been the primary and most effective way to slow the development and progression of microvascular complications including diabetic retinopathy (DR). After the appearance of clinically significant vascular lesions and macular edema, laser photocoagulation remains an effective approach to slow the loss of visual acuity. These established approaches have recently been extensively reviewed (rev. in). Unfortunately, ~20% of people with type 1 diabetes develop proliferative DR even under intense metabolic control by exogenous insulin, while others have inherent difficulties with maintaining proper euglycemia. Therefore, understanding the causative underlying mechanisms of DR remains of utmost importance in the treatment of this insidious disease. Basic and clinical research into the inflammatory cytokines and proangiogenic signals that drive DR has provided new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of diabetic eye disease. Importantly, anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME). The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network suggested that ranibizumab improves visual acuity outcomes in patients with DME. Subsequently, in the RISE clinical trial, 44.8% of patients treated with 0.3 mg ranibizumab for 24 months gained ≥ 15 letters improvement in visual acuity vs. 18% of sham-treated patients. In the RIDE study, 45.7% of patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab gained ≥ 15 letters vs. 12.3% of sham-treated patients. In addition to increases in visual acuity, improvements were observed in retinal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography and reduced risk of further vision loss. This success has provided much-needed therapeutic options and a blueprint to discover novel treatments for diabetic ocular complications.

Abstract

Background

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by neurovascular degeneration as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so‐called "new vessels", at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high‐risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC‐PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one‐fourth to one‐third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre‐retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre‐retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight‐threatening PDR stage.

Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema — treatment considerations indicate there is mounting evidence that anti‑VEGF treatment can improve the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS), and ranibizumab and aflibercept are both FDA approved to treat any degree of NPDR; however, under most circumstances, most retina specialists likely would not recommend invasive treatment for mild or moderate NPDR, although clinical trials indicate statistically significant anatomic benefit when treating eyes with DRSS levels 47 or 53, and currently there is no definitive answer, so observation remains a strong option and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) can be considered as well.

### Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy [^68471109]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The advent of intravitreal anti‐VEGF injections has become a pharmacological alternative to PRP (Cheung 2010). A 2014 Cochrane intervention review determined that evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficacy and safety of anti‐VEGF drugs in the treatment of PDR was of low quality, but did find a reduction in the risk of intraocular bleeding (Martinez‐Zapata 2014). Recent trials have shown that anti‐VEGFs are non‐inferior to PRP in the treatment of PDR (Gross 2015; Sivaprasad 2017). However, the great majority of participants included in these RCTs did not have HRC‐PDR, where laser PRP has been shown to be most beneficial. Furthermore, anti‐VEGFs appear not to have any beneficial effect on retinal ischaemia, which seems to continue to progress despite this treatment (Chatziralli 2022; Zhu 2021). Recent studies have shown that people with PDR who are treated with anti‐VEGF therapy alone and become temporarily lost to follow‐up are more susceptible to developing irreversible blindness when compared with those treated with laser PRP (Obeid 2018; Wubben 2019). Furthermore, anti‐VEGFs do not appear to be cost‐effective unless they are used to treat people with concomitant DMO and PDR (Hutton 2017). Given that several long‐term studies have verified that the beneficial effects of PRP generally last indefinitely (Chew 2003; Dogru 1999), PRP remains the mainstay therapy for PDR. Even with treatment, however, progression of PDR and the development of further complications may still occur in severe cases.

Moment of prognostication

The moment of prognostication is any time after an individual has been diagnosed as having diabetes and DR, and prior to the occurrence of PDR.

Anti-VEGF therapy

Anti-VEGF therapy has emerged as a pivotal advancement in treating DR, especially diabetic macular oedema (DME) and proliferative DR (PDR). VEGF plays a significant role in promoting the formation and permeability of blood vessels under both physiological and pathological conditions. In DR, excessive VEGF release leads to the proliferation of abnormal blood vessels and leakage from existing vessels, culminating in vision loss. Figure 2 displays the pathophysiological mechanisms of DR. The introduction of anti-VEGF therapy offers an effective treatment option for DR, directly targeting the disease's underlying vascular abnormalities. Through intraocular injections of anti-VEGF drugs, significant reductions in retinal VEGF levels are achieved, thereby decreasing vascular leakage and inhibiting abnormal neovascularisation, ultimately improving or stabilising vision.

Figure 2
Pathophysiological mechanisms of diabetic retinopathy. The onset of diabetes triggers a cascade of events leading to hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, which in turn causes damage to the retinal blood vessels. This damage initiates an increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes the formation of abnormal blood vessels, subsequently leading to complications such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema. These complications can result in retinal swelling and vision loss. Therapeutic interventions, such as laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGF injections, target these mechanisms to improve or stabilise vision.

### Diabetic retinopathy and the use of laser photocoagulation: is it cost-effective to treat early? [^76f48a9e]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss in the working age population and people with diabetes are 25 times more likely than the general population to go blind. Retinopathy can progress through various stages, starting with background (mild) non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), to moderate and severe NPDR, and in some patients to the most serious and sight-threatening form known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). If left untreated, this can lead to blindness.

A recent review concluded that rates of progression to PDR have fallen over recent times because of earlier identification and treatment of retinopathy, and improved control of blood glucose and blood pressure. Nevertheless, DR remains common. A study in Liverpool reported prevalences of any DR and PDR to be 46% and 4% in type 1 diabetes, and 25% and 0.5% in type 2 diabetes, respectively, although the prevalence will vary with mean duration of diabetes, with higher proportions of those with long duration having DR. However, a more recent study by Yau et al found that prevalence for PDR was much higher at 7%.

Scatter or panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP) is the standard treatment for DR, and in current practice it is administered mostly when DR reaches the high-risk (HR) PDR stage. The aim of PRP treatment is to preserve central vision. However, there are adverse events associated with laser such as visual field defects, retinal fibrosis and epiretinal membrane formation. The ability to drive can also be affected. These harms must be balanced against the benefits of earlier treatment at stages where the risk of blindness is lower. Trials comparing modern lasers with conventional methods have reported little difference in efficacy, but have fewer adverse effects. In recent years, antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs have become available, and are used for conditions including diabetic macular oedema (DMO). They have to be injected into the eye, but could be used to reduce the risk of DMO associated with PRP.

This paper assesses whether offering PRP treatment to patients with severe NPDR (intervention) could be cost-effective compared with delaying treatment until the HR-PDR stage ensues (usual care).

### Prognostic factors for the development and progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetic retinopathy [^d95f77e6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A Cochrane Review assessed the effects of intensive versus conventional glycaemic control on long‐term diabetic complications in people with T1D, and aimed to determine whether near normoglycaemic values are beneficial. The review confirmed that tight blood sugar control significantly reduced the risk of developing retinopathy (23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 768 participants; high‐quality evidence). However, the beneficial effect of tight blood sugar control seemed to become weaker once retinopathy was present (Fullerton 2014). A recent review, consisting of five RCTs with large sample sizes and long‐term follow‐up, found that in people with worse‐than‐moderate NPDR, intensive glycaemic control may not confer any benefits in terms of progression (Liu 2020).

International evidence‐based clinical practice guidelines recognise the benefit of glycaemic control (Fred Hollows Foundation 2015). However, current management approaches do not fully prevent progression to PDR, and there is no glycaemic threshold below which protection is certain (Diabetes Control and Complications Group 1993).

Prior to the undertaking of this systematic review, the current evidence on the effect of hypertension on progression to and within PDR seemed unclear. Although the Wisconsin Epidemiological Study of Diabetic Retinopathy determined hypertension to be associated with progression to PDR in people with T1D (Klein 1998), and the UKPDS identified a corresponding relationship in those with T2D (Turner 1998), other studies failed to corroborate these findings (Chew 2014; Harris 2013; Jin 2015). In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye study, intensive blood pressure control did not have a significant effect on retinopathy progression (Chew 2014). A Cochrane Review of 15 RCTs, including participants with T1D and T2D conducted mainly in North America and Europe, determined an association between reduced blood pressure and prevention of DR for up to four to five years (Do 2015). However, the review concluded that the available evidence did not support a benefit of intervention on blood pressure on progression to PDR or moderate/severe visual loss after five years of follow‐up. Similarly, a recent meta‐analysis concluded that intensive blood pressure control reduced relative risk of incidence of DR by 17% in T2D (Zhou 2018a). However, the available data were insufficient to confirm a relative risk reduction for DR progression or incidence of PDR (Zhou 2018a).

### Efficacy and safety of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy in diabetic retinopathy: what we have learned and what should we learn further? [^cefa7b78]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most frequent microvascular complications of diabetes that can lead to blindness. Laser treatment has been the gold standard treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) for many years. Recently, the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been established in the pathogenesis of DR, and the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy has gained popularity for the management of DR.

Areas Covered

This review includes a brief overview of the efficacy and safety of currently available (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept) and potential future (brolucizumab, faricimab, and KSI-301) anti-VEGF agents in patients with DR based mainly on publicly available data from phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials.

Expert Opinion

Clinical trials investigating the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept injections demonstrated favorable functional and anatomical outcomes in patients with DME. Moreover, the use of these anti-VEGF agents showed a significant improvement in the severity of DR. Recent clinical research for future anti-VEGF molecules aims to provide higher target-protein binding affinity and prolonged therapeutic effect. Brolucizumab, faricimab, and KSI-301 are three novel anti-VEGF agents that demonstrate promising data for the management of DME and potentially DR.

### Ranibizumab induces regression of diabetic retinopathy in most patients at high risk of progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^a21527e5]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) outcomes with ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA) treatment in patients with DR and diabetic macular edema (DME) at high risk of progression to proliferative disease.

Design

Post hoc analysis of the phase 3 RIDE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00473382) and RISE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00473330) clinical trials of ranibizumab for the treatment of DME.

Participants

Seven hundred forty-six patients with baseline fundus photographs and randomized for treatment.

Methods

Diabetic retinopathy outcomes were assessed through month 36 by baseline DR severity level. Diabetic retinopathy severity was quantified using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS).

Main Outcome Measures

Two-step or more or 3-step or more improvement or worsening on the ETDRS DRSS and time to new proliferative event (composite end point).

Results

At baseline, most patients were distributed evenly among mild or moderate nonproliferative DR (NPDR; ETDRS DRSS, 35/43), moderately severe or severe NPDR (ETDRS DRSS, 47/53), and proliferative DR (ETDRS DRSS, 60–75; 28.8%, 33.2%, and 31.1%, respectively). At month 24, rates of 2-step or more improvement with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, and sham treatment were highest among patients with baseline DR levels 47/53 (78.4%, 81.1%, and 11.6%, respectively) compared with patients with baseline DR levels 35/43 (10.3%, 15.8%, and 1.4%, respectively) or 60 through 75 without panretinal photocoagulation (31.0%, 36.4%, and 6.7%, respectively; all ranibizumab vs. sham comparisons, P < 0.05). In patients with baseline DR levels 47/53, ranibizumab treatment reduced the probability of patients experiencing a new proliferative event at month 36 by 3 times compared with sham treatment (12.4% and 11.9% vs. 35.2% for ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, and sham, respectively). In patients with baseline DR levels 47/53 who achieved 2-step or more DR improvement, improvements were independent of all assessed baseline characteristics (P > 0.4).

Conclusions

Ranibizumab treatment resulted in DR improvements in all 3 baseline DR severity subsets examined. The greatest benefits in DR improvement occurred in patients with baseline moderately severe to severe NPDR (DR levels 47/53). Diabetic retinopathy improvements were rapid, clinically meaningful, and sustained through month 36.

### Five-year outcomes of panretinal photocoagulation vs intravitreous ranibizumab for proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a randomized clinical trial [^6e21d28e]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Ranibizumab is a viable treatment option for eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) through 2 years. However, longer-term results are needed.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of 0.5-mg intravitreous ranibizumab vs panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) over 5 years for PDR.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluated 394 study eyes with PDR enrolled February through December 2012. Analysis began in January 2018.

Interventions

Eyes were randomly assigned to receive intravitreous ranibizumab (n = 191) or PRP (n = 203). Frequency of ranibizumab was based on a protocol-specified retreatment algorithm. Diabetic macular edema could be managed with ranibizumab in either group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean change in visual acuity (intention-to-treat analysis) was the main outcome. Secondary outcomes included peripheral visual field loss, development of vision-impairing diabetic macular edema, and ocular and systemic safety.

Results

The 5-year visit was completed by 184 of 277 participants (66% excluding deaths). Of 305 enrolled participants, the mean (SD) age was 52 (12) years, 135 (44%) were women, and 160 (52%) were white. For the ranibizumab and PRP groups, the mean (SD) number of injections over 5 years was 19.2(10.9) and 5.4(7.9), respectively; the mean (SD) change in visual acuity letter score was 3.1(14.3) and 3.0(10.5) letters, respectively (adjusted difference,0.6; 95% CI, -2.3 to 3.5; P = 0.68); the mean visual acuity was 20/25 (approximateSnellen equivalent) in both groups at 5 years. The mean (SD) change in cumulative visual field total point score was -330(645) vs -527(635) dB in the ranibizumab (n = 41) and PRP (n = 38) groups, respectively (adjusted difference,208 dB; 95% CI, 9–408). Vision-impairing diabetic macular edema developed in 27 and 53 eyes in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively (cumulative probabilities: 22% vs 38%; hazard ratio,0.4; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7). No statistically significant differences between groups in major systemic adverse event rates were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although loss to follow-up was relatively high, visual acuity in most study eyes that completed follow-up was very good at 5 years and was similar in both groups. Severe vision loss or serious PDR complications were uncommon with PRP or ranibizumab; however, the ranibizumab group had lower rates of developing vision-impairing diabetic macular edema and less visual field loss. Patient-specific factors, including anticipated visit compliance, cost, and frequency of visits, should be considered when choosing treatment for patients with PDR. These findings support either anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy or PRP as viable treatments for patients with PDR.

Antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for diabetic retinopathy (DR) regression in diabetic macular edema (DME) trials — post hoc analyses of the RISE/RIDE phase 3 trials showed 36% to 37% of ranibizumab-treated eyes achieved a 2 or more step improvement in diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) compared to 5% with sham. Improvement was more pronounced with higher baseline DRSS: among DRSS levels 47 to 53, 78% to 81% achieved a 2 or more step improvement at 2 years versus 10% to 16% for levels 35 to 43; based on these data, the FDA approved ranibizumab 0.3 mg for any level of DR with DME in 2015, and in 2017 approved ranibizumab 0.3 mg for any level of DR even without DME.

### Diabetic retinopathy and the use of laser photocoagulation: is it cost-effective to treat early? [^b1cc8973]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background/aims

The aim of the study was to explore whether it would be cost-effective to apply panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) at the severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (early treatment) stage, compared with waiting until high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (HR-PDR) characteristics (deferred treatment) developed.

Methods

A Markov model with a 30-year time horizon was developed, in which patients presenting with moderate NPDR could progress through all stages of DR (severe NPDR > early PDR > HR-PDR > severe PDR) to severe vision loss and blindness (and to death). A National Health Service and personal social services perspective was adopted. Transition probabilities were mainly derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study. Health state utilities, costs and complications were based on information from the literature, supplemented by expert opinion. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Results

Administering PRP at the severe NPDR stage could be more effective and less costly than waiting until HR-PDR developed. Sensitivity analyses gave similar results, with early treatment continuing to dominate deferred treatment. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that at willingness-to-pay threshold of £20–£30 000 per quality-adjusted life year, the probability of early treatment being cost-effective is 60%.

Conclusion

PRP administered at the severe NPDR stage is likely to be cost-effective compared with delaying photocoagulation until HR-PDR develops. However, given the limitations of the evidence, these results need to be interpreted with caution. A trial of early versus deferred laser therapy is needed to provide better data based on modern treatments.

### Anti-vascular endothelial growth factors in combination with vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^b0f18d08]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitrectomy is an established treatment for the complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). However, a number of complications can occur during and after vitrectomy for PDR. These include bleeding and the creation of retinal holes during surgery, and bleeding, retinal detachment and scar tissue on the retina after surgery. These complications can limit vision, require further surgery and delay recovery. The use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents injected into the eye before surgery has been proposed to reduce the occurrence of these complications. Anti-VEGF agents can reduce the amount and vascularity of abnormal new vessels associated with PDR, facilitating their dissection during surgery, reducing intra- and postoperative bleeding, and potentially improving outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of perioperative anti-VEGF use on the outcomes of vitrectomy for the treatment of complications for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 22 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at the use of anti-VEGFs and the incidence of complications in people undergoing vitrectomy for PDR. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed and extracted the data. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The critical outcomes of the review were the mean difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between study arms at six (± three) months after the primary vitrectomy, the incidence of early postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH, within four weeks postoperatively), the incidence of late POVCH (occurring more than four weeks postoperatively), the incidence of revision surgery for POVCH within six months, the incidence of revision surgery for recurrent traction/macular pucker of any type and/or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment within six months and vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) measures. Important outcomes included the proportion of people with a visual acuity of counting fingers (1.8 logMAR or worse), the number of operative retinal breaks reported and the frequency of silicone oil tamponade required at time of surgery.

Main Results

The current review includes 28 RCTs that looked at the pre- or intraoperative use of intravitreal anti-VEGFs to improve the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries (11 from China, three from Iran, two from Italy, two from Mexico and the remaining studies from South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia and Pakistan). The inclusion criteria for entry into the studies were the well-recognised complications of proliferative retinopathy: non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment involving the macula or combined tractional rhegmatogenous detachment. The included studies randomised a total of 1914 eyes. We identified methodological issues in all of the included studies. Risk of bias was highest for masking of participants and investigators, and a number of studies were unclear when describing randomisation methods and sequence allocation. Participants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better BCVA at six months compared to people undergoing vitrectomy alone (mean difference (MD) -0.25 logMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.11; 13 studies, 699 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduced the incidence of early POVCH (12% versus 31%, risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58; 14 studies, 1038 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Perioperative anti-VEGF use was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of late POVCH (10% versus 23%, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74; 11 studies, 579 eyes; high-certainty evidence). The need for revision surgery for POVCH occurred less frequently in the anti-VEGF group compared with control, but the confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (4% versus 13%, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; 4 studies 207 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Similar imprecisely measured effects were seen for revision surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (5% versus 11%, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.66; 4 studies, 145 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Anti-VEGFs reduce the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks (12% versus 31%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59; 12 studies, 915 eyes; high-certainty evidence) and the need for silicone oil (19% versus 41%, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.80; 10 studies, 591 eyes; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available on quality of life outcomes or the proportion of participants with visual acuity of counting fingers or worse.

Authors' Conclusions

The perioperative use of anti-VEGF reduces the risk of late POVCH, probably results in lower early POVCH risk and may improve visual outcomes. It also reduces the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks. The evidence is very uncertain about its effect on the need for silicone oil tamponade. The reported complications from its use appear to be low. Agreement on variables included and outcome standardisation is required in trials studying vitrectomy for PDR.

### Developing and validating models to predict progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^8654a42e]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Vision loss from diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged adults in the United States. In many patients, blindness associated with diabetic retinopathy can be prevented with appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment. There have been many studies aimed at identifying risk factors associated with progression of diabetic retinopathy. Large population-based studies and randomized controlled trials, such as the landmark ETDRS in the 1980s, informed us of the risk factors for diabetic retinopathy progression and helped to establish guidelines for screening and management. However, there have been improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatment for diabetes and diabetic retinopathy since many of those studies were first conducted, and the risk factors for diabetic retinopathy progression should be revisited.

In 2013, a study using health care claims data found that 6.7% of newly diagnosed nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) patients progressed to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with a median follow-up time of 1.7 years. Using a similar method to the ETDRS paper, they determined the risk factors for progression to PDR at 5 years were hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetic nephropathy, and non-healing ulcers. The investigators acknowledged intrinsic limitations to claims data including no clinical examination information (i.e. vitals, laboratory data, eye examination), no information about disease severity and duration using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 codes, and the inclusion of only insured patients. Electronic health record (EHR) data can help overcome many of these limitations. There has been significant adoption of EHRs in the United States in the last decade; they are used in nearly 90% of outpatient physician offices. Concurrently, newer statistical and machine-learning techniques have been developed, allowing researchers to better utilize and analyze the massive amount of EHR data available.

Diabetic retinopathy severity scales and risk — The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved DR grading as an approvable end point for clinical trials targeting pharmaceutical registration. The Airlie House classification, a consensus reached in 1968, was modified for the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) and then for the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), and the ETDRS Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS) has become the gold standard for research purposes. Levels 47 and 53 are highlighted as key levels for potential treatment of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) without diabetic macular edema (DME). Table 2 analyzes the 1- and 5-year risks for progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or high-risk PDR stratified by the DRSS, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology also published a simplified severity scale in 2003 for routine clinical use.

Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema — patient burden, Protocol V evidence, and follow-up risk: Patients with NPDR without DME are largely asymptomatic and will have to undergo multiple ongoing procedures with potential risk, which may be a relatively difficult paradigm for patients to understand. DRCR.net Protocol V recently demonstrated that there is no benefit in treating DME in patients with good vision (20/25 Snellen or better), whether with aflibercept, laser, or observation, as long as rescue treatment with aflibercept is possible if vision declines. Patients with diabetes tend to have comorbidities and are at risk for missing scheduled appointments because of medical issues and other barriers; therefore, there is a substantial risk of loss to follow-up during anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic retinopathy, which may result in adverse events.

Diabetic retinopathy is a progressive disease that results from vascular injury due to chronic hyperglycemia. It is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults in the US and is usually asymptomatic until late stages. Treatment with laser photocoagulation is effective at preventing severe vision loss; thus, diabetic patients should be referred for regular screening by an ophthalmologist. New inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor may provide targeted nonsurgical treatment to improve vision in diabetic retinopathy.

### Perspectives of diabetic retinopathy-challenges and opportunities [^30f0a2d2]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) may lead to vision-threatening complications in people living with diabetes mellitus. Decades of research have contributed to our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy from non-proliferative to proliferative (PDR) stages, the occurrence of diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and response to various treatment options. Multimodal imaging has paved the way to predict the impact of peripheral lesions and optical coherence tomography-angiography is starting to provide new knowledge on diabetic macular ischaemia. Moreover, the availability of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors has changed the treatment paradigm of DMO and PDR. Areas of research have explored mechanisms of breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, damage to pericytes, the extent of capillary non-perfusion, leakage and progression to neovascularisation. However, knowledge gaps remain. From this perspective, we highlight the challenges and future directions of research in this field.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of adult-onset blindness worldwide.–DR is observable via retinal examination and regular screening is recommended for those with diabetes;, however, it may also be present in individuals who are unaware of their diabetes status.

The burden of DR is largely attributed to its progression from mild and asymptomatic to severe and vision-threatening. In earlier stages of nonproliferative DR (NPDR), damage to the retinal microvasculature occurs as a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia and manifests as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, and the development of diabetic macular edema (DME). Without appropriate treatment, the resulting retinal ischemia promotes neovascularization characteristic of proliferative DR (PDR), leading to vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, neovascular glaucoma, and severe vision loss. This progression is accompanied by worsening vision-related quality of life and increasing functional burden.

Clinical guidelines, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Preferred Practice Pattern ® and American Diabetes Association (ADA) Position Statement, recommend regular monitoring for patients with DR to track disease progression and identify those who require referral and/or treatment. Recommended follow-up intervals are dependent on DR severity and the presence of DME, and have been shortened in updated AAO guidance to promote closer monitoring of patients with more advanced disease. Eye examinations are recommended every 1–2 years for patients with diabetes and no evidence of DR and then annually for those with mild NPDR. Current ADA and AAO guidelines recommend follow-up intervals of 6–9 months and 6–12 months for patients with moderate NPDR, respectively, decreasing to every 3–6 months and 3–4 months for those with severe NPDR. ADA guidelines recommend that patients with PDR are monitored every 3 months, whereas the AAO recommends follow-up every 2–4 months, depending on the presence of early or high-risk PDR. In addition to closer monitoring, patients with severe NPDR and PDR are typically indicated for treatment, with panretinal laser photocoagulation and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy representing the preferred treatment strategies in clinical guidance. For patients across all stages of DR, more frequent monitoring and earlier treatment are advised when concurrent DME, particularly center-involved DME, is present.

### Association of statin therapy with prevention of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy… [^0a967d34]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

associated with reduced risk of development of diabetic macular edema and progression of diabetic retinopathy. 16 Subsequently, a population-based study in Denmark showed that use of statins before receiving a diagnosis of diabetes decreased the cumulative incidence of diabetic retinopathy after diagnosis. 17 However, the effectiveness of regular statin therapy as the primary prevention of the development of retinopathy in patients with diabetes remains uncertain. We conducted this population-based study to explore the association of statin therapy with the prevention of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. We divided patients into those taking statins and those not taking statins. The index date for the statin group was the day of the first statin prescription. A graded correlation was found between intensity of statin therapy and diabetic retinopathy, with an overall rate of diabetic retinopathy of 13.

4% for patients administered low-intensity statin therapy,
6. 0% for patients administered moderate-intensity statin therapy, and 3. 4% for patients administered high-intensity statin therapy. This study investigated the association of statins with the prevention of diabetic retinopathy in a Taiwanese patient population with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. We found that statin use in patients with diabetes was associated with a decreased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and a lower need for invasive treatments for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. The benefit increased as the statin intensity and patient adherence increased. In our study, we found that statin use was associated with a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Statin therapy could delay and avert the development of diabetic retinopathy compared with patients not administered statin therapy, as statin users had a lower incidence of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. In vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, statin users had not only a lower incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy but also a lower rate of complications associated with diabetic retinopathy and fewer interventions, including retinal laser treatments, intravitreal injections, and vitrectomies. For patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia, statin therapy was associated with a decreased risk of diabetic retinopathy. Statin therapy could also retard the progression of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and reduce the number of subsequent retinal laser treatments, intravitreal injections, and vitrectomies.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases in the world. According to International Diabetes Federation Atlas 2021, it was estimated that approximately 537 million individuals in the world had diabetes (types 1 and 2), aged between 20 and 79 years representing 10.5% of the world population. India ranks second in terms of disease burden globally with around 74.2 million individuals having diabetes. The national survey conducted in India establishes the prevalence of DM to be 11.2%. It was established that diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major diabetes-related complication having vision loss as a global concern, leading to substantial financial implications. The global prevalence of DR was observed to be ranging between 22% and 35% in patients with diabetes as reported in different studies. In 2020, the individuals affected with DR is estimated to be 103.12 million which is projected to increase to 160.50 million by 2045. However, a disproportionate representation of DR is observed across geography where maximum prevalence is observed in Middle East and North Africa and the Western Pacific. Additionally, no significant inter-gender difference was observed in the DR prevalence (females: 25.93%; males: 28.95%). Sight-threatening DR or vision-threatening DR is defined as "presence of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and/or macular oedema in at least one eye". The incidence of sight-threatening DR is more in type 1 when compared with type 2 DM.

### Incidence of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and numbers needed to screen: a systematic review [^b1122771]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy is a chronic, potentially sight‐threatening complication of diabetes mellitus that can be detected by periodic screening of the fundus. For the classification of diabetic abnormalities, two grading schemes are used: the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study classification (ETDRS) and the more recent National Screening Committee (NSC) 1, 2. Absence of diabetic retinopathy is classified as '10' (ETDRS) or 'R0' (NSC). Aneurysms and small retinal haemorrhages may progress to mild, non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy or background diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS 20–35, NSC R1), or to moderate to severe non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS 43–53, NSC R2), and ultimately to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS ≥ 61, NSC R3) 1, 2. It is estimated that this progressive pattern takes on average ~17 years 3, 4. Regression from mild non‐proliferative diabetic retinopathy (R1) to no visible retinopathy occurs in up to 46% of cases 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. This regression is reinforced by effective treatment of hypertension and hyperglycaemia 3, 9.

Diabetic maculopathy or macular oedema (NSC M1) represents a spectrum of retinopathy symptoms characterized by oedema, fine macular exudates with or without haemorrhages and thickening of the central macula and surrounding non‐central macula. The gradings R2, R3 and M1 are classified as sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) or referable diabetic retinopathy.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (R3) is an urgent sight‐threatening condition, which needs a fast‐track referral for ophthalmological treatment to prevent loss of vision. All screen‐detected STDRs need comprehensive diagnosis, monitoring, and eventually treatment by an ophthalmologist. Timely screen detection of STDR and referral and treatment can prevent or slow down loss of visual acuity.

The incidence of STDR has decreased over the last decades 10, 11. Between 1991 and 2006, the screen‐detected prevalence of all referable diabetic retinopathy (R2 or R3 or M1) cases increased from 2.0% to 4.7% in the UK, but in that period the prevalence of the most severe STDR (R3 or M1) dropped by 91%: from 1.7% to 0.16% 12. Several authors suggest extending the screening interval for people with Type 2 diabetes without retinopathy at last screening session 13, 14, 15, 16 to 2 12, 17 or 3 years 18, 19, 20.

### VEHSS modeled estimates: prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) [^8b0a7e95]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- The Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System modeled estimate of DR is CDC's primary estimate of the prevalence of DR in the United States.
- VEHSS researchers used a statistical method called Bayesian meta-regression to combine information from multiple data sources to produce DR prevalence estimates among the entire US population in 2021.
- VEHSS includes crude and standardized estimates. Case definition
- DR in either eye.
- **Vision threatening DR**: severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, or diabetic macular edema in either eye.
- **Non-vision threatening DR**: Mild or moderate non-proliferative DR in either eye, and do not have vision threatening DR. Case definition DR is defined as having vision-threatening or non-vision threatening DR, as measured using the retinal imaging module of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Vision-Threatening DR: includes severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema in either eye. Non-Vision-Threatening DR: includes mild or moderate non-proliferative DR in either eye, and no vision threatening DR in either eye. Methods The VEHSS modeled estimates of DR were generated using a statistical modeling approach called Bayesian meta-regression, which is used to combine information from multiple VEHSS data sources into a single summary estimate. The VEHSS estimates use measured DR based on retinal imaging from the 2005–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey as the reference point dataset to create output based on the characteristics and performance of the NHANES retinal imaging exam. The population with diabetes was based on 2017–2020 NHANES data, including self-reported diabetes, self-reported use of insulin, or elevated blood hemoglobin A1C levels.

In addition to NHANES, the estimation model used population-based study data to provide additional evidence on the prevalence of DR by stage and demographic group, 2018 Medicare claims data to provide evidence on the single-year age trends and regional variation in DR, and 2021 American Community Survey data to estimate the underlying US population at risk for DR.

Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) — PRP is described as the standard of care based on DRS and ETDRS findings; in the DRS, patients with PDR in at least 1 eye had 1 eye randomly assigned to prompt PRP (either argon or xenon) and the other observed. Prompt PRP for high-risk PDR decreased the risk of severe vision loss (≤ 5/200) by 50%. The DRS laser burns were large (500 or 1000 μm for argon, or 3 or 4.5° for xenon), and constriction of the visual field to 45° or less occurred in 5% and 25% of eyes treated with argon and xenon, respectively, while a decrease in 1 or more lines of visual acuity occurred in 14% and 30% of eyes treated with argon and xenon, respectively. The ETDRS subsequently addressed PRP timing and intensity, enrolling a total of 3711 patients with moderate or severe NPDR or early PDR.

### Evaluation of intravitreal aflibercept for the treatment of severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy: results from the PANORAMA randomized clinical trial [^37643d90]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness globally. Disease severity ranges from nonproliferative DR (NPDR) to proliferative DR (PDR), with 13 distinct categories on the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS) developed in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). The microvascular ischemia associated with DR leads to vision loss, primarily through pathologic neovascularization of the retina and/or anterior segment and diabetic macular edema (DME). Increasing NPDR severity is associated with an increased risk of progression to PDR and vision loss.

Among patients with untreated eyes in the landmark Diabetic Retinopathy Study, after 4 years, 12.8% of eyes with severe NPDR, 20.9% of eyes with non–high-risk PDR, and 44.0% of eyes with high-risk PDR developed severe vision loss. The Diabetic Retinopathy Study established panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) as the cornerstone of treatment for PDR, providing a 57% reduction in the development of severe vision loss. Several clinical trials, including the phase 2 CLARITY (Clinical Efficacy and Mechanistic Evaluation of Aflibercept for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy) study and the DRCR Network Protocol S (Prompt Panretinal Photocoagulation Versus Intravitreal Ranibizumab With Deferred Panretinal Photocoagulation for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy) study, have found vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition to be highly effective, with some indications of superiority in specific outcomes compared with PRP. For patients with DME, intravitreal VEGF inhibitors have delivered substantial long-term visual gains compared with focal laser photocoagulation, establishing anti-VEGF therapy as the standard of care.

### Diabetic retinopathy [^526bb2e2]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and is a major cause of vision loss in middle-aged and elderly people. One-third of people with diabetes have DR. Severe stages of DR include proliferative DR, caused by the abnormal growth of new retinal blood vessels, and diabetic macular oedema, in which there is exudation and oedema in the central part of the retina. DR is strongly associated with a prolonged duration of diabetes, hyperglycaemia and hypertension. It is traditionally regarded as a microvascular disease, but retinal neurodegeneration is also involved. Complex interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by hyperglycaemia underlie the development of DR. These mechanisms include genetic and epigenetic factors, increased production of free radicals, advanced glycosylation end products, inflammatory factors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Optimal control of blood glucose and blood pressure in individuals with diabetes remains the cornerstone for preventing the development and arresting the progression of DR. Anti-VEGF therapy is currently indicated for diabetic macular oedema associated with vision loss, whereas laser photocoagulation prevents severe vision loss in eyes with proliferative DR. These measures, together with increasing public awareness and access to regular screening for DR with retinal photography, and the development of new treatments to address early disease stages, will lead to better outcomes and prevent blindness for patients with DR.

### The unmet need for better risk stratification of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^675b4eec]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for future studies

The studies presented in this review suggest that specific non‐proliferative retinopathy lesion patterns may be weighted to individual risks of developing sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy. To implement additional lesion measurements into current classification systems, robust natural history studies of lesion types are needed to fully characterize these non‐proliferative retinopathy progression profiles. Future studies investigating the systematic progression and regression and local distribution of different lesion types should be performed to identify markers of the risk of rapid progression to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy so that appropriate actions can be taken to prevent sight loss.

In addition to the standard stepwise changes on the diabetic retinopathy severity scale and best‐corrected visual acuity, valuable information on the progression of non‐proliferative retinopathy could be acquired in future clinical trials specifically to investigate treatment effects on early and reversible lesion changes. Suggested supplementary measurements are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Suggested supplementary measurements for non‐proliferative retinopathy lesion assessment

A detailed assessment of concomitant hypertension would be helpful, particularly in determining whether hypertensive retinopathy affects non‐proliferative retinopathy disease progression and whether specifically targeting hypertension would be more effective in the non‐proliferative retinopathy population.

Advances in adaptive optics can already reveal the microscopic changes that could help elucidate underlying pathology imaging such as vessel occlusion and the presence of leukostasis 50; therefore, future developments in imaging could involve high‐resolution visualization of retinal circulation. Further research is required to determine new blood biomarkers, retinal imaging markers, and genetic determinants of diabetic retinopathy. These findings will enable us to further our understanding of the pathogenesis, risk prediction, prevention, and treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

Current non‐proliferative retinopathy classifications are limited owing to their broad description of moderately severe and severe non‐proliferative retinopathy categories, which presents a challenge when predicting people with a high risk of progressing to sight‐threatening diabetic retinopathy, even if stratified by 'traditional' risk factors (such as diabetes duration, haemoglobin levels, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Furthermore, standard imaging techniques may not capture predominantly peripheral lesions. There is a clear unmet need for improved and earlier detection of moderate‐to‐severe non‐proliferative retinopathy to improve outcomes. It is hoped that combining a robust qualitative classification with quantitative metrics may allow us to better stratify people with non‐proliferative retinopathy. Clinical applications of this approach may prove useful in better understanding microvascular disease progression and may help point the way to more successful treatment regimens.

### Advances in the medical treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^64b0e9f4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) remains the leading cause of blindness among working-age individuals in developed countries. Diabetic macular edema (DME), another important event that occurs in diabetic retinopathy, is more frequent in type 2 than type 1 diabetes. Whereas PDR is the most common sight-threatening lesion in type 1 diabetes, DME is the primary cause of poor visual acuity in type 2 diabetes. Because of the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, DME is the main cause of visual impairment for diabetic patients. In addition, DME is almost invariably present when PDR is detected in type 2 diabetes. Neovascularization caused by severe hypoxia is the hallmark of PDR, whereas vascular leakage caused by the breakdown of the blood retinal barrier (BRB) is the main event involved in the pathogenesis of DME.

Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) natural history and prophylactic panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) — eyes with moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) had a 44% risk of developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in 5 years, rising to 66% for moderately severe NPDR, 75% to 81% for severe NPDR, and 90% for very severe NPDR; the respective 5-year rates for conversion to high-risk PDR were 27%, 39%, 56%, and 71%. Early prophylactic PRP did not significantly change visual acuity at 5 years, but reduced conversion to high-risk PDR to 8.5% to 13.7% (full PRP) and 16.6% to 21.4% (mild PRP) in mild to moderate NPDR, and to 26.3% to 28.8% (full PRP) and 40.3% to 46.7% (mild PRP) in severe NPDR or early PDR; in very long-term follow-up, a median of 16.7 years after initial treatments, all patients with severe NPDR or higher at closeout had received PRP after the study.

### Effect of intravitreous aflibercept vs vitrectomy with panretinal photocoagulation on visual acuity in patients with vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a randomized clinical trial [^94ec6c4e]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative diabetic retinopathy can cause loss of vision. The best management approach is unknown.

Objective

To compare initial treatment with intravitreous aflibercept vs vitrectomy with panretinal photocoagulation for vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial at 39 DRCR Retina Network sites in the US and Canada including 205 adults with vison loss due to vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative diabetic retinopathy who were enrolled from November 2016 to December 2017. The final follow-up visit was completed in January 2020.

Interventions

Random assignment of eyes (1 per participant) to aflibercept (100 participants) or vitrectomy with panretinal photocoagulation (105 participants). Participants whose eyes were assigned to aflibercept initially received 4 monthly injections. Both groups could receive aflibercept or vitrectomy during follow-up based on protocol criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mean visual acuity letter score (range, 0–100; higher scores indicate better vision) over 24 weeks (area under the curve); the study was powered to detect a difference of 8 letters. Secondary outcomes included mean visual acuity at 4 weeks and 2 years.

Results

Among 205 participants (205 eyes) who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 57 [11] years; 115 [56%] men; mean visual acuity letter score, 34.5 [Snellen equivalent, 20/200]), 95% (195 of 205) completed the 24-week visit and 90% (177 of 196, excluding 9 deaths) completed the 2-year visit. The mean visual acuity letter score over 24 weeks was 59.3 (Snellen equivalent, 20/63) (95% CI, 54.9 to 63.7) in the aflibercept group vs 63.0 (Snellen equivalent, 20/63) (95% CI, 58.6 to 67.3) in the vitrectomy group (adjusted difference, -5.0 [95% CI, -10.2 to 0.3], P = 0.06). Among 23 secondary outcomes, 15 showed no significant difference. The mean visual acuity letter score was 52.6 (Snellen equivalent, 20/100) in the aflibercept group vs 62.3 (Snellen equivalent, 20/63) in the vitrectomy group at 4 weeks (adjusted difference, -11.2 [95% CI, -18.5 to -3.9], P = 0.003) and 73.7 (Snellen equivalent, 20/40) vs 71.0 (Snellen equivalent, 20/40) at 2 years (adjusted difference, 2.7 [95% CI, -3.1 to 8.4], P = 0.36). Over 2 years, 33 eyes (33%) assigned to aflibercept received vitrectomy and 34 eyes (32%) assigned to vitrectomy received subsequent aflibercept.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among participants whose eyes had vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative diabetic retinopathy, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of mean visual acuity letter score over 24 weeks following initial treatment with intravitreous aflibercept vs vitrectomy with panretinal photocoagulation. However, the study may have been underpowered, considering the range of the 95% CI, to detect a clinically important benefit in favor of initial vitrectomy with panretinal photocoagulation.

### Loss to follow-up in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema [^4a1fd055]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Effective management of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) requires reliable patient follow-up to prevent disease progression.

Objective

To investigate the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with being lost to follow-up (LTFU) among individuals with PDR or DME treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal injections (IVIs) or panretinal photocoagulation (PRP).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included a multicenter, retrospective review of patients with PDR or DME treated in Toronto, Canada, from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from February 1 to May 31, 2024.

Exposures

All patients received at least 1 anti-VEGF IVI or PRP session.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the LTFU rate, defined as the absence of an ophthalmic visit or intervention in the 1-year period following an individual's last visit with the treating retinal specialist. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to evaluate associations between sociodemographic and clinical factors with the LTFU rate.

Results

Overall, 2961 patients with PDR or DME (mean [SD] age, 71 [13] years; 1640 [55.4%] male) were included, of whom 507 (17.1%) were LTFU over a mean (SD) follow-up period of 61 (22) months. In the multivariable analysis, older patients (age ≥ 85 years vs age < 65 years: odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40–0.81; P = 0.002), those with worse baseline visual acuity (> 20/200 Snellen vs 20/40 Snellen or better: OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.97; P = 0.04), those with DME (OR vs no DME, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.83; P = 0.003), those with frequent clinic visits (≥ 6 visits vs < 6 visits: OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.98; P = 0.04), and those with a high anti-VEGF IVI burden in the first year (OR vs low anti-VEGF burden, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21–0.76; P = 0.006) were less likely to be LTFU. In contrast, males (OR vs females, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04–1.52; P = 0.04), patients living further from the point of care (> 200 vs ≤ 20 km OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.85–3.76; P < .001), and those treated with PRP (OR vs anti-VEGF IVIs, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.24–3.55; P < .001) were more likely to be LTFU. Compared with White patients, Black patients (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.50–2.95; P < .001) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05–2.21; P = 0.03) were more likely to be LTFU.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found multiple factors associated with LTFU rates. Identifying individuals at higher risk of LTFU and developing targeted strategies may reduce disease progression and vision loss in individuals with PDR.

Arguments for treating nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy levels 47 and 53 without diabetic macular edema with anti‑VEGF agents include that through year 1 of PANORAMA, treatment significantly decreased the probability of developing PDR and center‑involving DME and that a cumulative risk of 41% of vision‑threatening progression in moderately severe and severe NPDR is not negligible; additional considerations note earlier intervention can achieve better outcomes in exudative conditions such as center‑involving DME, anti‑VEGF may be able to slow development and progression of retinal nonperfusion with further studies required, and NPDR may be associated with reduced visual function and quality‑of‑life measures in epidemiologic studies.

### The evolving treatment of diabetic retinopathy [^e7f83fd7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

With the recent expansion of management options for diabetic retinopathy, optimal sequences of treatment application and combination in specific clinical situations are under investigation. A review and synthesis of the ophthalmologic literature on treatment of diabetic retinopathy was performed to provide perspective on the relative prioritization of the various treatments in the contexts seen in clinical practice. In general, pharmacotherapy is ascendant, particularly with the anti-VEGF class, while laser treatment continues to have lesser roles in specific situations and under certain economic constraints. Surgical intervention continues to be reserved for those situations which fail to respond to pharmacotherapy, laser or combination therapy. Ongoing refinements in the systemic management of both hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia continue to demonstrate significant benefits for both diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Recent developments involving newer retinal diagnostics are proving beneficial in optimizing both initiation and maintenance of therapy. As well, recent advances in novel pharmaceutical agents and ocular drug delivery methods show promise in better controlling the disease as well as reducing the burden of treatment.

We systematically reviewed studies published from Jan 1, 1980, to Jan 7, 2018, assessed the methodological quality, and described variations in incidence of diabetic retinopathy by region with a focus on population-based studies that were conducted after 2000 (n = 8, including two unpublished studies). Of these eight studies, five were from Asia, and one each from the North America, Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. The annual incidence of diabetic retinopathy ranged from 2·2% to 12·7% and progression from 3·4% to 12·3%. Progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy was higher in individuals with mild disease compared with those with no disease at baseline. Our Review suggests that more high-quality population-based studies capturing data on the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy with stratification by age and sex are needed to consolidate the evidence base. Our data is useful for conceptualisation and development of major public health strategies such as screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^2caf8449]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy — high-risk PDR definition and treatment effect: the presence of any three of the following four features characterizes DRS high-risk PDR; neovascularization at any location; neovascularization at or near the optic disc; at least moderate neovascularization defined as new vessels within 1 disc diameter of the optic nerve head that are larger than one-quarter to one-third disc area in size or new vessels elsewhere that are at least one-half disc area in size; or vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage; the DRS showed that the risk of severe visual loss among patients with high-risk PDR is high and is reduced substantially by PRP.

### Does laser still have a role in the management of retinal vascular and neovascular diseases? [^17ad8ee3]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To discuss the current role of laser therapies in the management of retinal vascular and neovascular diseases.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Laser's role in the management of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and venous occlusive disease is discussed, with emphasis on comparing laser with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and discussion of situations where these treatment methods can be complementary.

Results

Thermal panretinal photocoagulation remains the usual practice for treatment of neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and after venous occlusive events. Focal/grid laser still has a role for patients with macular edema resulting from diabetes or venous occlusion that is poorly responsive to anti-VEGF agents and in patients who are unable or unwilling to return for frequent injections. Focal/grid laser also is used as combination therapy with anti-VEGF agents for these indications. Focal laser can be used for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization to avoid the treatment burden and risks of multiple injections. Photodynamic therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy and idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and as combination therapy with anti-VEGF agents in age-related macular degeneration.

Conclusions

Anti-VEGF agents are effective in preventing vision loss and improving vision in multiple diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusions. Despite a substantial decrease in its use for these conditions in recent years, laser therapies continue to serve important roles in our ability to combat retinal pathologic features and will remain a pivotal component of our practices for at least the next several years.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^2507437e]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) management: When high-risk PDR is present, PRP or intravitreous anti-VEGF agents should be considered and should not be delayed. Panretinal laser photocoagulation can exacerbate DME in some individuals. Persons receiving PRP for severe NPDR or early PDR have similar risks of developing macular edema whether PRP is delivered in a single session or over four sessions, and a single session may reduce travel and lost productivity costs. Since the relative risk of vision loss in patients without high-risk characteristics is low, treatment of CSME or central-involved DME should be considered before PRP is used.

### Diabetic retinopathy: pathogenic mechanisms and current treatments [^a2aba5c2]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Since diabetes is now a global epidemic, the incidence of retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness in patients aged 20–74 years, is also expected to rise to alarming levels. The risk of development and progression of diabetic retinopathy is closely associated with the type and duration of diabetes, blood glucose, blood pressure and possibly lipids. It is an unmet medical need that can lead to severe and irreversible loss of vision in people of working age worldwide. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the clinical and anatomical changes during the progression of retinopathy, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms that link hyperglycemia with retinal tissue damage, current treatments, and the emerging pharmacological therapies for this sight-threatening complication of diabetes.

### Can the retinal screening interval be safely increased to 2 years for type 2 diabetic patients without retinopathy? [^91097313]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy is a serious complication for people with diabetes that can lead to blindness or severe vision loss. Although retinopathy cannot be cured, its progression can be slowed or halted, and laser treatment can prevent visual loss if offered promptly at the proliferative stage. Diabetic digital retinal photography is an effective method of detecting the onset of treatable retinopathy. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the U.K. currently recommend that people with diabetes are screened for retinopathy annually, or every 3–6 months for those patients who have developed beyond mild background retinopathy or who are at higher risk of progression. This also forms part of the National Screening Committee's policy of a national screening program for diabetes in the U.K.

The development of retinopathy may take decades, and the annual screening of all diabetic patients may therefore incur considerable cumulative health service cost and patient inconvenience that, for some, may be unjustified. With a significant increase in diabetes incidence forecast in the U.K. it is imperative that screening policies for diabetes complications are cost-effective and practicable. It is therefore prudent to ask whether it would be cost-effective and safe to screen diabetic patients for retinopathy less frequently, particularly in light of more recent evidence that suggests an overall decline in the rates at which people with diabetes are developing vision-threatening retinopathy.

We undertook a collaborative project with the Royal Devon and Exeter National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust (henceforth referred to simply as Royal Devon and Exeter), which carries out annual retinopathy screening for a population of ∼20,000 patients across Devon. Using simulation modeling, we assessed the potential impact of implementing a 2-year retinopathy screening interval for those patients without retinopathy and who have type 2 diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy may progress more quickly in patients with type 1 diabetes (,–), and although it has been shown that less frequent screening may be feasible for type 1 patients, we focus on the lower-risk type 2 diabetic patient group in this study. Previous studies have looked at the cost-effectiveness of longer screening intervals for diabetic retinopathy screening across all patients in a population, but we assessed an increased screening interval solely for those patients who have not yet been diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy. These patients represent ∼40% of the type 1 and type 2 diabetic population screened by Royal Devon and Exeter, and reductions in the frequency with which they are screened could therefore lead to large potential cost and resource savings.

### Visual field changes over 5 years in patients treated with panretinal photocoagulation or ranibizumab for proliferative diabetic retinopathy [^e3b17cbf]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Preservation of peripheral visual field (VF) is considered an advantage for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents compared with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Long-term data on VF are important when considering either treatment approach.

Objective

To further evaluate changes in VF throughout 5 years among eyes enrolled in the Protocol S clinical trial, conducted by the DRCR Retina Network.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Post hoc analyses of an ancillary study within a multicenter (55 US sites) randomized clinical trial. Individuals with eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy enrolled in Protocol S were included. Data were collected from February 2012 to February 2018. Analysis began in June 2018.

Interventions

Panretinal photocoagulation or intravitreous injections of 0.5-mg ranibizumab. Diabetic macular edema, whenever present, was treated with ranibizumab in both groups. Panretinal photocoagulation could be administered to eyes in the ranibizumab group when failure or futility criteria were met.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean change in total point score on VF testing with the Humphrey Field Analyzer 30–2 and 60–4 test patterns.

Results

Of 394 eyes enrolled in Protocol S, 234 (59.4%) were targeted for this ancillary study. Of these, 167 (71.4%) had VF meeting acceptable quality criteria at baseline (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [43–58] years; 90 men [53.9%]). At 5 years, 79 (33.8%) had results available. The mean (SD) change in total point score in the PRP and ranibizumab groups was -305 (521) dB and -36 (486) dB at 1 year, respectively, increasing to -527 (635) dB and -330 (645) dB at 5 years, respectively (P = 0.04). After censoring VF results after PRP treatments in the ranibizumab group, the 5-year mean change in total point score was -201 (442) dB. In a longitudinal regression analysis of change in total point score including both treatment groups, laser treatment was associated with a mean point decrease of 208 (95% CI, 112–304) dB for the initial PRP session, 77 (95% CI, 21–132) dB for additional PRP sessions, and 325 (95% CI, 211–439) dB for endolaser. No association was found between change in point score and the number of ranibizumab injections during the previous year (-9 per injection [95% CI, -22 to 3]).

Conclusions and Relevance

The limited data available from Protocol S suggest that there are factors besides PRP associated with VF loss in eyes treated for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Further clinical research is warranted to clarify the finding.

5.8. Limitations and drawbacks to current therapies

Whilst a number of therapeutic strategies are available to clinicians for the treatment of DR, no treatment is yet to fully attenuate clinical progression to reverse damage to the retina. Further, a large number of patients do not respond to certain treatments at all, and patient outcomes are often limited in many cases. A summary of the limitations and drawbacks to existing therapies is given in Table 1.

### Aspirin in diabetic retinopathy. A systematic review [^03f6ee34]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for eye disease that can lead to blindness. There have been both concerns that aspirin use might worsen diabetic retinopathy, as well as hopes that aspirin might be beneficial in treating it. We investigated whether there are beneficial effects of aspirin alone and in combination with other antiplatelet agents in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, and the relative hazards for the development of high-risk proliferative retinopathy following aspirin treatment. We conducted a sensitive search for randomized controlled trials combined with index terms for identifying studies on aspirin treatment in diabetic retinopathy in the Cochrane Library (issue 4, 2001) and Medline (1966 to October, 2001). We examined randomized controlled clinical trials in diabetic patients with (non) proliferative diabetic retinopathy and aspirin treatment alone or in combination with dipyramidole versus placebo administration. Two independent reviewers judged trial eligibility, collected details of study population, interventions, and outcomes using a standard data extraction form. One reviewer assessed the quality of trial reporting. We identified six publications pertinent to our objective. Aspirin dosages ranged from 650 mg to 990 mg daily, the dose of dipyridamole, used in only one trial, was 225 mg per day. Studies lasted 8 weeks to 5 years. All trials showed that aspirin alone or in combination with dipyridamole neither lowered nor increased the risk of the development of diabetic retinopathy. The results suggest that there are no ocular contraindications to taking aspirin if required as part of a treatment for cardiovascular diseases or other medical indications.

### A review of advancements and evidence gaps in diabetic retinopathy screening models [^dc527c14]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes with a prevalence of ~35%, and is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in people of working age in most developed countries. The earliest stage of DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), may progress to sight-threatening DR (STDR). Thus, early detection of DR and active regular screening of patients with diabetes are necessary for earlier intervention to prevent sight loss. While some countries offer systematic DR screening, most nations are reliant on opportunistic screening or do not offer any screening owing to limited healthcare resources and infrastructure. Currently, retinal imaging approaches for DR screening include those with and without mydriasis, imaging in single or multiple fields, and the use of conventional or ultra-wide-field imaging. Advances in telescreening and automated detection facilitate screening in previously hard-to-reach communities. Despite the heterogeneity in approaches to fit local needs, an evidence base must be created for each model to inform practice. In this review, we appraise different aspects of DR screening, including technological advances, identify evidence gaps, and propose several studies to improve DR screening globally, with a view to identifying patients with moderate-to-severe NPDR who would benefit if a convenient treatment option to delay progression to STDR became available.

### Shifts in ophthalmic care utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US [^0b07ca08]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy, which is present in roughly a third of people with diabetes, is the most common cause of blindness among working aged adults (e.g. ages 20–74) globallyand in the United States. With over 150 million people affected worldwideand 9.6 million in the US, DR is the only leading cause of blindness and visual impairment that is experiencing an increase in age-standardized prevalence. In the absence of appropriate intervention, DR progresses from mild to more severe stages; but with early detection and timely treatment, 90–95% of blindness caused by vision-threatening DR can be prevented. Management strategies for DR, including the recommended follow-up frequency (ranging from once every 12 months to more frequently for more rapidly progressing disease) and treatment approaches (such as laser surgery treatments and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, among others), are tailored based on the severity of the retinopathy as well as the presence and vision-threatening status of DME, which is the accumulation of fluid in the macula due to leaky blood vessels. Because it is common for patients with DR to remain asymptomatic for years, even at some more advanced stages, annual screenings via dilated eye exams are recommended for individuals with diabetes; however, the actual rates of screenings and ophthalmic care referrals have not met guideline recommendations. Furthermore, for certain forms of DR, such as high-risk proliferative DR (PDR), prompt treatment is required. Thus, the persistent declines in visits we are finding for diagnoses of both non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and PDR, with or without DME, may suggest a looming challenge in the effective management of this condition at the population level.
