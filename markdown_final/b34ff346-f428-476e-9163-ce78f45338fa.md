## Question

How often should Keppra levels be drawn?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often levetiracetam (Keppra) levels should be drawn and in which clinical scenarios therapeutic drug monitoring is warranted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether routine level monitoring is recommended for all patients. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale that might justify or obviate routine levels. Next, I will identify the specific high-risk scenarios where monitoring changes outcomes, especially pregnancy and renal impairment. After that, I should consider other special populations and clinical questions like suspected nonadherence, toxicity, and polytherapy. Finally, I will synthesize practical timing and targets, and close with a concise, clinically actionable recommendation anchored to the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the general principle: routine therapeutic drug monitoring of levetiracetam is not recommended for most patients. Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence here. A randomized controlled trial comparing systematic versus rescue TDM of newer ASMs, including levetiracetam, showed no improvement in seizure control or tolerability with routine level checks, supporting a rescue-only approach in most cases [^113kJzcB]. I should also note that expert reviews emphasize poor correlation between plasma levels and clinical effect for levetiracetam, reinforcing that routine levels rarely change management when patients are doing well [^116mXZZ5] [^115NA1Ef].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetic rationale next. Levetiracetam has linear kinetics, minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and predictable renal clearance, which together make dose–exposure relationships relatively straightforward and reduce the need for routine levels in stable patients with normal renal function [^1126hi8m] [^115NA1Ef]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup deviates from this pattern; yes, neonates and very young infants have rapidly maturing renal function and changing clearance, so PK variability is high in that group, which can justify more frequent monitoring if used off-label in neonates [^117PQ8fV].

> Now, pregnancy is the clearest scenario where monitoring changes outcomes. I should confirm the magnitude of change: levetiracetam clearance rises substantially during pregnancy, with levels falling by roughly 40–60% by the third trimester, and abrupt postpartum rebound is common, so dose adjustments guided by levels are often necessary to maintain seizure control [^117AEbK1] [^113d9C5d]. Let me verify the monitoring cadence; contemporary cohorts and practice recommendations support checking levels about every 1–2 months during pregnancy and again early postpartum, with individualized targets often framed as maintaining levels at or above a percentage of the preconception concentration/dose ratio, for example above about 46–65% depending on baseline seizure control and risk profile [^117AEbK1] [^115jZReA]. I should also remember to enroll patients in the NAAED pregnancy registry when applicable [^113d9C5d].

> Renal impairment is the next high-yield indication. I should double-check the clearance reductions: total clearance falls by about 40% with CrCl 50–80 mL/min, 50% with CrCl 30–50 mL/min, and 60% with CrCl < 30 mL/min, necessitating dose reductions and, in many cases, level checks to ensure we are neither under- nor overdosing as kidney function fluctuates or dialysis is initiated [^115tDrFL] [^111YeVwS]. But wait, what if the patient is on peritoneal dialysis where PK data are sparse; case-based evidence suggests prolonged half-life and accumulation, so periodic levels can help prevent neurotoxicity in PD patients, especially with dose changes or intercurrent illness [^111YeVwS].

> Let me consider other special populations and clinical questions. In suspected nonadherence, a single level can be misleading; I should confirm that comparing a current level to a previously established individual reference range is more informative than using population "therapeutic ranges", which are not well validated for levetiracetam [^116mXZZ5]. In patients with toxicity on apparently standard doses, particularly the elderly or those with fluctuating renal function, a level can help distinguish supratherapeutic exposure from other causes and guide dose reduction or slower titration [^116mXZZ5]. In polytherapy, levels can occasionally help adjudicate which agent is most likely contributing to adverse effects, though I need to be cautious because low levels do not exclude toxicity and high levels do not guarantee causality [^116mXZZ5]. For neonates, given rapid maturation of renal function in the first week of life, more frequent PK assessment may be justified if levetiracetam is used, acknowledging off-label status and limited data [^117PQ8fV].

> I should confirm whether there are any scenarios where establishing a baseline level is useful even if no immediate change is planned. Establishing an individual reference concentration when a patient is clinically stable can be valuable for future comparisons if seizures break through or toxicity emerges, especially in patients with infrequent seizures where titration to effect is impractical [^116mXZZ5]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even with a baseline, decisions should still prioritize clinical response and tolerability rather than chasing a numeric "therapeutic range" that is not well defined for levetiracetam [^116mXZZ5].

> Next, I should review practical timing and targets. For pregnancy, I will plan trough levels every 1–2 months and within 1–2 weeks postpartum, aiming to keep the concentration/dose ratio at or above roughly 46–65% of the preconception value depending on baseline seizure control and risk, with dose adjustments as needed and close clinical follow-up for breakthrough seizures or sedation [^117AEbK1] [^115jZReA]. For renal impairment, I will check a level 3–5 days after a dose change or after initiating dialysis, and repeat if symptoms, seizures, or kidney function change, using clinical judgment rather than a fixed interval schedule [^1126hi8m]. For suspected nonadherence or toxicity, I will obtain a trough level and compare to the patient's own prior levels when available, recognizing that population reference ranges are not reliable for levetiracetam [^116mXZZ5].

> I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing from inpatient neurocritical care settings to ambulatory care. Some TBI and ICU protocols describe "therapeutic ranges" and weight-based targets for levetiracetam, but those practices reflect institutional protocols and different risk–benefit tradeoffs in critically ill patients; they do not support routine outpatient TDM in stable community dwellers with normal renal function [^116rm4dy]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought those ICU data might imply broader TDM utility, but I should correct that inference and keep the inpatient and outpatient contexts distinct [^116rm4dy].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows. Routine levetiracetam level monitoring is not indicated for most patients; management should be driven by clinical seizure control and tolerability, with dose titration to effect and attention to renal function and drug interactions [^113kJzcB] [^116mXZZ5]. Levels should be checked in pregnancy about every 1–2 months and early postpartum due to marked PK changes, with individualized targets anchored to preconception concentration/dose ratios to maintain seizure control [^117AEbK1] [^115jZReA]. Levels are also appropriate after dose changes in renal impairment, when initiating or modifying dialysis, or when toxicity or nonadherence is suspected, ideally interpreted against the patient's own prior levels rather than population ranges [^111YeVwS] [^116mXZZ5]. For neonates and other special populations, I will individualize monitoring frequency based on PK variability and clinical status, recognizing the limited evidence base and prioritizing safety and seizure control in shared decision-making [^117PQ8fV].

Routine levetiracetam (Keppra) levels are **not required** for most patients because of predictable pharmacokinetics and a wide therapeutic index [^113kJzcB] [^115NA1Ef]. Monitoring is indicated only in **specific scenarios**: pregnancy (levels fall ~40–60%, especially in the third trimester) [^113d9C5d] [^115jZReA], renal impairment (dose-adjusted to creatinine clearance) [^114TtgYJ], suspected nonadherence, or toxicity [^116mXZZ5]. When needed, obtain a trough level before a dose change or after 3–5 days at a new dose, and repeat if seizures recur or toxicity is suspected. Routine monitoring is not recommended for stable patients with normal renal function [^113kJzcB].

## Clinical scenarios requiring levetiracetam level monitoring

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for monitoring** | **Recommended frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Pregnancy | Physiological changes significantly reduce levetiracetam plasma concentrations, especially in the third trimester, increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures [^113d9C5d] [^115jZReA] | - Baseline pre-pregnancy level <br/> - Monthly during pregnancy <br/> - Postpartum within 1–2 weeks after delivery |
| Renal impairment | Levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted; impaired renal function necessitates dose adjustments to prevent accumulation and toxicity [^114TtgYJ] | - Baseline level <br/> - After any dose change <br/> - Periodically based on renal function stability |
| Suspected nonadherence | Monitoring can help differentiate true pharmacoresistance from nonadherence, guiding appropriate clinical decisions [^116mXZZ5] | - Single level when nonadherence is suspected <br/> - Compare with previous levels if available |
| Toxicity or adverse effects | Monitoring can help identify supratherapeutic levels in patients experiencing adverse effects such as somnolence, fatigue, or behavioral changes [^111YeVwS] | - Single level when toxicity is suspected <br/> - Repeat if symptoms persist or dose is adjusted |

---

## Clinical scenarios not requiring routine monitoring

Routine monitoring is **not recommended** for patients with stable seizure control, normal renal function, and no pregnancy, given predictable pharmacokinetics and a wide therapeutic index [^113kJzcB] [^115NA1Ef]. In these patients, clinical response and adverse effects should guide dosing adjustments [^116mXZZ5].

---

## Recommended frequency of levetiracetam level monitoring

- **Baseline measurement**: Obtain a baseline level before initiating therapy or before significant dose changes, especially in patients with renal impairment or pregnancy.

- **After dose changes**: Recheck levels 3–5 days after any dose adjustment to ensure steady-state concentrations and clinical response.

- **Routine monitoring**: Not required for stable patients with normal renal function and consistent seizure control.

- **Pregnancy**: Monthly monitoring throughout pregnancy, with additional checks if breakthrough seizures occur or dose changes are made [^117AEbK1] [^115jZReA].

- **Postpartum**: Within 1–2 weeks after delivery, as levels may rise rapidly after childbirth, necessitating dose adjustments [^117AEbK1].

---

## Factors influencing levetiracetam plasma concentrations

Several factors can **significantly affect levetiracetam plasma concentrations**, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments:

- **Renal function**: Levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted; impaired renal function significantly increases plasma concentrations, requiring dose adjustments [^114TtgYJ].

- **Pregnancy**: Physiological changes during pregnancy significantly reduce levetiracetam plasma concentrations, particularly in the third trimester [^113d9C5d] [^115jZReA].

- **Age**: Elderly patients may have reduced renal function, necessitating dose adjustments and monitoring [^1126hi8m].

- **Drug interactions**: Levetiracetam has minimal drug interactions, but concomitant medications affecting renal function may indirectly influence levetiracetam levels [^114CiUnS].

---

## Clinical implications of subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic levels

Subtherapeutic levels increase the risk of **breakthrough seizures** and reduced efficacy, whereas supratherapeutic levels increase the risk of adverse effects such as somnolence, fatigue, and behavioral changes [^115jZReA] [^1173uQzm]. Therefore, maintaining therapeutic levels is crucial for optimal seizure control and minimizing adverse effects [^115jZReA] [^1173uQzm].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Routine levetiracetam level monitoring is **not required** for most patients because of predictable pharmacokinetics and a wide therapeutic index [^113kJzcB]. Monitoring is indicated in specific scenarios such as pregnancy, renal impairment, suspected nonadherence, or toxicity. When monitoring is indicated, obtain trough levels before dose changes or after 3–5 days at a new dose, and repeat if seizures recur or toxicity is suspected.

5.9 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age using an oral formulation of KEPPRA, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the KEPPRA-treated patients (17%), compared to placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the KEPPRA and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.

Monitor patients 1 month to < 4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

5.10 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including levetiracetam, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking levetiracetam injection during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1–888–233–2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Prolonged experience with levetiracetam in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature, which includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, neurobehavioral alterations in offspring) at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

Clinical Considerations

Levetiracetam blood levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response.

### Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epilepsy – focus on pregnancy (an evidence-based review): vitamin K, folic acid, blood levels, and breastfeeding: report of the quality standards subcommittee and therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society [^113UaXoW]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To reassess the evidence for management issues related to the care of women with epilepsy (WWE) during pregnancy, including preconceptional folic acid use, prenatal vitamin K use, risk of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, clinical implications of placental and breast milk transfer of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), risks of breastfeeding, and change in AED levels during pregnancy.

Methods

A 20-member committee evaluated the available evidence based on a structured literature review and classification of relevant articles published between 1985 and October 2007.

Results

Preconceptional folic acid supplementation is possibly effective in preventing major congenital malformations in the newborns of WWE taking AEDs. There is inadequate evidence to determine if the newborns of WWE taking AEDs have a substantially increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. Primidone and levetiracetam probably transfer into breast milk in amounts that may be clinically important. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine probably are not transferred into breast milk in clinically important amounts. Pregnancy probably causes an increase in the clearance and a decrease in the concentration of lamotrigine, phenytoin, and to a lesser extent carbamazepine, and possibly decreases the level of levetiracetam and the active oxcarbazepine metabolite, the monohydroxy derivative.

Recommendations

Supplementing women with epilepsy with at least 0.4 mg of folic acid before they become pregnant may be considered (Level C). Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered (Level B) and monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy derivative) levels may be considered (Level C). A paucity of evidence limited the strength of many recommendations.

### Poststroke seizure: optimising its management [^1135ZZKH]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

In cases of PSS with SE (includes subclinical or non-convulsive SE), the risk of recurrent seizures in 10 years was increased twofold to threefold and the severity of the seizures was also significantly increased; therefore, a long-term antiepileptic treatment (similar to patients with recurrent unprovoked seizures) may be warranted. In patients with stroke with abnormal EEG, treatment should be considered based on the EEG pattern. Periodic discharge patterns, for example, LPDs and bilateral independent periodic discharges (BIPDs), are considered along a continuum between interictal and ictal state and may consequently induce neuronal injury, so long-term AED is recommended.

The principle of selecting an appropriate AED in patients with epilepsy has been well studied, which depends on numerous factors, such as seizure type/epileptic syndrome, efficacy and adverse effects of respective AED, drug-to-drug interactions, age and gender, drug regimen, and so on. Nevertheless, the PSS typically occurred in the elderly population, and the stroke survivors have a tendency to present with other health-related issues, or treated with multiple medications and have alterations in drug metabolism, which make them more sensitive to adverse effects, so the selection of AEDs is more dependent on the potential side effects, tolerability, impact on the patient's rehabilitation and recovery, and drug-to-drug interactions. So far, the literature contains very limited data that specifically and prospectively evaluated antiepileptic therapy in PSS. However, taking into consideration the elderly population and underlying cerebral structural disturbance, conclusions derived from studies of AED treatment on focal (partial) seizures in the elderly population might be considered in the case of patients with PSS. The latest ILAE report recommends that for efficacy, as initial monotherapy in adults with focal seizures, carbamazepine (CBZ), levetiracetam (LEV), phenytoin (PHT) and zonisamide have level A evidence. For elderly patients, lamotrigine (LTG) and gabapentin (GBP) have level A evidence. In the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) trial, the efficacy and tolerance were compared among GBP, LTG, oxcarbazepine (OCBZ) and topiramate in patients with partial epilepsy. GBP was found to be less effective and LTG was better tolerated than the other drugs. In the Keppra vs Older Monotherapy in Epilepsy Trial (KOMET trial, LEV, valproic acid (VPA) and CBZ were compared as initial monotherapy in elderly patients (> 60 years old). It was found that LEV had better tolerance and less severe treatment withdrawal effects than other AEDs, but no difference was detected in drug efficacy. In a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial study in elderly patients with focal epilepsy, Werhahn et al found that LEV and LTG had better tolerability and less severe treatment withdrawal effects. Studies specifically targeted on PSS are typically of small sample, open-label or retrospect review, with low-level evidence. These studies also suggest that the newer generation AEDs LEV and LTG have better tolerability than the older generation AEDs, CBZ and PHT. Among the older generation AEDs, VPA seems to have better tolerance than CBZ and PHT.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs, Symptoms and Laboratory Findings of Acute Overdosage in Humans

The highest known dose of oral KEPPRA received in the clinical development program was 6000 mg/day. Other than drowsiness, there were no adverse reactions in the few known cases of overdose in clinical trials. Cases of somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and coma were observed with KEPPRA overdoses in postmarketing use.

10.2 Management of Overdose

There is no specific antidote for overdose with KEPPRA. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with KEPPRA.

10.3 Hemodialysis

Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of levetiracetam (approximately 50% in 4 hours) and should be considered in cases of overdose. Although hemodialysis has not been performed in the few known cases of overdose, it may be indicated by the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.

### Level-headed: correlating antiseizure medication drug concentrations with adverse effects and seizure response [^117SHAf5]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

While the history and physical provide a foundation to guide care, interview questions and neurological examination have limits. Accordingly, we supplement data collected during a visit with objective tests, to see what we could otherwise not see with our own eyes.

Checking antiseizure medication (ASM) levels provides an apt example. While it is easy enough to ask the patient or caregiver regarding their perception of ASM adverse effects, seizure response, or medication adherence, unstructured interview questions are imperfect probes. Structured questionnaires demonstrate that adverse effects go undetectedand nonspecific symptoms can be confused for adverse effects, patients may under- or overreport their true seizure burden, and many factors beyond adherence influence a patient's blood concentration level (eg, pregnancy, nutritional status, drug interactions, and hepatorenal function). Therefore, checking ASM levels has intuitive appeal to supplement our monitoring toxicity and response, testing clinical hypotheses regarding whether the problem might be "too much" or "too little" medication during periods of worsening.

Despite this appeal, evidence is lacking regarding how ASM levels predict outcomes to guide management. Suggested lab ranges can be arbitrary in the absence of evidence-based reference controls or individualized numerical targets, inter- or even intra-lab variability can make values difficult to interpret across time, and the correlation between levels and physiological response may not be linear or simple. Therefore, the leap between drug concentration and its impact on the patient can be complex.

Hentschel et alrecently investigated whether ASM response and adverse effects correlated with plasma levels of 3 ASMs — brivaracetam, lacosamide, and perampanel. They included 100 patients currently taking each ASM and assessed current adverse effects and seizure frequency compared with initial seizure frequency at the time of ASM initiation, per electronic medical records.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

### Brivaracetam (briviact) [^112Azw3D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Rifampin: Because of decreased concentrations, increasing BRIVIACT dosage in patients on concomitant rifampin is recommended. (2.6, 7.1)
Carbamazepine: Because of increased exposure to carbamazepine metabolite, if tolerability issues arise, consider reducing carbamazepine dosage in patients on concomitant BRIVIACT. (7.2)
Phenytoin: Because phenytoin concentrations can increase, phenytoin levels should be monitored in patients on concomitant BRIVIACT. (7.3)
Levetiracetam: BRIVIACT had no added therapeutic benefit when co-administered with levetiracetam. (7.4)

7.1 Rifampin

Co-administration with rifampin decreases BRIVIACT plasma concentrations likely because of CYP2C19 induction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Prescribers should increase the BRIVIACT dose by up to 100% (i.e., double the dosage) in patients while receiving concomitant treatment with rifampin [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

7.2 Carbamazepine

Co-administration with carbamazepine may increase exposure to carbamazepine-epoxide, the active metabolite of carbamazepine. Though available data did not reveal any safety concerns, if tolerability issues arise when co-administered, carbamazepine dose reduction should be considered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Phenytoin

Because BRIVIACT can increase plasma concentrations of phenytoin, phenytoin levels should be monitored in patients when concomitant BRIVIACT is added to or discontinued from ongoing phenytoin therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Levetiracetam

BRIVIACT provided no added therapeutic benefit to levetiracetam when the two drugs were co-administered [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### What's new in therapeutic drug monitoring of antimicrobials? [^113wRxmb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of plasma samples is used in many circumstances to adjust pharmaceutics to desired concentrations. It is predominantly employed for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window (to avoid both underdosing and toxic levels) and/or where large inter- and intra-individual variations of concentrations are expected (e.g. antiepileptic drugs, anticoagulants, and immune modulators).

### Levetiracetam (LEVETIRACETAM solution) [^115tDrFL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

However, differences in exposures between obese and non-obese pediatric patients are not expected to be clinically meaningful because the recommended dose titration at initiation of levetiracetam therapy would establish an appropriate dose for each individual patient.

Pregnancy

Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Gender

Levetiracetam Cmaxand AUC were 20% higher in women (N = 11) compared to men (N = 12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable.

Race

Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons involving Caucasians (N = 12) and Asians (N = 12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

Renal Impairment

The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50–80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30–50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance.

### Levetiracetam (Keppra) [^116dyWuZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 2

Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted at 62 centers in Europe comparing KEPPRA 1000 mg/day (N = 106), KEPPRA 2000 mg/day (N = 105), and placebo (N = 111) given in equally divided doses twice daily.

The first period of the study (Period A) was designed to be analyzed as a parallel-group study. After a prospective baseline period of up to 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 16-week treatment period consisted of the 4-week titration period followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). The results of the analysis of Period A are displayed in Table 11.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the three treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 2.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including ELEPSIA XR, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking ELEPSIA XR during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1–888–233–2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Prolonged experience with levetiracetam in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature, which includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, neurobehavioral alterations in offspring) at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

Clinical Considerations

Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response.

2.6 Compatibility with Other Antiepileptic Drugs

Levetiracetam in Sodium Chloride Injection is found to be physically compatible and chemically stable for at least 24 hours when mixed with lorazepam, diazepam, and valproate sodium and stored at controlled room temperature 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).

There are no data to support the physical compatibility of levetiracetam injection with antiepileptic drugs that are not listed above.

2.7 Discontinuation of Levetiracetam

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

5.2 Somnolence and Fatigue

KEPPRA may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for somnolence and fatigue, and be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

Somnolence

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study in which there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving KEPPRA 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of KEPPRA-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of KEPPRA-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the KEPPRA-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

Asthenia

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of KEPPRA-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of KEPPRA-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In general, the incidences of somnolence and fatigue in the pediatric partial-onset seizure studies, and in pediatric and adult myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic studies were comparable to those of the adult partial-onset seizure studies.

Fallik N, Trakhtenbroit I, Fahoum F, Goldstein L. Therapeutic drug monitoring in pregnancy: Levetiracetam. Epilepsia. 2024 May;65(5):1285–1293. Epub 2024 Feb 24. PMID: 38400747. doi:10.1111/epi.17925.

Objective: Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiseizure medication that is mainly excreted by the kidneys. Due to its low teratogenic risk, LEV is frequently prescribed for women with epilepsy (WWE). Physiological changes during gestation affect the pharmacokinetic characteristics of LEV. The goal of our study was to characterize the changes in LEV clearance during pregnancy and the postpartum period, to better plan an LEV dosing paradigm for pregnant women. Methods: This retrospective observational study incorporated a cohort of women who were followed up at the epilepsy in pregnancy clinic at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center during the years 2020–2023. Individualized target concentrations of LEV and an empirical postpartum taper were used for seizure control and to reduce toxicity likelihood. Patient visits took place every 1–2 months and included a review of medication dosage, trough LEV blood levels, week of gestation and LEV dose at the time of level measurement, and seizure diaries. Total LEV concentration/dose was calculated based on LEV levels and dose as an estimation of LEV clearance. Results: A total of 263 samples were collected from 38 pregnant patients. We observed a decrease in LEV concentration/dose (C/D) as the pregnancy progressed, followed by an abrupt postpartum increase. Compared to the third trimester, the most significant C/D decrease was observed at the first trimester (slope = .85), with no significant change in the second trimester (slope = .11). A significant increase in C/D occurred postpartum (slope = 5.23). LEV dose was gradually increased by 75% during pregnancy compared to preconception. Average serum levels (μg/mL) decreased during pregnancy. During the postpartum period, serum levels increased, whereas the LEV dose was decreased by 24%, compared to the third trimester. Significance: LEV serum level monitoring is essential for WWE prior to and during pregnancy as well as postpartum. Our data contribute to determining a rational treatment and dosing paradigm for LEV use during both pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Objective: In pregnancy, it is important to balance the risks of uncontrolled epileptic seizures to the mother and fetus against the potential teratogenic effects of antiseizure medications. Data are limited on pregnancy outcomes among patients taking lacosamide (LCM), particularly when taken as monotherapy. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes of LCM-exposed pregnancies. Methods: This analysis included all reports in the UCB Pharma pharmacovigilance database of exposure to LCM during pregnancy from spontaneous sources (routine clinical settings) or solicited reports from interventional clinical studies and noninterventional postmarketing studies. Prospective and retrospective reports were analyzed separately. Results: At the data cutoff (August 31, 2021), there were 202 prospective pregnancy cases with maternal exposure to LCM and known outcomes. Among these cases, 44 (21.8%) patients received LCM monotherapy and 158 (78.2%) received LCM polytherapy. Most patients received LCM during the first trimester (LCM monotherapy: 39 [88.6%]; LCM polytherapy: 143 [90.5%]). From the prospective pregnancy cases with maternal LCM exposure, there were 204 reported outcomes (two twin pregnancies occurred in the polytherapy group). The proportion of live births was 84.1% (37/44) in patients who received LCM as monotherapy, and 76.3% (122/160) for LCM polytherapy. The overall proportion of abortions (for any reason) was 15.9% (7/44) with LCM monotherapy, and 22.5% (36/160) with LCM polytherapy. Congenital malformations were reported in 2.3% (1/44) of known pregnancy outcomes with maternal exposure to LCM monotherapy, and 6.9% (11/160) with polytherapy. Significance: Our preliminary data do not raise major concerns on the use of LCM during pregnancy. Most pregnancies with LCM exposure resulted in healthy live births, and no new safety issues were identified. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as additional data are needed to fully evaluate the safety profile of LCM in pregnancy.

Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam oral solution dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

CLcr = [[(140 − age (years)) × weight (kg)]/[72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)]] (× 0.85 for female patients)

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

CLcr (mL/min/1.73 m²) = [CLcr (mL/min)/BSA_subject (m²)] × 1.73

5.6 Coordination Difficulties

KEPPRA may cause coordination difficulties.

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of KEPPRA in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 3.4% of KEPPRA-treated patients experienced coordination difficulties, (reported as ataxia, abnormal gait, or incoordination) compared to 1.6% of placebo-treated patients. A total of 0.4% of patients in controlled clinical studies discontinued KEPPRA treatment due to ataxia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.7% of KEPPRA-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to coordination difficulties, while one of the treated patients was hospitalized due to worsening of pre-existing ataxia. These events occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of coordination difficulties and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KEPPRA to gauge whether it could adversely affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.7 Withdrawal Seizures

As with most antiepileptic drugs, KEPPRA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. But if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

5.8 Hematologic Abnormalities

KEPPRA can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cells counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month to 16 years of age have been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The dosing recommendation in these pediatric patients varies according to age group and is weight-based [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adolescents 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The safety and effectiveness of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Safety and effectiveness for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month; adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years; and adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

A 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of KEPPRA as adjunctive therapy in 98 (KEPPRA N = 64, placebo N = 34) pediatric patients, ages 4 years to 16 years, with partial seizures that were inadequately controlled. The target dose was 60 mg/kg/day. Neurocognitive effects were measured by the Leiter-R Attention and Memory (AM) Battery, which measures various aspects of a child's memory and attention. Although no substantive differences were observed between the placebo and drug treated groups in the median change from baseline in this battery, the study was not adequate to assess formal statistical non-inferiority of the drug and placebo. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6–18), a standardized validated tool used to assess a child's competencies and behavioral/emotional problems, was also assessed in this study. An analysis of the CBCL/6–18 indicated, on average, a worsening in KEPPRA-treated patients in aggressive behavior, one of the eight syndrome scores [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Antiseizure medication dosing and levetiracetam — subtherapeutic exposure and variable practices were common: several studies titrated dosing "to achieve therapeutic levels", but others "did not titrate dosing to blood levels", and "several studies neither measured therapeutic levels nor monitored drug levels"; across seven studies, "15–74% of patients were subtherapeutic". Only one levetiracetam (LEV) study used weight-based dosing with monitoring; at "55 mg/kg/day divided in two doses, 85% of patients were within the therapeutic range throughout the 30 days of drug administration". Some LEV studies lacked dosing information or monitoring, including "low-dosage LEV (500 mg twice daily)". Pharmacokinetic data found LEV doses "1000 mg every 8 h or 1500–2000 mg every 12 h" most likely to achieve therapeutic troughs. A retrospective series of "866 patients with TBI" "suggested no difference in the cumulative incidence of early posttraumatic seizure" across LEV dose groups " ≤ 1000 mg/day, 1500 mg/day, or 2000 mg/day", although higher-dose groups were "more than twice as likely to have EEG monitoring".

Objective

Nonsedating antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that can be initiated rapidly are desirable in a variety of clinical situations. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a newer AED, with a recently approved parenteral formulation, that can be initiated at doses effective in controlling seizures. We investigated whether oral loading of levetiracetam is well tolerated and facilitates stabilization and discharge of patients in epilepsy monitoring units (EMU).

Methods

Adult patients in the EMU at two centers were identified who received 1,500 mg of LEV in a single dose. This was an observational study of these patients where LEV was thought to be an appropriate component of the therapeutic regimen. Patients were either LEV naive or had been off all LEV for at least 3 days. LEV maintenance was begun 12 hours later at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg twice a day.

Results

A total of 37 adult patients (20 female) were identified. There were no spontaneous complaints of side effects. Upon questioning, 33 patients (89%) denied side effects. The remaining 4 patients (11%) reported transient irritability, imbalance, tiredness, or lightheadedness. Eleven patients (mean weight = 85.0 Kg) had mean LEV serum concentration of 31.5 microg/mL after 1 hour, 23 (mean weight 85.7 Kg) had mean concentration of 30.77 microg/mL after 2 hours, five (mean weight 84.3 Kg) had mean concentration of 12.1 microg/mL after 12 hours, and two (mean weight 94 Kg) had mean concentration of 7.4 microg/mL after 14 hours. No seizures occurred within 24 hours of loading. All patients were able to be discharged 3 to 30 hours after loading.

Conclusions

In the population surveyed, oral loading with levetiracetam was well-tolerated and rapidly yielded serum concentrations thought to decrease seizure frequency. This regimen facilitated discharge from the epilepsy monitoring units.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

Study 5 was a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Study 5 was conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. Study 5 consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients who experienced, on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either KEPPRA or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with KEPPRA), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with KEPPRA), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with KEPPRA), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with KEPPRA). KEPPRA dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. The enrolled population included 116 patients (KEPPRA N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between KEPPRA and placebo was observed in Study 5 (see Figure 5).

### Association of levetiracetam concentration with seizure frequency in pregnant women with epilepsy [^115jZReA]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Pharmacologic treatment of epilepsy in pregnant women is balancing between risks for the mother and fetus. Levetiracetam (LEV) is considered to be safe during pregnancy because of its low teratogenic potential and lack of drug-drug interaction with other antiseizure medications (ASMs). Recent studies have shown decline of ASM concentrations during pregnancy because of physiologically based pharmacokinetic changes. In this study, we established this decrease in LEV concentration during pregnancy. In addition, we aimed at investigating the effect of the low LEV levels during pregnancy and developing a target value for the level during pregnancy.

Methods

Pregnant patients using levetiracetam were studied in this retrospective cohort study. Blood samples were monthly collected through venous puncture or the dried blood spot method. ASM serum concentrations were determined at least 6 months before conception and for each month of pregnancy. Seizure frequency and ASM dosages during pregnancy were obtained from patient records. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a seizure-free group and a non-seizure-free group, which contained pregnancies in which the mother had experienced an epileptic seizure more than 12 months and less than 12 months before pregnancy, respectively.

Results

We found decreased concentration/dose ratios in 29 pregnancies throughout all months of pregnancy. In the non-seizure-free group, it was found that low LEV concentrations were associated with seizure increase frequency (p = 0.022). For this group, the cutoff value with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity was 0.466.

Discussion

All in all, we recommend therapeutic drug monitoring for all pregnant patients on LEV as the concentrations of LEV significantly decrease throughout most months of pregnancy. However, this decrease in LEV concentration was only significantly correlated with seizure deterioration in patients who had a seizure in the year preceding the pregnancy. Therefore, we suggest more careful monitoring of non-seizure-free patients as they are at higher risk for experiencing an increase of seizure frequency. For this group, we advise physicians to keep LEV concentration above 65% of the preconceptional concentration. For seizure-free patients, we recommend an LEV threshold value of approximately 46% of the preconceptional concentration.

### A missed opportunity-consequences of unknown levetiracepam pharmacokinetics in a peritoneal dialysis patient [^111YeVwS]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam is a frequently used drug in the therapy of partial onset, myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The main route of elimination is via the kidneys, which eliminate 66% of the unchanged drug as well as 24% as inactive metabolite that stems from enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore dose adjustments are needed in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 D, i.e. patients undergoing dialysis treatment. In this patient population a dose reduction by 50% is recommended, so that patients receive 250–750 mg every 12 hours. However "dialysis" can be performed in using different modalities and treatment intensities. For most of the drugs pharmacokinetic data and dosing recommendations for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis are not available. This is the first report on levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a peritoneal dialysis patient.

Case presentation

A 73-y-old Caucasian male (height: 160 cm, weight 93 kg, BMI 36.3 kg/m²) was admitted with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. Due to diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy he was undergoing peritoneal dialysis for two years. Eight weeks prior he was put on levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily for suspected partial seizures with secondary generalization. According to the patient's wife, levetiracetam lead to fatigue and somnolence leading to trauma with fracture of the metatarsal bone. Indeed, even 24 hours after discontinuation of levetiracetam blood level was still 29.8 mg/l (therapeutic range: 12–46 mg/l). Fatigue and stupor had disappeared five days after discontinuation of the levetiracepam. A single dose pharamockinetic after re-exposure showed an increased half life of 18.4 hours (normal half life 7 hours) and levetiracetam content in the peritoneal dialysate. Both half-life and dialysate content might help to guide dosing in this patient population.

Conclusion

If levetiracetam is used in peritoneal dialysis patients it should be regularly monitored to avoid supratherapeutic levels that could lead to severe sequelae.

### Happy healthy parents and babies: levetiracetam, lacosamide and epilepsy pregnancy registries [^111wACYK]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

These findings emphasize the need to closely monitor LEV levels during pregnancy, particularly in PWE who develop hyperemesis gravidarum or in whom transitioning from one ASM during pregnancy to LEV is deemed medically necessary. These additional findings are in line with the recent published guidelines. Seizure outcomes could not be meaningfully assessed because study participants on polytherapy were included and may have adjusted the doses of these other treatments during pregnancy as well. However, this study provides additional guidance and emphasis on the importance of monitoring and reacting quickly to blood level changes of levetiracetam frequently during pregnancy.

A second study published in the same issue of Epilepsia, focused on the evaluation of 76 PWECP during pregnancy treated with LCM as monotherapy and 159 treated with lacosamide (LCM) as polytherapy in the UCB Pharma global pharmacovigilance database. The study was funded by UCB Pharma. The authors concluded that no new safety issues were identified among these individuals and their offspring.

Commentary

Routine use of plasma-level monitoring of newer antiseizure medications (ASMs), according to the report by Aícua-Rapún et al, provided no advantage in terms of seizure control or avoidance of toxicity among a group of 151 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to a cohort who had levels measured at every clinic visit or to a cohort who had levels measured only as a "rescue" measure, that is, if seizure control worsened or if drug toxicities were suspected. There was no difference in outcomes of seizure control or toxicity. This conclusion may be surprising, but it replicated the results of a study published in 2000 of patients with new-onset epilepsy, which also found no measurable advantage to routine monitoring of levels.

Is it ever useful to measure plasma levels of ASMs, or is it an expensive and potentially misleading practice? Overuse of plasma levels has been criticized for years. However, most neurologists still find levels useful in certain circumstances, and there has been an extensive discussion of when they should be measured. A common circumstance is pregnancy, when levels of many ASMs are known to fall substantially. However, even this has been questioned. In a British study, pregnant women with a plasma level decrease over 26% from a baseline value were randomized to monthly drug-level monitoring or to dosing based on clinical judgment. Outcomes of seizure number and time to first seizure after randomization did not differ.

In this postlicensing surveillance study in a large unselected population, data were collected prospectively on all patients prescribed levetiracetam (LEV) at a regional epilepsy clinic over a 2-year period. Two hundred forty-five (69.2%) patients remained on LEV, with 8.8% achieving remission and some improvement in seizure control in 49.3%. Sedation was the most common adverse effect (10.7%), but mood disturbance was more likely to lead to discontinuation (4.8%). Cumulative probability of remaining on LEV at 12 months was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.79). Factors predictive of a poorer retention were a greater number of previous antiepileptic drugs and a faster initial titration regimen.

Regarding the use of levetiracetam IV (also known as Keppra) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Monitor plasma drug levels closely during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The drug levetiracetam IV (also known as Keppra) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including levetiracetam, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking levetiracetam during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1–888–233–2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Prolonged experience with levetiracetam in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature, which includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, neurobehavioral alterations in offspring) at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

### Measure for measure: measuring the usefulness of measuring antiseizure medication levels [^116mXZZ5]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

The good advice to be cautious in interpretation of levels is often forgotten. This can lead to dangerous reductions in dose because of a "toxic" level which in fact may have been perfectly well-tolerated and necessary for seizure control. Less dangerous but still expensive and generative of side effects is the practice of raising doses because of a "subtherapeutic" level in persons who are seizure-free.

How do we select patients who need levels measured? There are 3 categories of patients: those with seizures, those with toxicity, and those who are just fine. Most patients in all 3 categories do not need levels: the course of action is clear. For those with seizures, as a check for adherence, a single level is worthless unless compared with previous levels in the same patient. For those with toxicity, identification of the culprit drug in polytherapy is also unreliable. The drug with the low serum level may be responsible. Patients who are just fine would seem to constitute a group that never needs a plasma level. But there is an exception: patients with new-onset epilepsy with infrequent seizures. In such patients, one cannot "titrate to effect" because the infrequent seizure has not yet recurred. It is then necessary to titrate to a predetermined dose or to a predetermined plasma level. A dose target may be satisfactory if there is a well-established relationship between dose and efficacy, or if serum levels are known not to reflect degree of brain binding (levetiracetam). But for most drugs, aiming for a target serum level makes more sense. I am uncomfortable with a lamotrigine level of 3 μg/mL in a patient with new-onset epilepsy, regardless of the prescribed dose. If nonadherence is ruled out, the dose should be raised. Another possible use for a level is to set a "baseline" when the patient is doing well for future reference. This is the concept of setting an "individual reference range" rather than a population reference range.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The adverse reactions that result from KEPPRA injection use include all of those reported for KEPPRA tablets and oral solution. Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

Phenytoin

KEPPRA (3000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin.

Valproate

KEPPRA (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.

Other Antiepileptic Drugs

Potential drug interactions between KEPPRA and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients

There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

Oral Contraceptives

KEPPRA (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Digoxin

KEPPRA (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Warfarin

KEPPRA (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

Overview

Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (< 10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6–8 hours. It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

Distribution

The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at Tmaxafter an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 × 500 mg oral tablets. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC(0–12)at steady-state was equivalent to AUCinffollowing an equivalent single dose.

Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

1Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

2.6 Discontinuation of Levetiracetam

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Assessment of a dose-response relationship of levetiracetam [^115HTPcm]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between levetiracetam dose and both efficacy and safety in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Dose-response relationships for levetiracetam efficacy were evaluated using pooled data from three trials including adults with refractory partial epilepsy. Two were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in which doses of 1000–3000 mg/day of levetiracetam were administered as adjunctive therapy. The third consisted of the two parts of a crossover randomized, double-blind study in which levetiracetam (1000 or 2000 mg/day) or placebo was added to ongoing therapy. Data from each part of the crossover trial were included as if it was an independent parallel-group study. A fourth randomized double-blind trial was added for the safety evaluation. It included data from adults receiving placebo or 2000 mg/day of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures. The combined analysis showed an increasing effect with increasing dose. The responder rates (≥ 50% reduction in seizures) for placebo and levetiracetam 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/day were 13.1%, 28.5%, 34.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. The respective values for seizure freedom were 0.8%, 4.7%, 6.3%, and 8.6%. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship with regard to adverse events, including those (asthenia, dizziness, somnolence) most commonly associated with this antiepileptic drug. Patients who do not become seizure-free at the lowest recommended levetiracetam dose (1000 mg/day) should be titrated to 2000 or 3000 mg/day to provide the greatest opportunity for efficacy with little or no increased risk for adverse events.

Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial- onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of second-and third-generation antiepileptic drugs [^112t8sLp]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

Therapeutic drug monitoring has traditionally been widely used for first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine and phenytoin. The last 2 decades have seen the introduction of second- and third-generation AEDs (eg, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate) into clinical practice.

Objective —

To use data from the College of American Pathologists Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, Extended Proficiency Testing Survey to determine the performance of assays used for therapeutic drug monitoring of newer AEDs, including comparison of enzyme immunoassay and chromatographic techniques.

Design —

Six years of proficiency testing surveys were reviewed (2013–2018).

Results —

Steady growth was seen in participant volumes for newer AEDs. The analytical performance of automated enzyme immunoassays for lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate was similar to that of chromatographic methods, consistent with published literature using patient samples for comparisons. The majority of participating laboratories now use enzyme immunoassays to measure levetiracetam.

Conclusions —

Survey results reflect steadily growing interest in therapeutic drug monitoring of newer AEDs. The increasing availability of robust immunoassays for new AEDs should facilitate their clinical utility, especially for clinical laboratories that do not perform chromatographic assays for therapeutic drug monitoring.

5.3 Somnolence and Fatigue

Levetiracetam may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

Somnolence

In controlled trials of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of levetiracetam-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study where there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of levetiracetam-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of levetiracetam-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the levetiracetam-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.

Asthenia

In controlled clinical studies of adult patients with epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures, 15% of levetiracetam-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.

Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In general, the incidences of somnolence and fatigue in the pediatric partial-onset seizure studies, and in pediatric and adult myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure studies were comparable to those of the adult partial-onset seizure studies.

2.1 Dosing for Partial-Onset Seizures

The recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same as outlined below.

There is no clinical study experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a period longer than 4 days.

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.

Pediatric Patients

1 Month to < 6 Months

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

6 Months to < 4 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

4 Years to < 16 Years

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.

2.2 Dosing for Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied.

### Correlation between efficacy of levetiracetam and serum levels among children with refractory epilepsy [^114EftMM]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam is used as adjunctive therapy in various types of seizures. Studies evaluating the effect of levetiracetam on children with refractory epilepsy are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between serum concentration of levetiracetam and either efficacy or tolerability in children with refractory epilepsy, and to determine the value of levetiracetam blood level monitoring.

Methods

Medical records of 50 children with refractory epilepsy treated with levetiracetam and regularly followed at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed. Trough serum levetiracetam concentration was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and correlated with the administered dose and clinical report.

Results

No correlation between levetiracetam serum levels and clinical efficacy, tolerability or administered dosage was found. The average dose of levetiracetam was 43.7 ± 20.0 (range 14–100) mg/kg/day and the average serum concentration was 16.0 ± 9.5 (range 2.5–38.5) μg/mL. Forty-five patients (95%) had more than a 50% reduction of seizure frequency, with 22 (44%) patients becoming seizure-free for at least 6 months. Adverse events related to levetiracetam were reported in 15 (30%) patients. No correlation between serum concentrations and adverse events was found. These results were not affected by gender, age, type of seizure, and other drugs.

Conclusions

Determination of serum concentration is not needed in all children treated with levetiracetam. Serum concentrations may be valuable either in patients with refractory epilepsy for compliance evaluation or in patients with satisfactory control of seizures for determination of their therapeutic baseline.

5.6 Withdrawal Seizures

As with most antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam should be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. But if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

5.7 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 × 10⁶/mm³), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 10⁹/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 × 10⁹/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Although there were no obvious hematologic abnormalities observed in patients with JME, the limited number of patients makes any conclusion tentative. The data from the partial seizure patients should be considered to be relevant for JME patients.

5.8 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Status epilepticus prognosis following levetiracetam administration: analysis of loading doses [^117T5nhn]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recommended loading doses of levetiracetam (LEV) for status epilepticus (SE) treatment have increased over time. However, this was not evidence-based, and the benefit of the increase remains unclear. The effect of different LEV loading doses on SE prognosis was explored.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of an SE adult registry (January 2016-December 2021), including patients receiving LEV as a second-line SE treatment. Patients were stratified according to LEV loading doses (threshold 35mg/kg). Main outcomes were global mortality, LEV use as last SE treatment, and return to baseline conditions at discharge, exploring LEV as a dichotomized or continuous dose.

Results

Among 202 patients, 44 received LEV at ≥ 35mg/kg and 158 below it. Global mortality, adjusted for SE severity and potentially fatal aetiology, was more frequent in the high LEV dose group (27.2% vs. 17.1%, odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.23–8.06; p = 0.017), whilst LEV prescription as last treatment and return to baseline conditions were comparable. Considering continuous LEV dosages or mortality in ongoing SE, however, no outcome reached statistical significance.

Conclusions

Lower LEV loading doses do not seem to correlate with worse clinical outcome, challenging current guidelines. Further studies, ideally prospective, are needed on this topic.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including levetiracetam, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking levetiracetam during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1–888–233–2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

Prolonged experience with levetiracetam in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature, which includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, neurobehavioral alterations in offspring) at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

### Generic substitution of levetiracetam resulting in increased incidence of breakthrough seizures [^111hQwVV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We report on 4 patients having an increased incidence of seizures when treatment was switched from brand name levetiracetam (Keppra) to generic levetiracetam formulations.

Case Summary

Patients reported an increase in seizure activity to their neurologists after treatment was switched from Keppra to generic levetiracetam formulations. To confirm the timeline of increased seizure activity with use of the generic drug and report these adverse events to MedWatch, we made a telephone call to each patient's pharmacy to collect information on dispensing dates and the generic formulations' manufacturers. Subsequent to the increase in seizure frequency with generic levetiracetam, treatment in all 4 patients was switched back to Keppra. Seizure frequency in all patients returned to baseline when Keppra was reinstituted.

Discussion

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers generic medications to be therapeutically equivalent to their corresponding brand name formulation when the generic meets bioequivalence criteria. Considering the linear pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam, loss of seizure control or fluctuations of serum concentrations are unexpected if the patient remains on a consistent dose. However, there is growing evidence to support the concept that brand name antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are not clinically equivalent to their generic counterparts. Because the FDA relies on voluntary reporting of adverse events from health-care professionals and consumers to their MedWatch program, underreporting makes it difficult to quantify the significance of brand to generic switches, and, equally important, generic to generic switches.

Conclusions

Until the use of generic AEDs can be evaluated in a large randomized blinded controlled study, clinicians must be vigilant in their efforts to report to MedWatch adverse events resulting from the switch from an AED brand to generic formulation of an AED.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of lamotrigine [^113rctgX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the usefulness of routine monitoring of serum lamotrigine concentration.

Data Source

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1990-January 2001). Key search terms included lamotrigine, pharmacokinetics, and epilepsy.

Data Synthesis

A decision-making algorithm was used to evaluate the clinical evidence to support or refute the routine use of serum lamotrigine concentrations to adjust doses. The value of serum lamotrigine concentration monitoring remains controversial, primarily because clear relationships between concentration and pharmacologic response (either efficacy or toxicity) have not been demonstrated.

Conclusions

Serum concentration monitoring of lamotrigine is not recommended as a tool for routine dose adjustment.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of newer antiepileptic drugs: a randomized trial for dosage adjustment [^113kJzcB]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is widely established for older generation AEDs, whereas there is limited evidence about newer AEDs. Our aim is to assess the benefit of TDM of newer generation AEDs in epilepsy.

Methods

We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing systematic with rescue TDM of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, brivaracetam, zonisamide, or pregabalin. Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment. In the systematic TDM arm, AED plasma levels were available at each appointment, whereas in the rescue TDM arm, levels were known only if a study endpoint was reached (inefficacy or adverse events). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants followed 1 year without reaching one of the predefined endpoints.

Results

A total of 151 participants were enrolled; global retention in the study was similar in both arms (56% overall, 58% in the systematic, and 53% in the rescue TDM arm, p = 0.6, Cox regression). There was no difference in terms of outcome regarding treatment efficacy or tolerability. Partial adherence of clinicians to TDM (adjusting or not AED dosage based on blood levels) did not explain this lack of benefit.

Interpretation

This study provides class A evidence that systematic drug level monitoring of newer generation AEDs does not bring tangible benefits in the management of patients with epilepsy. Poor correlation between clinical effects and drug levels likely accounts for this finding. However, TDM is useful in several situations, such as pregnancy, as well as when there are compliance issues. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:22–29.

### The case for levetiracetam to be included in essential medicine lists [^115NA1Ef]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam is one ASM that fulfils the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, neither does it have the propensity to clinically relevant drug interactions, nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward in comparison to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution and injectable forms and, therefore, suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalised epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required, apart from some situations, e.g. pregnancy, adherence check, intercurrent critical illnesses and extremes of age. Levetiracetam's adverse effect profile is limited, making it further appealing for use in primary care. Behavioural side effects, including irritability, anger and aggression, are the most common. It is prudent to screen for suicidality and psychiatric disorders at treatment initiation bearing in mind, however, that both are raised in epilepsy.

Traditional ASMs are low-priced and often the only drugs available in LMICs. These remain indispensable to practice, especially in primary care settings in LMICs. Their use poses challenges on account of their complexity and long-term consequences. Levetiracetam's cost remains an issue but has lessened with the availability of generics and will likely further reduce if labelled as an essential medicine. The addition of levetiracetam to the Indian list is a commendable step. Other countries should follow suit.

### Making up missed anti-seizure medication doses: double or nothing? [^114uGuTp]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

The other question is whether to take the full missed dose immediately if remembered soon enough. They found that for most ASMs, taking the full missed dose immediately did minimize time outside the desired therapeutic range if taken within a few hours of the missed dose. This makes sense and is in line with the above usual advice. There were just a couple exceptions — for example, clobazam (with its long half-life) was better served by any of the "0.5" or "1.5" dose strategies if a dose is anything more than 1 hour delayed.

Take a typical example — twice daily levetiracetam, assume a 40-year-old adult with normal renal function. Their results endorse some of our typical advice — take the full missed dose immediately if remembered within 2 hours of the scheduled time (our typical advice, strategy B). But if remembered more than 2 hours after the originally scheduled time, their results favored different variations of making up only half of the missed dose (strategies C-F), rather than skipping an entire dose.

They have posted their results in a convenient online format. This allows the user to take matters into their own hands by entering a patient's specific data into this app to view how concentrations may fluctuate under strategies A-F. For more advanced users, they posted another app in which one can even modify assumptions about absorption, clearance, volume of distribution, and more.

Even with their large array of analyses, the investigators could look at only a subset of all possible ASMs or ages (they did not include a scenario for older patients, for whom changes in renal function and susceptibility to adverse effects may be greatest), and these data pertain only to immediate rather than extended-release formulations. There are also 2 elephants in the room: (1) Translating a precise sinusoidal concentration curve into the chance that a patient might have seizures or side effects is not simple, nor does this inform how the patient perceives the tradeoff between transient seizure versus side effect risk, and (2) None of this modeling addresses the underlying cause of skipping doses.

That said, this is a nicely done, useful study, involving incredible technical demands. But what I most appreciate about this study is its spirit. The investigators identified an extremely common clinical scenario with agreed upon yet arbitrary guidance and sought to provide clinicians with freely available evidence-based guideposts.

### Happy healthy parents and babies: levetiracetam, lacosamide and epilepsy pregnancy registries [^112fZPbt]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

In June of 2024, the American Academy of Neurology, American Epilepsy Society, and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine collaborated to publish new guidelines on the use of antiseizure medications (ASMs) in people with epilepsy of childbearing potential or PWECP. Following an extensive literature search, the authors recommended using lamotrigine, levetiracetam or oxcarbazepine when appropriate based on diagnosed epilepsy syndrome in PWECP given the lower risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) compared to other ASMs. Regarding several newer or less utilized antiseizure medications including lacosamide, the group recommended cautioning PWECP that evidence is limited about pregnancy-related outcomes.

A recently estimated 1.3 million PWECP live in the United Statesand many are now treated with levetiracetam given the evidence of low risk for MCM, as stated in the guidelines. Oxcarbazepine is not appropriate for generalized epilepsy and lamotrigine levels can fluctuate significantly during pregnancy and after delivery and for these reasons, levetiracetam may be the preferred choice when effective. Guidance regarding the management of antiseizure medication (ASM) doses during pregnancy included titrating to a dose that minimizes seizures and optimizes fetal outcomes without further details. Fortunately, an article was recently published in Epilepsia in February of 2024 providing additional evidence regarding monitoring of levetiracetam (LEV) levels in pregnancy. This retrospective study investigated a cohort of 38 pregnant people with epilepsy (PWE) on levetiracetam monotherapy or polytherapy and had at least one LEV blood level measurement during pregnancy in a specialized epilepsy center in Israel. A total of 263 samples were collected and LEV concentration/dose (C/D) was calculated. There was an initial decrease in LEV C/D in the first trimester compared to the third and a significant increase post-partum. To address changes in levels over time (measured every 1–2 months during pregnancy), LEV doses were increased by an average of 75%. Of the 38 individuals studied, 5 (17%) had breakthrough seizures during pregnancy. These included two pregnant PWE in the setting of hyperemesis gravidarum with decreased LEV absorption, two whose LEV concentrations decreased in pregnancy, and one during transition from valproic acid to LEV during pregnancy.

2.4 Dosing for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

Adults 16 Years of Age and Older

Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age

Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Only whole tablets should be administered.

2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

Levetiracetam dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:

Table 1: Dosing Adjustment Regimen for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment

1Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.

2.6 Discontinuation of Levetiracetam

Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Levetiracetam blood levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response.

### A seven-day study of the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levetiracetam in neonates: marked changes in pharmacokinetics occur during the first week of life [^117PQ8fV]. Pediatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Levetiracetam (LEV) is increasingly used in the treatment of neonatal seizures. The aim of this study was to determine pharmacokinetics in neonates with seizures and to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data.

Methods

Eighteen term neonates with seizures persisting after 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital received intravenous LEV for 1 wk. LEV was administered as a 20 or 40 mg/kg bolus followed by 5–10 mg/kg/d. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed-effects population approach. Continuous electroencephalogram monitoring allowed preliminary assessment of the efficacy of LEV in this population.

Results

LEV clearance (CL) increased from a mean of 0.7 ml/min/kg (SD 0.27 ml/min/kg) on day 1 to 1.33 ml/min/kg (SD 0.35 ml/min/kg) by day 7. Mean half-life was 18.5 h (SD 7.1 h) on day 1 of the study and decreased to 9.1 h (SD 2.0 h) by day 7. The mean volume of distribution was 1.01 l/kg (SD 0.13 l/kg). No study-related serious adverse events were observed.

Discussion

CL of LEV in neonates was higher than expected on the basis of immature renal function in term infants and increased significantly during the first week of life. More frequent dosing of LEV is needed in term infants to maintain serum concentrations in the range seen in children and adults.

Regarding the use of levetiracetam PO (also known as Keppra) in patients with chronic liver disease, any severity:

- Use acceptable.
- No dose adjustment required.

Regarding the use of levetiracetam ER PO (also known as Keppra XR) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Enroll patients in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. Physiological changes during pregnancy can alter drug concentrations and therapeutic effects, requiring dose adjustments. The drug levetiracetam ER PO (also known as Keppra XR) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.
