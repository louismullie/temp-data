## Question

What percent of liver transplant recipients are over 70?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of liver transplant recipients are over 70 years old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most recent national registry data that explicitly reports the proportion of recipients aged 70 or older. Then, I should verify whether that figure reflects current practice or a historical cohort and whether it applies to deceased-donor transplants, living-donor transplants, or both. Next, I will check for corroborating estimates from other contemporary cohorts and guidelines to ensure consistency. Finally, I will reconcile any discrepancies and state the best-supported estimate with context and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the most direct estimate. A 2023 analysis of the UNOS/OPTN registry identified 897 recipients aged 70 years or older among 22,862 deceased-donor liver transplant recipients from 2016–2020, which equals 4.0% exactly, and this is the clearest contemporary national proportion I can find [^114yNAXN].

> Wait, let me verify whether this 4% figure generalizes to living-donor liver transplantation as well. A 2025 prospective registry analysis of 1,018 living-donor liver transplant recipients reported that 71 recipients were aged 70 or older, which is 7.0%, suggesting a slightly higher proportion in LDLT than in DDLT, though the cohort is smaller and may reflect center selection practices rather than national utilization patterns [^116XFRqw].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any recent guideline statements contextualize this proportion. The 2024 EASL guidance emphasizes that age alone should not disqualify candidates and recommends comprehensive geriatric and frailty assessments for older adults, which aligns with the observed increase in transplantation among septuagenarians but does not itself provide a national percentage estimate, so I should not over-interpret it as a quantitative figure [^115eRVq6] [^115UEAQb].

> I need to check for corroborating signals in disease-specific cohorts. A 2025 UNOS/OPTN analysis of older candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma showed that the proportion of registrants aged 70 or older rose from 4.2% in 2012 to 15.0% in 2022, indicating a strong aging trend among HCC registrants; however, this reflects waitlist demographics rather than transplant recipient proportions, so I should be cautious not to conflate these rates with the percentage of actual recipients over 70 [^113iwpNY].

> Let me consider whether older national data contradict or support the 4% estimate. Historical series and single-center experiences document that recipients aged 70 or older constituted a small minority in earlier eras, consistent with the notion that the proportion has remained modest even as absolute numbers have risen, but they do not provide a more reliable contemporary national percentage than the 2023 registry analysis cited above [^111VAtgB] [^111W21pB].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my conclusion. The best-supported national estimate for deceased-donor liver transplantation is 4.0% of recipients aged 70 or older in 2016–2020, while living-donor cohorts suggest a modestly higher proportion around 7.0%, likely reflecting selective center practices; taken together, approximately 4–7% of liver transplant recipients are over 70 years old, with the most reliable national figure being 4% for deceased-donor transplants [^114yNAXN] [^116XFRqw].

---

Approximately **4%** of liver transplant recipients are over 70 years old, based on recent UNOS/OPTN data from 2016–2020 [^114yNAXN]. This proportion has **increased over time** as the population ages and selection criteria evolve, but recipients over 70 remain a small minority [^116MwMzH]. Outcomes in carefully selected older recipients can be acceptable, though survival is generally lower than in younger patients [^111W21pB] [^114nQd4F].

---

## Current proportion of liver transplant recipients over 70

Recent UNOS/OPTN registry data (2016–2020) show that **4% of deceased-donor liver transplant recipients were aged 70 or older** (897/22,862) [^114yNAXN]. This aligns with other contemporary series reporting roughly 4–7% of recipients over 70 [^116XFRqw] [^112WBPpK].

---

## Historical trends

Historically, recipients over 70 were rare; a 2007 UCLA series of 62 septuagenarians noted only about 3 per year, reflecting **limited acceptance** at that time [^111VAtgB]. Since then, the proportion has gradually increased as the population ages and transplant centers broaden criteria [^116MwMzH].

---

## Regional and international variations

Regional differences exist: in the Eurotransplant region, **about 13% of transplants use livers from donors ≥ 70 years**, but recipient age data are not directly comparable [^114CX6aH]. In the US, older donors are underused, and older recipients remain a minority [^1112pxBR].

---

## Clinical outcomes in recipients over 70

Outcomes in recipients over 70 are generally **inferior to younger patients** but can be acceptable with careful selection:

- **Survival**: 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of 88%, 77%, and 67% vs 92%, 86%, and 78% in younger recipients [^114yNAXN].
- **Complications**: Higher rates of cardiovascular, renal, and infectious complications; malignancy is a major cause of death [^114cKXcR].
- **Selection**: Dialysis and poor functional status (KPS < 40) strongly predict worse outcomes; carefully selected older patients without these features can have outcomes comparable to younger recipients [^114yNAXN].

---

## Factors influencing transplantation in patients over 70

Several factors shape transplantation in patients over 70:

| **Factor** | **Influence on transplantation** |
|-|-|
| Physiological age and comorbidities | Physiological, not chronological, age guides candidacy; comorbidities and functional status are critical [^114nQd4F] [^115UEAQb] |
| Organ allocation policies | MELD-based systems may disadvantage older patients with lower physiological reserves but similar MELD scores [^113QLmPw] |
| Availability of donor organs | Older recipients often receive marginal grafts, impacting outcomes [^116XpT6k] |
| Center-specific practices | Some centers are more aggressive in transplanting older patients, influencing regional proportions [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized assessment**:

- **AASLD**: Age > 70 is not a contraindication; physiological age and comorbidities should guide decisions [^114nQd4F].
- **EASL**: Do not disqualify based on age alone; assess frailty, sarcopenia, and comorbidities [^115eRVq6] [^112TatJ9].

---

## Future trends

The proportion of recipients over 70 is expected to **rise** with population aging and evolving selection criteria, but careful patient selection and management will remain essential to maintain acceptable outcomes [^114yNAXN] [^111GC7an].

---

Approximately **4%** of liver transplant recipients are over 70, a figure that is slowly increasing; with rigorous selection and management, outcomes can be acceptable, though generally inferior to younger recipients [^114yNAXN] [^111W21pB].

### Age matters: what affects the cumulative lifespan of a transplanted liver? [^112zeonp]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess factors affecting the cumulative lifespan of a transplanted liver.

Background

Liver aging is different from other solid organs. It is unknown how old a liver can actually get after liver transplantation.

Methods

Deceased donor liver transplants from 1988 to 2021 were queried from the United States UNOS registry. Cumulative liver age was calculated as donor age + recipient graft survival.

Results

In total, 184,515 livers were included. Most were donation after brain death donors (n = 175,343). The percentage of livers achieving > 70, 80, 90, and 100 years cumulative age was 7.8% (n = 14,392), 1.9% (n = 3576), 0.3% (n = 528), and 0.01% (n = 21), respectively. The youngest donor age contributing to a cumulative liver age > 90 years was 59 years, with posttransplant survival of 34 years. In pediatric recipients, 736 (4.4%) and 282 livers (1.7%) survived > 50 and 60 years overall, respectively. Transplanted livers achieved cumulative age > 90 years in 2.86 per 1000 and > 100 years in 0.1 per 1000. The U.S. population at large has a cumulative "liver age" > 90 years in 5.35 per 1000 persons, and > 100 years in 0.2 per 1000. Livers aged > 60 years at transplant experienced both improved cumulative survival (P < 0.0001) and interestingly improved survival after transplantation (P < 0.0001). Recipient warm ischemia time of > 30 minutes was most predictive of reduced cumulative liver survival overall (n = 184,515, hazard ratio = 1.126, P < 0.001) and excluding patients with mortality in the first 6 months (n = 151,884, hazard ratio = 0.973, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In summary, transplanted livers frequently get as old as those in the average population despite ischemic-reperfusion-injury and immunosuppression. The presented results justify using older donor livers regardless of donation type, even in sicker recipients with limited options.

Age and eligibility for liver transplantation (LT) — In the absence of significant comorbidities, older recipient age (> 70 years) is not a contraindication to LT (2-B). Physiological, not chronological, age determines whether an older patient can be accepted for LT, with careful attention to comorbidities and functional status, and overall outcomes are acceptable in recipients > 70 years of age, although they are inferior to those in younger age groups.

### Outcomes in liver transplantation: does sex matter? [^113Yxo4c]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Age at transplant

Both men and women are most commonly transplanted between 50 and 64 years of age, though a somewhat higher percentage of women are transplanted in the older and younger age ranges. Among U.S. LT recipients in 2012, approximately 15% of women were transplanted at > 65 years of age compared to 13% of men, and approximately 7% of women compared to 4% of men were transplanted between ages 18 and 34 years.

### Evolving role of liver transplantation in elderly recipients [^111W21pB]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The need for liver transplantation (LT) among older patients is increasing, but the role of LT in the elderly (≥ 70 years) is not well defined. We retrospectively reviewed all primary LTs from 1998 through 2016 at our center. Survival and associated risk factors were analyzed with Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods for LT recipients in 3 age groups: < 60, 60–69, and ≥ 70 years. Among 2281 LT recipients, the median age was 56 years (range, 15–80 years), and 162 were aged ≥ 70 years. The estimated 5- and 10-year patient survival probabilities for elderly LT recipients were lower (70.8% and 43.6%) than for recipients aged 60–69 years (77.2% and 64.6%) and < 60 years (80.7% and 67.6%). Patient and graft survival rates associated with LT improved over time from the pre-Model for End-Stage Liver Disease era to Share 15, pre-Share 35, and Share 35 for the cohort overall (P < 0.001), but rates remained relatively stable in septuagenarians throughout the study periods (all P > 0.45). There was no incremental negative effect of age at LT among elderly patients aged 70–75 years (log-rank P = 0.32). Among elderly LT recipients, greater requirement for packed red blood cells and longer warm ischemia times were significantly associated with decreased survival (P < 0.05). Survival of LT recipients, regardless of age, markedly surpassed that of patients who were denied LT, but it was persistently 20%-30% lower than the expected survival of the general US population (P < 0.001). With the aging of the population, select older patients with end-stage liver diseases can benefit from LT, which largely restores their expected life spans.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^114S73Rj]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, liver allografts from donors aged 70 years or older are more often and more efficiently used for LT in the ET region. These advanced age donors provide an important additional number of livers available for transplantation. Donor age is an independent risk factor with a linear relation with inferior graft survival from 25 up to 80 years old. Yet, transplantations performed with livers from donors of an advanced age can lead to similar outcomes in preferred recipients. Older donors should therefore be reported less cautiously and allocated to preferred recipients to further decrease wait‐list mortality safely.

### Assessment of trends in transplantation of liver grafts from older donors and outcomes in recipients of liver grafts from older donors, 2003–2016 [^1112pxBR]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

In light of the growing population of older adults in the United States, older donors (aged ≥ 70 years) represent an expansion of the donor pool; however, their organs are underused. Liver grafts from older donors were historically associated with poor outcomes and higher discard rates, but clinical protocols, organ allocation, and the donor pool have changed in the past 15 years.

Objective

To evaluate trends in demographics, discard rates, and outcomes among older liver donors and transplant recipients of livers from older donors in a large national cohort.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective cohort study of 4127 liver grafts from older donors and 3350 liver-only recipients of older donor grafts and 78 990 liver grafts from younger donors (aged 18–69 years) and 64 907 liver-only recipients of younger donor grafts between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2016, in the United States. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, which includes data on all transplant recipients in the United States that are submitted by members of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, was used.

Exposures

Year of liver transplant and age of liver donor.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Odds of graft discard and posttransplant outcomes of all-cause graft loss and mortality.

Results

In this study, 4127 liver grafts from older donors were recovered for liver transplant across the study period (2003–2016); 747 liver grafts from older donors were discarded, and 3350 liver grafts from older donors were used for liver-only recipients. After adjusting for donor characteristics other than age and accounting for Organ Procurement Organization-level variation, liver grafts from older donors were more likely to be discarded compared with liver grafts from younger donors in 2003–2006 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.68–2.31), 2007–2009 (aOR, 2.55; 95% CI, 2.17–3.01), 2010–2013 (aOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.68–2.46), and 2013–2016 (aOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.96–2.86) (P < .001 for all). Transplants of liver grafts from older donors represented a progressively lower proportion of all adult liver transplants, from 6.0% (n = 258 recipients) in 2003 to 3.2% (n = 211 recipients) in 2016 (P = .001). However, outcomes in recipients of grafts from older donors improved over time, with 40% lower graft loss risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53–0.68; P < .001) and 41% lower mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.52–0.68; P < .001) in 2010 through 2016 vs 2003 through 2009; these results were beyond the general temporal improvements in graft loss (interaction P = .03) and mortality risk (interaction P = .04) among recipients of liver grafts from younger donors.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings show that from 2003 to 2016, liver graft loss and mortality among recipients of liver grafts from older donors improved; however, liver graft discard from older donors remained increased and the number of transplants performed with liver grafts from older donors decreased. Expansion of the donor pool through broader use of liver grafts from older donors might be reasonable.

### Differential aging trends among candidates for liver transplant with and without HCC [^113iwpNY]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

HCC has become a leading indication for liver transplant (LT), with HCC registrants increasing more than 6-fold in the past 2 decades, accompanied by a significant rise in older candidates. Given this trend and the influence of hepatitis C (HCV) treatments, updated data on aging and changing etiologies in older patients with HCC are needed. This study examines age trends, clinical characteristics, and transplant outcomes by comparing older (70+), younger patients with HCC, and patients without HCC. All adult candidates for LT (18+) in the UNOS/OPTN registry (2012–2022) were analyzed and categorized by HCC status and age (< 70 or 70+). Regression coefficients compared HCC and non-HCC registrants and recipients by age group. The aging trend among LT registrants was more pronounced in patients with HCC. From 2012 to 2022, the mean age of HCC registrants rose from 58.7 to 62.9, with those aged 70+ increasing from 4.2% to 15.0%. Non-HCC registrants saw minimal change, with a stable mean age of 53 years and a modest rise in those 70+ from 2.1% to 4.7%. HCV prevalence among patients with HCC decreased from 37.5% to 27.4%, while patients without HCC dropped from 14.8% to 5%. Posttransplant outcomes for older HCC recipients remained favorable, with 1-year and 5-year survival rates of 91% and 71%, respectively, comparable to older patients without HCC (87% and 69%). Among over 132,000 LT registrants from 2012 to 2022, the age of HCC candidates increased, with a growing proportion aged 70 and older, while the age and proportion of older adults among non-HCC registrants remained stable. This demographic shift underscores the importance of enhanced frailty assessments to improve outcomes for older patients with HCC.

### Clinical characteristics associated with posttransplant survival among adults 70 years old or older undergoing liver transplantation [^114yNAXN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Goals

We sought to identify pre-liver transplantation (LT) characteristics among older adults associated with post-LT survival.

Background

The proportion of older patients undergoing deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT) has increased over time.

Study

We analyzed adult DDLT recipients in the United Network for Organ Sharing registry from 2016 through 2020, excluding patients listed as status 1 or with a model of end-stage liver disease exceptions for hepatocellular carcinoma. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate post-LT survival probabilities among older recipients (age ≥ 70 y). Associations between clinical covariates and post-LT mortality were assessed using Cox regressions.

Results

Of 22,862 DDLT recipients, 897 (4%) were 70 years old or older. Compared with younger recipients, older recipients had worse overall survival (P < 0.01) (1y: 88% vs 92%, 3y: 77% vs 86%, and 5y: 67% vs 78%). Among older adults, in univariate Cox regressions, dialysis [hazards ratio (HR): 1.96, 95% CI: 1.38–2.77] and poor functional status [defined as Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) < 40] (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.31–2.53) were each associated with mortality, remaining significant on multivariable Cox regressions. The effect of dialysis and KPS < 40 at LT on post-LT survival (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.77–4.01) was worse than the effects of either KPS < 40 (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03–2.23) or dialysis alone (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.62–3.36). Older recipients with KPS > 40 without dialysis had comparable survival rates compared with younger recipients (P = 0.30).

Conclusions

While older DDLT recipients had worse overall post-LT survival compared with younger recipients, favorable survival rates were observed among older adults who did not require dialysis and had poor functional status. Poor functional status and dialysis at LT may be useful to stratify older adults at higher risk for poor post-LT outcomes.

### Older age and liver transplantation: a review [^115fSeAn]. Liver Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Patients older than 60 are undergoing transplantation with increasing frequency. Reports from several transplant centers document that overall short-term patient survival rates in seniors undergoing liver transplantation are comparable to survival rates of younger adults. However, specific subgroups of older patients may not fare as well. Seniors with far-advanced end-stage liver disease are high-risk for liver transplantation and have poor survival rates. In addition, seniors older than 65 have worse outcomes than those who are 60 to 65, and studies have shown increased mortality with increasing age as a continuous variable. On the other hand, the majority of seniors who survive liver transplantation have full or only minimally limited functional status. Preoperative evaluation of older patients for transplantation requires careful screening to exclude cardiopulmonary disease, malignancy, and other diseases of the aged. Paradoxically, seniors may benefit from a senescent immune system, which results in decreased requirements for immunosuppressive drugs, and possibly a lower rate of acute allograft rejection. Despite good overall short-term survival in the elderly, long-term survival may be worse because of an increased rate of long-term complications, such as malignancy and heart disease. In conclusion, although advanced age is a negative risk factor, advanced age alone should not exclude a patient from liver transplantation; however, it mandates thorough pretransplant evaluation and careful long-term follow-up with attention to usual health maintenance issues in the elderly.

### Survival benefit of accepting livers from deceased donors over 70 years old [^112W5RmG]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Livers from older donors (OLDs; age ≥ 70) are risky and often declined; however, it is likely that some candidates will benefit from OLDs versus waiting for younger ones. To characterize the survival benefit of accepting OLD grafts, we used 2009–2017 SRTR data to identify 24 431 adult liver transplant (LT) candidates who were offered OLD grafts eventually accepted by someone. Outcomes from the time-of-offer were compared between candidates who accepted an OLD graft and matched controls within MELD ± 2 who declined the same offer. Candidates who accepted OLD grafts (n = 1311) were older (60.5 vs. 57.8 years, P < .001), had a higher median MELD score (25 vs. 22, P < .001), and were less likely to have hepatitis C cirrhosis (14.9% vs. 31.2%, P < .001). Five-year cumulative mortality among those who accepted versus declined the same OLD offer was 23.4% versus 41.2% (P < .001). Candidates who accepted OLDs experienced an almost twofold reduction in mortality (aHR: 0.45 0.59, P < .001) compared to those who declined the same offer, especially among the highest MELD (35–40) candidates (aHR: 0.10 0.55, P = .001). Accepting an OLD offer provided substantial long-term survival benefit compared to waiting for a better organ offer, notably among candidates with MELD 35–40. Providers should consider these benefits as they evaluate OLD graft offers.

### Comparative outcomes of living donor liver transplantation in elderly recipients: a study on morbidity and survival in 1018 recipients [^116XFRqw]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the increasing demand of patients requiring liver transplants who are 70 years or older and may have health conditions, this study aimed to assess the outcomes of recipients of living donor liver transplants (LDLTs) in this age group. We conducted an analysis using a prospective registry that included all recipients of LDLT from January 2011 to May 2023. Patients were divided into 2 age groups, 18–69 years and 70 years or older, and their short-term and long-term outcomes were compared. We considered complications as major if they were grade ≥ 3a (Dindo-Clavien). Among 1018 recipients of LDLT, 71 (7%) were aged 70 years or older. The rates of posttransplant complications of any severity were comparable between the younger and older age groups (46.7% vs. 46%, p = 0.983), as were the rates of major complications (25% vs. 25%, p = 0.995) and in-hospital mortality (6% vs. 7%, p = 0.800). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survival rates were 94%, 86%, and 81% in the younger group and 92%, 87%, and 65% in the older group (p = 0.090). Similarly, the overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year recipient survival rates were 90%, 85%, and 86% in the younger group and 88%, 86%, and 65% in the older group (p = 0.100). This study suggests that carefully selected elderly patients can undergo LDLT and achieve comparable short-term outcomes to their younger counterparts.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^113sE9aQ]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that an important and increasing proportion of LTs in ET is performed with livers from donors of ≥ 70 years. These donors are not only more often reported in recent years but are also increasingly more efficiently used for transplantation. We have shown that an increasing donor age is linearly associated with graft loss between 25 years old up to 80 years old, without evidence of decreasing after 80 years. Additional risk factors like a history of diabetes in the donor and HCV in the recipient should therefore be avoided when transplanting older livers. With an adequate selection, wait‐list mortality can be safely further reduced by increasing the number of reported liver allografts from donors of ≥ 70 years for preferred recipients.

The high shortage of transplantable liver allografts has led to an international expansion of acceptable donor criteria. Within ET, the extent of aging of transplanted livers is distinctive; the median donor age increased from 43 to 55 years in only 15 years. Currently, over 10% of all transplantations in adult recipients in ET are performed with livers of ≥ 70 years. Results from this study show that outcomes could potentially be improved by optimizing our patient selection. This is an important issue because of the expected increase in transplanted livers from donors of advanced age. The increase will be likely caused by a higher availability and because these organs will be more readily accepted. The increased availability is because Western populations are aging rapidly, and the higher acceptance rate is likely because of the persisting shortage that was also observed in this study (Fig. 5; from 42% to 76%).

With this development, defining the effect of an increasing donor age on outcome becomes more and more important. Considering the oldest transplanted liver in our study was 98 years old, the question arises as to whether there is a maximum donor age at all. In this study, we have shown that the risk of graft loss increases linearly from a donor age of 25 up to 80 years old. The risk of livers from donors of 80 years may increase nonlinearly and suggests that these organs reach the outer limits of biological flexibility despite their regenerative capacity. 14, 15

### Age and liver transplantation [^111GC7an]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The average age of liver transplant donors and recipients has increased over the years. Independent of the cause of liver disease, older candidates have more comorbidities, higher waitlist mortality and higher post-transplant mortality than younger patients. However, transplant benefit may be similar in older and younger recipients, provided older recipients are carefully selected. The cohort of elderly patients transplanted decades ago is also increasingly raising issues concerning long-term exposure to immunosuppression and aging of the transplanted liver. Excellent results can be achieved with elderly donors and there is virtually no upper age limit for donors after brain death liver transplantation. The issue is how to optimise selection, procurement and matching to ensure good results with elderly donors. The impact of old donor age is more pronounced in younger recipients and patients with a high model for end-stage liver disease score. Age matching between the donor and the recipient should be incorporated into allocation policies with a multistep approach. However, age matching may vary depending on the objectives of different allocation policies. In addition, age matching must be revisited in the era of direct-acting antivirals. More restrictive limits have been adopted in donation after circulatory death. Perfusion machines which are currently under investigation may help expand these limits. In living donor liver transplantation, donor age limit is essentially guided by morbidity related to procurement. In this review we summarise changing trends in recipient and donor age. We discuss the implications of older age donors and recipients. We also consider different options for age matching in liver transplantation that could improve outcomes.

### No country for old livers? Examining and optimizing the utilization of elderly liver grafts [^116hVK51]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Of the 1.6 million patients > 70 years of age who died of stroke since 2002, donor livers were retrieved from only 2402 (0.15% yield rate). Despite reports of successful liver transplantation (LT) with elderly grafts (EG), advanced donor age is considered a risk for poor outcomes. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services definitions of an "eligible death" for donation excludes patients > 70 years of age, creating disincentives to donation. We investigated utilization and outcomes of recipients of donors > 70 through analysis of a United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research-file of adult LTs from 2002 to 2014. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression was used to identify factors influencing outcomes of EG recipients. Three thousand one hundred four livers from donors > 70, ≈40% of which were used in 2 regions: 2 (520/3104) and 9 (666/3104). Unadjusted survival was significantly worse among recipients of EG compared to recipients of younger grafts (P < .0001). Eight independent negative predictors of survival in recipients of EG were identified on multivariable analysis. Survival of low-risk recipients who received EG was significantly better than survival of recipients of younger grafts (P = .04). Outcomes of recipients of EG can therefore be optimized to equal outcomes of younger grafts. Given the large number of stroke deaths in patients > 70 years of age, the yield rate of EGs can be maximized and disincentives removed to help resolve the organ shortage crisis.

### Donor age-based analysis of liver transplantation outcomes: short-and long-term outcomes are similar regardless of donor age [^116WKEGT]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The shortage of donor organs has led to increasing use of extended criteria donors, including older donors. The upper limit of donor age that produces acceptable outcomes continues to be explored. In liver transplantation, with appropriate selection, graft survival and patient outcomes would be comparable regardless of age.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective analysis of 1,036 adult orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT) from a prospectively maintained database performed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2013. The study focus group was liver transplantations performed using grafts from older (older than 60 years) deceased donors. Deceased donor liver transplantations done during the same time period using grafts from younger donors (younger than 60 years) were analyzed for comparison. Both groups were further divided based on recipient age (less than 60 years and 60 years or older). Donor age was the primary variable. Recipient variables included were demographics, indication for transplantation, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), graft survival, and patient survival. Operative details and postoperative complications were analyzed.

Results

Patient demographics and perioperative details were similar between groups. Patient and graft survival rates were similar in the 4 groups. Rates of rejection (p = 0.07), bile leak (p = 0.17), and hepatic artery thrombosis were comparable across all groups (p = 0.84). Hepatitis C virus recurrence was similar across all groups (p = 0.10). Thirty-one young recipients (less than 60 years) received grafts from donors aged 70 or older. Their survival and other complication rates were comparable to those in the young donor to young recipient group.

Conclusions

Comparable outcomes in graft and patient survivals were achieved using older donors (60 years or more), regardless of recipient age, without increased rate of complications.

### National trends in liver transplantation in older adults [^116MwMzH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore trends in liver transplantation (LT) and outcomes for older recipients for evaluation, counseling, and appropriate referral of this vulnerable group of older adults.

Design

Prospective national cohort study.

Setting

Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (January 1, 2003-December 31, 2016).

Participants

Older (aged ≥ 65) deceased donor liver-only transplant recipients (n = 8,627).

Measurements

We evaluated temporal changes in recipient, donor, and transplant characteristics and post-LT length of stay (LOS), acute rejection, graft loss, and mortality using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards.

Results

LT in older adults almost quadrupled, from 263 in 2003 (9.5% of total LTs that year) to 1,144 in 2016 (20.7% of total LTs). Recent recipients were more likely to be female and African American and have a higher body mass index and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. Hepatitis C, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma were the most common indications for LT in recent recipients. Odds of LOS longer than 2 weeks decreased 34% from 2003–06 to 2013–16 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57–0.76, P < .001), 1-year acute rejection decreased 30% (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.56–0.88, P = .002), all-cause graft loss decreased 54% (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.40–0.52, P < .001), and mortality decreased 57% (aHR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.38–0.49, P < .001).

Conclusion

Despite the substantial increase in the number of older adults undergoing LT and the severity of their condition, LOS, rejection, graft loss, and mortality have significantly decreased over time. These trends can help guide appropriate LT referral and counseling in older adults with end-stage liver disease. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:2321–2326, 2018.

### The elderly liver transplant recipient: a call for caution [^1179BiCr]. Annals of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether liver transplantation is judicious in recipients older than 60 years of age.

Summary Background Data

The prevailing opinion among the transplant community remains that elderly recipients of liver allografts fare as well as their younger counterparts, but our results have in some cases been disappointing. This study was undertaken to review the results of liver transplants in the elderly in a large single-center setting. A secondary goal was to define, if possible, factors that could help the clinician in the prudent allocation of the donor liver.

Methods

A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained single-institution database of 1,446 consecutive liver transplant recipients was conducted. The 241 elderly patients (older than 60 years) were compared with their younger counterparts by preoperative laboratory values, illness severity, nutritional status, and donor age. Survival data were stratified and logistic regression analyses were conducted.

Results

Elderly patients with better-preserved hepatic synthetic function or with lower pretransplant serum bilirubin levels fared as well as younger patients. Elderly patients who had poor hepatic synthetic function or high bilirubin levels or who were admitted to the hospital had much lower survival rates than the sicker younger patients or the less-ill older patients. Recipient age 60 years or older, pretransplant hospital admission, and high bilirubin level were independent risk factors for poorer outcome.

Conclusions

Low-risk elderly patients fare as well as younger patients after liver transplantation. However, unless results can be improved, high-risk patients older than 60 years should probably not undergo liver transplantation.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^116dxGcc]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

UTILIZATION IN OTHER STUDIES

Utilization rates for donors aged ≥ 70 years old increased in our study from 42% (2000‐2003) to 77% (2010‐2012) and remained at 76% between 2013 and 2015. In the overall study period, the utilization rate was 70% for livers ≥ 70 years old and 69% for livers ≥ 80 years. The utilization rate of livers ≥ 70 years old was even slightly higher at 72% when livers that were used for retransplantations were included (data not shown). These rates are very high in comparison to other studies who report usage rates of approximately 60% 38 and 52%‐63% for liver donors ≥ 70 years and ≥ 80 years old, respectively. 7, 16, 38 It does, however, correspond with usage in the United States where 74% of livers of 70 years and older are used for transplantation. 10 Although the United States has a similar utilization rate, it is of note that the proportion of transplantations with donors ≥ 70 years of all performed transplantations is much higher within ET as compared with the United States. By using the same inclusion criteria as Halazun et al. 10 in ET 2625 out of 21,644 (12%) transplantations in adults were performed with donors from 70 years and older as compared with 4.3% in the United States (data from ET).

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^114CX6aH]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Acceptance criteria for liver allografts are ever more expanding because of a persisting wait-list mortality. Older livers are therefore offered and used more frequently for transplantation. This study aims to analyze the use and longterm outcome of these transplantations. Data were included on 17,811 first liver transplantations (LTs) and information on livers that were reported for allocation but not transplanted from 2000 to 2015 in the Eurotransplant (ET) region. Graft survival was defined as the period between transplantation and date of retransplantation or date of recipient death. In the study period, 2394 (13%) transplantations were performed with livers ≥ 70 years old. Graft survival was 74%, 57%, and 41% at 1-, 5-, and 10-year follow-up, respectively. A history of diabetes mellitus in the donor (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; P = 0.01) and positive hepatitis C virus antibody in the recipient (HR, 1.5; P < 0.001) are specific risk factors for transplantations with livers ≥ 70 years old. Although donor age is associated with a linearly increasing risk of graft loss between 25 and 80 years old, no difference in graft survival could be observed when "preferred" recipients were transplanted with a liver < 70 or ≥ 70 years old (HR 1.1; CI 0.92–1.23, P = 0.40) or with a donor < 40 or ≥ 70 years old (HR 1.2; CI 0.96–1.37, P = 0.13). Utilization of reported livers ≥ 70 years old increased from 42% in 2000–2003 to 76% in 2013–2015 without a decrease in graft survival (P = 0.45). In conclusion, an important proportion of LTs in the ET region are performed with livers ≥ 70 years old. The risk of donor age on graft loss increases linearly between 25 and 80 years old. Livers ≥ 70 years old can, however, be transplanted safely in preferred patients and are to be used more frequently to further reduce wait-list mortality.

### Life expectancy of transplanted livers: HOPE against aging? [^111hwqoF]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the impact of cumulative liver age on graft survival in liver transplant recipients.

Summary Of Background Data

Organ shortage has led to increased use of elderly donor livers for an ageing group of recipients, particularly in Europe. We hypothesized that hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) enhances graft resilience against aging in livers from elderly donors.

Methods

This post-hoc analysis of the multicenter European HOPE-REAL study (NCT05520320) examined liver age in adult recipients of HOPE-treated brain-dead donor (DBD) livers. Cumulative liver age was defined as the sum of donor age and post-transplant graft survival. HOPE-treated DBD liver transplants were compared with a single-center control cohort of non-perfused DBD livers using propensity score matching to adjust for confounders.

Results

The median cumulative liver age was significantly higher in the HOPE-treated (n = 768) cohort than in the non-perfused (n = 863) group (69 vs. 61 years, P < 0.001), yet graft survival was superior in the HOPE-treated group (log-rank P < 0.001). After matching, cumulative liver age remained significantly higher in the HOPE group (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified HOPE as an independent predictor of cumulative liver age (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

HOPE treatment appears to mitigate the risks associated with transplanting elderly DBD livers, leading to excellent long-term survival in an ageing recipient population. These findings support broader adoption of HOPE to improve utilization of older donor livers and expand the donor pool.

### Aging of liver transplant registrants and recipients: trends and impact on waitlist outcomes, post-transplantation outcomes, and transplant-related survival benefit [^113QLmPw]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Epidemiologic factors have generated increased demand for liver transplantation among older patients. We aimed to describe trends in age among liver transplant registrants and recipients and the effect of age on waitlist and post-transplantation outcomes and on transplant-related survival benefit.

Methods

We obtained data from the United Network for Organ Sharing on adults who were listed for liver transplantation (N = 122,606) or underwent liver transplantation (N = 60,820) from 2002 to 2014 in the United States. Competing risks analysis was used to model waitlist outcomes and Cox proportional hazards analysis to model post-transplantation survival. These models were also used to estimate 5-year transplant-related survival benefit for different age groups, calculated as the difference between waitlist and post-transplantation life expectancy.

Results

Between 2002 and 2014, the mean age of liver transplant registrants increased from 51.2 to 55.7 years, with a more prominent increase in hepatitis C virus-positive (50.9–57.9 years) than hepatitis C virus-negative (51.3–54.3 years) registrants. The proportion of registrants aged ≥ 60 years increased from 19% to 41%. In hepatitis C virus-negative patients, aging trends were driven by increasing proportions of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Among transplant registrants, increasing age was associated with increasing mortality before transplantation and decreasing likelihood of transplantation. Among transplant recipients, increasing age was associated with increasing post-transplantation mortality. There was little difference in 5-year transplant-related survival benefit between different age groups who had the same Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score.

Conclusions

Dramatic aging of liver transplant registrants and recipients occurred from 2002 to 2014, driven by aging of the hepatitis C virus-positive cohort and increased prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Increasing age does not affect transplant-related survival benefit substantially because age diminishes both post-transplantation survival and waitlist survival approximately equally.

### Long-term results using old liver grafts for transplantation: sexagenerian versus liver donors older than 70 years [^115f9Lkm]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The most practical measure to augment the available number of liver grafts and thus reduce waiting list mortality is to increase the donor age limit. We hypothesized that with careful selection of old liver donors without age limit it should be possible to obtain good patient and graft survival.

Methods

The present study comprises 351 adults who underwent liver transplantation. They were divided into three groups according to the age of the liver donors: group 1: 226 recipients of donors < 60 years; group 2: 75 recipients of donors between 60 and 70 years; and group 3: 50 recipients of donors > 70 years. A comparative study among the groups was performed.

Results

Patient survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were, respectively, 81.0, 76.1, and 71.1% in group 1; 83.8, 74, and 72.2% in group 2; and 76, 70.0, and 62.9% in group 3 (P = NS). Graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was, respectively, 74.8, 69.0, and 64.1% in group 1; 82.7, 71.4, and 69.6% in group 2; and 71.4, 64.8, and 58.3% in group 3 (P = NS). We analyzed the use of older grafts in recipients with HCV cirrhosis and did not find significant differences in patient and graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. In multivariate analysis increased donor body mass index and decreased recipient albumin were associated with lower patient and graft survival.

Conclusions

Because patient and graft survival rates are not affected by donor age, well-selected older donor livers can be safely used if they show good function and preharvesting conditions.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^116cq7Ly]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The number of patients registered for a liver transplantation (LT) in the Eurotransplant (ET) region exceeds the number of available liver allografts. In 2016, 2258 patients were registered for a LT, and 1567 transplantations were performed. Wait‐list mortality is therefore a serious issue: Over 500 patients died in 2016 while waiting and over 1700 patients were still on the waiting list at the year's end. 1 To increase the number of transplantations, the acceptance criteria for LT have been stretched increasingly in the past decade. One of the criteria that is being expanded is donor age. As a result, mean donor age has increased from 25 years old in 1990 to 55 years old in 2016. 1 This development is illustrated by the significant increase in donors aged 70 years or older. 2 These older livers can increase the number of LT and are therefore an important source to help decrease wait‐list mortality.

However, they are likely to negatively affect posttransplantation outcomes because donor age is a well‐known risk factor. 3 For example, it has been included as an important risk factor in several outcome models, like the donor risk index (DRI), 4 ET‐DRI, 5 and BAR score. 6 The latter uses a cutoff for older donors of 40 years old, 6 whereas the DRI and ET‐DRI have donor age categorized into 5 age categories. The category with the oldest livers comprises all livers from donors of 70 years and older and is associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.65 and 1.62 for the DRI and ET‐DRI, respectively. 4, 5 Although these risk models use cut‐off values for donor age, the actual summative effect of donor age on posttransplantation outcome is yet unclear, especially when transplanting livers from donors > 70 years.

The demographical transition in Western countries with aging populations and promising posttransplantation results 7, 8, 9 indicates that this practice will become increasingly more common. The current substantial use might therefore just be the onset of a far more common one in Europe and the United States. 10 It questions whether there are limits to donor age at all and urges a thorough analysis of the current practice of transplantations with elderly donors.

This study aims to analyze the effect of an increasing donor age on outcomes after LT in the ET region. Second, an evaluation of the current and potential use of liver allografts from donors of 70 years and older is performed.

CENTER ANALYSIS

No difference in outcome of transplantations with livers ≥ 70 years old (n = 2394) was observed when centers were stratified according to the number of transplanted with livers ≥ 70 years old (< 70 or > 70 transplantations; P = 0.781) or by proportion of livers > 70 years old (≤ 12% or > 12%; P = 0.395; Supporting Fig. 4 A, B) in the study period. High proportion centers tended to transplant younger donors (54 years old versus 49 years old; P < 0.001), but no (clinical) significant differences in median laboratory MELD score (17 versus 16; P < 0.001) or CIT (8.8 hours versus 8.9 hours; P = 0.96) were observed as compared with low proportion centers.

When centers were categorized according to outcome of transplantations with livers ≥ 70 years old, 6 centers (n = 570 LTs) had significantly "better than expected" graft survival at 5‐year follow‐up, whereas 8 (n = 649 LTs) and 20 transplantation centers (n = 1160 LTs), respectively, had "worse than expected" or "as expected" outcome (Supporting Fig. 4C). Characteristics of these groups are shown in Supporting Table 2. Most notably, centers with better than expected performance transplanted these livers ≥ 70 years old more often in preferred recipients and transplanted more locally procured livers.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^115Jjq5s]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

IMPLICATIONS

Outcomes of geriatric LT in ET can likely be further improved based on the center‐specific analysis. Centers with better than expected outcomes transplanted the livers ≥ 70 years old more often in preferred recipients and less often in recipients with HCV. In addition, these centers accepted more often locally procured organs and transplanted livers with relatively short ischemic times. These potentially beneficial factors can be further supported by modifying allocation algorithms to decrease CITs and to improve our patient selection. For example, CITs could be further reduced by more regional allocation or even by allocation to the donor hospital. This could positively affect outcomes and might even prevent organ loss. Approximately 6% of procured and not transplanted livers in this study were also declined due to long CITs. Another option would be to improve our donor‐recipient matching because we have confirmed good outcomes of older livers in preferred recipients as defined by Segev et al. 11 It is interesting that posttransplantation outcomes in these preferred recipients are not significantly affected by older donor age. Although not fully understood, the factors recipient age > 45 years, BMI < 35 kg/m 2, and CIT < 8 hours seem to be effective variables for recipient selection and do also apply to a European population of liver patients.

Besides improving outcomes of currently used older livers, we have to focus on improving the use of currently reported livers and to increase the number of reported livers itself. The relative use can potentially increase based on the reasons for discarding organs. Several factors, like CIT, might be resolved or attenuated with the use of machine perfusion. It would at least enable us to better assess the actual quality or function of the graft prior to the transplantation to safely transplant livers that are now discarded. 39 Second, we should strive to improve the number of older donors who are reported. The willingness of centers to accept and transplant these older organs is very high. The maximum donor age that doctors will consider for specific patients increased from 75 to 87 years between September 2003 and December 2015 based on the individual acceptance criteria of patients entered in the ET liver allocation system. On a center level, the maximum donor age is currently even set at 100 years old for 15 out of 38 (40%) LT centers (data ET). It might be true that acceptance criteria have expanded faster than criteria for reporting donors. Because there were only relatively small differences in baseline characteristics between transplanted and nontransplanted livers, we suggest avoiding an age limit to report potential donors. Because of this, otherwise transplantable older donor livers will not be missed.

Deceased donors of extremes of age (< 12 years to > 65 years)

The age cut-off for categorising elderly donors varies by country. Given that the Government of India's 2023 "One Nation, One Policy"removed the 65-year age limit for receiving DD organ transplantation, ISOT decided to use the same cut-off of > 65 years to categorise elderly recipients. A systematic review of eight nonrandomised comparative studies (n = 4376 recipients of DD liver transplant [DDLT]) reported that donors of 79.9% of the grafts were < 70 years old and 20.1% were > 70 years old. One-year graft and recipient survival were similar between the two groups (P = 0.11 and P = 0.54, respectively). However, three and five-year graft survival (P = 0.006 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and patient survival (P = 0.007 and P < 0.0001, respectively) were better for the > 70-year-old group. The rates of biliary or vascular complications or delayed/loss of graft function were not statistically different between the groups. The systematic review concluded that liver transplant from > 70 years old DD was feasible with good functional outcomes. Single-centre retrospective studies conclude that very advanced age (≥ 70–75 years) should not be an exclusion criterion for organ donation (liver, kidney, and dual kidney transplant [DKT]). The ISCCM recommends that DKT and liver donations should be accepted from ECD > 70 years for recipients whose outcome is poor without organ transplants.

Consistently, the number of livers reaching cumulative liver age of more than 70 years and more than 80 years in the HOPE group was 372/768 (48.4%) and 170/768 (22.1%), respectively, compared with 261/863 (30.2%) and 127/863 (14.7%) in the control group (P < 0.001) (Table 2), both of which are considerably higher than those recently observed in the United States(Table 2). A separate analysis of liver transplants using donor livers older than 70 years or older than 80 years, revealed persisting and significant survival advantages for the HOPE group (Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Multivariate analysis identified HOPE treatment, along with donor age and primary transplantation, as a strong (P < 0.001) and independent predictor of cumulative liver age (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure 2 B). Furthermore, propensity score matching, adjusting for key confounders, confirmed significantly higher cumulative liver age in the HOPE-treated cohort (n = 432) compared with a matched control group of unperfused DBD livers (n = 404) (P < 0.001, Fig. 3).

### Liver transplantation for elderly patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma [^112WBPpK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although liver resection is a viable option for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation is the optimal treatment. The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of liver transplantation for elderly patients, and to assess the therapeutic benefit derived from liver transplantation over liver resection.

Methods

This was a population-based study of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC in the United States between 2004 and 2018. Data were retrieved from the National Cancer Database. Elderly patients were defined as individuals aged 70 years and over. Propensity score overlap weighting was used to control for heterogeneity between the liver resection and liver transplantation cohorts.

Results

Among 4909 liver transplant recipients, 215 patients (4.1 per cent) were classified as elderly. Among 5922 patients who underwent liver resection, 1907 (32.2 per cent) were elderly. Elderly patients who underwent liver transplantation did not have a higher hazard of dying during the first 5 years after transplantation than non-elderly recipients. After propensity score weighting, liver transplantation was associated with a lower risk of death than liver resection. Other factors associated with overall survival included diagnosis during 2016–2018, non-white/non-African American race, and α-fetoprotein level over 20 ng/dl.

Conclusion

Elderly patients with HCC should not be excluded from liver transplantation based on age only. Transplantation leads to favourable survival compared with liver resection.

With increased demand for liver transplantation (LT), outcomes of older recipients have been subjected to greater scrutiny, as previous studies have demonstrated poorer survival outcomes. Outcomes of 77 patients aged > 65 yr (group 1) who underwent transplantation between 1988 and 2003 at King's College Hospital, London, were compared with all recipients aged between 60 and 64 yr (group 2, n = 137) and 202 time-matched control patients with chronic liver disease aged between 18–59 yr (group 3). Patient survival at 30-days for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 99%, 94%, and 94%, respectively (P = not significant [NS]). At 1-yr, survival in the 3 groups was 82%, 86%, and 83%, respectively (P = NS), and at 5-yr patient survival was comparable (73%, 80%, and 78%, respectively) (P = NS). Episodes of acute cellular rejection (ACR) were fewer in the older cohorts (43% vs. 45% vs. 61%, P = 0.0016), although there was no significant difference identified in the numbers of patients in each group who experienced ACR (P = 0.16). A similar but nonsignificant trend was identified for rates of chronic rejection among the groups. In conclusion, these data suggest that survival of patients over 60 and 65 yr undergoing LT is satisfactory, at least in the first 5-yr posttransplantation. In addition, patients over 65 yr experience less rejection, with good graft survival. Thus, LT should not be denied to patients > 65 yr on the basis of age alone, once a comprehensive screen for comorbidity has been undertaken.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^116HG3h2]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

In preferred recipients, there was only a minor, nonstatistically significant difference in graft survival between recipients who underwent transplantation with a liver younger than 70 or older than 70 years old (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.92‐1.23; P = 0.40; Fig. 4 A). In nonpreferred recipients on the contrary, a donor age over 70 years old had a significant impact on graft survival (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.14‐1.35; P < 0.001; Fig. 4 B). An even more distinctive difference between preferred and nonpreferred recipients was observed when comparing transplantations with a donor below 40 years old or of 70 years old and older. In preferred recipients, no statistically significant difference could be observed in graft survival at 5 years (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.96‐1.37; P = 0.13; Fig. 4 C), whereas it had a major impact in nonpreferred recipients (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.39‐1.71; P < 0.001; Fig. 4). Similar results were observed for patient survival at 5 years (Supporting Fig. 3A‐D).

### Liver transplantation in septuagenarians receiving model for end-stage liver disease exception points for hepatocellular carcinoma: the national experience [^1121NtwD]. Liver Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Current liver allocation policy in the United States grants liver transplant candidates with stage T2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) a priority Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 22, regardless of age. Because advanced age may portend an increase in all-cause mortality after transplantation for any diagnosis, the aim of this study was to examine overall posttransplant survival in elderly patients with HCC versus younger cohorts. Based on Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data, Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival rates were compared. Recipients undergoing primary liver transplantation were stratified into cohorts based on age (< 70 or ≥ 70 years) and the receipt of MELD exception points for HCC. Log-rank and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical comparisons. In 2009, 143 transplants were performed for patients who were 70 years old or older. Forty-two percent of these patients received a MELD exception for HCC. Regardless of the diagnosis, the overall survival rate was significantly attenuated for the septuagenarians versus the younger cohort. After 5 years of follow-up, this disparity exceeded 10% to 15% depending on the populations being compared. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 88.4%, 83.2%, 79.6%, 76.1%, and 72.7%, respectively, for the patients who were younger than 70 years and 81.1%, 73.8%, 67.1%, 61.9%, and 55.2%, respectively, for the patients who were 70 years old or older. Five-year survival was negatively affected for patients with HCC who were younger than 70 years; this disparity was not observed for patients with HCC who were 70 years old or older. In conclusion, although patients who are 70 years old or older compose a small fraction of transplant recipients in the United States, patients in this group undergoing transplantation for HCC form an even smaller subset. Overall, transplantation in this age group yields outcomes inferior to those for younger cohorts. However, unlike patients who are less than 70 years old and receive MELD exception points, overall liver transplant survival is not affected by HCC at an advanced age.

### Effect of recipient age on prioritisation for liver transplantation in the UK: a population-based modelling study [^112PBRwR]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2024). High credibility.

Background

Following the introduction of an algorithm aiming to maximise life-years gained from liver transplantation in the UK (the transplant benefit score [TBS]), donor livers were redirected from younger to older patients, mortality rate equalised across the age range and short-term waiting list mortality reduced. Understanding age-related prioritisation has been challenging, especially for younger patients and clinicians allocating non-TBS-directed livers. We aimed to assess age-related prioritisation within the TBS algorithm by modelling liver transplantation prioritisation based on data from a UK transplant unit and comparing these data with other regions.

Methods

In this population-based modelling study, serum parameters and age at liver transplantation assessment of patients attending the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit, Edinburgh, UK, between December, 2002, and November, 2023, were combined with representative synthetic data to model TBS survival predictions, which were compared according to age group (25–49 years vs ≥ 60 years), chronic liver disease severity, and disease cause. Models for end-stage liver disease (UKELD [UK], MELD [Eurotransplant region], and MELD 3.0 [USA]) were used as validated comparators of liver disease severity.

Findings

Of 2093 patients with chronic liver disease, 1808 (86%) had complete datasets and liver disease parameters consistent with eligibility for the liver transplant waiting list in the UK (UKELD ≥ 49). Disease severity as assessed by UKELD, MELD, and MELD 3.0 did not differ by age (median UKELD scores of 56 for patients aged ≥ 60 years vs 56 for patients aged 25–49 years; MELD scores of 16 vs 16; and MELD 3.0 scores of 18 vs 18). TBS increased with advancing age (R = 0·45, p < 0·0001). TBS predicted that transplantation in patients aged 60 years or older would provide a two-fold greater net benefit at 5 years than in patients aged 25–49 years (median TBS 1317 [IQR 1116–1436] in older patients vs 706 [411–1095] in younger patients; p < 0·0001). Older patients were predicted to have shorter survival without transplantation than younger patients (263 days [IQR 144–473] in older patients vs 861 days [448–1164] in younger patients; p < 0·0001) but similar survival after transplantation (1599 days [1563–1628] vs 1573 days [1525–1614]; p < 0·0001). Older patients could reach a TBS for which a liver offer was likely below minimum criteria for transplantation (UKELD < 49), whereas many younger patients were required to have high-urgent disease (UKELD > 60). US and Eurotransplant programmes did not prioritise according to age.

Interpretation

The UK liver allocation algorithm prioritises older patients for transplantation by predicting that advancing age increases the benefit from liver transplantation. Restricted follow-up and biases in waiting list data might limit the accuracy of these benefit predictions. Measures beyond overall waiting list mortality are required to fully capture the benefits of liver transplantation.

Funding

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^11119385]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — transplant imaging criteria and older adult outcomes are outlined, noting that the OPTN has proposed imaging criteria for patients with HCC who may be candidates for transplant and a classification system for nodules identified by well-defined imaging from contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. While the panel does not have a recommendation regarding liver transplantation in older adults with HCC, some centers report transplant in highly selected patients > 70 years; a systematic review of 50 studies with 4169 elderly patients and 13,158 young patients found higher post-resection mortality (3.0% vs. 1.2%) but only marginally lower 5-year overall survival (OS) (51% vs. 56%) in the elderly.

### Outcomes of liver transplantation among older recipients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in a large multicenter US cohort: the Re-evaluating age limits in transplantation consortium [^116uXD5r]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The liver transplantation (LT) population is aging, with the need for transplant being driven by the growing prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Older LT recipients with NASH may be at an increased risk for adverse outcomes after LT. Our objective is to characterize outcomes in these recipients in a large multicenter cohort. All primary LT recipients ≥ 65 years from 2010 to 2016 at 13 centers in the Re-Evaluating Age Limits in Transplantation (REALT) consortium were included. Of 1023 LT recipients, 226 (22.1%) were over 70 years old, and 207 (20.2%) had NASH. Compared with other LT recipients, NASH recipients were older (68.0 versus 67.3 years), more likely to be female (47.3% versus 32.8%), White (78.3% versus 68.0%), Hispanic (12.1% versus 9.2%), and had higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium (21 versus 18) at LT (P < 0.05 for all). Specific cardiac risk factors including diabetes with or without chronic complications (69.6%), hypertension (66.3%), hyperlipidemia (46.3%), coronary artery disease (36.7%), and moderate-to-severe renal disease (44.4%) were highly prevalent among NASH LT recipients. Graft survival among NASH patients was 90.3% at 1 year and 82.4% at 3 years compared with 88.9% at 1 year and 80.4% at 3 years for non-NASH patients (log-rank P = 0.58 and P = 0.59, respectively). Within 1 year after LT, the incidence of graft rejection (17.4%), biliary strictures (20.9%), and solid organ cancers (4.9%) were comparable. Rates of cardiovascular (CV) complications, renal failure, and infection were also similar in both groups. We observed similar posttransplant morbidity and mortality outcomes for NASH and non-NASH LT recipients. Certain CV risk factors were more prevalent in this population, although posttransplant outcomes within 1 year including CV events and renal failure were similar to non-NASH LT recipients.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^111U8iw4]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

OUTCOME BY DONOR AGE GROUPS

Of all transplantations, 15,147 (85%) were performed with donors < 70 years old and 2014 (11%), 369 (2%), and 11 (0.06%) transplantations were performed with livers from septuagenarian, octogenarian, and nonagenarian donors, respectively (Fig. 2; Table 3). The percentage of LTs with donors ≥ 70 years old increased significantly throughout the study period (P < 0.001). Donor and recipient characteristics per donor age category are shown in Table 4. In this table, characteristics of transplantations with livers from donors < 70 years old and > 70 years old were compared. Cerebral vascular accident as cause of death was more frequent in transplanted livers ≥ 70 years old, whereas trauma was more frequent in younger donors. DM had a higher prevalence in livers ≥ 70 years old (16% versus 5%; P < 0.001) in contrast to cardiac arrest (4% versus 13%; P < 0.001). Furthermore, CITs were longer in transplanted livers < 70 years old (8.9 versus 8.7, P < 0.001). The ET‐DRI — as a measurement of donor quality — was significantly different in both groups (1.7 versus 2.4; P < 0.001), but no significant difference was shown with the factor donor age set at reference (1.4 versus 1.4; P = 0.31).

NOTE:

Patients transplanted with a liver ≥ 70 years old were older as compared with recipients of livers from donors < 70 years old (58 versus 54 years old; P < 0.001). The recipients of older livers did also have a lower median laboratory MELD score (16 versus 17; P < 0.001). Another difference was observed in primary diagnosis. Recipients of liver allografts ≥ 70 years old more often had a malignant disease (24% versus 17%) and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (30% versus 22%).

When analyzing graft survival, significant differences were observed across donor age categories (< 70, 70‐79, and ≥ 80 years) at 5‐year (P ≤ 0.001) and 10‐year follow‐up (P ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2 A). No difference in 1‐year graft survival could be detected (P = 0.09). Similar differences were observed for patient survival: no difference at 1‐year follow‐up (P = 0.19) but significant differences at 5‐year (P ≤ 0.001) and 10‐year follow‐up (P ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2 B). A potential change in outcome throughout the study period was evaluated for LTs with donors of ≥ 70 years per year. However, no effect of transplant year (P = 0.30) or when grouped into 5 transplant periods (P = 0.45) could be detected for graft survival at 5‐year follow‐up (data not shown).

### Outcome after liver transplantation in elderly recipients (> 65 years) – A single-center retrospective analysis [^111BgUCP]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Liver transplantation (LT) in elderly recipients is controversially discussed in the literature with only little data on long-term outcome available. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficiency of LT in elderly recipients (> 65 years).

Methods

Between 1989–2016, 139 patients > 65 years-old were listed for liver transplantation, and 76 (55%) were transplanted. Patient outcome and characteristics were evaluated separately for the time period before (1989–2004) and after (2005–2016) MELD-implementation. Post-transplant outcome was compared between the elderly cohort and LT-recipients aged 18–65 years (n = 1395).

Results

Overall survival of patients > 65 years was better in the MELD-era compared to the earlier period (1- and 5-year-survival: 73%, 60% vs. 69%, 37%, respectively; p = 0.055). The main differences between the two groups included higher recipient age (p = 0.001) and BMI (p = 0.001), higher donor age (p < 0.001), less need of intraoperative red blood cells (p = 0.008) and a lower number of postoperative rejections (p = 0.03) after 2004. Comparing the overall survival of patients transplanted in the MELD-era aged 18–65 years vs. > 65 years displayed comparable 1- and 5 year-survival rates (81%, 68% vs. 73% and 60%, respectively, p = 0.558).

Conclusion

In the modern era, outcome of patients receiving LT with > 65 years is comparable to < 65 year-old patients. After careful evaluation, patients > 65 years old should be considered for LT.

### Actual risk of using very aged donors for unselected liver transplant candidates: a European single-center experience in the MELD era [^111R8dtG]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the whole experience of liver transplantation (LT) with donors ≥ 70 years in a single center not applying specific donor/recipient matching criteria.

Background

LT with very old donors has historically been associated with poorer outcomes. With the increasing average donor age and the advent of Model for End-stage Liver Diseases (MELD) score-based allocation criteria, an optimal donor/recipient matching is often unsuitable.

Methods

Outcomes of all types of LTs were compared according to 4 study groups: patients transplanted between 1998 and 2003 with donors < 70 (group 1, n = 396) or ≥ 70 years (group 2, n = 88); patients transplanted between 2004 and 2010 with donors < 70 (group 3, n = 409), or ≥ 70 years (group 4, n = 190). From 2003, graft histology was routinely available before cross-clamping, and MELD-driven allocation was adopted.

Results

Groups 1 and 2 were similar for main donor and recipient variables, and surgical details. Group 4 had shorter donor ICU stay, lower rate of moderate-to-severe graft macrosteatosis (2.3% vs 8%), and higher recipient MELD score (22 vs 19) versus group 3. After 2003, median donor age, recipient age, and MELD score significantly increased, whereas moderate-to-severe macrosteatosis and ischemia time decreased. Five-year graft survival was 63.6% in group 1 versus 59.1% in group 2 (P = 0.252) and 70.9% in group 3 versus 67.6% in group 4 (P = 0.129). Transplants performed between 1998 and 2003, recipient HCV infection, balance of risk score > 18, and pre-LT renal replacement treatments were independently associated with worse graft survival.

Conclusions

Even without specific donor/recipient matching criteria, the outcomes of LT with donors ≥ 70 and < 70 years are comparable with appropriate donor management.

### Minimizing risk associated with elderly liver donors by matching to preferred recipients [^115MRkyr]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Elderly liver donors (ELDs) represent a possible expansion of the donor pool, although there is great reluctance to use ELDs because of reports that increasing donor age predicts graft loss and patient death. The goal of this study was to identify a subgroup of recipients who would be least affected by increased donor age and thus best suited to receive grafts from ELDs. A national registry of deceased donor liver transplants from 2002–2005 was analyzed. ELDs aged 70–92 (n = 1043) were compared with average liver donors (ALDs) aged 18–69 (n = 15,878) and ideal liver donors (ILDs) aged 18–39 (n = 6842). Recipient factors that modified the effect of donor age on outcomes were identified via interaction term analysis. Outcomes in recipient subgroups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Recipients preferred for ELD transplants were determined to be first-time recipients over the age of 45 with body mass index < 35, non-status 1 registration, cold ischemic time < 8 hours, and either hepatocellular carcinoma or an indication for transplantation other than hepatitis C. In preferred recipients, there were no differences in outcomes when ELD livers were used (3-year graft survival: ELD 75%, ALD 75%, ILD 77%, P > 0.1; 3-year patient survival: ELD 81%, ALD 80%, ILD 81%, P > 0.1). In contrast, there were significantly worse outcomes when ELD livers were used in nonpreferred recipients (3-year graft survival: ELD 50%, ALD 71%, ILD 75%, P < 0.001; 3-year patient survival: ELD 64%, ALD 77%, ILD 80%, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The risks of ELDs can be substantially minimized by appropriate recipient selection.

### Kidney and liver transplantation in the elderly [^114qjUkv]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Transplant surgery is facing a shortage of deceased donor organs. In response, the criteria for organ donation have been extended, and an increasing number of organs from older donors are being used. For recipients, the benefits of transplantation are great, and the growing ageing population has led to increasing numbers of elderly patients being accepted for transplantation.

Methods

The literature was reviewed to investigate the impact of age of donors and recipients in abdominal organ transplantation, and to highlight aspects of the fine balance in donor and recipient selection and screening, as well as allocation policies fair to young and old alike.

Results

Overall, kidney and liver transplantation from older deceased donors have good outcomes, but are not as good as those from younger donors. Careful donor selection based on risk indices, and potentially biomarkers, special allocation schemes to match elderly donors with elderly recipients, and vigorous recipient selection, allows good outcomes with increasing age of both donors and recipients. The results of live kidney donation have been excellent for donor and recipient, and there is a trend towards inclusion of older donors. Future strategies, including personalized immunosuppression for older recipients as well as machine preservation and reconditioning of donor organs, are promising ways to improve the outcome of transplantation between older donors and older recipients.

Conclusion

Kidney and liver transplantation in the elderly is a clinical reality. Outcomes are good, but can be optimized by using strategies that modify donor risk factors and recipient co-morbidities, and personalized approaches to organ allocation and immunosuppression.

UTILIZATION OF REPORTED LIVERS

Out of all reported livers of ≥ 70 years, 1022 out of 3416 (30%) livers were not transplanted. Characteristics of transplanted versus nontransplanted liver allografts are shown in Supporting Table 1. Most notably, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV were more often observed in nontransplanted livers with rates for HBV of 12% versus 8% (P ≤ 0.001), and HCV of 3% versus 0% (P ≤ 0.001), respectively. Also, diabetes was more often present in donors of nontransplanted livers (23% versus 16%; P ≤ 0.001), and laboratory values (GGT, transaminases, and bilirubin) were significantly higher in donors of nontransplanted livers. The utilization rate increased from 42% in 2000‐2003 to 77% in 2010‐2012 and stabilized at 76% in 2013‐2015 (Fig. 5). Of all 1022 nontransplanted livers, 374 (37%) were procured. The proportion of nontransplanted livers that were procured increased from 23% (35/151) in 2000‐2003 to 41% (89/216) in 2013‐2015. Reasons for discarding the liver allografts (n = 416) were reported in 82% of all procured livers and mostly concerned organ quality. Steatosis was most often mentioned as the reason for discarding the organ (36%), followed by fibrosis (14%) and a (suspected) malignancy in the donor (14%). All other reasons are shown in Table 6.

### Clinical outcomes of living donor liver transplantation for patients 65 years old or older with preserved performance status [^115XpQxn]. Liver Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for elderly recipients. We reviewed 411 adult-to-adult LDLT cases, including 46 recipients who were 65 years old or older and 365 recipients who were less than 65 years old. The elderly group had a higher proportion of females (P = 0.04) and a smaller body surface area (P < 0.001) and more frequently underwent transplantation because of hepatitis C (P < 0.001) or hepatocellular carcinoma (P < 0.001). Elderly patients had less advanced liver disease with lower Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores (P = 0.02) and preserved health without the need for prolonged hospitalization (P < 0.01). The transplanted graft volume/standard liver volume ratios were similar for the 2 groups (P = 0.22). The elderly group had fewer episodes of acute rejection (P = 0.03) but had more neuropsychiatric complications (P = 0.01). The 5- and 10-year graft survival rates were comparable for the elderly group (89.8% and 77.8%, respectively) and the younger group (79.4% and 72.9%, respectively; P = 0.21). Seven recipients were 70 years old or older, and they had a mean MELD score of 15.6 ± 5.2; 6 of these patients were treated as outpatients before LDLT. All were alive after LDLT and showed good compliance with medical management with a mean follow-up of 5.7 ± 3.0 years. In conclusion, LDLT can be safely performed and has acceptable long-term outcomes for low-risk elderly recipients with preserved performance status.

RISK FACTORS IN TRANSPLANTATIONS WITH OLDER LIVER ALLOGRAFTS

Multivariate analysis in transplantations with livers from donors ≥ 70 years old showed the following significant risk factors for graft survival at 10‐years follow‐up: donor age (P = 0.02), a history of DM in the donor (P = 0.01), CIT (P = 0.001), rescue allocation (P = 0.02), a recipient age of < 45 years old (P = 0.01), MELD score category (P < 0.001), and HCVAb status of the recipient (P < 0.001; Fig. 3; Table 5). Interestingly, recipient age as a continuous variable was not associated with inferior graft survival in the multivariate analysis. When outcome of transplantations with livers ≥ 70 years old was stratified for recipient age (< 45 years old, n = 217; 45‐55 years old, n = 650; 55‐65 years old, n = 1120; > 65 years old, n = 407), inferior survival was observed in recipients < 45 years old with a survival rate of 54% as compared with recipients ≥ 45 years old with an overall survival rate of 59% (P < 0.001). No differences were observed between the age categories in recipients > 45 years old (P < 0.69; Supporting Fig. 1). No clear cutoff value for laboratory MELD score could be identified for transplanting livers ≥ 70 years old (data not shown). The risk of an increasing donor age (adjusted for donor and recipient risks) is shown in Fig. 3. It shows a stable risk up to a donor age of 25 years, after which the risk increases linearly up to 80 years old. As of a donor age of 80 years, the risk seems to increase even further, although the 95% CI increases because of limited numbers.

Figure 3
The adjusted risk of donor age on graft survival (n = 12,296). Donor age has a linear, increasing risk for graft survival from 25 years old up to 80 years old, that shows no signs of decreasing over 80 years old.

### Age and equity in liver transplantation: an organ allocation model [^116aRQ8Z]. Liver Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

A moral liver allocation policy must be fair. We considered a 2-step, 2-principle allocation system called "age mapping". Its first principle, equal opportunity, ensures that candidates of all ages have an equal chance of getting an organ. Its second principle, prudential lifespan equity, allocates younger donor grafts to younger candidates and older donors to older candidates in order to increase the likelihood that all recipients achieve a "full lifespan". Data from 2476 candidates and 1371 consecutive adult liver transplantations (from 1999 to 2012) were used to determine whether age mapping can reduce the gap in years of life lost (YLL) between younger and older recipients. A parametric Weibull prognostic model was developed to estimate total life expectancy after transplantation using survival of the general population matched by sex and age as a reference. Life expectancy from birth was calculated by adding age at transplant and total life expectancy after transplantation. In multivariate analysis, recipient age, hepatitis C virus status, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score at transplant of > 30, and donor age were significantly related to prognosis after surgery (P < 0.05). The mean (and standard deviation) number of years of life from birth, calculated from the current allocation model, for various age groups were: recipients 18–47 years (n = 340) = 65.2 (3.3); 48–55 years (n = 387) = 72.7 (2.1); 56–61 years (n = 372) = 74.7 (1.7) and for recipients > 61 years (n = 272) = 77.4 (1.4). The total number of YLL equaled 523 years. Redistributing liver grafts, using an age mapping algorithm, reduces the lifespan gap between younger and older candidates by 33% (from 12.3% to 8.3%) and achieves a 14% overall reduction of YLL (73 years) compared to baseline liver distribution. In conclusion, deliberately incorporating age into an allocation algorithm promotes fairness and increases efficiency.

### Advanced donor age alone does not affect patient or graft survival after liver transplantation [^114VdGvd]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals greater than 60 years old donate an important portion of the organs available for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), but use of donors in this age group remains controversial. We hypothesized that proper selection of donors older than age 60 would not disadvantage recipients in terms of patient and graft survival.

Study Design

All OLTs performed at our center between January 1, 1990, and July 31, 2007, were divided into groups based on donor age: donors 60 years old or more and donors less than 60 years old. Recipients in each group were compared based on graft and patient survival at 1, 3, and 5 years, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores, cold ischemic times, and era of transplant (before or after 2001).

Results

There were 741 recipients who met inclusion criteria. Ninety-one patients received livers from donors 60 years old or older, and 650 patients had donors younger than 60 years old. Overall patient survival rates in the group using donors 60 or older were 86.8%, 72.6%, and 67.6% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, and did not differ significantly from survival in the group receiving transplants from donors less than 60 (87.1%, 81.8%, and 75.5%; p = 0.39). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year graft survivals in patients receiving transplants from donors 60 or older were 82.4%, 65%, and 62.5%, respectively, and were not significantly different from those in the group using donors younger than 60 (84%, 78.6%, and 72.3%, respectively; p = 0.39). Neither patient survival nor graft survival in recipients of organs from donors 60 or older was affected by Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score. Recipients of older-donor livers had improved outcomes after 2001, which correlated with significant improvements in cold ischemic times.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that age alone does not adversely affect recipient outcomes. When properly selected, donors older than 60 represent an important and safe increase in the liver donor pool.

### Evaluating the outcomes of donor-recipient age differences in young adults undergoing liver transplantation [^117Biybp]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The current liver allocation system may be disadvantaging younger adult recipients as it does not incorporate the donor-recipient age difference. Given the longer life expectancy of younger recipients, the influences of older donor grafts on their long-term prognosis should be elucidated. This study sought to reveal the long-term prognostic influence of the donor-recipient age difference in young adult recipients. Adult patients who received initial liver transplants from deceased donors between 2002 and 2021 were identified from the UNOS database. Young recipients (patients 45 years old or below) were categorized into 4 groups: donor age younger than the recipient, 0–9 years older, 10–19 years older, or 20 years older or above. Older recipients were defined as patients 65 years old or above. To examine the influence of the age difference in long-term survivors, conditional graft survival analysis was conducted on both younger and older recipients. Among 91,952 transplant recipients, 15,170 patients were 45 years old or below (16.5%); these were categorized into 6,114 (40.3%), 3,315 (21.9%), 2,970 (19.6%), and 2,771 (18.3%) for groups 1–4, respectively. Group 1 demonstrated the highest probability of survival, followed by groups 2, 3, and 4 for the actual graft survival and conditional graft survival analyses. In younger recipients who survived at least 5 years post-transplant, inferior long-term survival was observed when there was an age difference of 10 years or above (86.9% vs. 80.6%, log-rank p < 0.01), whereas there was no difference in older recipients (72.6% vs. 74.2%, log-rank p = 0.89). In younger patients who are not in emergent need of a transplant, preferential allocation of younger aged donor offers would optimize organ utility by increasing postoperative graft survival time.

### Optimizing the use of geriatric livers for transplantation in the eurotransplant region [^1163nP7C]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

DESIGN

All first LTs performed in adult recipients (≥ 18 years) with liver allografts from deceased donors from January 1, 2000 until December 31, 2015 in the ET region were included. Follow‐up data were obtained from the ET Network Information System and ET Liver Registry up to March 2017. Also, data were obtained on the reported but nontransplanted liver allografts from donors of 70 years and older within the study period. The study protocol was approved by the ET Liver Intestine Advisory Committee, and no ethical statement was required according to European guidelines and Dutch law because data were anonymized and patients were not (directly) involved and/or affected.

OUTCOME MEASURES

Graft survival at 1‐, 5‐, and 10‐year follow‐up was considered as primary outcome measure. Graft survival was defined as the period between the date of transplantation and date of retransplantation or date of recipient death, whichever occurred first (nondeath censored graft survival). Patient survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was considered a secondary outcome and was defined as the time between the date of transplantation and the death date. Utilization rate was defined as the proportion of liver allografts used for liver‐only transplantations in adult recipients divided by the sum of livers used for first liver–only transplantations in adult recipients and all reported but nontransplanted livers.

PREFERRED RECIPIENTS

Preferred and nonpreferred recipients were defined according to the criteria as published by Segev et al. 11 They identified a group of patients by selecting first time, nonstatus 1 recipients with an age > 45 years, body mass index (BMI) < 35 kg/m 2, an indication other than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), and a cold ischemia time (CIT) < 8 hours. In our study, we only considered recipients with an age > 45 years, BMI < 35 kg/m 2, an indication other than HCV, and a CIT < 8 hours as preferred recipients. Retransplantations were not included in this study, and the definition of (the equivalent of) status 1 recipients changed over the study period. In addition, HCC could not be analyzed because the presence of HCC was not registered for the entire study period as a separate variable or as a category in the etiology of the liver disease variable.

OUTCOME IN PREFERRED AND NONPREFERRED RECIPIENTS

Transplantations were then divided into 2 groups of preferred and nonpreferred recipients as described by Segev et al. 11 (Fig. 4). According to these criteria (recipient age > 45 years old, recipient BMI < 35 kg/m 2, etiology of liver diseases other than HCV cirrhosis, and CIT < 8 hours), 4576 (26%) and 13,235 (74%) patients were identified as preferred and nonpreferred recipients, respectively. A similar distribution of laboratory MELD score was present in both groups (Supporting Fig. 2).

Figure 4
Graft survival in preferred recipients versus nonpreferred recipients. (A) In preferred recipients, no statistical significant difference can be observed in graft survival whether transplanted with a liver below or over 70 years old (HR 1.1; CI 0.92‐1.23, P = 0.40). In nonpreferred recipients, this difference in outcome is statistically significant (B) whether transplanted with a liver below or over 70 years old (HR 1.2; CI 1.14‐1.35, P < 0.001). Also, significant differences can be detected when comparing transplantations with livers below 40 years old or of 70 years and older. In preferred recipients (C) no difference was observed (HR 1.2; CI 0.96‐1.37, P = 0.13) while a statistically significant difference was observed in nonpreferred recipients (D) (HR 1.5; CI 1.39‐1.71, P < 0.001).

### Lung transplant outcome from selected older donors (≥ 70 years) equals younger donors [^116nC3dG]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Whether or not, a transplant candidate should be informed before transplant on the donor age could be a matter of debate. In this case, the ethical principle of "respect for autonomy" could outweigh the overall good (by expansion of the donor pool). The Belgian law stipulates that recipients should not be given any information on the donor details, however, in other countries/regions donor age could be part of a shared decision-making process (including other donor risk factors).

For other solid organs including liver and kidney transplantation, excellent results have been reported for older donors. For liver transplantation, the use of septuagenarian and octogenarian donors has investigated at our center 10 years ago in a cohort of 450 transplants, of which 58 (13%) livers came from donors ≥ 70 years, revealing excellent 5-year patient survival of 84%. In Spain, septuagenarian and octogenarian organ donors represent 30% of all liver transplantations, whereas even nonagenarian grafts are occasionally used. In a larger kidney transplant registry study, grafts from donors > 70 years were not associated with inferior graft or patient survival.

However, the allocation of elderly allografts for LTx remains conflicting. Renard et alconcluded that the use of pulmonary allografts from donors ≥ 65 years (N = 44) did not negatively affect PGD, CLAD-free, and overall survival, whereas a review of the United Network of Organ Sharing database by Bittle et alfound a higher 1 and 3-year mortality rate for donors ≥ 65 years compared with a nonpropensity matched cohort of younger donors. Sommer et aldemonstrated safe utilization of donors ≥ 70 years (N = 27) without compromising recipient survival.

Our study is the first propensity-matched analysis on this topic; however, it has some inherent limitations due to its retrospective and monocentric design. A matching approach based on propensity scores has been used to handle the imbalance in characteristics between LTx with older and younger donors. Note, however, that such an approach only addresses observed imbalances, that is, bias is still possible when there are variables related to donor age and outcome, which have not been measured. Despite being the largest reported cohort of lung donors ≥ 70 years, so far, the patient number remains relatively small. This precludes definitive conclusions but provides a rationale for larger multicenter studies.

OUTCOMES IN OTHER STUDIES

The presented results of outcomes after transplantation with a liver from an older donor are in accordance with results from other regions, although these are reported with a high variance. Reported patient survival rates at 1 year vary from 70% to 90% 7, 9, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 5‐year patient survival rates from 50% to 80%. 7, 20, 28, 29, 30, 34 The sometimes very promising outcomes 7, 8, 9, 31, 32 are apparently contradicting to the higher intrinsic risk of older donors. 10, 35 These results are therefore likely to be explained by the frequent single‐center design, relatively small numbers of included transplantations, different aging patterns in other countries, 36 and differences in recipient and donor selection criteria. The latter is present in our study and also observed in these other studies. Older liver allografts have shorter CITs, 7, 8, 9, 20, 23, 27, 29 more often have pretransplant biopsies, 8, 16, 20, 22, 29, 37 have a lower incidence of cardiac arrest, 7, 8, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27 and are more frequently regionally procured. 8, 22, 23 All of these are obviously meant to decrease the initial risk of the geriatric liver allograft.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Posttransplantation outcomes at 10 years were analyzed with Kaplan‐Meier analysis and by log‐rank test. Results were stratified for 4 donor age categories (< 60, 60‐69, 70‐79, and ≥ 80 years). A possible correlation between donor age and laboratory MELD score was tested with a Cox regression model. Subsequently, factors potentially associated with graft survival were analyzed in a multivariate Cox regression model in transplantations with livers from donors ≥ 70 years old. The specific effect of donor age was visualized by using splines regression when adjusted for donor and risk factors (DRM). Then, the effect of donor age on outcome was analyzed in preferred and nonpreferred recipients. Within both patient categories, outcome was stratified by 2 donor age categories: livers from donors < 70 years old and ≥ 70 years old and for livers from donors < 40 and ≥ 70 years old. Center outcome for transplantations with livers ≥ 70 years old was according to volume and proportion of LTs with livers ≥ 70 years old in a Kaplan‐Meier analysis, and then, according to their relative performance on graft survival at 5‐year follow‐up in a funnel‐plot analysis. Centers with few such transplantations were excluded for this analysis (< 10 LTs). To analyze the utilization rate, livers from donors ≥ 70 years old that were reported to ET were compared by transplantation status (yes/no).

A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all analyses were performed with SPSS, version 24.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and R, version 3.3.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^112wc71V]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Adult liver transplant (LT) recipients — hyperlipidemia prevalence, interactions, and monitoring are summarized as follows: Dyslipidemia occurs in up to 70% of LT recipients and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; although age, body weight, and genetics have some influence, medications — especially calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), mTOR inhibitors, and glucocorticoids — are the major influences on its high prevalence. 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and CNIs share metabolic pathways and have significant drug-drug interactions, and the measurement of blood lipids after a 14-hour fast is recommended annually for healthy LT recipients.

### Everolimus tablets (everolimus) [^115c6jP9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The study population consisted of 18 to 70 year old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31% to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m2) were also balanced between groups.

A total of 1147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days post transplant a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: everolimus with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N = 245, everolimus with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N = 231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N = 243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia.

Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, tacrolimus trough level of greater or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication.

### Expanding liver transplant opportunities in older patients with nonconventional grafts [^116Nj98m]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Broader use of donation after circulatory death (DCD) and nonconventional grafts for liver transplant helps reduce disparities in organ availability. Limited data, however, exists on outcomes specific to nonconventional graft utilization in older patients. As such, this study aimed to investigate outcomes specific to conventional and nonconventional graft utilization in recipients > 70 y of age.

Methods

1-to-3 matching based on recipient sex, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and donor type was performed on patients ≥ 70 and < 70 y of age who underwent liver transplant alone at Mayo Clinic Arizona between 2015 and 2020. Primary outcomes were posttransplant patient and liver allograft survival for recipients greater than or less than 70 y of age. Secondary outcomes included grafts utilization patterns, hospital length of stay, need for reoperation, biliary complications and disposition at time of hospital discharge.

Results

In this cohort, 36.1% of grafts came from DCD donors, 17.4% were postcross clamp offers, and 20.8% were nationally allocated. Median recipient ages were 59 and 71 y (P < 0.01). Recipients had similar Intensive care unit (P = 0.82) and hospital (P = 0.14) lengths of stay, and there were no differences in patient (P = 0.68) or graft (P = 0.38) survival. When comparing donation after brain death and DCD grafts in those > 70 y, there were no differences in patient (P = 0.89) or graft (P = 0.71) survival.

Conclusions

Excellent outcomes can be achieved in older recipients, even with use of nonconventional grafts. Expanded use of nonconventional grafts can help facilitate transplant opportunities in older patients.

### Factors associated with access to and receipt of liver transplantation in veterans with end-stage liver disease [^112pyVdk]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Organ scarcity means few patients with advanced liver disease undergo a transplant, making equitable distribution all the more crucial. Disparities may arise at any stage in the complex process leading up to this curative therapy.

Objective

To examine the rate of and factors associated with referral, wait-listing, and receipt of liver allografts.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used linked data from comprehensive electronic medical records and the United Network of Organ Sharing. Adult patients with cirrhosis and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease with addition of sodium score of at least 15 points between October 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017, were included in the study. Patients were from 129 hospitals in the integrated, US Department of Veterans Affairs health care system and were followed up through December 31, 2018. Statistical analyses were performed from April 28, 2020, to January 31, 2021.

Exposures

Sociodemographic (eg, age, insurance, income), clinical (eg, liver disease etiology, severity, comorbidity), and health care facility (eg, complexity, rural or urban, presence of a liver transplant program) factors were evaluated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Referral, wait-listing, and liver transplantation.

Results

Of the 34 494 patients with cirrhosis (mean [SD] age, 62 [7.7] years; 33 560 men [97.29%]; 22 509 White patients [65.25%]), 1534 (4.45%) were referred, 1035 (3.00%) were wait-listed, and 549 (1.59%) underwent a liver transplant within 3 years of meeting clinical criteria for transplantation. Patient age of 70 years or older was associated with lower rates of referral (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; 95% CI, 0.06–0.13), wait-listing (HR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.04–0.12), and transplant (HR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.04–0.16). Alcohol etiology for liver cirrhosis was associated with lower rates of referral (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.33–0.44), wait-listing (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.27–0.38), and transplant (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23–0.37). In addition, comorbidity (none vs > 1 comorbidity) was associated with lower rates of referral (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.40–0.56), wait-listing (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.31–0.46), and transplant (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.21–0.38). African American patients were less likely to be referred (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.95) and wait-listed (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.88). Patients with lower annual income and those seen in facilities in the West were less likely to be referred (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.93), wait-listed (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36–0.64), or undergo a transplant (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34–0.74). In a review of the medical records for 333 patients who had limited comorbidity but were not referred, organ transplant was considered as a potential option in 176 (52.85%). When documented, medical and psychosocial barriers explained most of the deficits in referral.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, few patients with advanced liver disease received referrals, were wait-listed, or underwent a transplant. The greatest deficits occurred at the referral step. Although health systems routinely track rates and disparities for organ transplants among wait-listed patients, extending monitoring to the earlier stages may help improve equity and manage potentially modifiable barriers to transplantation.

### Survival benefit of living-donor liver transplant [^111QduWD]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Despite the acceptance of living-donor liver transplant (LDLT) as a lifesaving procedure for end-stage liver disease, it remains underused in the United States. Quantification of lifetime survival benefit and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease incorporating sodium levels (MELD-Na) score range at which benefit outweighs risk in LDLT is necessary to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness.

Objective

To assess the survival benefit, life-years saved, and the MELD-Na score at which that survival benefit was obtained for individuals who received an LDLT compared with that for individuals who remained on the wait list.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This case-control study was a retrospective, secondary analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database of 119 275 US liver transplant candidates and recipients from January 1, 2012, to September 2, 2021. Liver transplant candidates aged 18 years or older who were assigned to the wait list (N = 116 455) or received LDLT (N = 2820) were included. Patients listed for retransplant or multiorgan transplant and those with prior kidney or liver transplants were excluded.

Exposures

Living-donor liver transplant vs remaining on the wait list.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome of this study was life-years saved from receiving an LDLT. Secondary outcomes included 1-year relative mortality and risk, time to equal risk, time to equal survival, and the MELD-Na score at which that survival benefit was obtained for individuals who received an LDLT compared with that for individuals who remained on the wait list. MELD-Na score ranges from 6 to 40 and is well correlated with short-term survival. Higher MELD-Na scores (> 20) are associated with an increased risk of death.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 119 275 study participants was 55.1 (11.2) years, 63% were male, 0.9% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.3% were Asian, 8.2% were Black or African American, 15.8% were Hispanic or Latino, 0.2% were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 70.2% were White. Mortality risk and survival models confirmed a significant survival benefit for patients receiving an LDLT who had a MELD-Na score of 11 or higher (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.47–0.88]; p = 0.006). Living-donor liver transplant recipients gained an additional 13 to 17 life-years compared with patients who never received an LDLT.

Conclusions and Relevance

An LDLT is associated with a substantial survival benefit to patients with end-stage liver disease even at MELD-Na scores as low as 11. The findings of this study suggest that the life-years gained are comparable to or greater than those conferred by any other lifesaving procedure or by a deceased-donor liver transplant. This study's findings challenge current perceptions regarding when LDLT survival benefit occurs.

### Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients: an international registry study [^116DDMsb]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Despite concerns that patients with liver transplants might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 because of coexisting comorbidities and use of immunosuppressants, the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on this patient group remains unclear. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes in these patients.

Methods

In this multicentre cohort study, we collected data on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were older than 18 years, who had previously received a liver transplant, and for whom data had been submitted by clinicians to one of two international registries (COVID-Hep and SECURE-Cirrhosis) at the end of the patient's disease course. Patients without a known hospitalisation status or mortality outcome were excluded. For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. We compared the cohorts with regard to several outcomes (including death, hospitalisation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, requirement for intensive care, and need for invasive ventilation). A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death.

Findings

Between March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47–66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44–84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p = 0·106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p = 0·837). However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p < 0·0001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p < 0·0001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p = 0·046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1·4% [95% CI -7·7 to 10·4]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1·06 [95% CI 1·01 to 1·11] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1·57 [1·05 to 2·36] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18·30 [1·96 to 170·75]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients.

Interpretation

Liver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were. Factors other than transplantation should be preferentially considered in relation to physical distancing and provision of medical care for patients with liver transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p < 0·0001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p < 0·0001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p = 0·046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1·4% [95% CI −7·7 to 10·4]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1·06 [95% CI 1·01 to 1·11] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1·57 [1·05 to 2·36] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18·30 [1·96 to 170·75]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients.

Interpretation

Liver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were. Factors other than transplantation should be preferentially considered in relation to physical distancing and provision of medical care for patients with liver transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Liver transplant recipients older than 60 years have lower survival and higher incidence of malignancy [^114cKXcR]. American Journal of Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Older age is not considered a contraindication for liver transplantation, but age-related morbidity may be a cause of mortality. Survival and the incidence of the main post-transplant complications were assessed in 111 adult liver transplant recipients. They were divided in two groups according to their age (patients younger than 60 years, n = 54; patients older than 60 years, n = 57) and both groups were compared. Older patients were more frequently transplanted for hepatitis C (p = 0.03) and hepatocellular carcinoma (p = 0.05) and their liver disease was less advanced (Child-Pugh and MELD scores were significantly lower; p = 0.004 and p = 0.05, respectively). After transplantation, older patients had a significantly lower survival (p = 0.02). Higher age was independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio for each 10-year increase: 2.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.1–4.0; p = 0.02). The incidence of de novo neoplasia and nonskin neoplasia were higher in older patients (p = 0.02 and p = 0.007, respectively). Malignancy was the cause of death in one patient younger than 60 years and in 12 patients older than 60 years (p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, a higher age and smoking were independently associated with a higher risk of dying of de novo neoplasia. In conclusion, older liver transplant recipients have a significantly lower survival than younger patients. Malignancy is responsible for this decreased survival.

### Everolimus (Zortress) [^116mL8DH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The study population consisted of 18- to 70-year-old male and female liver transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant, mean age was approximately 54 years, more than 70% of patients were male, and the majority of patients were Caucasian, with approximately 89% of patients per treatment group completing the study. Key stratification parameters of HCV status (31% to 32% HCV positive across groups) and renal function (mean baseline eGFR range 79 to 83 mL/min/1.73 m2) were also balanced between groups.

A total of 1147 patients were enrolled into the run-in period of this trial. At 30 days posttransplant, a total 719 patients, who were eligible according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: Zortress with reduced exposure tacrolimus; N = 245, Zortress with tacrolimus elimination (tacrolimus elimination group); N = 231, or standard dose/exposure tacrolimus (tacrolimus control); N = 243. The study was conducted at 89 liver transplant centers across Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, North and South America, and Australia.

Key inclusion criteria were recipients 18 to 70 years of age, eGFR greater or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, tacrolimus trough level of greater or equal to 8 ng/mL in the week prior to randomization, and the ability to take oral medication.

### Long-term outcomes of liver transplant recipients. what Do patients die from? [^116SRt8C]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Several advances in liver transplantation (LT) have provided an increased rate in 1-year patient survival, currently reported between 84.5% and 91.4%. However, this significant improvement is not widely maintained after the 1-year of follow-up. In this study, we analyze short-term and long-term results in LT recipients.

Methods

A retrospective observational cohort study, including patients who underwent LT between 1990 and 2009 and were followed for a minimum 15-year period, analyzing the causes and risk factors of mortality and patient and graft survival from LT up to the last outpatient visit.

Results

A total of 594 patients with LT were included (median age, 53-year and 69.7% male). The most common indications for LT were HCV-cirrhosis (267 patients), alcoholic cirrhosis (250 patients), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (144 patients). Post-LT complications were acute rejection in 44.1%, cardiovascular in 40.6%, chronic kidney disease in 40.1%, hypertension in 22.6%, and de novo tumors in 25.6%. Retransplantation was performed in 40 (6.7%) patients. A total of 388 (65.3%) patients died during a follow-up over 20 years: 106 (17.8%) in the first year post-LT; 76 (12.8%) between 2 and 5 years; 75 (12.6%) between 6 and 10 years; 73 (812.3%) between 11 and 15 years; 30 (5%) between 16 and 20 years; and 28 (4.7%) after 20 years. The overall causes of death were infection in 69 (11.6%) patients, cardiovascular complications in 58 (9.8%) patients, pulmonary complications in 8 (1.3%) patients, liver graft failure in 126 (21.2%) patients, HCC recurrence in 15 (2.6%) patients, de novo tumors in 72 (12.1%) patients, and miscellaneous in 40 (6.7%) patients. Rates of actuarial patient survival at 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year after LT were 82.7%, 75.6%, 70%, 58.6%, 45.2%, and 37.6%, respectively, and actuarial graft survival were 80%, 72.5%, 67.1%, 54.8%, 42.6%, and 34.6%, respectively. Advanced recipient age, blood transfusion, and infection were the main risk factors for patient mortality.

Conclusions

The highest mortality rate was within the first year of LT, and the most common causes of death were hepatic failure, de novo tumors, infection, cardiovascular disease, and HCC recurrence.

### Improvement in liver transplant outcomes from older donors: a US national analysis [^112pRJ3u]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate trends in long-term graft and patient outcomes following liver transplantation using grafts from donors ≥ 60 years old.

Summary Background Data

The scarcity of donor livers has led to increased utilization of organs from donors ≥ 60 years old. However, few studies have examined how long-term transplant outcomes from older donors have evolved over time.

Methods

The OPTN/UNOS database was queried for all first-time isolated adult liver transplants. We identified 14,796 adult liver transplant using donors ≧60-year-old suitable for analysis from 1990 to 2014. Cohorts were then developed based on 5-year intervals of transplant date. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare graft and patient survival for recipients from older donor across each 5-year era.

Results

Utilization of donor grafts ≥ 60 years old increased steadily for the first 15 years of the study, but has leveled off over the last 10 years. Comparison of the earliest and latest eras in the study was notable for an increase in median recipient age (51 vs. 59, P < 0.001) and reduction in median cold ischemic time (10 vs. 6h, P = 0.001). Unadjusted 5-year graft and patient survival has improved significantly over time (P < 0.0001). More importantly, the discrepancy in survival between older and younger grafts has narrowed substantially over time (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates significant improvement in transplant outcomes with donor grafts ≥ 60-years old and supports increased but judicious use of extended criteria donors liver grafts. Improved patient selection and reduction in cold ischemia time appear to be contributing factors.

Introduction: The shortage of available donor organs is a major limiting factor in liver transplantation, leading to an increase in donor age over the past several years. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of deceased donor age on liver transplantation outcomes at our institution, focusing on the relationship between donor age and recipient survival, while considering other factors that may influence outcomes.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using a prospectively collected database of liver transplants performed between 2019 and 2023. Donors were divided into three age groups: young (≤ 45 years), old (46–70 years), and very old (≥ 70 years). Factors such as donor and recipient age, sex, and clinical status were evaluated. The primary endpoints were graft survival and recipient survival.

Results: A total of 215 liver transplants were analyzed. Statistically significant differences in graft survival were observed among the groups (p = 0.0001), with the young donor group (¯x = 1578.2 days) showing higher survival compared to the very old donor group (¯x = 1124.5 days). Donor age was a significant predictor of graft survival after adjusting for other variables (p = 0.000). Elective transplantation was associated with improved graft survival. Regarding recipient survival, significant differences were observed, with the young donor group having 317 additional days of survival compared to the very old group (p = 0.0244). Age remained a significant predictor of recipient survival after adjusting for other variables (p = 0.043). Female sex and elective transplants were associated with better outcomes.

Conclusions: Older donor age was associated with decreased graft and recipient survival, with a more detrimental impact on graft survival. A combination of other donor and recipient factors, including recipient sex and clinical status, may influence outcomes. These findings can help guide clinicians in making informed decisions on marginal donor allocation and recipient selection to optimize transplant outcomes.

RISK FACTORS

To balance the risk of an increased donor age, other risk factors should be avoided or adjusted. We identified a history of diabetes, prolonged CIT, rescue allocation, male sex, MELD score category, and HCV positive in the recipient as risk factors for decreased outcome of LT with older livers. This is in line with the factors that were identified by Ghinolfi et al. including a history of diabetes. 8 Diabetes is more often present in older donors and may have a stronger and more chronic effect on the vasculature and parenchyma in older donor livers. 8, 16, 17 Diabetes, therefore, seems to be an important risk factor that should be avoided when possible. Another risk factor with a potential higher influence on older livers is prolonged CIT. 18 Considering the recipient selection criteria that were used by Segev et al. 11 we could confirm CIT, HCV, and a recipient age < 45 years, but not recipient BMI (continuous or with a BMI of 35 kg/m 2 as a cutoff). Yet, we have confirmed their findings that in "preferred patients" donor age has no significant effect as compared with "nonpreferred recipients".

LIMITATIONS

When evaluating patient selection criteria, analyses are likely to confirm "classical" selection patterns for older donors. These livers are generally accepted for older recipients 7, 8, 19, 20, 21 with lower laboratory MELD scores 22, 23 who more often suffer from malignant disease. 7, 20, 21 This previously observed selection bias is inherent to the retrospective design and was also observed in this study: livers of donors of 70 years and older had shorter ischemia times, had diabetes less often, and underwent transplantation in recipients with lower laboratory MELD scores. We have therefore adjusted outcomes for significant risk factors to better assess the effect of an increasing donor age. In adjusting for risk factors, we considered GGT as a proxy for steatosis 24 because information on biopsies was insufficiently available. We considered graft survival a primary outcome because information on biliary complications or early bile production was not available in the ET database. This is a potential limitation because some studies found suggestions for more biliary complications in transplantations with livers from elderly donors. 3, 17, 25, 26, 27 However, biliary complications will likely also affect graft survival in the long run.

TRANSPLANT CENTERS

Transplant centers were first categorized by the median number of LTs with livers ≥ 70 years old in a low‐ and high‐volume group. Subsequently, centers were categorized by the median proportion of transplantations performed with livers ≥ 70 years old as compared with all transplantations performed in that center and included in this study. Then, centers were categorized according to outcome of transplantations with livers ≥ 70 years in "better than expected", "worse than expected", and "as expected" based on the 95% confidence interval (CI). 12

DATA ANALYSIS

Clinical characteristics were summarized by median and 25% and 75% interquartile range (IQR) or by n (%) for continuous and categorical factors, respectively. Factors between groups were compared using Kruskal‐Wallis (continuous) and chi‐square tests (categorical). Missing values were imputed with the median value for gamma‐glutamyltransferase (GGT; 34 U/L, 2%), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT; 41 U/L, 1%), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT; 29 U/L, 1%), and bilirubin (9.4 µmol/L, 3%). Missing CITs (37%) were imputed based on 3 factors: allocation (local, regional, and extraregional), 3 years' nondeath‐censored graft survival, and CITs in a 5‐fold database by multiple imputation using chained equations. Diabetes mellitus (DM) in the donor was considered present in case of a medical history of DM type 1, 2, and "positive but unspecified". Rescue allocation, cardiac arrest, and hypotensive periods in the donor were considered absent when missing. Donor hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and recipient HCVAb were considered negative when missing (1%, 1%, and 24%, respectively) or not tested (0%, 2%, and 8%, respectively). The ET‐DRI 5 was calculated for all transplantations, and the simplified recipient risk index (sRRI) and donor‐to‐recipient model (DRM) 13 were calculated for all patients with a known Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. MELD score was only known for recipients that were listed in the time period after December 16, 2006 because then MELD score was implemented in ET.

AASLD and AST adult liver transplant — Recommendation 37 on dyslipidemia screening and management states that the measurement of blood lipids after a 14-hour fast is recommended annually for healthy liver transplant (LT) recipients, and that an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 100 mg/dL, with or without hypertriglyceridemia, requires therapy; if therapeutic lifestyle and dietary changes are not enough, statin therapy should be introduced, and suboptimal control with statins can be improved by the addition of ezetimibe (grade 2, level B). Rationale notes that dyslipidemia occurs in up to 70% of LT recipients and that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and CNIs share metabolic pathways and have significant drug-drug interactions.

### Liver disease in the elderly [^114Y8o3L]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Despite several morphologic and functional changes that have been described in the aging liver, most relevant studies fail to identify a significant age-related deficit in liver function in humans. One of the important age-related changes is a decrease in regenerative capacity, which may partly explain the impaired recovery after severe viral and toxic injury in the elderly. Nevertheless, livers from older subjects are used successfully for transplantation. Substantial morbidity and mortality in the elderly is attributable to liver diseases, and the number of patients older than 65 years of age with chronic liver disease is increasing rapidly. Although there are no liver diseases specific to advanced age, the presentation, clinical course and management of liver diseases in the elderly may differ in important respects from those of younger individuals.

### Impact of dialysis and older age on survival after liver transplantation [^116dWyBG]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Because creatinine is heavily weighed in the MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score, we sought to determine the impact of MELD-based organ allocation on outcomes after transplantation in the pre- and post-MELD eras, focusing on recipients over age 65 on dialysis prior to transplant. A total of 20 196 patients from the UNOS database were analyzed. Comparing the pre-MELD to MELD era, there was a 41% increase in patients on dialysis (p < 0.0001), and a 117% increase in combined liver/kidney transplants (p < 0.0001). In the pre-MELD era, 1-year patient survival in recipients greater and less than age 65 on dialysis who received liver transplant alone was 56.8% and 76.4%, respectively (p = 0.13). In the MELD era these rates were 50.7% and 77.8% (p = 0.04). In the pre-MELD era, 1-year patient survival in recipients greater and less than age 65 on dialysis who underwent combined liver/kidney transplantation was 25.0% and 83.2%, respectively (p = 0.0002). In the MELD era, these rates were 67.0% and 82.5% (p = 0.18). In conclusion, a greater proportion of patients in the MELD era are on dialysis prior to transplant, and more receive combined liver/kidney transplants compared with the pre-MELD era. Candidates over age 65 who are on dialysis at the time of transplant have decreased survival after isolated liver transplantation.

### OPTN / SRTR 2016 annual data report: intestine [^116ZBwTk]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in medical and surgical treatment of intestinal failure, intestine transplant continues to play an important role. In 2016, a total of 147 intestine transplants were performed, 80 intestine-without-liver and 67 intestine-liver. Over the past decade, the age distribution of candidates waitlisted for intestine and intestine-liver transplant shifted from primarily pediatric to increasing proportions of adults. In 2016, 58.2% of candidates on the intestine list at any time during the year were aged younger than 18 years, with a decrease over time in those aged younger than 6 years and an increase in those aged 6–17 years. Adults accounted for 41.9% of candidates on the list at any time during the year, with a stable proportion of those aged 18–34 years and a decrease in those aged 35 years or older. By age, pretransplant mortality rate was highest for adult candidates at 11.7 per 100 waitlist years and lowest for children aged younger than 6 years at 2.2 per 100 waitlist years. For intestine transplants with or without a liver in 2009–2011, 1- and 5-year graft survival was 72.0% and 54.1%, respectively, for recipients aged younger than 18 years, and 70.5% and 44.1%, respectively, for recipients aged 18 years or older.

### COVID-19 in patients with liver disease and liver transplant: clinical implications, prevention, and management [^111wjssK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes in LT recipients

LT recipients are faced with unique infectious complications compared to the general population, particularly due to the use of immunosuppressive medications. As the prevalence of COVID-19 infection continues to grow worldwide, there have been an increasing number of studies evaluating clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in LT and other solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Early reports described an increased risk of severe disease and mortality in SOT recipients hospitalized for COVID-19 compared to non-transplant patients, with a mortality rate approaching 20%. Subsequent reports have identified a similar risk of death in SOT transplant patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a trend toward worse outcomes during the pandemic's first wave, potentially skewed by early testing limitations leading to underrepresentation of mild or asymptomatic cases. Older age, male sex, and increasing BMI in the SOT population are independently associated with increased mortality, paralleling what has been described in the general population.

Following these initial reports, larger studies have further refined our understanding of the relationship between COVID-19 and LT specifically. Among LT recipients, several studies in the United States and Europe have described a mortality rate nearing 20%, in line with rates seen among all SOT recipients (Table 1). In a multicenter cohort study across 18 countries, LT recipients with COVID-19 were hospitalized at similar rates compared to age- and gender-matched non-transplant controls but experienced higher rates of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. In this and other studies, LT did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with COVID-19, but older age and medical comorbidities – including renal dysfunction and non-liver cancer – did. – In a systematic review of 1481 LT recipients from 17 studies, there was no difference in mortality among LT recipients hospitalized for COVID-19 when compared to non-transplant patients with similar comorbidities. Another meta-analysis of 12 studies comprising 517 LT recipients hospitalized for COVID-19 found that time since LT did not significantly impact the risk of death. In all, despite initial concerns that immunocompromised transplant recipients would be more severely impacted by COVID-19, non-transplant-associated medical comorbidities seem to drive clinical outcomes.

### Donor age as a risk factor in donation after circulatory death liver transplantation in a controlled withdrawal protocol programme [^1161EWZU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Results of donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation are impaired by graft loss, resulting mainly from non-anastomotic biliary stricture. Donor age is a risk factor in deceased donor liver transplantation, and particularly in DCD liver transplantation. At the authors' institute, age is not an absolute exclusion criterion for discarding DCD liver grafts, DCD donors receive comfort therapy before withdrawal, and cold ischaemia is minimized.

Methods

All consecutive DCD liver transplantations performed from 2003 to 2012 were studied retrospectively. Three age groups were compared in terms of donor and recipient demographics, procurement and transplantation conditions, peak laboratory values during the first post-transplant 72 h, and results at 1 and 3 years.

Results

A total of 70 DCD liver transplants were performed, including 32 liver grafts from donors aged 55 years or less, 20 aged 56–69 years, and 18 aged 70 years or more. The overall graft survival rate at 1 month, 1 and 3 years was 99, 91 and 72 per cent respectively, with no graft lost secondary to non-anastomotic stricture. No difference other than age was noted between the three groups for donor or recipient characteristics, or procurement conditions. No primary non-function occurred, but one patient needed retransplantation for artery thrombosis. Biliary complications were similar in the three groups. Graft and patient survival rates were no different at 1 and 3 years between the three groups (P = 0.605).

Conclusion

Results for DCD liver transplantation from younger and older donors were similar. Donor age above 50 years should not be a contraindication to DCD liver transplantation if other donor risk factors (such as warm and cold ischaemia time) are minimized.

### Recipient characteristics and morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation [^113V8LTx]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older non-hepatitis C cirrhotics with multiple co-morbidities has increased in the United States. We sought to identify an easily applicable set of recipient factors among HCV negative adult transplant recipients associated with significant morbidity and mortality within five years after liver transplantation.

Methods

We collected national (n = 31,829, 2002–2015) and center-specific data. Coefficients of relevant recipient factors were converted to weighted points and scaled from 0–5. Recipient factors associated with graft failure included: ventilator support (five patients; hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; 95% CI 1.48–1.72); recipient age > 60 years (three patients; HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.23–1.36); hemodialysis (three patients; HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.16–1.37); diabetes (two patients; HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.14–1.27); or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl without hemodialysis (two patients; HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09–1.22).

Results

Graft survival within five years based on points (any combination) was 77.2% (0–4), 69.1% (5–8) and 57.9% (> 8). In recipients with > 8 points, graft survival was 42% (model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] score < 25) and 50% (MELD score 25–35) in recipients receiving grafts from donors with a donor risk index > 1.7. In center-specific data within the first year, subjects with ≥ 5 points (vs. 0–4) had longer hospitalization (11 vs. 8 days, p < 0.01), higher admissions for rehabilitation (12.3% vs. 2.7%, p < 0.01), and higher incidence of cardiac disease (14.2% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.01) and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (78.6% vs. 39.5%, p = 0.03) within five years.

Conclusion

The impact of co-morbidities in an MELD-based organ allocation system need to be reassessed. The proposed clinical tool may be helpful for center-specific assessment of risk of graft failure in non-HCV patients and for discussion regarding relevant morbidity in selected subsets.

Lay Summary

Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older patient with multiple co-morbidities has increased. In this study, we show that a set of recipient factors (recipient age > 60 years, ventilator status, diabetes, hemodialysis and creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl) can help identify patients that may not do well after transplant. Transplanting sicker organs in patients with certain combinations of these characteristics leads to lower survival.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^11135mSe]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

AASLD/AST 2012 practice guideline — post–liver transplant hepatitis C virus (HCV) outcomes — The risk of decompensation after onset of cirrhosis is 15% to 30% within the first year, and mortality is 40% to 55% within 6 to 12 months of the decompensating event; patient survival and graft survival are reduced in HCV-infected recipients with a 5-year patient survival rate of approximately 70%. HCV-infected recipients have higher rates of graft loss when the allograft is from an older donor, and there is a higher risk of cirrhosis when HCV-infected liver transplant (LT) recipients develop acute rejection requiring treatment or comorbid CMV hepatitis. The impact of immunosuppressives on HCV progression is poorly understood, with some data suggesting anti-lymphocyte agents promote HCV-associated liver injury, and post-LT diabetes, insulin resistance, and steatosis have been associated with a higher risk of rapid progression to advanced fibrosis.

### Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients: an international registry study [^111NPNSp]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

In summary, this study involving more than 700 patients, including 151 liver transplant recipients, suggests that previous liver transplantation is not independently associated with death following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, advanced age and medical comorbidities such as renal impairment were associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality. Thus, traditional risk factors for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 should be preferentially considered when considering the risks and benefits of hospital attendance, immunosuppression, and social-distancing requirements for liver transplant recipients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Investigating outcomes after marginal allograft transplant is essential in determining appropriate and more aggressive use of these allografts.

Objective

To determine the time trends in the outcomes of marginal liver allografts as defined by 6 different sets of criteria.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cohort, multicenter study, 75 050 patients who received a liver transplant between March 1, 2002, and September 30, 2016, were retrospectively analyzed to last known follow-up (n = 55 395) or death (n = 19 655) using the United Network for Organ Sharing Database. The study period was divided into three 5-year eras: 2002–2006, 2007–2011, and 2012–2016. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to examine the allograft after transplant with marginal allografts, which were defined as 90th percentile Donor Risk Index allografts (calculated over the entire study period), donor after circulatory death allografts, national share allografts, old age (donors > 70 years) allografts, fatty liver allografts, and 90th percentile Discard Risk Index allografts. Statistical analysis was performed from August to December 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Allograft failure after transplant as defined by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database.

Results

Among the 75 050 patients (44 394 men; mean [SD] age, 54.3 [9.9] years) in the study, Donor Risk Index, patient Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores, and balance of risk scores significantly increased over time. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that 90th percentile Donor Risk Index allograft survival increased across the study period (2002–2006: hazard ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.34–1.49]; 2007–2011: hazard ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.17–1.34]; 2012–2016: hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.98–1.24]). Secondary definitions of marginal allografts (donor after circulatory death, national share, old age donors, fatty liver, and 90th percentile Discard Risk Index) showed similar improvements in allograft survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

The study's findings encourage the aggressive use of liver allografts and may indicate a need for a redefinition of allograft marginality in liver transplantation.

### Health-related quality of life after liver transplantation for adult recipients [^116zF8gg]. Liver Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

1. Pretransplantation health-related quality of life scores are affected by the etiology of liver cirrhosis, with hepatocellular and cholestatic etiologies having higher health-related quality of life scores than alcohol or viral hepatitis etiologies. 2. Posttransplantation health-related quality of life scores are not affected by the etiology of the original liver cirrhosis, but transplant recipient scores continue to remain significantly lower than those of healthy patient controls. 3. During the first 6 months after liver transplantation, the majority of physical and mental components of health-related quality of life scores improve, but these increases are not sustained in the long term. 4. At 1 year after liver transplantation, emotional and mental health-related quality of life scores begin to decrease. 5. During postoperative years 1 to 5, episodes of acute cellular rejection and patient age over 60 years decrease physical function and overall general health-related quality of life scores. 6. Beyond 5 years after orthotopic liver transplantation, age over 60, osteoporosis, and episodes of chronic rejection decrease health-related quality of life scores through decreases in the physical function and bodily pain domains. 7. Hepatitis C as an indication for liver transplantation is an independent factor in decreasing posttransplantation health-related quality of life scores. 8. Further studies are necessary that include a complete evaluation of the effects of gender, socioeconomic status, education, and ethnicity in order to better understand factors influencing post-liver transplantation health-related quality of life scores. 9. The development of a health-related quality of life assessment tool specific to transplantation could help us to more accurately assess factors (such as immunosuppression) that alter posttransplantation health-related quality of life.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^117JRHjx]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 14 — recommended immunizations for adult liver transplant (LT) recipients: After transplantation, the listed vaccines are Influenza and Pneumococcus, and the pneumococcal vaccine should be repeated every 3 to 5 years after the initial administration. Transplant recipients may also receive the following vaccines safely: the meningococcal vaccine, the inactivated Salmonella Typhi vaccine (Typhim Vi intramuscular vaccine), the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, and the Vibrio cholera vaccine, and live virus vaccines should be avoided after transplantation. For hepatitis A virus and HBV, immunizations should be administered before transplantation; there are no guidelines regarding posttransplant immunization, although these vaccines are safe after transplantation, and HBV antibody levels should be measured annually after transplantation, with boosters considered for waning immunity. The tetanus/diphtheria/acellular pertussis vaccine can also be safely administered after transplantation. The human papilloma virus vaccine is indicated for females up to the age of 26 years and can be safely administered after transplantation. The varicella vaccine can be administered safely before transplantation to nonimmune individuals and should not be administered after transplantation. The zoster vaccine is indicated for individuals who are 60 years old or older and should not be administered after transplantation.

Introduction

Liver transplantation constitutes the only curative treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Advances in the field of liver transplantation have led to favourable short and medium-term (1–3 years) recipient survival rates. However, long-term survival rates remain somewhat disappointing, with patient survival at 1, 5 and 10 years post-transplant being 87%, 74% and 61%, respectively. Cardiovascular comorbidities are one of the leading causes of mortality in liver transplant recipients with a functioning graft. Cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia (13–46%), hypertension (21–56%), obesity, diabetes (up to 40%) and metabolic syndrome (~50%) are highly prevalent in liver transplant recipients. In addition to the side effects of immunosuppressive therapy, this unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile can be attributed to modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivityand poor physical fitness.

The American Heart Association now advocates routine assessment of cardiorespiratory capacity as a clinical vital sign, recognising that, in the general and at-risk population, the peak oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 peak) may be more powerful in predicting mortality than smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and type 2 diabetes. In healthy adults, each one metabolic equivalent (3.5 mL×kg −1 ×min −1) improvement in V̇O 2 peak is associated with 15% reduction in cardiovascular events and a 13% reduction in all-cause mortality. Accordingly, a large trial in elderly non-transplant men showed each one metabolic equivalent improvement in V̇O 2 peak to result in a 12% improvement in survival. In end-stage liver disease, V̇O 2 peak is severely impaired while only partially recovering after transplantation to~70–85% of a matched reference population. Some data indicate that pathologically decreased muscle mass and function, already present before transplantation in 30–40% of liver transplant candidates, does not significantly improve in the initial 2 years post-transplant in the absence of lifestyle interventions. Moreover, persistent or new-onset sarcopenia after transplantation is a common finding. In addition, in light of prevalent excessive post-transplant weight gain, persistent and new-onset sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are common in this patient population.

### Long-term outcomes (beyond 5 years) of liver transplant recipients – A transatlantic multicenter study [^116crVy8]. Liver Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The long-term (> 5 y) outcomes following liver transplantation (LT) have not been extensively reported. The aim was to evaluate outcomes of LT recipients who have survived the first 5 years. A multicenter retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 3 high volume LT centers (Dallas-USA, Birmingham-UK, and Barcelona-Spain) was undertaken. All adult patients, who underwent LT since the inception of the program to December 31, 2010, and survived at least 5 years since their LT were included. Patient survival was the primary outcome. A total of 3682 patients who survived at least 5 years following LT (long-term survivors) were included. Overall, median age at LT was 52 years (IQR 44–58); 53.1% were males; and 84.6% were Caucasians. A total of 49.4% (n = 1820) died during a follow-up period of 36,828 person-years (mean follow-up 10 y). A total of 80.2% (n = 1460) of all deaths were premature deaths. Age-standardized all-cause mortality as compared to general population was 3 times higher for males and 5 times higher for females. On adjusted analysis, besides older recipients and older donors, predictors of long-term mortality were malignancy, cardiovascular disease, and dialysis. Implementation of strategies such as noninvasive cancer screening, minimizing immunosuppression, and intensive primary/secondary cardiovascular prevention could further improve survival.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors use in liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: a global cohort study [^115ShvJv]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have indicated a potential association between recipient age and the risk of graft rejection in LT. Kueht et al. analyzed data from 42,508 adult recipients in the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) database. They found an inverse relationship between age and the incidence of acute rejection within one year post-transplant. Recipients aged 18–25 had a significantly higher risk of rejection compared to those over 60. Similarly, a single-center retrospective study of 110 liver transplant recipients reported that patients experiencing acute rejection were significantly younger than those who did not. Additionally, recipients under 46 years of age exhibited higher peripheral CD8⁺ T cell counts postoperatively, suggesting greater immune activation in younger individuals. A 2024 review by De Simone et al. further noted an acute rejection incidence of approximately 9% in recipients aged 65 years or older, significantly lower than the 23% observed in the 18–34 age group. In our study, recipient age was considered a potential influencing factor; however, no statistically significant association with graft rejection was identified. This discrepancy may be attributed to several factors: the relatively small sample size may have limited statistical power; the narrow age distribution may have reduced detectable age-related immune variation; and standardized, intensified perioperative immunosuppression may have minimized age-dependent differences in immune activation.

### Associations among different domains of quality among US liver transplant programs [^111APup9]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

US liver transplant programs have traditionally been evaluated on 1-year patient and graft survival. However, there is concern that a narrow focus on recipient outcomes may not incentivize programs to improve in other ways that would benefit patients with end-stage liver disease.

Objective

To determine the correlation among different potential domains of quality for adult liver transplant programs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2014 to 2019 among adult liver transplant programs included in the United Network for Organ Sharing and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients program-specific reports. Liver transplant programs in the United States completing at least 10 liver transplants per year were included. Data were analyzed from March 2 to August 13, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The potential domains of quality examined included recipient outcomes (1-year graft and patient survival), aggressiveness (ie, marginal graft use, defined as the rate of use of donors with body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 40, age older than 65 years, or deceased by cardiac death), and waiting list management (ie, waiting list mortality). The correlation among measures, aggregated at the center level, was evaluated using linear regression to control for mean Model for End Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score at organ allocation. The extent to which programs were able to achieve high quality across multiple domains was also evaluated.

Results

Among 114 transplant programs that performed a total of 44 554 transplants, the mean (SD) 1-year graft and patient survival was 90.3% (3.0%) with a total range of 75.9% to 96.6%. The mean (SD) waiting list mortality rate was 16.7 (6.1) deaths per 100 person-years, with a total range of 6.3 to 53.0 deaths per 100 person years. The mean (SD) marginal graft use rate was 15.8 (8.8) donors per 100 transplants, with a total range of 0 to 49.3 donors. There was no correlation between 1-year graft and patient survival and waiting list mortality (β = -0.053; p = 0.19) or marginal graft use (β = -0.007; p = 0.84) after correcting for mean allocation Model for End Stage Liver Disease-Sodium scores. There were 2 transplant programs (1.8%) that performed in the top quartile on all 3 measures, while 4 transplant programs (3.6%) performed in the bottom quartile on all 3 measures.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that among US liver transplant programs, there were no correlations among 1-year recipient outcomes, measures of program aggressiveness, or waiting list management. These findings suggest that a program's performance in one domain may be independent and unrelated to its performance on others and that the understanding of factors contributing to these domains is incomplete.

### Assessment of trends in transplantation of liver grafts from older donors, 2003–2016… [^115k6tMa]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

We identified 4127 liver grafts from older donors recovered for transplant and 3350 deceased donor liver-only recipients of grafts from older donors between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2016. We also identified 78 990 liver grafts from younger donors recovered for transplant and 64 907 deceased donor liver-only recipients of grafts from younger donors in the same period. Among 4127 liver grafts from older donors that were recovered for liver transplant across the entire study period, 2241 donors were aged 70 to 74 years, 1361 were aged 75 to 79 years, 435 were aged 80 to 84 years, and 90 were 85 years or older. Among 747 discarded liver grafts from older donors, 381 donors were aged 70 to 74 years, 246 were aged 75 to 79 years, 98 were aged 80 to 84 years, and 22 were 85 years or older.

Among 3350 liver grafts from older donors for liver-only recipients, 1838 were aged 70 to 74 years, 1109 were aged 75 to 79 years, 335 were aged 80 to 84 years, and 68 were 85 years or older. The number of recipients of liver grafts from older donors steadily decreased from 258 in 2003 to 211 in 2016 and the percentage among all adult liver recipients decreased from 6. 0% to
3. 2%. The mean age increased from 55. 9 years in 2003 to
59. 8 years in 2016. Furthermore, we found that if all OPOs performed at least at the level of the national average for discard, 177 more grafts from older donors would have been available for liver transplant.

### Outcome of liver transplantation in septuagenarians: a single-center experience… [^111VAtgB]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Group 1 included 62 patients aged 70 years or older. Group 2 included 864 patients aged 50 to 59 years. Unadjusted patient survival of group 1 at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years was 73. 3%,
65. 8%, 47. 1%, and
39. 7%, respectively. Because many diseases causing liver failure are age specific, and some are increasingly common in patients of advancing age, the number of older transplant candidates is substantial. Herein we report the largest series to date of liver transplantation in recipients 70 years or older and the finding that age as a sole criterion does not affect survival when compared with a cohort of patients in their sixth decade of life. We found no statistically significant difference in survival in the first 10 years after transplantation for a group of 62 patients 70 years or older when compared with a younger cohort of 864 recipients aged 50 to 59 years with similar characteristics. Chris E.

Freise, MD, San Francisco, California: This study by Lipshutz, Ghobrial, Busuttil, and colleagues describes their group's experience with liver transplantation in a cohort of patients age 70 and greater, comparing outcomes to a cohort age 50 to 59. They state their purpose very clearly: septuagenarians are a higher-risk group in terms of survival, but as our population ages, there is an increasing demand for transplant in patients with advancing age. Data available to date are from a few small center-specific reports and from the national UNOS database. Five-year patient survival from the UNOS database is 62% for patients 65 and greater, and 70. 3% for patients 50 to
64. While the age cut points are a bit different than in this UCLA report, these data show that there is a clear decrease in survival with advancing age. That is about 3 or 4 recipients older than 70 years every year.

That is not very many, considering that we do about 200 to 250 transplants per year. The means that we go about to accomplish this include using split livers, writing exception letters to the board, and getting upgrades by the presence of cancer. About 10% to 15% of these patients did have cancer.
