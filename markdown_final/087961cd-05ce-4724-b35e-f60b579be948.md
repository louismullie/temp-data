## Question

concerta administration

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Concerta (OROS methylphenidate) administration, including conversion from immediate-release methylphenidate, maximum doses, titration and timing, key safety monitoring, and special co-occurring situations such as substance use disorder and tic disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Concerta is pharmacologically and how its delivery system shapes dosing. Then, I should verify conversion ratios from IR methylphenidate and the principle behind the roughly 20% higher daily exposure. Next, I will review maximum licensed and guideline-recommended doses and reconcile apparent discrepancies. After that, I should define practical administration and titration. I will then examine core safety issues — abuse/diversion, cardiovascular and psychiatric risks — and monitoring. Finally, I will consider co-occurring conditions (SUD, tics/ASD), dose-optimization evidence, and when to reassess or stop treatment, with careful cross-checking of each claim against the cited sources.

> Let me first confirm the product and delivery system because dosing logic hinges on this. Concerta is an osmotic-release oral system (OROS) formulation of methylphenidate designed for once-daily administration with approximately 12-hour coverage, developed to achieve clinical effects comparable to three-times-daily immediate-release methylphenidate across the day, which guides equivalency considerations and administration timing [^114Gsvdv] [^114NQAX5].

> I will now examine dose conversion from IR to OROS carefully. In the pivotal within-subject comparison, 5 mg IR tid aligned with 18 mg once daily, 10 mg IR tid with 36 mg once daily, and 15 mg IR tid with 54 mg once daily, with Concerta doses intentionally set about 20% higher on a daily basis than the comparable total daily IR regimen to maintain continuous coverage; I should emphasize that this is a therapeutic equivalence framework and not a milligram-for-milligram substitution across different extended-release brands or technologies, so I need to avoid assuming cross-product mg equivalence when switching among ER methylphenidate formulations such as Azstarys or the transdermal system Daytrana [^114Gsvdv] [^113pJAmd] [^115Aao2U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on titration without cross-checking best practices. Titration should start low and proceed in small, clinically meaningful increments to maximize benefit while containing side effects, consistent with AAP guidance to titrate ADHD medications to maximal benefit with tolerable adverse effects; in practice with OROS methylphenidate this typically means beginning at a low once-daily dose and adjusting about weekly, often in 18 mg steps paralleling studied dose levels, with symptom and tolerability reviews at each step, a cadence that is congruent with the 7-day treatment epochs used in the trial and general FDA labeling principles for methylphenidate [^114Gsvdv] [^114Gsvdv] [^115SVGP3].

> Wait, I should verify maximum dose language because different documents conflict and I need to preserve that discrepancy transparently. I initially stated "FDA-approved maximum 54 mg/day for osmotic-release formulations", but I should double-check: the FDA methylphenidate HCl labeling caps daily doses for children at 60 mg, which pertains to IR formulations and does not by itself define OROS limits, while UK-oriented sources report that OROS/prolonged-release methylphenidate has a licensed maximum of 54 mg/day but that the BNF and some specialty guidelines allow Concerta XL up to 108 mg/day under specialist supervision; thus, my earlier blanket "FDA maximum 54 mg" assertion needs qualification as formulation- and jurisdiction-specific, and any escalation beyond labeled maxima should be specialist-led with careful risk–benefit documentation, particularly given abuse potential and dose-related adverse events [^115SVGP3] [^113rA9Gf] [^116ZHTCW].

> Let me think about practical administration next. Once-daily morning dosing is typically used to align the 12-hour effect window with school or work demands, and dose adjustments are generally spaced by about a week to judge effect and tolerability, consistent with the once-daily, 12-hour profile and the week-long cross-over periods used in the core trial; I should also remind myself not to substitute different methylphenidate products on a mg-for-mg basis because pharmacokinetics differ across ER technologies, as explicitly noted for Azstarys and implicitly for transdermal delivery with Daytrana [^114Gsvdv] [^113pJAmd] [^115Aao2U].

> I need to ensure discontinuation and reassessment practices are clear. If there is no meaningful improvement after appropriate dose adjustments over roughly one month, discontinuation is recommended, and periodic drug holidays or interruptions can help reassess the ongoing need, which aligns with FDA labeling principles for methylphenidate more broadly and supports a structured reassessment cadence during maintenance [^115SVGP3] [^113pJAmd].

> Next, I should review abuse, misuse, and diversion risks. CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate, carry boxed warnings emphasizing high abuse and misuse potential with risks of overdose and death particularly with higher doses or non-oral routes, so I need to assess baseline risk, educate patients and families about secure storage and disposal, and monitor throughout treatment; extended-release formulations can mitigate some misuse patterns, and even at very high single doses in abuse-potential studies, ER methylphenidate produced variable but generally comparable or lower positive subjective effects than high-dose IR comparators, underscoring the importance of formulation choice and monitoring plans [^116K1i3u] [^114SZjx7] [^116Twe6P] [^113GFfFX].

> Hold on, I should verify cardiovascular and psychiatric precautions too. Regulatory and guideline language advises caution in children with personal or family cardiovascular disease and calls for routine blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, while stimulants can rarely precipitate manic or psychotic symptoms even at usual doses, so pre-treatment screening for bipolar spectrum risk and ongoing monitoring for aggression, mood or psychotic symptoms are essential; if such symptoms emerge, I should consider a causal role of the stimulant and dose reduction or discontinuation, aligning with both observational and FDA labeling data [^116heBg3] [^113VjbSQ].

> I will now examine dose optimization evidence to balance efficacy and tolerability. Meta-analytic work suggests that higher stimulant doses within licensed ranges can yield additional symptom reductions but with diminishing returns and more adverse-event-related discontinuations, which argues for methodical upward titration to the highest effective and tolerated dose, and careful justification if contemplating doses beyond labeled limits under specialist oversight, particularly in adults where unlicensed dosing is sometimes used but carries a less favorable risk–benefit profile on average [^114Gsvdv] [^113rA9Gf] [^113rA9Gf].

> Let me consider co-occurring substance use disorder because this changes risk calculus. For patients with ADHD and co-occurring stimulant use disorder, expert consensus recommends that ADHD still be addressed, favoring long-acting formulations and risk-aligned monitoring such as pill counts, PDMP checks, drug testing, and increased clinical contact, while remembering that methylphenidate is not recommended as a treatment for stimulant use disorder per se by WHO guidance; thus, the indication here remains ADHD management with safeguards, not SUD pharmacotherapy, and the benefit–risk assessment must be individualized and revisited regularly [^117UDhiR] [^11736e23] [^116Xkfdt] [^112vXh6A] [^113KgVaF].

> But wait, what if tics or ASD are present. Evidence-informed guidance suggests methylphenidate remains acceptable for ADHD in the presence of tics, though alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine may be preferred when ADHD co-occurs with prominent tics or broader dysregulation, and if guanfacine XR is considered, I should avoid milligram-for-milligram substitution from immediate-release due to different pharmacokinetics and follow labeled titration, while monitoring for sedation, hypotension, and bradycardia [^113oaxn7] [^111i5ozn].

> I should double-check that my synthesis preserves the key equivalences without overgeneralization. When converting an established IR methylphenidate tid regimen, 5 mg tid typically corresponds to 18 mg OROS qd, 10 mg tid to 36 mg qd, and 15 mg tid to 54 mg qd, remembering the approximately 20% higher total daily OROS dose to maintain continuous exposure, and then titrating in weekly steps based on clinical response and tolerability within licensed or specialist-approved ranges, with ongoing monitoring for cardiovascular, psychiatric, and misuse risks throughout care [^114Gsvdv] [^1145xUKk] [^113rA9Gf].

Concerta is administered as a **once-daily morning dose** to provide 12-hour symptom control [^114Gsvdv] and reduce school-time dosing burden [^114NQAX5]. Tablets must be **swallowed whole** with water; do not chew, crush, or split [^113GFfFX], to preserve the OROS delivery system and prevent dose dumping. Dosing is individualized, starting at 18 mg and **titrated by 18 mg weekly** [^1145xUKk] [^115SVGP3] to a typical maximum of 54 mg/day in children/adolescents [^113rA9Gf] and 72 mg/day in adults; higher doses should be considered only under specialist supervision [^1138w7NB]. Monitor for insomnia, appetite loss, cardiovascular effects [^116heBg3], and psychiatric symptoms [^113VjbSQ], and avoid evening dosing to minimize sleep disruption [^115SVGP3]. Educate patients on proper use, storage, and disposal to prevent misuse and diversion [^114SZjx7].

---

## Indications and patient selection

Concerta is **indicated for ADHD** in children, adolescents, and adults [^1145xUKk]. Patient selection should **confirm an ADHD diagnosis** using standardized criteria [^1145xUKk], assess comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease, anxiety, or substance use disorders), and consider patient preference for **once-daily dosing** [^114NQAX5] to support convenience and adherence.

---

## Dosage and titration

Concerta **dosing is individualized** according to response and tolerability [^1145xUKk]. Titrate weekly based on clinical response and side effects [^1121eNFn], and reduce or discontinue if adverse effects occur:

| **Patient population** | **Initial dose** | **Titration** | **Maximum recommended dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Children and adolescents (6–17 years) | 18 mg once daily | Increase by 18 mg weekly | - 54 mg/day (FDA) [^1145xUKk] <br/> - Up to 108 mg/day (BNF) [^113rA9Gf] |
| Adults (≥ 18 years) | 18–36 mg once daily | Increase by 18 mg weekly | - 72 mg/day (FDA) [^1138w7NB] <br/> - Up to 108 mg/day (BNF) [^113rA9Gf] |

---

## Administration instructions

Proper administration is **essential for efficacy and safety**:

- **Timing**: Administer once daily in the morning to avoid insomnia [^115SVGP3].

- **Swallowing**: Swallow tablets whole with water; do not chew, crush, or split [^113GFfFX].

- **Food**: May be taken with or without food.

- **Missed dose**: Skip and resume next morning; do not double dose.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is **necessary to ensure safety and efficacy**:

- **Cardiovascular monitoring**: Check blood pressure and heart rate regularly [^116heBg3].

- **Growth monitoring**: Monitor height and weight in children and adolescents [^1145xUKk].

- **Psychiatric monitoring**: Watch for mood changes, anxiety, or psychotic symptoms [^113VjbSQ].

- **Abuse potential**: Monitor for misuse, diversion, or dependence [^116Twe6P].

---

## Potential side effects and risks

Concerta is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects may occur**:

- **Common side effects**: Insomnia, decreased appetite, headache, abdominal pain, irritability [^117NtF7x].

- **Serious risks**: Cardiovascular events, psychiatric symptoms, growth suppression [^116heBg3] [^113VjbSQ].

- **Abuse potential**: Risk of misuse, dependence, and diversion [^113GFfFX].

---

## Special considerations

Use Concerta **cautiously in cardiovascular conditions** [^116heBg3]. In individuals with substance use disorder, prefer **extended-release formulations** with close monitoring [^112vXh6A] [^116Xkfdt]. During pregnancy and lactation, use only if **benefits outweigh risks**.

---

## Patient education

Patient education is **critical for adherence and safety**. Emphasize swallowing tablets whole and adhering to the dosing schedule; inform patients about potential side effects and when to seek medical attention; and instruct on secure storage and proper disposal of unused medication [^116K1i3u].

Concerta is a once-daily extended-release methylphenidate formulation for ADHD that provides 12-hour symptom control and improved adherence [^114NQAX5]. Proper administration, individualized dosing, and regular monitoring are **essential for optimal outcomes** [^1145xUKk].

### Once-a-day Concerta methylphenidate versus three-times-daily methylphenidate in laboratory and natural settings [^114Gsvdv]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Methylphenidate (MPH), the most commonly prescribed drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has a short half-life, which necessitates multiple daily doses. The need for multiple doses produces problems with medication administration during school and after-school hours, thus affecting compliance. Previous long-acting stimulants and preparations have shown effects equivalent to twice-daily dosing of MPH. This study tests the efficacy and duration of action, in natural and laboratory settings, of an extended-release MPH preparation designed to last 12 hours and therefore be equivalent to 3-times-daily dosing.

Sixty-eight children with ADHD, aged 6 to 12 years, participated in a within-subject, double-blind comparison of placebo, immediate-release (IR) MPH three times a day (tid), and Concerta, a once-daily MPH formulation. Three dosing levels of medication were used: 5 mg IR MPH tid/18 mg Concerta once a day (qd); 10 mg IR MPH tid/36 mg Concerta qd; and 15 mg IR MPH tid/54 mg Concerta qd. All children were currently medicated with MPH at enrollment, and each child's dose level was based on that child's MPH dosing before the study. The doses of Concerta were selected to be comparable to the daily doses of MPH that each child received. To achieve the ascending rate of MPH delivery determined by initial investigations to provide the necessary continuous coverage, Concerta doses were 20% higher on a daily basis than a comparable tid regimen of IR MPH. Children received each medication condition for 7 days.

### Common pitfalls and how to avoid them in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^113rA9Gf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Optimising the treatment involves careful consideration of the dosing for medications such as methylphenidate. While the maximum licensed dose for children (excluding osmotic release and prolonged release formulations) is generally 60 mg/day in many countries, some guidelines, such as those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA), recommend higher doses. The British National Formulary (BNF) suggests a dose of up to 90 mg/day, but only under the guidance of a specialist. For osmotic-release and prolonged-release formulations, the maximum licensed dose sits at 54 mg/day, although Concerta XL® allows for a maximum of 108 mg/day in children and adults, according to the BNF.

- **Dose optimization**: Some prescribers may not optimize the treatment dose to achieve the maximum benefit with the highest tolerated dose, settling instead for a moderate improvement in symptoms. Meta-analytic evidence from flexible-dose trials involving both methylphenidate and amphetamines demonstrates increased efficacy and a reduced likelihood of discontinuations with higher stimulant doses, up to the maximum FDA-licensed limit.

- **Beyond licensed doses**: In adults, evidence (though unavailable for children) suggests that doses exceeding licensed limits do not typically offer a favorable benefit–risk profile. However, individual patients might benefit from and tolerate doses beyond these limits. While exceeding recommended doses should not become standard practice, it can be considered when the patient presents with unique needs warranting such an approach.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^115SVGP3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Dosage should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient.

- **Adults**: Administer in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. The average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily. Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily. In others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate. Patients who are unable to sleep if medication is taken late in the day should take the last dose before 6 p.m.

- **Children (6 years and over)**: Methylphenidate HCl should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly increments. A daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended. Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch), with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly. If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur, reduce dosage or, if necessary, discontinue the drug. Methylphenidate HCl should be periodically discontinued to assess the child's condition. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued. Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may be discontinued after puberty.

If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.

### Methylphenidate for ADHD rejected from the who essential medicines list due to uncertainties in benefit-harm profile [^1124UCwg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder with estimated global prevalence rates between 3% and 5% in children and 2.5% in adults, depending on the classification system used. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used medications for ADHD. In this analysis article, we describe the evidence in the field, the application for inclusion of methylphenidate on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the comments raised to the application, and the decision of the WHO Expert Committee.

The application for getting methylphenidate on the WHO list was overzealous in reporting potential benefits, without highlighting key uncertainties and harms. Decisions regarding medicines' candidacy for the WHO Model List should not be based on speculation about potential benefits and should fully incorporate areas of uncertainties. Even though methylphenidate has been used for over 60 years, the evidence concerning the benefits of this medication in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD is uncertain. The decision of the committee was to not include methylphenidate in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines due to uncertainties in the estimates of benefit, and concerns regarding the quality and limitations of the available evidence for both benefit and harm.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^117UDhiR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly concerning patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend addressing ADHD symptoms as part of the substance use disorder treatment in patients with substance use disorder co-occurring with ADHD. Consider offering the following:

- **Psychostimulant medications**: Manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.
- **Non-stimulant medications**: Manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks.
- **Behavioral approaches**: Implement as part of the treatment plan.

### Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride [^116Twe6P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks, proper storage of the drug, and proper disposal of any unused drug. Throughout treatment with dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of these issues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

- **Warning: Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets carry a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to substance use disorder and addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. The risk of these outcomes is heightened with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

- **Patient evaluation and education**: Before prescribing, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. It is crucial to educate patients and their families about the risks, the proper storage of the drug, and the disposal of any unused medication. Throughout treatment, continue to reassess each patient's risk and monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^11736e23]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the following agents for patients with stimulant use disorder and co-occurring ADHD:

- **Topiramate combined with extended-release mixed amphetamine salts**: This combination may provide benefits in managing symptoms effectively.
- **Long-acting amphetamine formulation psychostimulants**: These formulations can be considered to support therapeutic outcomes.
- **Long-acting methylphenidate formulations**: These are recommended for their potential efficacy in managing co-occurring conditions.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^113fjTa3]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cognitive neuroscience has permitted a greater understanding of ADHD. Recent research and novel drug developments have provided new treatment options for adolescents and adults with ADHD. New stimulant formulations have made it possible to tailor treatment to the duration of efficacy required by patients and to help mitigate the potential for abuse, misuse, and diversion. Although they tend to be less efficacious than stimulants, new non-stimulant options also allow for extended duration of treatment without the adverse consequences associated with stimulant therapy. Progress in non-medical therapies now provides several options for patients who cannot or will not use medications, and for the many medication-treated patients who continue to show residual disability.

Looking toward the future, research will need to address several unmet needs. Many treated people with ADHD continue to have problems with executive functioning and deficient emotional self-regulation. These problems persist in many patients even when the core ADHD symptoms, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), are effectively treated. Future treatment development should aim at developing both psychosocial and medical treatments for these areas of difficulty. Future treatment research should also work to define and achieve optimal treatment outcomes for people with ADHD. Although treatments are effective for achieving substantial symptom reduction in most patients, more work is needed to achieve full symptom reduction and to reduce…

### Amphetamine, past and present — a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^115nMbHu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Amphetamine was discovered over 100 years ago. Since then, it has transformed from a drug that was freely available without prescription as a panacea for a broad range of disorders into a highly restricted controlled drug with therapeutic applications restricted to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. This review describes the relationship between the chemical structure and pharmacology of amphetamine and its congeners. Amphetamine's diverse pharmacological actions translate not only into therapeutic efficacy but also into the production of adverse events and liability for recreational abuse. Accordingly, the balance of benefit/risk is the key challenge for its clinical use.

The review charts advances in pharmaceutical development from the introduction of once-daily formulations of amphetamine through to lisdexamfetamine, which is the first d-amphetamine prodrug approved for the management of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults. The unusual metabolic route for lisdexamfetamine to deliver d-amphetamine makes an important contribution to its pharmacology. How lisdexamfetamine's distinctive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile translates into sustained efficacy as a treatment for ADHD and its reduced potential for recreational abuse is also discussed.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117NtF7x]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Is treatment with methylphenidate associated with benefits or harms for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

- **Bottom line**: Methylphenidate is associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms, general behavior, and quality of life; however, due to the very low quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the associated improvement is uncertain. Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of nonserious adverse events. There are too few data to assess the association with serious adverse events.

### 2023 Canadian Thoracic Society guideline on pharmacotherapy in patients with stable COPD [^117Dkiaq]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically in the context of combination therapy, the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) 2023 guidelines recommend stepping up to LAMA/LABA/ICS triple therapy in patients with stable COPD who are at low risk of exacerbations. This recommendation applies to those with a moderate-to-high symptom burden and/or health status impairment, indicated by a COPD Assessment Test score of 10 or more or an mMRC grade of 2 or higher. It also pertains to patients with impaired lung function, evidenced by an FEV₁ less than 80% of the predicted value, despite being on LAMA/LABA dual therapy or ICS/LABA combination therapy.

### Icatibant [^115DJ9fu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: A 30 mg dose should be injected subcutaneously in the abdominal area. If the response is inadequate or symptoms recur, additional 30 mg injections may be administered at intervals of at least 6 hours. It is critical not to administer more than 3 injections within a 24-hour period. Upon recognition of an HAE attack, patients may self-administer the injection.

- **Recommended dosing**: The recommended dose is 30 mg administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdominal area. Additional doses, if necessary, may be given at intervals of at least 6 hours if the response is inadequate or symptoms recur. No more than 3 doses should be administered within any 24-hour period.

- **Administration instructions**: Before administration, inspect the icatibant injection visually for any particulate matter and discoloration. The solution should be clear and colorless; do not administer if particulates are present or if the solution is discolored. Use the provided 25-gauge needle, attaching it securely to the syringe hub, and do not use a different needle. Disinfect the injection site thoroughly and administer the icatibant injection subcutaneously over at least 30 seconds.

Patients can self-administer the icatibant injection after receiving training under healthcare professional guidance upon recognizing symptoms of an HAE attack [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Novel surfactant administration techniques: Will they change outcome [^115zzzpT]. Neonatology (2019). Low credibility.

Traditionally, surfactant has been administered to preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome via an endotracheal tube and in conjunction with mechanical ventilation. However, negative consequences of mechanical ventilation, such as pneumothorax and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are well known. In order to provide the benefits of surfactant administration without the negative effects of mechanical ventilation, several methods of less invasive surfactant administration have been developed. These methods include InSurE (intubate, surfactant, extubate), pharyngeal administration, laryngeal mask administration, aerosolized surfactant administration, and thin catheter administration (TCA). Of these, TCA has been studied most extensively and holds the most promise as a less invasive and effective mode of surfactant administration to preterm infants. Further studies will aid in determining which patients would benefit most from less invasive surfactant administration.

### Do stimulants reduce the risk for cigarette smoking in youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder? A prospective, long-term, open-label study of extended-release methylphenidate [^112B9DYj]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Although attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a well-known risk factor for cigarette smoking, prospective studies aimed at reducing smoking risk in this population are critically needed.

This was a 2-year, prospective, open-label clinical trial of extended-release methylphenidate for smoking prevention in adolescents with ADHD (n = 154). Smoking outcomes were assessed with the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire. Comparisons were made using data from a historical, naturalistic sample of ADHD (n = 103) and non-ADHD comparators (n = 188) of similar age and sex, assessed with the same assessment battery as that used in subjects participating in the clinical trial.

The smoking rate at endpoint (mean, 10 months of methylphenidate treatment) was low in the clinical trial subjects and not significantly different from that in the non-ADHD comparators or the ADHD comparators receiving stimulants naturalistically (7.1% vs. 8.0% vs. 10.9%; P > .20). In contrast, the smoking rate was significantly lower in the clinical trial subjects than in the naturalistic sample of ADHD comparators who were not receiving stimulant treatment (7.1% vs. 19.6%; p = 0.009), adjusting for comorbid conduct disorder and alcohol and drug abuse.

Although considered preliminary until replicated in future randomized clinical trials, the findings from this single-site, open-label study suggest that stimulant treatment may contribute to a decreased risk for smoking in adolescents with ADHD. If confirmed, this finding would have significant implications.

### Pharmacotherapy for stimulant-related disorders [^112Wfg2q]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Stimulant-related disorders (SRD) continue to be an important public health problem for which there are presently no approved pharmacotherapies. Although behavioral interventions provide some benefit, response varies. The development of novel and effective pharmacotherapies continues to be a research priority. Understanding neural mechanisms critical to the action of stimulants has helped reveal several potential pharmacotherapies that have already shown promise in controlled clinical trials. Common to some of these medications is the ability to reverse neural deficits in individuals with SRD. Results from thoroughly conducted clinical trials continue to broaden our knowledge, increasing the possibility of soon developing effective pharmacotherapies for SRD.

### 2023 Canadian Thoracic Society guideline on pharmacotherapy in patients with stable COPD [^112Ahr3E]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

In regard to medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically concerning combination therapy, the CTS 2023 guidelines recommend preferring ICS/LABA dual therapy over as-needed short-acting β-agonist and LABA monotherapy. This recommendation aims to prevent acute exacerbations in patients at high risk of COPD exacerbations.

### Amphetamine, past and present — a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^115ASxmG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Amphetamines, including racemic amphetamine, d-amphetamine, and methamphetamine, were widely used to promote wakefulness during World War II. This led to a substantial increase in production, resulting in large surpluses of these drugs after the war. Consequently, much of these stocks infiltrated the black market. By the 1950s, d-amphetamine abuse became recognized. In a classic study from that period, Connell from the Institute of Psychiatry reported on heavy d-amphetamine users who developed paranoia. This study highlighted the potential psychiatric dangers of d-amphetamine, possibly discouraging prescribers from using it and leading them towards methylphenidate instead.

Furthermore, d-amphetamine was used as an antidepressant in the 1950s before the discovery of tricyclic monoamine reuptake inhibitors. There were cases of misuse by patients and significant diversion of the prescribed drug into youth misuse and/or abuse. These factors likely contributed to prescriber wariness regarding its clinical use. In subsequent years, local outbreaks of d-amphetamine abuse occurred in various parts of the UK, often involving locally synthesized d-amphetamine, which again deterred doctors from prescribing it due to concerns over misuse.

In the United States, d-amphetamine-containing medications, especially MES-amphetamine, have been widely used to treat ADHD. Familiarity with prescribed amphetamines, alongside the increased availability of tamper-deterrent drug formulations designed to reduce the potential for abuse, such as Adderall, may help mitigate concerns about misuse.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^113oaxn7]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Medication management and dosing for ADHD

Whether a stimulant or a non-stimulant should be the first-line pharmacotherapy approach for managing ADHD in ASD depends on the profile of the individual patient. Methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine (AMP) are the first-line treatments for ADHD in typically developing children and adolescents. Clinicians can choose from among a variety of immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) formulations of MPH and AMP.

Non-stimulants such as α2-adrenergic agonists may be preferable for patients with significant behavioral or emotional dysregulation beyond ADHD symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbance, tics, or medical contraindications such as cardiovascular disease or low body weight that stimulants could exacerbate. Although FDA labeling on stimulants warns of their association with the onset or worsening of tics, a 2015 meta-analysis did not substantiate this relationship. Nonetheless, α2-adrenergic agonists, which are a first-line treatment for tics, may be preferred for patients with ADHD and co-occurring tic disorders.

### Inderalla [^113djQnT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inderal LA provides propranolol hydrochloride in a sustained-release capsule for administration once daily. If patients are switched from Inderal Tablets to Inderal LA Capsules, care should be taken to assure that the desired therapeutic effect is maintained. Inderal LA should not be considered a simple mg-for-mg substitute for Inderal. Inderal LA has different kinetics and produces lower blood levels. Retitration may be necessary, especially to maintain effectiveness at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval.

- **Hypertension**: The usual initial dosage is 80 mg Inderal LA once daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased to 120 mg once daily or higher until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 to 160 mg once daily. In some instances, a dosage of 640 mg may be required. The time needed for full hypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.

- **Angina pectoris**: Starting with 80 mg Inderal LA once daily, dosage should be gradually increased at three- to seven-day intervals until optimal response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond at any dosage level, the average optimal dosage appears to be 160 mg once daily. In angina pectoris, the value and safety of dosage exceeding 320 mg per day have not been established. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of a few weeks (see "WARNINGS").

- **Migraine**: The initial oral dose is 80 mg Inderal LA once daily.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (against) [^116Fmx6p]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Definition of terms is necessary to address the motion. First, "psychostimulants" are defined as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which inherently are short-acting drugs characterized by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of immediate-release formulations that act for a few hours. Sustained effects across the day can be achieved by controlled-release formulations, but positive carry-over to the next day is not significant, so on subsequent days, these medications must be administered again to reinstate pharmacological effects.

Second, "effective" refers to treatment-as-usual, whereas "efficacious" refers to enhanced or optimized treatment (that may set a maximum for effectiveness). The magnitude of effectiveness (e.g. small, medium, or large effect size) depends on who is treated, how treatment is delivered, what outcome is evaluated, and other factors (including treatment adherence and study design).

Third, "long term" refers to a given time frame (e.g. 1 year), which can be applied to specify the duration of treatment, length of follow-up, or both. Some studies evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment while it is continued, whereas others evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment during the follow-up after it is discontinued. Given these definitions, the following questions address the long-term effectiveness of stimulant medication.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly in patients with stimulant use disorder, the 2024 AAAP/ASAM guidelines recommend addressing ADHD symptoms as part of the treatment for substance use disorder in patients with co-occurring ADHD. Consider offering the following:

- **Psychostimulant medications**: Use to manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.

- **Non-stimulant medications**: Use to manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks.

- **Behavioral approaches**: Implement behavioral strategies as part of the treatment plan.

### Relexxii [^113GFfFX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In two placebo-controlled human abuse potential studies, single oral doses of another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were compared to single oral doses of immediate-release methylphenidate (IR MPH) and placebo in subjects with a history of recreational stimulant use to assess relative abuse potential. For the purpose of this assessment, the response for each of the subjective measures was defined as the maximum effect within the first 8 hours after dose administration.

In one study (n = 40), both the other formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (108 mg, which is 1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets) and 60 mg IR MPH compared to placebo produced statistically significantly greater responses on the five subjective measures suggestive of abuse potential. In comparisons between the two active treatments, however, the other formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (108 mg) produced variable responses on positive subjective measures that were either statistically indistinguishable from (abuse potential, drug liking, amphetamine, and morphine Benzedrine group [euphoria]) or statistically less than (stimulation – euphoria) responses produced by 60 mg IR MPH.

In another study (n = 49), both doses of another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (54 mg and 108 mg) and both doses of IR MPH (50 mg and 90 mg) produced statistically significantly greater responses compared to placebo on the two primary measures of abuse potential.

### Methamphetamine hydrochloride [^116A5bGV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets are administered orally. Methamphetamine should be given at the lowest effective dosage, with the dosage individually adjusted. Late evening administration should be avoided due to the risk of resulting insomnia.

- **Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity**: For treating children aged 6 years or older who exhibit a behavioral syndrome characterized by moderate to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity, an initial dose of 5 mg methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets once or twice a day is recommended. The daily dosage may be increased in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until an optimum clinical response is achieved. The usual effective dose ranges from 20 to 25 mg daily. The total daily dose may be divided into two doses taken throughout the day. Whenever feasible, drug administration should be paused occasionally to evaluate whether the recurrence of behavioral symptoms necessitates continued therapy.

### Medical and nonmedical use of prescription stimulants: results from a national multicohort study [^114NJvyc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). High credibility.

To examine the lifetime prevalence of medical and nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (e.g. Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin, Dexedrine) among high school seniors in the United States, and to assess substance use behaviors (i.e. cigarette smoking, binge drinking, marijuana, and other drug use) based on lifetime histories of medical and nonmedical use of prescription stimulants, nationally representative samples of high school seniors from the Monitoring the Future study were surveyed via self-administered questionnaires. The sample consisted of 4,572 individuals (modal age 18 years) from two independent cohorts (2010 and 2011) and represented a population that was 50% female, 57% white, 12% African-American, 13% Hispanic, and 18% other.

The lifetime prevalence of medical use of prescription stimulants was 9.5%, and the lifetime nonmedical use of prescription stimulants was also 9.5%. Among those who were ever prescribed stimulants, approximately 59.3% reported medical use only, 22.9% reported medical use before nonmedical use, and 17.8% reported nonmedical use before medical use. The odds of substance use behaviors generally did not differ between medical users only and non-users. In contrast, the odds of substance use behaviors were greater among nonmedical users only and medical users who reported any history of nonmedical use relative to nonusers.

About 1 in every 6 high school seniors in the United States has ever had some exposure to prescription stimulants, either medically or nonmedically. Health care professionals should…

### Methamphetamine hydrochloride [^113VjbSQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of the concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

- **Emergence of new psychotic or manic symptoms**: Treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania, can be caused by stimulants at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.1% (4 patients with events out of 3,482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses) of stimulant-treated patients compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.

- **Aggression**: Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment should be monitored for these symptoms.

### Methylin [^116K1i3u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warning: Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: Methylin has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Methylin, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing Methylin, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks, proper storage of the drug, and proper disposal of any unused drug. Throughout Methylin treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

- **See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning**: Methylin has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction.

### Zubsolv [^113JST79]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence, i.e. long- or short-acting opioid products, the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

- **Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products**: Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products may be induced with either Zubsolv or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. At treatment initiation, the first dose of Zubsolv should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, not less than six hours after the patient last used opioids, to avoid precipitating an opioid withdrawal syndrome. It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too-gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of dropout of buprenorphine patients during the induction period. On Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 5.7 mg/1.4 mg Zubsolv is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 1.4 mg/0.36 mg Zubsolv. The remainder of the Day 1 dose of up to 4.2 mg/1.08 mg should be divided into doses of 1 to 2 tablets of 1.4 mg/0.36 mg at 1.5 to 2-hour intervals. Some patients (e.g. those with recent exposure to buprenorphine) may tolerate up to 3 x 1.4 mg/0.36 mg Zubsolv as a single, second dose. On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 11.4 mg/2.9 mg Zubsolv is recommended.

- **Patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products**: Patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products may require different induction protocols.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^117Rwajw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Stimulants (e.g. amphetamine-based and methylphenidate-based agents) and non-stimulants (e.g. atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine) are licensed as pharmacological treatments for ADHD. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line treatment due to their greater efficacy. However, the recommendations from international clinical guidelines are inconsistent with respect to the order in which the stimulants should be offered, with some guidelines advocating for methylphenidate over amphetamines in children, while other guidelines make no distinction between the stimulants. The non-stimulant atomoxetine is recommended by guidelines as a second- or third-line treatment. As such, consumption patterns of different ADHD medications across geographical locations may differ but remain unclear.

We previously reported the prevalence of ADHD medication use in thirteen countries and one special administration region between 2001 and 2015 and found an increasing trend in all studied sites, with methylphenidate being the most commonly used ADHD medication in most countries. However, existing literature on global ADHD medication use beyond 2015, particularly from middle-income countries as well as geographical regions such as Africa, Central and South America, and Southern and Western Asia, remains scarce. A recent study examined psychotropic medicine consumption in 65 countries and regions and found that geographical locations and income levels are explanatory factors for between-country/region consumption disparities. Furthermore, guanfacine and clonidine were not licensed for ADHD in most countries.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^116ZHTCW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder**: Can I use doses of psychostimulants beyond the maximum licensed or recommended ones?

	- The maximum recommended doses of psychostimulants, which act by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine and, for amphetamines, inducing their release, for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in guidelines or formularies may be higher than the maximum licensed doses by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Agency. More specifically, the maximum licensed dose of methylphenidate for children (except for osmotic release and prolonged release formulations, see below) is 60 mg/day, while the British National Formulary (BNF) recommends a dose of up to 90 mg/day under the direction of a specialist.

	- For osmotic-release (Concerta® XL, Janssen Cilag, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK) and prolonged-release (e.g. Xaggitin® XL, Ethypharm, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK, and Delmosart® prolonged-release tablet, Accord UK Ltd, Barnstaple, Devon, UK) formulations of methylphenidate, the maximum licensed dose is 54 mg/day, but the BNF mentions a maximum of 108 mg/day for Concerta® XL, in line with other clinical guidelines, such as those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (caddra.ca). For lisdexamfetamine, both the maximum licensed and the BNF recommended dose is 70 mg/day.

### Amphetamine, past and present — a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^116Wkv7V]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

It is now just over a hundred years since amphetamine was first discovered. In that period, amphetamine has transformed from a drug that was widely available without prescription for the treatment of a broad range of disorders to being highly restricted controlled drugs that, in Europe at least, have all but disappeared from the formularies in many countries. The very clear links between molecular structure and pharmacological mode of action and, in turn, efficacy and safety in humans make amphetamine a textbook example of translational validity. The primary pharmacology of these drugs is not only responsible for providing efficacy in disorders such as ADHD and narcolepsy, but also for their spectrum of adverse events and liability for recreational abuse, making the balance of benefit/risk the key challenge in their clinical use.

Amphetamine ranks alongside methylphenidate as the most effective drugs available for the management of ADHD. The advances made in developing genuine once-daily medications have addressed some of the problems of therapeutic coverage while at the same time reducing the risk of diversion and recreational abuse.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^114NQAX5]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Research has continued to suggest that osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate lessens ADHD symptoms throughout the day and has greater adherence, thought to be associated with the convenience of once-daily dosing. Dexmethylphenidate extended-release (XR) and transdermal methylphenidate also offer this benefit. Dexmethylphenidate comes in capsules that can be opened and mixed with food and has the earliest onset of efficacy of the long-acting preparations. Transdermal methylphenidate bypasses the oral route entirely and, in short-term studies, is associated with efficacy throughout the day, improved family quality of life, and, when carefully titrated, little effect on sleep. Greater absorption of medication occurs when the patch is applied to the buttocks rather than to the subscapular area.

Comorbid anxiety was not found to affect stimulant efficacy in a recent study, and some studies suggest that treatment with stimulants can help to lessen the likelihood of other psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence, including cigarette use and substance abuse. However, meta-analyses of stimulants and other ADHD medications in the treatment of ADHD comorbid with tic disorders concluded that supratherapeutic doses of dextroamphetamine should be avoided in this population. These studies also indicated that methylphenidate gave the best control for ADHD and that α-2-agonists produced the best improvement in both tics and ADHD.

The most common side effects of stimulants (decreased appetite, trouble with sleep onset) have also continued to receive recent research.

### Strattera [^1153FnJM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study 2, a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, acute treatment study involving children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 (N = 171), participants received either Strattera or placebo. Strattera was administered as a single dose in the early morning and titrated on a weight-adjusted basis according to clinical response, up to a maximum dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day. The mean final dose of Strattera was approximately 1.3 mg/kg/day. ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly improved on Strattera compared with placebo, as measured on the ADHDRS scale. This study demonstrates that Strattera is effective when administered once daily in the morning.

In two identical, 9-week, acute, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of children aged 7 to 13 (Study 3, N = 147; Study 4, N = 144), Strattera and methylphenidate were compared with placebo. Strattera was administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon (after school) and titrated on a weight-adjusted basis according to clinical response. The maximum recommended Strattera dose was 2.0 mg/kg/day. The mean final dose of Strattera for both studies was approximately 1.6 mg/kg/day. In both studies, ADHD symptoms statistically significantly improved more on Strattera than on placebo, as measured on the ADHDRS scale.

Examination of population subsets based on gender and age (< 12 and 12 to 17) did not reveal any differential responsiveness in these subgroupings. There was not sufficient exposure of ethnic groups other than Caucasian to allow exploration of differences in these subgroups.

Only after all these aspects have been assessed, the prescriber should consider:

- **Second-line medications**: Atomoxetine, which selectively inhibits the norepinephrine transporter; guanfacine, that selectively stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors; or clonidine, that selectively stimulates alpha-2A adrenergic receptors.
- **Augmenting agents**: Guanfacine or clonidine XR.
- **Other agents**: Under specialist advice/supervision, for which RCTs provide preliminary evidence of efficacy (e.g. bupropion, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).

Does the concomitant use of cannabis impact on the effectiveness and tolerability of psychostimulants?

The evidence on the effectiveness of psychostimulants in marijuana users and the tolerability of the combination of psychostimulants and marijuana is limited. In a RCT of OROS-methylphenidate and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in youths with substance use disorder (in the majority of the cases (66%), marijuana), there were no significant differences in terms of efficacy between participants assigned to OROS-methylphenidate plus CBT and those in the placebo plus CBT, when considering the primary outcome (scores on the ADHD-RS completed by the clinicians). Even though ADHD-RS scores rated by parents were significantly lower in adolescents treated with OROS-MPH + CBT compared to those in the placebo + CBT arm at 8 and 16 weeks, the tolerability of OROS-methylphenidate was not substantially different compared to what would be expected with OROS-methylphenidate alone.

### Amphetamine, past and present — a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^116dWLbG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

The primary action of amphetamine is to increase synaptic concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby indirectly enhancing noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the CNS. Although amphetamine's isomers are also powerful 5-HT-releasing agents in vivo, this action does not appear to contribute to their efficacy in treating ADHD. This opinion is based on clinical experience with fenfluramine, a chemical analogue of amphetamine and a powerful releasing agent with a preferential action on 5-HT. It was reported that fenfluramine was not effective in treating disruptive and overactive behaviors in ADHD, nor did it ameliorate the conduct disorder present in about half of the subjects. However, it is possible that amphetamine's action to increase serotonergic drive may have a beneficial effect on anxiety or depression often comorbid with ADHD. Thus, enhanced catecholaminergic signaling is the primary mediator of amphetamine's efficacy in ADHD and narcolepsy. On the negative side, the same pharmacology is also responsible for amphetamine's major side effects and its liability for recreational abuse. Therefore, optimizing therapeutic efficacy while simultaneously maintaining side effects at an acceptable level is a difficult balance requiring careful dose titration in the patient.

### Treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with a stimulant transdermal patch: The clinical art [^111ZwRUz]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Stimulant medications, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, are the best-documented treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; however, their short pharmacokinetic and behavioral half-lives have historically produced irksome time-course effects. New drug-delivery systems, designed to eliminate the need for frequent dosing, include the methylphenidate transdermal system. This system utilizes the matrix as both the drug reservoir and the skin adhesive.

The methylphenidate transdermal system patch, in contrast to long-acting oral preparations, requires a paradigmatic shift in clinical thinking and refinement of clinical management skills. For dosing with this patch, clinicians must think in terms of a retrievable form of drug delivery (in milligrams per hour) rather than a fixed non-retrievable dose (in milligrams per dose or milligrams per day). Clinicians and patients can determine the optimal clinical dose by controlling two variables:

- **Patch size**: Controlling milligrams per hour.
- **Duration of patch wear**.

The new paradigm is worth learning because the patch offers several advantages over oral preparations for some patients, chiefly individualized control over effect duration, determined by when the patch is applied in the morning and removed in the afternoon or evening. Taking full advantage of this treatment option requires educating the patient and parents regarding the practical elements of daily use. These elements include patch-site selection, application techniques, and management of wear time to optimize the daily time course of cl.

### Ritalin [^114SZjx7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Ritalin has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Ritalin, can result in overdose and death; this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing Ritalin, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks, proper storage of the drug, and proper disposal of any unused drug. Throughout Ritalin treatment, reassess each patient's risk and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

- **Warning: Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: Ritalin has a high potential for abuse and misuse, leading to substance use disorder and addiction. Overdose and death may result from misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Ritalin.

	- **Before prescribing**: Assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with stimulant use disorder, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of extended-release formulations when initiating psychostimulant medications in patients with co-occurring ADHD. It is advised to maintain a level of monitoring that corresponds to the risk profile of the given medication and patient. This may include pill counts, drug testing, increased clinical contact, and more frequent prescription drug monitoring program checks (Clinical consensus, strong recommendation).

### Wainua [^11584sez]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dosage of WAINUA is 45 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once monthly. Administer WAINUA into the abdomen or upper thigh region; the back of the upper arm can be used if a healthcare provider or caregiver administers the injection.

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended dosage of WAINUA is 45 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once monthly. If a dose is missed, administer WAINUA as soon as possible and resume dosing at monthly intervals from the date of the most recently administered dose.

- **Administration instructions**: Prior to initiation, train patients and/or caregivers on proper preparation and administration of WAINUA. Remove the single-dose autoinjector from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to injection and allow it to warm to room temperature. Do not use other warming methods. Inspect WAINUA visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration; the solution should appear colorless to yellow. Do not use if cloudiness, particulate matter, or discoloration is observed prior to administration. Administer WAINUA as a subcutaneous injection into the abdomen or upper thigh region. The back of the upper arm can also be used as an injection site if a healthcare provider or caregiver administers the injection.

### Intuniv [^111i5ozn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush, chew, or break tablets because this will increase the rate of guanfacine release. Do not administer with high-fat meals due to increased exposure.

- **Dose selection**: Take Intuniv orally once daily, either in the morning or evening, at approximately the same time each day. Begin at a dose of 1 mg/day, and adjust in increments of no more than 1 mg/week. In monotherapy clinical trials, there was dose- and exposure-related clinical improvement, as well as risks for several clinically significant adverse reactions, including hypotension, bradycardia, and sedative events. To balance exposure-related potential benefits and risks, the recommended target dose range, depending on clinical response and tolerability, is 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day (total daily dose between 1 to 7 mg). In the adjunctive trial evaluating Intuniv treatment with psychostimulants, the majority of patients reached optimal doses in the 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day range. Doses above 4 mg/day have not been studied in adjunctive trials.

- **Switching from immediate-release guanfacine to Intuniv**: If switching from immediate-release guanfacine, discontinue that treatment and titrate with Intuniv following the above-recommended schedule. Do not substitute for immediate-release guanfacine tablets on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles. Intuniv has significantly reduced Cmax (60% lower), bioavailability (43% lower), and a delayed Tmax (3 hours later) compared to those of the same dose of immediate-release guanfacine.

Regarding medical management for hidradenitis suppurativa, specifically in relation to antiandrogen therapy, the BAD 2019 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the following agents in patients with HS unresponsive to conventional systemic therapy:

- **Cyproterone**: A medication historically used for hormonal therapy.
- **Ethinylestradiol with cyproterone acetate**: A combination often used in contraceptive pills.
- **Ethinylestradiol with norgestrel**: Another contraceptive combination.
- **Finasteride**: Typically used to treat conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia and hair loss.
- **Spironolactone**: Commonly used as a diuretic and for its antiandrogen properties.

### Evaluation of methylphenidate safety and maximum-dose titration rationale in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A meta-analysis [^1121eNFn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Evidence on the titration of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is lacking. However, this lack of evidence has not prevented medication guidelines from specifying apparently arbitrary dose limitations, which could discourage clinicians from titrating methylphenidate to higher and, perhaps for some patients, more efficacious doses.

- **Objective**: To determine the evidence on dose titration and adverse events associated with dose titration of stimulants for ADHD.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, and PsycINFO from 1806 through April 1, 2019, were searched to identify relevant articles.

- **Study selection**: The inclusion criteria were that (1) the study was conducted on children up to 18 years of age; (2) children had a diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or hyperkinetic disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases codes; and (3) the dose of methylphenidate was determined by titration.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: The PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity were followed. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Jadad scoring system. Statistical analysis was undertaken using a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The outcomes of interest were (1) the doses used in published clinical trials, (2) the clinical justification given by researchers for their selected dose range, and (3) the adverse effects associated with methylphenidate when the dose is established by titration.

### Daytrana [^115Aao2U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Transdermal administration of methylphenidate exhibits much less first-pass effect than oral administration. Consequently, a much lower dose of Daytrana on a mg/kg basis compared to oral dosages may still produce higher exposures of d-methylphenidate (d-MPH) with transdermal administration compared to oral administration. In addition, very little, if any, l-methylphenidate is systemically available after oral administration due to first-pass metabolism, whereas after transdermal administration of racemic methylphenidate, exposure to l-methylphenidate is nearly as high as to d-methylphenidate.

The mean elimination half-life (t₁/₂) from plasma of d-methylphenidate after removal of Daytrana in children aged 6 to 12 years and adolescents aged 13 to 17 years was approximately 4 to 5 hours. The t₁/₂ of l-methylphenidate was shorter than for d-methylphenidate and ranged from 1.4 to 2.9 hours, on average.

The maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) of d-methylphenidate were approximately 50% lower in adolescents compared to children, following either a 1-day or 7-day administration of Daytrana (10mg/9hr). Multiple-dose administration of Daytrana did not result in significant accumulation of methylphenidate; following 7 days of Daytrana administration (10mg/9hr) in children and adolescents, the accumulation index of methylphenidate was 1.1, based on the mean steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCss) relative to that anticipated on the basis of single-dose pharmacokinetics (AUC0-∞).

- **Food effects**: The pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic food effect performance after the application of Daytrana has not been studied.

### Amphetamine, past and present — a pharmacological and clinical perspective [^114TZsLt]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

In previous reviews, we have extensively described the efficacy and safety of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs used in the management of ADHD and compared the relative merits of each. This analysis has revealed that the stimulants, including amphetamine, are still accepted to be the most efficacious drugs available. Some attempts to introduce new medications, for example, guanfacine XR (Intuniv®), have been successful, but many other new pharmacological approaches have failed. On the other hand, innovations in formulation technology and drug delivery systems have significantly improved the clinical management of ADHD.

All of the stimulants have biological half-lives that require at least twice-daily dosing to deliver efficacy over 12–14 hours. ADHD is characterized by inattention, distractibility, working memory deficits, and impulsivity; therefore, individuals with this disorder are particularly unsuited to comply with rigid dosing schedules. Since amphetamine has a high liability for recreational abuse, placing medicines in the hands of children increases the risk of diversion/abuse. Alternatively, putting the drugs into the care of school authorities requires appropriate facilities for the storage of controlled drugs.

Administering a once-daily stimulant medication to a child or adolescent first thing in the morning under parental supervision relieves them of the need to take additional medication outside the home. This approach also eliminates the need for storage and administration of medication by school authorities.

### Treatment outcomes with licensed and unlicensed stimulant doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138w7NB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Stimulants, including methylphenidate and amphetamines, are frequently prescribed at unlicensed doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear whether dose escalation beyond US Food and Drug Administration recommendations is associated with positive risk benefits.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of stimulant doses on treatment outcomes in adults with ADHD, specifically analyzing whether unlicensed doses offer positive risk benefits compared to licensed doses based on averages.

- **Data sources**: Twelve databases were included, covering both published (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Sciences) and unpublished (ClinicalTrials.gov) literature up to February 22, 2023, without language restrictions.

- **Study selection**: Two researchers independently screened records to identify double-blinded randomized clinical trials comparing stimulants against placebo in adults aged 18 years and older with ADHD.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Aggregate data were extracted and synthesized using random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and network meta-analyses.

- **Main outcome measures**: Changes in ADHD symptoms and discontinuations due to adverse events were measured.

A total of 47 randomized clinical trials, including 7714 participants with a mean age of 35 years (SD 11), were included in the analysis. Of these, 4204 participants (56%) were male. Dose-response curves for methylphenidate indicated additional symptom reduction with increased doses. However, gains were progressively smaller and were associated with an increased risk of dropouts due to adverse events. Network meta-analyses showed that unlicensed doses…

### Type of medication therapy for ADHD and stimulant misuse during adolescence: a cross-sectional multi-cohort national study [^114LWWSS]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Important variables are also not assessed by the MTF, including other specific psychopathology and psychotropic medication use, ADHD symptom severity, specific stimulant and non-stimulant medication used to treat ADHD, and treatment response to ADHD pharmacotherapy. Future studies with an unmedicated ADHD control group would also help isolate the effects of underlying ADHD symptoms on PSM and illicit stimulant use. Similarly, the MTF does not provide data on aspects of medication treatment courses in adolescents, including treatment doses, patterns of medication discontinuation, transitions between stimulant and non-stimulant medications, and switching of medications within stimulant and non-stimulant classes (e.g. from a methylphenidate to an amphetamine formulation). Future studies are needed that include an unmedicated ADHD control group and that examine specific aspects of the pharmacotherapy course to better contextualize our findings and inform treatment planning. Finally, we could not determine the temporal order of ADHD pharmacotherapy and PSM and illicit stimulant use based on the cross-sectional design; thus, PSM and/or illicit stimulant use may have preceded initiation of non-stimulant and/or stimulant therapy.

In conclusion, after controlling for important potential confounds, any pharmacotherapy for ADHD is associated with elevated prevalence rates of PSM, cocaine use, and methamphetamine use, though we cannot rule out the impact of ADHD symptoms on outcomes. Indeed, we posit that these elevated rates are most likely a consequence of the ADHD symptomatology and not vice versa.

### Efficacy of a novel biphasic controlled-release methylphenidate formula in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study [^114KvSFj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new biphasic multilayer-release (MLR) methylphenidate formulation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study involving adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- **Method**: Adults aged 18 to 60 years with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD participated in a no-medication baseline week. Subsequently, they were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily MLR methylphenidate or a matching placebo. The patients underwent titration to achieve optimal effect over one to three weeks, followed by two weeks of treatment at a stable dose. The same titration protocol was applied with the alternate treatment. Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (Self-rated, CAARS-S, and Observer-rated, CAARS-O) were collected during weekly clinic visits. The study was conducted between October 2003 and April 2004.

- **Results**: Fifty patients were randomly assigned to treatment, with 39 being analyzed in a per-protocol population (23 men, 16 women; mean age = 37.9 years). CGI-Improvement scores for subjects taking MLR methylphenidate were significantly better compared with placebo (Global Improvement: 2.6 vs. 3.7; p = .0015). MLR methylphenidate also showed improvements over placebo on the ADHD Index T scores of the CAARS-S (12.2 vs. 5.4 [change from baseline score]; p = .0083) and the CAARS-O (10.9 vs. 6.6 [change from baseline score]; p = .1404). The most frequent adverse events for MLR methylphenidate compared to placebo were headache (26% and 24%, respectively), anorexia (22% and 6%), insomnia (22% and 8%), nervousness (20% and 4%), and nausea (16% and 8%).

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^116v9LBR]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

When an individual has a diagnosis of both ADHD and ASD, the trigger point for prescribing medication is when the ADHD symptom presentation is severe and/or associated with impairments that hamper personal, social, and educational development and achievement. However, given the substantial symptom overlap between the two conditions, when an individual (child or adult) presents with both, there is merit in commencing with psychological/environmental interventions to treat the associated difficulties of ASD, monitor outcomes, and review the need for medication as appropriate.

In childhood and adolescence, should psychological/environmental interventions fail, then ADHD medications (stimulant and non-stimulant) are helpful for the characteristic symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity when these are clearly evident (e.g. distinguishing agitation for hyperactivity) and arise from ADHD. However, in adults with co-occurring ASD and ADHD, medication to treat their ADHD should be offered as appropriate, with regular monitoring, and should not wait until psychological treatment has been completed. This is especially the case where there is a shortage of specialized ASD/ADHD adult psychology services and where medication for ADHD may be a more immediately available treatment option. Medication for ADHD may also enable adults to better concentrate and maximize benefits from psychological treatment.

Prescribers need to be mindful of the presence of conditions or problems co-existing with combined ADHD and ASD and, if appropriate, prescribe medication; for example, melatonin may help.

### First-generation antipsychotics are often prescribed in the emergency department but are often not administered with adjunctive medications [^112syZLM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) have long been used in the emergency department (ED) to treat acute agitation, little is known about how these medications are used in modern clinical practice. In particular, little work has been published about whether ED clinicians administer FGAs with adjunctive medications in accordance with expert guidelines or the prescribing practices of FGAs over time.

- **Objectives**:
	1) To provide a comparison of the frequency with which FGAs are administered with adjunctive benzodiazepines or anticholinergic medications.
	2) To analyze the prescribing trends for FGAs over time, particularly in the years after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black-box warning for droperidol.

- **Methods**: This is a structured review of a retrospective cohort of patients receiving haloperidol or droperidol in two EDs over a 7-year period.

- **Results**: Haloperidol or droperidol was administered on 2833 patient visits during the study period, with haloperidol being administered most often. Adjunctive medications are administered less than half of the time. The use of droperidol has remained relatively static, whereas the use of haloperidol has increased.

- **Conclusions**: First-generation antipsychotics are still widely utilized in the ED. When administered, these medications are used with adjunctive medications that may decrease side effects less than half of the time. Droperidol use has remained unchanged in the years after the FDA black-box warning, whereas use of haloperidol has continued to rise.
