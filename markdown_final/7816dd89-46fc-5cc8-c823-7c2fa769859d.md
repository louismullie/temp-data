## Question

A 62-year-old man with recently diagnosed immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis presents to clinic complaining of frequent episodes of dizziness and near-syncope when standing up. He reports that these symptoms have worsened over the past month, and he sometimes feels faint after getting out of bed in the morning. On examination, his blood pressure drops from 130/80 mmHg supine to 95/60 mmHg after standing for 2 minutes, with a compensatory increase in heart rate. There is no evidence of volume depletion, and his cardiac evaluation is stable. You suspect orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction related to his amyloidosis.

According to current guidelines, which pharmacologic agents should be considered for the management of orthostatic hypotension in this patient with AL amyloidosis and autonomic dysfunction?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacologic agents should be considered for managing orthostatic hypotension in a 62-year-old man with AL amyloidosis and autonomic dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and mechanism of orthostatic hypotension. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment goals and the role of nonpharmacologic measures. Next, I will review first-line pharmacologic options and their evidence base, followed by second-line and adjunctive agents. After that, I need to consider disease-specific nuances in AL amyloidosis, including cardiac involvement and supine hypertension. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with dosing, monitoring, and safety considerations, and I will double-check for any conflicting guidance that might alter the plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and mechanism. The patient has a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing, with a compensatory heart rate increase, which meets criteria for classic orthostatic hypotension, and the absence of volume depletion plus the context of AL amyloidosis strongly supports neurogenic orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic neuropathy from amyloid deposition, which is a recognized manifestation in AL amyloidosis and warrants targeted autonomic evaluation when needed [^11692Bba] [^1132ZTDm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before establishing goals. The aims in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are to reduce symptom burden, prolong standing time, improve activities of daily living, and mitigate falls, rather than to normalize standing blood pressure, and this should be pursued with a stepwise approach that prioritizes nonpharmacologic measures before adding drugs, with ongoing reassessment of benefit and tolerability [^112vR4vZ] [^114nQSqq].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic foundations because they meaningfully augment pharmacotherapy and should be optimized in parallel. Increased fluid intake to about 2 to 2.5 liters per day and liberal salt intake, often more than 8 grams per day, are recommended to expand plasma volume, along with waist-high compression stockings or an abdominal binder to reduce venous pooling, and physical counter-maneuvers such as leg crossing, squatting, and slow positional changes can improve orthostatic tolerance. I should confirm that these are instituted and reinforced at each visit [^113oZczM] [^117BWmPw] [^114CK3Ch].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic options and their evidence. Midodrine, an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, is FDA-approved for orthostatic hypotension and is recommended as first-line in multiple guidelines, with typical dosing starting at 2.5 mg three times daily and titrating up to 10 mg three times daily. It increases vascular tone and standing blood pressure but can cause supine hypertension, so the last dose should be at least 4 hours before bedtime and supine blood pressure should be monitored [^112Degxv] [^116ai4NL] [^1135g37L]. Droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug, is FDA-approved for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and improves symptoms and standing blood pressure in randomized trials, with dosing typically 100 to 600 mg three times daily during waking hours. Like midodrine, it can worsen supine hypertension and may be limited by headache, dizziness, and nausea, so bedtime dosing should be avoided and blood pressure monitored [^115XTRyF] [^114YSqAK] [^112t1QRW]. Fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid, expands plasma volume and is guideline-supported, but it carries risks of supine hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema, and may be poorly tolerated in patients with cardiac involvement or volume overload, so I need to use it cautiously and monitor electrolytes and volume status closely [^113H4BCD] [^111dQi2u] [^114z3oSf].

> Wait, let me verify the role of pyridostigmine because I recall conflicting data. Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is modestly effective in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and is less likely to worsen supine hypertension, making it particularly attractive when supine hypertension is prominent or when other agents are not tolerated. It is reasonable as adjunctive therapy or in milder autonomic failure, though it may be less effective in severe postganglionic lesions and can cause cholinergic side effects such as diarrhea and hypersalivation [^113w78XF] [^11715ibY] [^116W8XPo].

> I need to ensure I incorporate disease-specific considerations in AL amyloidosis. Autonomic neuropathy is common in AL and can drive severe orthostatic hypotension, and many patients have concurrent cardiac involvement that complicates hemodynamics and drug tolerance. In this context, midodrine and droxidopa remain appropriate first-line choices, but I should start low, titrate slowly, and watch closely for supine hypertension and edema, while fludrocortisone may be less suitable in those with fluid overload or restrictive physiology, and pyridostigmine becomes particularly valuable to mitigate supine hypertension risk [^11692Bba] [^114z3oSf] [^113P1d42].

> Let me consider supine hypertension management because it is tightly linked to orthostatic hypotension in autonomic failure. I should screen for supine hypertension at baseline and during therapy, implement head-up sleeping, avoid evening doses of pressors, and consider short-acting antihypertensives at night such as a nitroglycerin patch or clonidine if supine pressures are severely elevated, balancing the risk of worsening morning orthostasis. This trade-off requires individualized decisions and close follow-up [^112QoStC] [^112BtZbD].

> I should double-check dosing and monitoring details to make the plan actionable. For midodrine, start 2.5 mg three times daily and titrate to effect up to 10 mg three times daily, with the last dose at least 4 hours before bedtime and regular supine blood pressure checks. For droxidopa, start 100 mg three times daily and titrate every 48 hours to 600 mg three times daily as needed and tolerated, again avoiding bedtime dosing. For fludrocortisone, 0.1 to 0.2 mg daily is typical, with electrolyte and volume monitoring. For pyridostigmine, 30 to 60 mg two to three times daily is reasonable, titrated to effect and tolerability [^113sJq7p] [^1135g37L] [^112t1QRW] [^11715ibY].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite optimized monotherapy. I should confirm that we have maximized a single agent to the highest tolerable dose before switching or combining, and if monotherapy is insufficient, consider combination strategies such as midodrine plus pyridostigmine or droxidopa plus pyridostigmine, recognizing that evidence for combinations is limited and decisions should be individualized with careful monitoring for additive adverse effects, particularly supine hypertension and cholinergic symptoms [^114faSc3] [^111a69hZ].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy to ensure internal consistency. Nonpharmacologic measures are foundational and should be reinforced at every visit. First-line pharmacologic options include midodrine, droxidopa, and fludrocortisone, chosen based on comorbidities, tolerability, and the presence of supine hypertension. Pyridostigmine is a valuable adjunct or alternative, particularly when supine hypertension is problematic or other agents are not tolerated. Throughout, I should monitor standing and supine blood pressures, electrolytes when relevant, and symptoms to guide titration and minimize harm [^112vR4vZ] [^113H4BCD] [^113w78XF].

> Final synthesis: I recommend initiating midodrine 2.5 mg orally three times daily, titrating every few days to effect up to 10 mg three times daily, ensuring the last dose is at least 4 hours before bedtime and monitoring for supine hypertension and scalp itching. If midodrine is not tolerated or insufficient, consider droxidopa 100 mg three times daily, titrating up to 600 mg three times daily during waking hours. If supine hypertension limits therapy or if additional benefit is needed, add pyridostigmine 30 mg two to three times daily. Reserve fludrocortisone for selected patients without significant fluid overload, using 0.1 to 0.2 mg daily with close monitoring of potassium, edema, and supine blood pressure. Throughout, reinforce salt and fluid expansion, compression garments, and counter-maneuvers, and coordinate with the amyloidosis team to optimize disease-directed therapy and address cardiac involvement that may influence hemodynamic tolerance [^113sJq7p] [^115XTRyF] [^113w78XF] [^113oZczM] [^117BWmPw] [^11692Bba].

For a 62-year-old man with AL amyloidosis and autonomic dysfunction causing orthostatic hypotension, **midodrine is first-line** [^116EC8iK] therapy and should be titrated to effect while monitoring for supine hypertension [^1135g37L]. If midodrine is ineffective or not tolerated, **droxidopa is a reasonable second-line** [^115XTRyF] option with similar monitoring needs [^116ai4NL]. Fludrocortisone can be considered cautiously in select patients [^113JkzuQ], but fluid retention and supine hypertension limit its use in cardiac amyloidosis [^114z3oSf]. Pyridostigmine is an adjunct for refractory cases, especially when supine hypertension is a concern [^115Bx4sr] [^116W8XPo]. Nonpharmacologic measures (compression, salt loading, head-up sleeping) should be optimized in parallel [^112haZGA] [^1177HmZ9].

---

## Pharmacologic management

### First-line therapy

Midodrine is the **preferred first-line agent** [^116EC8iK] for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in AL amyloidosis. It is an alpha-1 agonist that increases vascular resistance and standing blood pressure [^113sJq7p]. Typical dosing starts at 2.5 mg three times daily, titrated to 10 mg three times daily as needed and tolerated [^116ai4NL]. The last dose should be at least 4 hours before bedtime to reduce supine hypertension risk [^1135g37L].

---

### Second-line therapy

Droxidopa is a norepinephrine prodrug approved for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^115XTRyF]; consider it when midodrine is ineffective or not tolerated. Typical dosing is 100 mg three times daily, titrated to 600 mg three times daily as needed [^112t1QRW]. Like midodrine, it can cause supine hypertension and should be titrated carefully [^116ai4NL].

---

### Adjunctive therapy

Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, can be added for refractory symptoms, particularly when supine hypertension limits other agents [^115Bx4sr]. It is less likely to worsen supine hypertension but may cause gastrointestinal side effects [^11715ibY] [^116W8XPo].

---

### Cautious use

Fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid, may be considered in select patients [^113JkzuQ] but is often limited by fluid retention and supine hypertension in cardiac amyloidosis [^114z3oSf]. If used, start low (0.1 mg daily) and monitor closely for edema and electrolyte disturbances [^112dabAo].

---

## Nonpharmacologic management

Nonpharmacologic measures should be implemented in conjunction with pharmacotherapy:

- **Compression garments**: Waist-high stockings or abdominal binders reduce venous pooling and improve standing blood pressure [^112haZGA] [^113P1d42].

- **Salt and fluid intake**: Increased salt (8–10 g/day) and fluid intake (2–3 L/day) expand plasma volume and improve orthostatic tolerance [^113oZczM] [^113AzFrc].

- **Head-up sleeping**: Elevating the head of the bed 6–9 inches reduces nocturnal diuresis and morning orthostatic symptoms [^1177HmZ9].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Regular supine and standing blood pressure measurements are essential to titrate therapy and detect supine hypertension [^1135g37L].

- **Electrolyte monitoring**: Fludrocortisone requires periodic electrolyte checks due to hypokalemia risk [^11715ibY].

- **Patient education**: Teach slow positional changes, hydration, and recognition of supine hypertension symptoms [^112vR4vZ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Midodrine | First-line | 2.5–10 mg TID | Supine hypertension |
| Droxidopa | Second-line | 100–600 mg TID | Supine hypertension |
| Pyridostigmine | Adjunctive | 30–60 mg BID/TID | GI side effects |
| Fludrocortisone | Selective use | 0.1–0.3 mg daily | Fluid retention, electrolytes |

---

Midodrine is **first-line** for orthostatic hypotension in AL amyloidosis, with droxidopa as a second-line option; pyridostigmine is an adjunct for refractory cases, and fludrocortisone is used cautiously. Nonpharmacologic measures should be optimized in parallel, with close monitoring for supine hypertension and adverse effects.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common problem among elderly patients, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While acute orthostatic hypotension is usually secondary to medication, fluid or blood loss, or adrenal insufficiency, chronic orthostatic hypotension is frequently due to altered blood pressure regulatory mechanisms and autonomic dysfunction. The diagnostic evaluation requires a comprehensive history including symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, careful blood pressure measurement at various times of the day and after meals or medications, and laboratory studies. Laboratory investigation and imaging studies should be based upon the initial findings with emphasis on excluding diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, amyloidosis, diabetes, anemia, and vitamin deficiency as the cause. Whereas asymptomatic patients usually need no treatment, those with symptoms often benefit from a stepped approach with initial nonpharmacological interventions, including avoidance of potentially hypotensive medications and use of physical counter maneuvers. If these measures prove inadequate and the patient remains persistently symptomatic, various pharmacotherapeutic agents can be added, including fludrocortisone, midodrine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and to make the patient as ambulatory as possible rather then trying to achieve arbitrary blood pressure goals. With proper evaluation and management, the occurrence of adverse events, including falls, fracture, functional decline, and myocardial ischemia, can be significantly reduced.

Orthostatic hypotension, a highly debilitating symptom experienced by patients with AL amyloidosis as a consequence of autonomic neuropathy, can be managed by adjunct supportive treatment, including wearing compression garments and medications such as midodrine or droxidopa. Although fludrocortisone may help some patients, it often causes fluid retention and is often not well tolerated.

Cardiac amyloidosis — volume management and guideline-directed medical therapy: Volume management is the mainstay of therapy in cardiac amyloidosis, and loop diuretic agents and sequential nephron blockade with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be considered. Thiazide diuretic agents such as metolazone should be used with caution due to risks including overdiuresis, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and kidney dysfunction, and in AL amyloidosis direct kidney deposition can impair kidney function and contribute to diuretic agent resistance. Expert consensus documents caution against the use of standard heart failure guideline-directed therapy; beta-blockers should be used with caution because even at low doses they can be poorly tolerated and discontinuation may improve outcomes. Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers may be poorly tolerated due to vasodilation, particularly with autonomic orthostatic hypotension, and data specific to cardiac amyloidosis is limited. A retrospective analysis observed benefit with spironolactone with a reduction in the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest. For sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitors in cardiac amyloidosis, there is insufficient evidence regarding their efficacy or harm.

Discussion

Determination of the underlying mechanism of syncope is critical for choosing an appropriate treatment and management protocol. A proposed diagnostic algorithm should include a detailed patient history and physical examination (including supine and standing BP measurements and an ECG; figure 1). If determination of the mechanism of syncope is inconclusive after initial examinations, then autonomic function testing is warranted.

Figure 1
Diagnostic algorithm and treatment options for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. BP, blood pressure; CHF, congestive heart failure; DBP, diastolic BP; HR, heart rate; MI, myocardial infarction; nOH, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; OH, orthostatic hypotension; SBP, systolic BP.

The underlying causes of nOH can be varied, and there are multiple factors to be considered in the management of nOH, especially in the face of comorbid conditions. A case report identified amyloidosis as a potential cause in a patient who presented with autonomic nervous system impairment and OH with systemic organ involvement including gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction. In two other case reports, patients with PD and cardiac conditions presented with dizziness, lightheadedness and fatigue, and were subsequently diagnosed with nOH. In one of these cases, the patient was initially suspected to have bradycardia because the symptoms overlap with those seen in nOH and was referred for a pacemaker before diagnostic testing for nOH was even considered. Thus, it is imperative for clinicians to screen for nOH when patients present with non-specific symptoms like dizziness and lightheadedness, even when there are other comorbidities present.

Autonomic function testing, including HUT, HR with deep breathing and response to the Valsalva manoeuvre, can determine whether orthostatic syncope is neurogenic in origin.

Although the standard supine-to-standing BP test is more commonly used and can be performed in many clinical settings, HUT testing on a tilt table has several advantages. When secured to the tilt table, HUT is markedly safer for patients who experience syncope on standing. Passive HUT eliminates the potential confound of compensatory muscle contraction, leading to a more sensitive test. Abnormal response to the HR with deep breathing test or to the Valsalva manoeuvre indicates autonomic dysfunction is likely causing orthostatic symptoms. In the current case, autonomic testing led to an efficient diagnosis of nOH, which allowed for implementation of appropriate pharmacological intervention.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common, often overlooked, disorder with many causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure. Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered, approach to arrive at an appropriate underlying diagnosis that is causing OH, treating accompanying conditions, and providing individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. We propose a novel streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH; review the relationship between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH; discuss OH-mediated end-organ damage; provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to guide clinical decision making and patient care; identify current gaps in knowledge and try to define future research directions. Using a case-based learning approach, specific clinical scenarios are presented highlighting various presentations of OH to provide a practical guide to evaluate and manage patients who have OH.

Heart transplantation — neurologic contraindications in cardiac amyloidosis: Amyloid polyneuropathy, if severe, may be a contraindication to heart transplant, and severe extracardiac amyloid organ dysfunction "should be considered a contraindication to heart transplantation (Class 2A, Level of Evidence: B)". For patients with significant neurologic symptoms, evaluation by a neurologist with expertise in peripheral neuropathy "is recommended". Generally accepted contraindications include "Severe peripheral neuropathy with resulting inability to ambulate (FAP Stage 3)" and "Severe autonomic dysfunction with" orthostatic hypotension requiring midodrine and/or droxidopa that cannot be weaned, malnutrition with "modified body mass index* < 600 kg/m²·g/L", and "Urinary retention requiring catheterization".

Case presentation

A 62-year-old man was evaluated for a 2-year history of syncope, collapse and fluctuating BP. His medical history included Hodgkin lymphoma, lupus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autonomic neuropathy, hypercholesterolaemia, hypothyroidism and orthostatic hypotension. He was being treated with gabapentin (300 mg, two times per day, saxagliptin (5 mg, one time per day (QD)), pravastatin (40 mg QD), levothyroxine sodium (100 mg QD), omeprazole (20 mg QD), prednisone (10 mg, every other day), midodrine (10 mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg two times per day).

At the time of his initial evaluation, the patient reported that his syncope was progressively worse over the past 3 months. Although his episodes of syncope were previously preceded by dizziness and nausea, they had begun to occur without warning. He also reported a 5-year history of orthostatic hypotension, with a supine BP of approximately 100/66 mm Hg and a standing BP as low as 50/40 mm Hg. His low standing BP and episodes of syncope persisted despite daily treatment with fludrocortisone and midodrine. Initial cardiac evaluation revealed a systolic murmur but was otherwise unremarkable. Other than OH, a clinical manifestation of possible cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, no other signs of autonomic dysfunction were noted during examination (table 2). Additionally, the patient showed no signs of hypovolaemia (ie, extremities were not cold, moist mucous membranes, no increase in urine specific gravity) or of amyloidosis (ie, lack of tongue swelling). Negative findings on serum protein electrophoresis and fat pad biopsy confirmed the lack of amyloidosis.

Screening for nOH

There is no standardized or recommended screening protocol for patients that present with symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Presenting symptoms and signs of OH include postural lightheadedness or dizziness, the sensation of blacking out, and falls with or without syncope. Less common symptoms include orthostatic cognitive dysfunction (executive function worsens significantly during the orthostatic challenge in patients with autonomic dysfunction, possibly because of transient frontal lobe hypoperfusion), mental dulling, generalized weakness, neck pain or discomfort in the suboccipital and paracervical region ('coat hanger' configuration — a manifestation of hypotension-induced ischemia of the strap muscles of the neck), or platypnea (dyspnea while standing due to OH causing inadequate perfusion of ventilated lung apices or ventilation perfusion mismatch). Thus, screening for nOH starts with questions to identify the symptoms of OH followed by measurement of blood pressures from the supine (or seated) to standing position (recommended specific technique for timing of blood pressure measurements is detailed below). It may be beneficial if screening questionnaires and blood pressure measurements are conducted by a qualified non-physician (such as a nurse) prior to the patient's visit with the clinician. Patients in the following five categories need to be routinely screened for OH:
Patients suspected of, or diagnosed with any neurodegenerative disorder associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Pure Autonomic Failure (PAF), or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB);
Patients who have reported an unexplained fall or have had an episode of syncope;
Patients with peripheral neuropathies known to be associated with autonomic dysfunction (e.g. diabetes, amyloidosis, HIV);
Patients who are elderly (≥ 70 years of age) and frail or on multiple medications;
Patients with postural (orthostatic) dizziness or non-specific symptoms that only occur when standing.

### Orthostatic hypotension: JACC state-of-the-art review [^116axeU7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent and disabling feature of autonomic failure due to both peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases. Community-based epidemiological studies have demonstrated a high morbidity and mortality associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. It is due to impairment of baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction of the skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulation and is caused by damage or dysfunction at central and/or peripheral sites in the baroreflex efferent pathway. Nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions may be implemented to ameliorate the symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and improve quality of life. Many patients will be adequately treated by education, counseling, removal of hypotensive medications, and other nonpharmacological interventions, whereas more severely afflicted patients require pharmacological interventions. The first stage of pharmacological treatment involves repletion of central blood volume. If unsuccessful, this should be followed by treatment with sympathomimetic agents.

### AL amyloidosis for cardiologists: awareness, diagnosis, and future prospects: state-of-the-art review [^112Drn85]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Because AL amyloidosis is very heterogeneous in its presentation, supportive care to help manage the many symptoms experienced by patients is critical. However, the heterogeneous nature of AL amyloidosis also makes standardization of supportive care very difficult. At present, there are no consensus standards for supportive care. Diuretic agents, β-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the principal drugs used to prevent cardiac failure among patients with nonamyloid cardiomyopathy. However, in patients with AL amyloidosis with advanced cardiomyopathy, hypotension is common, and β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are poorly tolerated and can be dangerous. These drugs should not be used for this group of patients except in very particular circumstances, determined on an individual case basis. Bradyarrhythmia may require implantation of pacemakers, but the role of cardiac resynchronization devices remains unclear. Hypotension can also severely limit hemodialysis, which is essential for patients with renal involvement. Management of autonomic neuropathy remains challenging. In addition, there is a huge unmet need for supportive care among patients with comorbid gastrointestinal symptoms, for whom the current drugs and dietary modifications are not sufficient.

Gaps in relevant endpoints

The primary endpoint preferred by regulatory agencies is overall survival. However, as many patients, especially those with minimal or no cardiomyopathy, can live for 5 years or longer after diagnosis, determining median overall survival requires very long trials, which proves difficult with a rare disease because of the paucity of patients available and delaying trial readouts. Better understanding from regulators is needed to accept surrogate endpoints such as the established criteria for hematologic response and NT-proBNP for cardiac response. However, outcomes that reduce comorbidities, reduce amyloid burden, improve organ function, or improve patient QoL are less likely to be accepted as primary endpoints for trials, even if they are clinically relevant. It is essential that this gap be addressed, and preferably eliminated, to ensure that the best treatments are available to patients.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^11762ZXh]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and peripheral neuropathies including amyloid or diabetic neuropathy. Due to the frequency of nOH in the aging population, clinicians need to be well informed about its diagnosis and management. To date, studies of nOH have used different outcome measures and various methods of diagnosis, thereby preventing the generation of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practices' when treating patients with nOH and associated supine hypertension. To address these issues, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation initiated a project to develop a statement of recommendations beginning with a consensus panel meeting in Boston on November 7, 2015, with continued communications and contributions to the recommendations through October of 2016. This paper summarizes the panel members' discussions held during the initial meeting along with continued deliberations among the panel members and provides essential recommendations based upon best available evidence as well as expert opinion for the (1) screening, (2) diagnosis, (3) treatment of nOH, and (4) diagnosis and treatment of associated supine hypertension.

Cardiac-Specific Treatments

Although light chain reduction therapy is the backbone to AL amyloidosis treatment, treating organ dysfunction in parallel is of great importance, particularly cardiac dysfunction, given that cardiac involvement is the primary driver of mortality in AL amyloidosis. Therapies can be grouped into medical therapy, arrhythmia management, and cardiac transplantation.

Medical therapy

Although no high-grade evidence exists to guide medical therapy in cardiac amyloidosis, generally accepted treatment principles are widely acknowledged. The mainstay of symptomatic therapy is volume management. Patients with systemic AL amyloidosis can be particularly prone to the challenging combination of hypotension with concomitant volume overload for the following reasons:
1 The presence of significant cardiac impairment due to: a. Poor ventricular compliance/diastolic dysfunction b. Reduced end-diastolic volume due to increased wall thickness
2 Coexisting renal (common) or hepatic (less common) amyloid deposition leading to reduced serum albumin concentrations, which can be severe
3 Concomitant autonomic dysfunction from amyloid deposition, leading to postural hypotension

Salt restriction and appropriate diuretic doses are essential for most patients, often best achieved by combining loop diuretics and aldosterone antagonists as allowed by serum potassium levels; in some cases, thiazide diuretics are necessary for sequential nephron channel blockade. If symptomatic hypotension limits the ability to achieve euvolemia, midodrine can be useful (particularly for patients with autonomic dysfunction); in select patients with severe nephrotic syndrome, intermittent albumin infusions may be necessary.

Standard systolic heart failure therapies are often poorly tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis with cardiac involvement. Both β-blockers and vasodilators (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers), in particular, can exacerbate the hypotension that is usually present for the reasons noted previously. Beta-blockers can also worsen bradycardia/heart block and blunt the compensatory tachycardic response to low stroke volume and/or vasodilatation from autonomic dysfunction. Digoxin has traditionally been considered contraindicated in cardiac amyloidosis because of the potential for tissue toxicity (from direct binding of digoxin to amyloid fibrils), although recent studies suggest that digoxin can be cautiously used in appropriate patients, particularly when needed for rate control of atrial fibrillation.

Amyloid neuropathy — management is organized into disease-directed therapy and symptom management. Disease-directed therapy lists TTR silencers to slow progression and/or reverse disease in ATTRv — patisiran, inotersen, and vutrisiran — and notes tafamidis not FDA-approved for neuropathy, TTR silencers are only FDA-approved for ATTRv disease, no evidence to date that carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal stenosis are impacted by disease-directed therapy, and vitamin A supplementation is required. Symptom management includes sensory neuropathy treatments (pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants), with the caution that tricyclic antidepressants may be effective but poorly tolerated due to risk of orthostatic hypotension, constipation, and urinary retention. For autonomic dysfunction, options include compression stockings and abdominal binders, increased salt/fluid intake, salt tablets, fludrocortisone, midodrine, droxidopa, and pyridostigmine, and all medications but pyridostigmine may be poorly tolerated in patients with cardiac involvement/restrictive physiology.

### Comparative outcomes of a transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy cohort versus patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction enrolled in the TOPCAT trial [^116hgiHe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Adequate management of heart failure symptoms in ATTR‐CM continue to be a challenge for a number of reasons. Diastolic filling is impaired due to the restrictive physiology in ATTR‐CM, and as a result, small increases in end‐diastolic volume can cause a rapid rise in intracardiac pressure. Neurohormonal blockade agents (ie, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers), are poorly tolerated in ATTR‐CM, and their use is often limited by orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction. Diuretics remain the only primary treatment for heart failure symptoms in ATTR‐CM without treatment options that induce favorable remodeling over time. The significant heart failure burden in ATTR‐CM is further demonstrated by Miller et al, who analyzed death rate data from the ATTR‐ACT trial, finding that the most common cause of death in this population was heart failure (56.3% of all deaths). In comparison, in TOPCAT, heart failure–related deaths accounted for only 12.7% of all deaths.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116W8XPo]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The collective evidence from six studies suggests that pyridostigmine can be an effective and safe option for certain patients with OH, particularly in patients with neurogenic OH. In most cases, pyridostigmine improved standing BP without significantly increasing supine BP. While methodological limitations in some studies call for further research, the overall findings support the consideration of pyridostigmine in appropriately selected patients. Future studies should focus on larger, well-designed trials to further validate these findings and explore the long-term benefits (> 3 months) and safety of pyridostigmine, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents.

Transthyretin amyloid neuropathy — therapy monitoring, approvals, and symptomatic care are detailed. Inotersen can result in injection-site reactions as well as thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis; because of this, platelet counts should be followed weekly, and serum creatinine and the urine protein-creatinine ratio should be followed every 2 weeks. Diflunisal and tafamidis are TTR stabilizers; however, although approved for ATTR-CM, tafamidis does not have approval from the FDA for treatment of ATTRv polyneuropathy, and diflunisal was demonstrated effective in ATTRv polyneuropathy to slow disease progression but is not FDA approved for this indication. Currently, there is no evidence that TTR stabilizers or silencers are beneficial in polyneuropathy associated with ATTRwt amyloidosis. For neuropathic pain, pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine may be beneficial, while tricyclic antidepressants may have increased side effects in many patients with amyloid neuropathy who also may have orthostatic hypotension or other autonomic symptoms such as urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, or constipation. Orthostatic hypotension may improve with increased fluid intake, salt tablets, fludrocortisone, midodrine, or droxidopa; pyridostigmine is another option without the risks of fluid retention or supine hypertension, and compression with knee- or thigh-high compression socks or stockings, and abdominal binders can be helpful without the risk of drug side effects or interactions.

### Conventional heart failure therapy in cardiac ATTR amyloidosis [^114tKUaZ]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

It has been well established that patients with ATTR-CA have a similar and possibly greater neurohormonal activation than is observed in patients with HF of different aetiologies. Furthermore, elevated neurohormone levels (specifically NT-proBNP and aldosterone) have been associated with a worse prognosis. It is therefore plausible that patients with ATTR-CA would derive prognostic benefit from neurohormonal modulation. However, a recent position statement by the ESC on the treatment of ATTR-CA recommended the withdrawal of beta-blockers, avoiding ACEi/ARBs, and did not discuss the use of MRAs in patients with ATTR-CA, reflecting the perceived poor tolerability of these agents and lack of trial evidence to support their use (and lack of differentiation between AL and ATTR-CA, the former having greater intolerance). Several small observational studies have contributed to these recommendations. However, differences in methodology and patient selection could explain our contrasting results. Previous studies have not matched patients, and therefore the worse outcomes in patients treated with HF medications were confounded by disease severity. Our study excluded patients with concomitant polyneuropathy, who often have autonomic disease and hypotension, resulting in a poor tolerance of HF medications. Importantly, our results are supported by a retrospective analysis of the TOPCAT trial, whereby an enriched cohort with echocardiographic characteristics of CA derived benefit from MRA therapy. This analysis is featured in a recent American College of Cardiology (ACC) consensus document that recommends MRA therapy alongside loop diuretics to augment diuresis. Our study is the first to sub-categorize ATTR-CA patients by LVEF. The majority of HF patients with a LVEF ≤ 40% experience chronic adrenergic overstimulation, and higher serum noradrenaline levels than their counterparts with preserved systolic function. A similar pathophysiological mechanism may exist in ATTR-CA, and therefore patients with a LVEF ≤ 40% could derive benefit from beta-blockade. Lastly, the majority were treated with bisoprolol (a cardio-selective beta-blocker), which potentially has a different haemodynamic profile to beta-blockers used in previous studies, while still providing neurohormonal modulation, and therefore, the observed benefit could potentially be confined to cardio-selective beta-blockers.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries.

Syncope is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery.

Standing for 2 to 3 min is usually sufficient to see the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope, however in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 min of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management (table 1). A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

Table 1
Potential causes of syncope

Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (eg, hypovolaemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope and falls. Neurogenic OH is commonly comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

In those cases in which the aetiology of a patient's syncope is unclear after initial evaluation and an ECG has ruled out a cardiac cause of syncope, referral for autonomic testing may aid in pinpointing the cause and guide decisions of the most appropriate steps in treating and managing the symptoms of the patient. In this context, autonomic testing should include continuous BP monitoring during prolonged head-up tilt (HUT) on a tilt table, HR in response to paced breathing and BP in response to the Valsalva manoeuvre. Decreased autonomic function, if observed, in this battery of tests indicates a neurogenic origin of OH and that the syncope is neurally mediated. Such a diagnosis should suggest a course of treatment.

When the cause of syncope has been identified as OH or nOH, pharmacological management of the condition may be necessary. Droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug, is the only drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat symptoms of nOH in adults, whereas midodrine, an alpha−1 adrenergic agonist, is approved to treat symptoms of OH.

Supine hypertension associated with nOH

It is critical for clinicians to understand the physiology underlying both nOH and supine hypertension and the associated risks of each when they manage patients with nOH. Neurogenic OH is associated with loss of baroreflex function that normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Therefore, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically have nOH and supine hypertension. In addition to supine hypertension being common in patients with nOH, many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension. Because OH/nOH and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, improving one can worsen the other. Thus, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension. There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some clinicians may not treat nOH for fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH while accepting the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-PD patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent potential major health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations can be made in multiple system atrophy. In contrast, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

HF management

Individualization of therapeutic strategies to treat HF is an important concept in patients with cardiac amyloidosis (Figure 1). The mainstay of symptomatic management remains the control of volume intake and administration of diuretics, in large part to target dyspnea and edema, which promotes enhanced exercise tolerance. Furthermore, by relieving intestinal congestion we can promote enhanced appetite, address early satiety and weight loss which can lead to cachexia. Patients with ATTR-CM require higher filling pressures to maintain cardiac output and are prone to organ hypoperfusion with aggressive diuresis which often manifests as acute kidney injury, necessitating judicious use of loop diuretics. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors appear to be well-tolerated in ATTR-CM, enhancing loop diuretic response and volume status, and their use is associated with a reduced risk of HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. Fatigue is a universal complaint in this patient population, which may be exacerbated by HF therapies. Beta-blockers can be considered in the right patients with cardiac amyloidosis but need to be considered in the context of other comorbidities and risk of hemodynamic intolerance and bradycardia;, however there is a subset who may derive benefit from continued, low-dose beta-blockade. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are synergistic with loop diuretics, promote potassium sparing, and may be associated with improved outcomes, while angiotensin-converting enzyme (inhibitor)/angiotensin II receptor blocker/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor should be used with caution due to their propensity to induce or worsen hypotension, orthostasis, and exacerbate falls. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension may occur, particularly in ATTRv and may benefit from treatment with midodrine, droxidopa, and compression hosiery, in addition to referral to neurology for assessment. Note that although drugs like midodrine are relatively contraindicated in HF, they are recommended in cases of ATTR-CM where patients remain hypotensive despite cessation of antihypertensive agents. Newly prescribed agents should be initiated at a low dose and titrated slowly. Attention should be paid to correcting iron deficiency, and consideration given to invasive hemodynamic monitoring, permanent pacemaker implantation, or cardiac resynchronization therapy, where appropriate.

Cardiac amyloidosis — arrhythmia management considerations: The most common tachyarrhythmia in this disorder is atrial arrhythmia, and rate control using AV nodal blocking agents can be especially challenging in the face of the relative hypotension and impairment in compensatory vasoreactivity that is commonly seen with widespread systemic and autonomic involvement. AV nodal ablation has been evaluated and appears to be a reasonable consideration in more resistant and symptomatic cases, but extensive substrate abnormalities are common and results from atrial fibrillation ablation are less than ideal. Frequent ectopy with NSVT is the most common ventricular dysrhythmia, yet neither burden of ectopy nor NSVT appears to predict SCD, and whether ICDs improve survival is not clear, with progressive HF and terminal pulseless electrical activity remaining a common theme; this situation may be different for patients with cardiac amyloidosis who have been successfully managed for AL-type disease and for those awaiting cardiac transplantation. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis remain at high risk for developing intracardiac thrombus and thromboembolic stroke; anticoagulation needs to be carefully considered even in the absence of atrial arrhythmias.

Neurologic evaluation in amyloidosis — amyloid polyneuropathy presents with sensory symptoms, motor loss, and autonomic dysfunction; examination and confirmatory testing are outlined, and important distinctions are noted. Sensory symptoms include numbness/pain in feet, inability to sense pain/temperature, and impaired balance/falls; motor loss includes tripping, foot drop, and difficulty with stairs, usually after sensory symptoms; autonomic dysfunction includes orthostatic hypotension, diarrhea/constipation, urinary retention, and erectile dysfunction. Physical examination may show muscle weakness, distal sensory loss, reduced or absent reflexes, and a wide-based unsteady gait. Confirmatory testing includes electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and optional skin biopsy for epidermal nerve fiber density or sweat gland nerve fiber density with amyloid staining. Conventional nerve conduction studies will not detect small-fiber neuropathy, and carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and lumbosacral radiculopathy are manifestations distinct from polyneuropathy.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: a hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogenous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical and delayed OH as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods and more effective therapeutic modalities.

Autonomic nervous system

Autonomic neuropathy is more frequently seen in ATTRv and AL, manifesting as orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction, or dyshidrosis (Central Illustration). Orthostatic hypotension is a significant risk factor for falls, which can contribute to overall frailty. Autonomic dysfunction that affects the GI tract may also lead to malnutrition and reduced muscle mass.

Gastrointestinal system

GI issues can be due to direct involvement of the autonomic nervous system in specific variants of ATTRv; patients complain of a large spectrum of disabling symptoms that are mostly attributable to reduced upper and lower GI motor function (eg, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and diarrhea; Central Illustration). Like the neurological manifestations of ATTR, however, there is also a significant indirect effect of ATTRwt. As ATTR-CM advances and HF symptoms worsen, patients frequently develop edema of the GI tract, resulting in malabsorption and cardiac cachexia, contributing to frailty. Increasing diuretic requirements may lead to constipation. The modified body mass index (mBMI) is a useful metric for GI manifestations. mBMI is the product of body mass index and serum albumin concentration, which is intended to adjust nutritional status, fluid retention and can be tracked longitudinally.

Skeletal muscle

Loss of muscle mass is frequently identified in patients with ATTR (Central Illustration). Whether there is a direct effect of amyloid on the skeletal muscle is under investigation. Again, HF has a significant impact on skeletal muscle mass and function. Promoting factors for loss of muscle mass and performance, including high levels of inflammatory cytokines, low levels of anabolic hormones, micronutrient deficiencies, and physical inactivity, are prevalent in both frailty and HF.

Key points

- Amyloidosis may have cardiac, neurological, autonomic, renal, GI, psychological, or other sequelae.
- Amyloidosis that affects the autonomic nervous system may result in postural instability and falls.

A 62-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of syncope, collapse and fluctuating blood pressure (BP). His medications included midodrine (10mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1mg, two times per day), but neither treatment afforded symptomatic relief. Autonomic testing was performed. Head-up tilt table testing revealed a supine BP of 112/68mm Hg (heart rate, 74 beats per minute (bpm)) after 6min, which dropped to 76/60mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2min of 80° head-up tilt. Findings from a heart rate with deep breathing test and a Valsalva test were consistent with autonomic dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and treated with droxidopa (100mg, two times per day; titrated to 100mg, one time per day). After initiating treatment with droxidopa, the patient no longer reported losing consciousness on standing and experienced improvement in activities of daily living. These improvements were maintained through 1year of follow-up.

### Proposed cardiac end points for clinical trials in immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis: report from the amyloidosis forum cardiac working group [^1136YJ6k]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin Light Chain Amyloidosis and Cardiac Involvement

Immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare, multisystemic, and phenotypically heterogenous disorder, affecting cardiac, renal, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems to varying degrees in different patients. AL amyloidosis is caused by a monoclonal plasma cell disorder characterized by misfolding of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains which leads to aggregation and deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils in target organs. Deposition of amyloid fibrils in target organs and chemotherapeutic regimens to treat the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia significantly and broadly impact health-related quality of life (HRQOL). –

AL amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidosis seen in specialized centers with an estimated annual incidence between 3 and 12.7 per million person-years and annual prevalence ranging between 20 and 58 per million person-years. The median age at diagnosis is ≈65 years. The impact of AL amyloidosis is often devastating. For the estimated 76% of patients with cardiac involvement, the ability to perform daily activities is impaired both by symptoms related left heart failure (eg, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, progressive shortness of breath and pulmonary edema) as well as symptoms related to right heart failure (eg, hepatic and intestinal vascular engorgement and peripheral edema). Many standard treatments for congestive heart failure (eg, β-blockers, ACE [angiotensin-converting enzyme] inhibitors, ARB [angiotensin receptor blocker], and ARNIs [angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors]) are either contraindicated or poorly tolerated in patients with AL amyloidosis, especially at high doses. Cardiac damage may be irreversible and contribute to ongoing morbidity and mortality despite achieving a complete hematologic response. The median overall survival of patients with advanced cardiac involvement is < 12 months.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111xTLTn]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

An important consideration is that the outcomes assessed across the included studies mainly comprised changes in orthostatic BP drop or in orthostatic symptom score. Byun et al and Schreglmann et al were the only studies to examine pyridostigmine's effect on quality of life and neuropsychiatric functioning. Notably, no included study evaluated hard endpoints such as fall frequency, hospitalisations or mortality. The narrow focus on physiological outcomes limits the clinical utility of the data.

Of the six included studies, only two studies assessed the efficacy of pyridostigmine over a time period longer than 2 weeks, while no study quantitatively analysed the safety of pyridostigmine beyond 3 months. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyridostigmine in the treatment of OH over a longer time period. As symptomatic management encompasses more than just standing BP targets, outcome measures including fall frequency, hospitalisations, health-related quality of life and safety data should be included to provide a broader picture of potential morbidity benefit. As the largest sample size of the included studies was only 87 patients, lack of statistical power, particularly with respect to secondary endpoints, is a consideration in the interpretation of these studies. Moreover, several studies involved heterogeneous cohorts, which ranged in both underlying aetiology of OH and disease severity. Future research should include larger sample sizes or focus on a specific underlying disease aetiology.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113pcNNH]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well informed about diagnosis and management of nOH as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, while recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial: i.e. patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis, and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practice'. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons. The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is "… a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table". In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system that is characterized by failure to provide adequate autonomic postural responses, most prominently systemic vasoconstriction and a compensatory increase in heart rate sufficient to maintain blood pressure. This deficit is, in large part, attributed to insufficient norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. In addition, many patients with nOH also suffer from supine hypertension, which further confounds therapy because pharmacologic treatments to normalize standing blood pressure may worsen supine hypertension. Differences in study designs and endpoints, as well as a paucity of data, preclude achieving definitive evidence-based treatment regimens through a systematic review of trials. To move forward in an effective and safe manner, consensus is required on the basics of screening, diagnosing, and treating patients with nOH. Thus, an expert opinion statement to these basic approaches is needed.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) prevalence and treatment safety — OH "affects an estimated 7% to 10% of community-dwelling adults with hypertension, especially older adults", and "Institutionalized older adults (age ≥ 65 years) have a much higher prevalence of OH and are not included in the scope of these recommendations, nor are persons with neurologic etiologies of OH, such as Parkinson disease and other autonomic neuropathies". Although "OH is also associated with antihypertensive medication and specific classes of medication use", evidence from RCTs shows "no association between OH and intensive BP treatment using first-line antihypertensive medication classes", and "Because antihypertensive agents may sometimes unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic or other impairment, thoughtful assessment is warranted".

A 63-year-old woman with severe symptomatic postural hypotension was treated unsuccessfully, and no underlying cause was found for 3 years until she was noted to have hypoalbuminaemia and proteinuria. A renal biopsy led to the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Despite being an established cause for autonomic neuropathy, amyloidosis was not suspected early enough. Although a diagnosis was reached and treatment started, the patient died as a complication of chemotherapy.

### Midodrine for severe orthostatic hypotension [^115PzuNH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Midodrine (Bramox-Brancaster Pharma Limited) was authorised in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in March 2015 for "the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction in adults when corrective factors have been ruled out and other forms of treatment are inadequate".(1) Previously, midodrine had only been available in the UK as an unlicensed product used on a named-patient basis. It is the first drug to be licensed in the UK for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Here we consider the evidence for midodrine in the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension and how it fits with current management strategies.

### Management of supine hypertension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: scientific statement of the American autonomic society, European federation of autonomic societies, and the European Society of Hypertension [^112QoStC]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Supine hypertension commonly occurs in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure. Supine hypertension promotes nocturnal sodium excretion and orthostatic hypotension, thus, interfering with quality of life. Perusal of the literature on essential hypertension and smaller scale investigations in autonomic failure patients also suggest that supine hypertension may predispose to cardiovascular and renal disease. These reasons provide a rationale for treating supine hypertension. Yet, treatment of supine hypertension, be it through nonpharmacological or pharmacological approaches, may exacerbate orthostatic hypotension when patients get up during the night. Fall-related complications may occur. More research is needed to define the magnitude of the deleterious effects of supine hypertension on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal morbidity and mortality. Integration of more precise cardiovascular risk assessment, efficacy, and safety data, and the prognosis of the underlying condition causing autonomic failure is required for individualized management recommendations.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^114faSc3]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations for initiating nOH treatment

There have been no head-to-head comparison studies to guide the initial choice of nOH treatments. An individualized treatment regimen should consider severity, co-morbid disease (especially cardiac or renal failure), and treatment goals. Midodrine has an FDA-approved indication for the treatment of symptomatic OH; FDA approval was based on studies showing an improvement in upright blood pressure as a surrogate for symptom relief. In contrast, the FDA-approved droxidopa with an orphan designation for the treatment of nOH based on studies showing improvement in symptoms of nOH. Patients receiving droxidopa reported a decrease in dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling as if they might black out compared with those receiving placebo. There have been no long-term studies on the durability of the treatment effect for either midodrine or droxidopa. However, a long-term study is underway to study durability of effectiveness with droxidopa (NCT02586623) in patients with nOH for up to 36 weeks of treatment.

Recommendations for changing nOH treatment

Once initial therapy has begun, symptomatic benefit, including impact on activities of daily living, and changes in blood pressure need to be assessed frequently. If symptoms do not improve after reaching maximum labeled dose, it is recommended that the treatment be changed and symptomatic benefit be assessed once more. This process is iterative until either symptomatic benefit is achieved or maximum tolerable dose of the therapy is reached.

Treating nOH — step 4: combination pharmacotherapy

Little data exists to determine efficacy and safety of different combinations of therapy compared to monotherapy for nOH. Based on the experience of the consensus panel, the recommendation is to appropriately titrate to maximum tolerable dose of a single agent and then, if symptomatic benefit is not obtained, consider switching to a different therapy or adding a second agent and titrate from its lowest starting dose.

### Medical therapy and physical maneuvers in the treatment of the vasovagal syncope and orthostatic hypotension [^117KF1s6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can both present with pre-syncope and syncope resulting from systemic hypotension. While not directly responsible for increased mortality, both of these conditions can have a tremendous deleterious impact on the daily lives of patients. This negative impact can take the form of both physical symptoms and injury, but also a psychological impact from living in fear of the next syncopal episode. Despite these similarities, these are different disorders with fixed damage to the autonomic nerves in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, as opposed to a transient reflex hypotension in "neurally mediated" vasovagal syncope. The treatment approaches for both disorders are parallel. The first step is to educate the patient about the pathophysiology and prognosis of their disorder. Next, offending medications should be withdrawn when possible. Non-pharmacological therapies and maneuvers can be used, both in an effort to prevent the symptoms and to prevent syncope at the onset of presyncope. This is all that is required in many patients with vasovagal syncope. If needed, pharmacological options are also available for both vasovagal syncope and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, many of which are focused on blood volume expansion, increasing cardiac venous return, or pressor agents to increase vascular tone. There is a paucity of high-quality clinical trial data to support the use of these pharmacological agents. We aim to review the literature on these different therapy choices and to give recommendations on tailored approaches to the treatment of these conditions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (eg, counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Bortezomib [^114mj4eP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy

Bortezomib for Injection treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including ≥ Grade 3) during treatment with Bortezomib for Injection. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing Bortezomib for Injection subcutaneous vs intravenous, the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Starting Bortezomib for Injection subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or at high risk of peripheral neuropathy.

Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during Bortezomib for Injection therapy may require a decrease in the dose and/or a less dose-intense schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. In the Bortezomib for Injection vs dexamethasone Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study, improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 48% of patients with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy following dose adjustment or interruption. Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 73% of patients who discontinued due to Grade 2 neuropathy or who had ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the Phase 2 multiple myeloma studies. The long-term outcome of peripheral neuropathy has not been studied in mantle cell lymphoma.

5.2 Hypotension

The incidence of hypotension (postural, orthostatic, and hypotension NOS) was 8% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These events are observed throughout therapy. Patients with a history of syncope, patients receiving medications known to be associated with hypotension, and patients who are dehydrated may be at increased risk of hypotension. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension may include adjustment of antihypertensive medications, hydration, and administration of mineralocorticoids and/or sympathomimetics.

### A practical approach to peripheral autonomic neuropathies [^112q259X]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review focuses on the practical evaluation and management of patients with autonomic neuropathies.

Recent Findings

Autonomic neuropathies are complex disorders and result in diverse clinical manifestations that affect the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and sudomotor systems. The autonomic medical history is key when seeing a patient with suspected autonomic neuropathy. The history guides the clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and autonomic testing in patients with autonomic neuropathies. The treatment of autonomic neuropathies is based on the combination of disease-modifying therapies, symptomatic pharmacologic therapies, and nonpharmacological management. Response to treatment can be assessed with quantitative autonomic biomarkers.

Summary

Treatment of autonomic neuropathies should be individualized, guided by disease state, medications' mechanism of action and adverse event profile as well as cost. Genetic discoveries and pathologic understanding lead to the development of disease-modifying therapies as seen in familial amyloid polyneuropathy.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) epidemiology and treatment intensity — OH affects an estimated 7% to 10% of community-dwelling adults with hypertension, and institutionalized older adults (age ≥ 65 years) have a much higher prevalence; despite concerns about intensive BP treatment, evidence from randomized clinical trials demonstrates no association between OH and intensive BP treatment using first-line antihypertensive medication classes; because antihypertensive agents may sometimes unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic or other impairment, thoughtful assessment is warranted.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^113AzFrc]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — autonomic dysfunction (Table 10) assessment emphasizes history of current diet, fluid, and salt intake and medication use that may impact symptoms, heart rate (HR), or blood pressure (BP), along with sensory examination for small fiber neuropathy and the Beighton Hypermobility Scale; nonpharmacologic management includes to "Increase oral intake to 2.5–3.5 L of fluid and 2.8–4 g of sodium (ie, 7–10 g of salt) daily", use "Compression garments (waist-high stockings and/or abdominal binder)", perform "Physical counterpressure maneuvers to mitigate orthostatic intolerance", and it "May start with supine core strengthening or recumbent activities (eg, recumbent biking, swimming)". Pharmacologic considerations are to "Consider weaning/de-prescribing medications or substances that can worsen orthostatic intolerance, tachycardia, and hypotension", and that "Medication management should be strongly and promptly considered if symptoms are severe or persistent after a trial of non-pharmacologic measures", with "Consider IV fluids during symptom flare, sparingly and as needed". Referral is advised "To autonomic specialist, if: Non-pharmacologic and first-line pharmacologic management does not ameliorate symptoms", with triggers including "Frequent syncope" or when "Additional autonomic function assessment is warranted (eg, Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing test, QSART, skin biopsy for evaluation of small fiber neuropathy)", and "To general cardiologist, if autonomic specialist is unavailable and management is outside the scope of the clinician".

### Orthostatic hypotension in adults with hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1121VX2b]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Although orthostatic hypotension (OH) has long been recognized as a manifestation of autonomic dysfunction, a growing body of literature has identified OH as a common comorbidity of hypertension. This connection is complex, related to pathophysiology in blood pressure regulation and the manner by which OH is derived as the difference between 2 blood pressure measurements. While traditional therapeutic approaches to OH among patients with neurodegenerative disorders focus on increasing upright blood pressure to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion, the management of OH among patients with hypertension is more nuanced; resting hypertension is itself associated with adverse outcomes among these patients. Although there is substantial evidence that intensive blood pressure treatment does not cause OH in the majority of patients with essential hypertension, some classes of antihypertensive agents may unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic impairment. Practical steps to manage OH among adults with hypertension start with (1) a thorough characterization of its patterns, triggers, and cause; (2) review and removal of aggravating factors (often pharmacological agents not related to hypertension treatment); (3) optimization of an antihypertensive regimen; and (4) adoption of a tailored treatment strategy that avoids exacerbating hypertension. These strategies include countermaneuvers and short-acting vasoactive agents (midodrine, droxidopa). Ultimately, further research is needed on the epidemiology of OH, the impact of hypertension treatment on OH, approaches to the screening and diagnosis of OH, and OH treatment among adults with hypertension to improve the care of these patients and their complex blood pressure pathophysiology.

Orthostatic hypotension pharmacologic therapy — midodrine and fludrocortisone are described with dosing, effects, and supporting evidence: Midodrine is stated to be "a useful addition to the first-line treatment in patients with chronic ANF" and that "midodrine increases BP in both supine and upright posture and that it ameliorates the symptoms of OH"; "Midodrine (5–20 mg, three times daily) has been shown to be effective in three randomized placebo-controlled trials". Fludrocortisone is presented as "Fludrocortisone (0.1–0.3 mg once daily) is a mineralocorticoid that stimulates renal sodium retention and expands fluid volume", with evidence "from two small observational studies (in combination with head-up sleeping) and one double-blind trial in 60 patients", in which treated patients "were less symptomatic with higher blood pressures".

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111a69hZ]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies not supporting the use of pyridostigmine for OH

Randomised trials by both Shibao et al and Okamoto et al concluded that pyridostigmine (60 mg single dose) had no significant effect on OH compared with placebo. However, both trials included patients with severe autonomic impairment. While the average baseline orthostatic BP reduction was −44 mm Hg in Singer et al 's study, the baseline BP drop was much greater in both Okamoto et al and Shibao et al 'strials (−60 mm Hg and −62 mm Hg, respectively). As pyridostigmine amplifies the signal of preganglionic fibres, it is not surprising that the medication demonstrated minimal benefit in patients with severe autonomic failure, especially among those who had significant degeneration of postganglionic efferent fibres. However, combining pyridostigmine (60 mg) with atomoxetine has been shown to elicit a synergistic pressor effect, significantly improving standing SBP and DBP in patients with severe autonomic failure. This treatment strategy may be a useful pharmacological approach in patients who do not respond to monotherapy alone

Pyridostigmine with midodrine

Three studies compared the efficacy of pyridostigmine with midodrine for the treatment of OH. Singer et al reported a significant reduction in the fall of standing diastolic BP by pyridostigmine (60 mg) with 5 mg midodrine (27.2 mm Hg vs 34.0 mm Hg with placebo, p = 0.002). Byun et al similarly concluded that pyridostigmine (30 mg two times per day) had a moderate but significant effect in reducing OH symptoms, comparable to midodrine (2.5 mg two times per day). The mean decrease in orthostatic SBP and DBP fall in the pyridostigmine group was 7 mm Hg and 4 mm Hg, respectively. Limwatthana et al reported that pyridostigmine (30 mg two times per day) was superior to midodrine (2.5 mg two times per day) in reducing orthostatic SBP reduction in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (−6.43 mm Hg vs −19 mm Hg, p = 0.022).

### Fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension [^111dQi2u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Orthostatic hypotension is an excessive fall in blood pressure (BP) while standing and is the result of a decrease in cardiac output or defective or inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that increases blood volume and blood pressure. Fludrocortisone is considered the first- or second-line pharmacological therapy for orthostatic hypotension alongside mechanical and positional measures such as increasing fluid and salt intake and venous compression methods. However, there has been no Cochrane Review of the benefits and harms of this drug for this condition.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 11 November 2019: Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We also searched trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies evaluating the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone compared to placebo, another drug for orthostatic hypotension, or studies without comparators, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and observational studies. We included studies in people with orthostatic hypotension due to a chronic peripheral neuropathy, a central autonomic neuropathy, or autonomic failure from other causes, but not medication-induced orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension from acute volume depletion or blood loss.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane methodological procedures for most of the review. We developed and used a tool to prioritize observational studies that offered the best available evidence where there are gaps in the evidence from RCTs. We assessed the certainty of evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 13 studies of 513 participants, including three cross-over RCTs and 10 observational studies (three cohort studies, six case series and one case-control study). The included RCTs were small (total of 28 participants in RCTs), short term (two to three weeks), only examined fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension in people with two conditions (diabetes and Parkinson disease), and had variable risk of bias (two had unclear risk of bias and one had low risk of bias). Heterogeneity in participant populations, comparators and outcome assessment methods prevented meta-analyses of the RCTs. We found very low-certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone versus placebo on drop in BP in people with diabetes (-26 mmHg versus -39 mmHg systolic; -7 mmHg versus -11 mmHg diastolic; 1 cross-over study, 6 participants). For people with Parkinson disease, we found very-low certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone on drop in BP compared to pyridostigmine (-14 mmHg versus -22.1 mmHg diastolic; P = 0.036; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) and domperidone (no change after treatment in either group; 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). For orthostatic symptoms, we found very low-certainty evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo in people with diabetes (4 out of 5 analyzed participants had improvements in orthostatic symptoms, 1 cross-over study, 6 participants), for fludrocortisone versus pyridostigmine in people with Parkinson disease (orthostatic symptoms unchanged; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) or fludrocortisone versus domperidone (improvement to 6 for both interventions on the Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale-Orthostatic Domain (COMPASS-OD); 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). Evidence on adverse events was also very low-certainty in both populations, but indicated side effects were minimal. Observational studies filled some gaps in evidence by examining the effects in larger groups of participants, with more diverse conditions, over longer periods of time. One cohort study (341 people studied retrospectively) found fludrocortisone may not be harmful in the long term for familial dysautonomia. However, it is unclear if this translates to long-term improvements in BP drop or a meaningful improvement in orthostatic symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of fludrocortisone on blood pressure, orthostatic symptoms or adverse events in people with orthostatic hypotension and diabetes or Parkinson disease. There is a lack of information on long-term treatment and treatment of orthostatic hypotension in other disease states. There is a need for standardized reporting of outcomes and for standardization of measurements of blood pressure in orthostatic hypotension.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117EdaHs]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To date, little published literature is available on a "standardized approach" to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension. As such, the recommendations of this panel, which were based on the discussions and experiences of the panel along with evidence in the literature, should provide clinicians with a useful working approach to dealing with this complex condition. The panel recommended that additional study in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension is necessary. In particular, additional studies of the treatment of nOH should be conducted to refine the diagnosis and treatment algorithms and to provide definitive evidence of efficacy and safety of medications that are currently used, but not approved, for the treatment of patients with nOH.

### Redefining cardiac involvement in systemic immunoglobulin AL amyloidosis… [^113HJrpZ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This cohort study involved 560 patients newly diagnosed with systemic AL amyloidosis undergoing CMR with ECV mapping before chemotherapy. Of the different approaches used to define cardiac involvement, ECV mapping was the only independent predictor of prognosis and provided information on the relation between the depth and rapidity of hematological response and outcomes, with a rapid and deep hematological response being important in patients with increasing ECV. Meaning ECV mapping redefines the hematological response associated with better outcomes and has the potential to inform treatment strategies. Importance Cardiac amyloid infiltration is the key determinant of survival in systemic light-chain amyloidosis. Current guidelines recommend early switching therapy in patients with a nonoptimal or suboptimal response regardless of the extent of cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Consecutive patients newly diagnosed with systemic AL amyloidosis underwent echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, and CMR with ECV mapping at diagnosis. Data were analyzed from January to June 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes of the study were all-cause mortality and hematological response as defined according to validated criteria: no response, partial response, very good partial response, and complete response. Secondary outcomes were the depth and speed of hematological response and overall survival according to ECV. Results Of 560 patients with AL amyloidosis, the median age was 68 years; 346 patients were male and 214 female. Over a median 40. 5 months 9–58 months), ECV was independently associated with mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance This study found that ECV mapping, in systemic AL amyloidosis, is an independent predictor of prognosis, can help define the hematological response associated with better long-term outcomes for each patient and potentially inform treatment strategies. Systemic immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis is characterized by the production of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains by an abnormal clone of plasma cells that subsequently deposits within the interstitial space of multiple organs, resulting in progressive organ dysfunction.

1. Cardiac infiltration, present in up to 80% of patients, is the main driver for mortality, 2 with median survival ranging from 2 months to 4 years depending on cardiac disease severity. 3, 4 Serum cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography traditionally used to define the presence of cardiac involvement, 5–7 although prognostically useful, do not directly measure cardiac amyloid infiltration.

Study participants were individuals with systemic AL amyloidosis identified from a long-term prospective observational study of newly diagnosed patients conducted at the National Amyloidosis Centre, United Kingdom. All patients who underwent an echocardiogram, serum biomarker assessment, and CMR with ECV mapping at the time of diagnosis were eligible for inclusion. Before patients were enrolled, the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was confirmed by central review of histological material inclusive of Congo red staining, with amyloid subtype being confirmed by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies or mass spectrometry. All patients underwent comprehensive assessments, including electrocardiogram, echocardiography, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide measurements, and CMR with ECV mapping.

### Amyloidosis | NEJM resident 360… [^116suzVq]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published June 26, 2024 The survival of patients with systemic light chain amyloidosis is dependent on the severity of cardiac dysfunction at the time of diagnosis. Patients who receive a diagnosis late in the clinical course of the disorder have a median survival of 3 to 6 months, whereas patients without cardiac involvement can survive for many years. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Describe the pathogenesis of AL amyloidosis. A: Amyloidosis comprises a group of diseases triggered by the misfolding of a soluble precursor protein. This misfolding leads to the formation of oligomers, aggregates, and amyloid fibrils characterized by pleated β-sheets, which are deposited extracellularly in various organs and tissues. The result is progressive organ dysfunction, organ failure, and eventual death.

Organ dysfunction is due to the disruption of architecture caused by amyloid deposits, direct cytotoxic effects from protein aggregates or oligomers, or both. AL amyloidosis is associated with a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia and is caused by abnormal or excessive production of amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chains, which aggregate into oligomers and amyloid fibrils, leading to organ dysfunction. Q: Is systemic AL amyloidosis readily diagnosed. A: Nonspecific symptoms linked to AL amyloidosis often contribute to diagnostic delays. Consideration of AL amyloidosis is crucial in patients with unexplained proteinuria, restrictive cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy with autonomic features, carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists, or hepatomegaly without imaging abnormalities and in any patient with a monoclonal gammopathy or multiple myeloma with atypical manifestations such as macroglossia or raccoon eyes. A high index of suspicion is essential to prevent delays in diagnosis.

A: The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis requires evidence of amyloid deposits in tissue and evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Tissue amyloid deposits show green birefringence when stained with Congo red dye and viewed with the use of polarized light microscopy. Fine-needle aspiration of abdominal fat is a simple procedure that is positive for amyloid deposits in approximately 70 to 75% of patients with AL amyloidosis. Other tissues that allow for relatively noninvasive biopsy procedures are the minor salivary glands, gingiva, rectum, and skin. However, if the clinical index of suspicion is high and abdominal fat-pad aspiration is negative for Congo red staining, biopsy of an affected organ may be necessary to establish the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Examination of specimens from both abdominal fat and bone marrow biopsies identifies 85% of patients with AL amyloidosis.

A: Care of patients with systemic AL amyloidosis has undergone transformative changes, leading to marked, steady progress in outcomes for patients over the past four decades. High-dose intravenous melphalan and autologous peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation have been used as a treatment since the mid-1990s for selected patients with AL amyloidosis. However, only 10 to 20% of patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis are eligible for SCT because of factors such as poor performance status, advanced organ dysfunction, and multiorgan disease. The expanding therapeutic landscape is another reason for the limited role of SCT. Patients who are ineligible for SCT receive treatment with the combination of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone plus daratumumab, which is the preferred first-line therapy on the basis of the ANDROMEDA trial.

### Efficacy of treatments for orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review [^1128JS1i]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) affects up to 30% of adults over 65 and frequently contributes to falls and syncopal episodes. Current guidelines suggest a wide range of treatments, but systematic reviews of the evidence base for such recommendations are lacking.

Methods

we performed a systematic review to assess the evidence for all non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for OH. Our search included the following databases: MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; and the Cochrane library. We searched grey literature and references from included studies and other reviews. We included randomised, placebo-controlled trials, which measured postural drop as an outcome. Study quality was assessed using pre-specified measures of bias.

Results

overall, 36 trials (21 interventions) were included. We identified a heterogeneous population and a wide variety of study methods, precluding meta-analysis. Most trials were of poor quality with high risk of bias. Changes in postural drop and symptoms were frequently inconsistent. Compression bandages, indomethacin, oxilofrine, potassium chloride and yohimbine improved the postural drop. Several vasoactive drugs-including midodrine and pyridostigmine-improved the standing blood pressure, but overall worsened the postural drop.

Conclusions

many commonly recommended interventions for OH have a limited evidence base supporting their use. High quality, randomised, controlled trials are needed to underpin clinical practice for this condition.

### Prevention and management of adverse events of novel agents in multiple myeloma: a consensus of the European Myeloma Network [^117BLA3X]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of symptoms of PNP and neuropathic pain remains unsatisfactory and includes anti-convulsive agents (gabapentin and pergabalin) and antidepressants. Other agents, such as acetyl — carnitine and alphalipoic acid, have shown activity in treatment of chemotherapy-emergent PNP of other cancers. In case of neuropathic pain, the three-step ladder of pain management in cancer patients issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) should be followed. These recommend an escalating analgesic therapy that includes opioids, such as tapentadol for very severe neuropathic pain. Topical pain medications include lidocaine and capsaicin. Both, TiPN and BiPN, can also be associated with autonomic symptoms induced by damage to small fibers. These include orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, constipation, and bradycardia. In rare cases, the insertion of a pacemaker should be considered. Recommendations for orthostatic dysregulation consist of a combination of vasoconstrictor drugs, volume expansion, compression garments, and postural adjustment, together with reduction or discontinuation of any concomitant blood pressure lowering medication. Drugs such as midodrine, pyridostigmine, and fludrocortisone can be administered, and physical inactivity should be avoided.

Muscle cramps and seizures

Several drugs such as lenalidomide, thalidomide, PIs, and dexamethasone can induce subtle perturbations of muscle fibers and/or of neurogenic structures, but the detailed pathogenesis of muscle cramps is still unknown. Presently, specific treatment recommendations are not available. General suggestions include fluid hydration, normalizing magnesium and potassium levels, use of muscle relaxants, and moving and stretching the affected areas. However, the efficacy of these measures has not been ascertained in clinical trials.

Off-label use of FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension

Fludrocortisone

Fludrocortisone has been used off-label for many years for the treatment of OH/nOH, and even though the level of data supporting the use of fludrocortisone in OH/nOH is low, it is included in treatment guidelines based on expert opinion. It acts by increasing renal sodium and water reabsorption, thus expanding intravascular blood volume. Fludrocortisone's long-term efficacy, however, may be related to increased vascular resistance. Fludrocortisone is typically dosed at 0.1–0.2 mg/day with little benefit being observed with increasing the dose beyond 0.3 mg/day (and an associated increase in risks of side effects, including hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression). The onset of action occurs over 3–7 days. The main side effects of fludrocortisone include supine hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema. It should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure.

Pyridostigmine

Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that has been used off-label for the treatment of OH/nOH because it potentiates neurotransmission at peripheral cholinergic synapses including those in the sympathetic ganglia. Pyridostigmine is thought to work in OH by amplifying the increased sympathetic nerve activity in response to orthostatic stress. Therefore, it is likely more useful in less severe patients with residual sympathetic function, and has the advantage of not worsening supine hypertension. Typical dosing is 30–60 mg once to three times per day. Several small studies have reported a modest improvement in OH and orthostatic symptoms. Patients may experience adverse side effects associated with cholinergic stimulation, including abdominal cramps, diarrhea, sialorrhea, excessive sweating, and urinary incontinence. Many patients with nOH also have autonomic failure resulting in constipation and anhidrosis, so these side effects may be salutary for some patients.

Orthostatic syndromes — definitions and hemodynamic criteria — are specified as follows: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is "a drop in systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture"; initial (immediate) OH is "a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope"; classic OH is "a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture"; delayed OH is "a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop"; orthostatic tachycardia is "a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age)"; orthostatic intolerance symptoms "can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, OH, or syncope", and individuals have " ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture"; neurogenic OH is a subtype "due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system" rather than environmental triggers.

### ATTR amyloidosis: current and emerging management strategies: state-of-the-art review [^111ZPgSV]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

While there is a lack of data regarding the use of outpatient pulmonary artery pressure monitoring specifically in ATTR-CA patients, the benefit for reducing HF hospitalizations in other cohorts is well established. A remote monitoring–guided strategy may be effective in ATTR-CA patients because of the heightened need for fluid balance within a narrow therapeutic window.

Expert consensus documents recommend against the use of standard HF therapies in ATTR-CA. While many ATTR-CA patients may have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a substantial portion will have reduced LVEF. There are no guideline-based recommendations for neurohormonal antagonists, and most recommendations are based on expert opinion. Pressure-volume relationships in ATTR-CA show abnormalities in passive ventricular filling and altered ventricular-vascular coupling that reduce the ability of the left ventricle to perform work. The resultant lower stroke volume index is associated with greater mortality. Thus, beta-blockers may be harmful by further reducing cardiac output in ATTR-CA patients who are heart rate dependent, owing to a relatively fixed low stroke volume. Given their unproven benefit and potential harm, de-escalation of beta-blockers should be considered in those with symptomatic hypotension and slow heart rates. Beta-blocker therapy may be required for rate control of atrial arrhythmias, but the lowest effective dose is recommended. Concerns with other HF therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor-blockers (ARB), and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), relate predominantly to risk for symptomatic hypotension. However, data concerning the use of these agents and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are lacking in ATTR-CA. The use of standard HF therapy in ATTR-CA will evolve with more experience and diagnosis at earlier stages.

Treating nOH

Once a patient is diagnosed with nOH, the goal of treatment should not be to normalize standing blood pressure, but the principal treatment goals should serve to reduce the burden of symptoms (especially falls), prolong standing time, and improve the physical capabilities of the patient to restore independence in activities of daily living. A treatment algorithm for nOH that encompasses a 4-step hierarchical process is proposed (Fig. 2): (1) assessing and adjusting pre-existing medications, (2) utilizing non-pharmacologic approaches, (3) implementing single-agent pharmacologic treatment, and (4) with great caution, combining pharmacologic treatments. At each step, it is recommended that the patient undergo a 2-week assessment to establish whether sufficient symptomatic benefit has been achieved before moving onto successive steps. Each facet of the algorithm is described in detail below.

Fig. 2
A 4-step process for treating nOH

Treating nOH — step 1: review and adjust current medications

After establishment of a diagnosis of symptomatic nOH, it is imperative to first consider pharmacologic simplification by reducing or discontinuing medication that exacerbate nOH. One of the keys to initial success is to complete a comprehensive medication review so that adjustments in regimens can be made as needed. Many medications (including those commonly used for treatment of PD, hypertension, or bladder symptoms) can lower blood pressure and exacerbate the symptoms of nOH (Table 3). Discontinuation or dose reduction of medications which can potentially aggravate orthostatic symptoms such as diuretics, vasodilators, and medications with negative chronotropic properties such as beta blockers may be sufficient to resolve symptoms of nOH in some patients.

Once a medication review has been conducted, it is recommended that any planned changes be discussed with the prescribing clinician such as: taking the patient off a particular drug, lowering current doses, or changing the dosing schedule. While there is limited published literature supporting this recommendation there is strong expert opinion underlying this approach. Following each adjustment to medication, changes to symptoms of nOH should be assessed, and this can be accomplished by asking the patient to respond to the screening questions listed in Table 1.

Droxidopa

Droxidopa is an orally administered norepinephrine pro-drug that is converted into norepinephrine both in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues, including sympathetic peripheral nerve endings. Increases in circulating plasma norepinephrine levels peak at 6 h following treatment with droxidopa and levels of norepinephrine remain elevated for at least 46 h. Replenishment of neural norepinephrine is believed to be the primary mechanism of action for improvement of standing blood pressure with droxidopa. Droxidopa can be dosed from 100 to 600 mg three times daily during waking hours. A recommended dosing schedule would be at 8 AM, noon, and 4 PM. In the clinical trials, droxidopa was titrated every 48 h to either symptomatic benefit and/or intolerable adverse events. Clinically, droxidopa has been evaluated in Phase 3 studies and has demonstrated significant improvement in the symptoms of nOH such as dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, fatigue, and in improvements to activities of daily living. Additionally, in studies of droxidopa for the treatment of nOH, the rate of falls and fall-related adverse events demonstrated a favorable trend (but not statistically significant) in the groups of patients receiving droxidopa versus those receiving placebo. A post hoc analysis of the most recent study of droxidopa for the treatment of nOH showed that the group treated with droxidopa had 68% fewer falls than the placebo group (229 vs. 716). Droxidopa, like other agents to treat nOH, is not recommended to be taken within 5 h of bedtime to avoid the risk of supine hypertension. Side effects observed with droxidopa included headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and supine hypertension. Caution should be exercised in patients with congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166JKWw]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

OH has a prevalence of approximately 20% in the community, mainly targeting older people and is the most common cause of disability for patients with autonomic failure. Current pharmacological treatment options include medications that increase sodium reabsorption and expand circulatory volume (ie, fludrocortisones) and vasoactive medications (ie, midodrine). However, these approaches are not selective for body position, and therefore, come at the expense of increasing supine hypertension. As supine hypertension is already present in 50% of patients with autonomic failure, this side effect is often unacceptable and limits the utility of these medications.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we reviewed the evidence supporting the use of pyridostigmine in the treatment of OH. We found that the preponderance of evidence supports the use of pyridostigmine in the management of OH; however, the effect on standing BP may only be modest. Singer et al, for example, determined only a 5 mm Hg increase in their primary outcome of standing DBP when compared with a placebo. Although this small increase in erect BP may be sufficient to alleviate symptoms, particularly as patients with OH often have expanded cerebral autoregulation. Pyridostigmine may be less effective for managing OH in patients with significant autonomic impairment, especially among those with severe lesions to their postganglionic efferent fibres. However, combination therapy with atomoxetine may produce a synergistic effect, which could be harnessed for this patient population.

Orthostatic hypotension — pathophysiology and presentation are summarized as excessive venous pooling with impaired compensatory responses and characteristic upright-position syncope. OH involves excessive pooling of blood volume in the splanchnic and leg circulations, causing decreased venous return and cardiac output on standing. In neurogenic OH, vasoconstrictor mechanisms may be inadequate due to neurodegenerative disorders or autonomic peripheral neuropathies. Neurogenic OH may present clinically as classic or delayed OH, and most commonly OH is due to dehydration or medications such as diuretics and vasodilators, with syncope from OH occurring in the upright position.

Purpose Of Review

Supine hypertension is a common finding in autonomic failure that can worsen orthostatic hypotension and predispose to end-organ damage. This review focuses on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to manage hypertension in these patients in the face of disabling orthostatic hypotension.

Recent Findings

The hypertension of autonomic failure can be driven by sympathetic-dependent or independent mechanisms, contingent on the site of autonomic lesions. Management of supine hypertension should include simple nonpharmacologic approaches including avoiding the supine position during the daytime and sleeping in a head-up tilt position at night. Most patients, however, require pharmacologic treatment. Several antihypertensive therapies lower nighttime pressure in autonomic failure, but none improve nocturnal volume depletion or morning orthostatic tolerance. Regardless, treatment may still be beneficial in some patients but must be decided on an individual basis. Blood pressure monitoring is helpful in this regard, as well as titration of doses, as these patients are hypersensitive to depressor agents due to loss of baroreceptor reflexes.

Summary

Autonomic failure provides a unique opportunity to study blood pressure regulation independent of autonomic influences. Understanding mechanisms driving supine hypertension will have important implications for the treatment of autonomic failure and will improve our knowledge of cardiovascular regulation in other populations, including essential hypertension and elderly hypertensive individuals with comorbid orthostatic hypotension.

### Droxidopa for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^114YSqAK]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether droxidopa, an oral norepinephrine precursor, improves symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH).

Methods

Patients with symptomatic nOH due to Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy underwent open-label droxidopa dose optimization (100–600 mg 3 times daily), followed, in responders, by 7-day washout and then a 7-day double-blind trial of droxidopa vs placebo. Outcome measures included patient self-ratings on the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a validated, nOH-specific tool that assesses symptom severity and symptom impact on daily activities.

Results

From randomization to endpoint (n = 162), improvement in mean OHQ composite score favored droxidopa over placebo by 0.90 units (p = 0.003). Improvement in OHQ symptom subscore favored droxidopa by 0.73 units (p = 0.010), with maximum change in "dizziness/lightheadedness". Improvement in symptom-impact subscore favored droxidopa by 1.06 units (p = 0.003), with maximum change for "standing a long time". Mean standing systolic blood pressure (BP) increased by 11.2 vs 3.9 mm Hg (p < 0.001), and mean supine systolic BP by 7.6 vs 0.8 mm Hg (p < 0.001). At endpoint, supine systolic BP > 180 mm Hg was observed in 4.9% of droxidopa and 2.5% of placebo recipients. Adverse events reported in ≥ 3% of double-blind droxidopa recipients were headache (7.4%) and dizziness (3.7%). No patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with symptomatic nOH, droxidopa improved symptoms and symptom impact on daily activities, with an associated increase in standing systolic BP, and was generally well tolerated.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with symptomatic nOH who respond to open-label droxidopa, droxidopa improves subjective and objective manifestation of nOH at 7 days.
