## Question

Is ivermectin indicated for ANCA-associated vasculitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ivermectin is indicated for ANCA‑associated vasculitis and how this squares with current evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard therapeutic landscape for AAV, including induction and maintenance therapies. Then, I should verify ivermectin's recognized indications and whether any guideline or regulatory body mentions it for AAV. Next, I will review high‑quality trial data for ivermectin in adjacent contexts, confirm mechanistic plausibility relative to AAV pathogenesis, check pharmacovigilance signals for vasculitis, and finally synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion with caveats relevant to immunosuppressed patients who may need antiparasitic prophylaxis [^114s6e3F] [^111dBcvd].

> Let me first confirm the current standard of care in AAV so I don't jump to conclusions about off‑label ideas. Induction relies on glucocorticoids combined with rituximab or cyclophosphamide, and complement blockade with the C5a‑receptor antagonist avacopan is an approved adjunct in severe active GPA/MPA, with data supporting remission and renal benefits; maintenance commonly uses rituximab, azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate guided by consensus recommendations and recent BSR management recommendations, none of which list ivermectin as a therapy for AAV [^111dBcvd] [^111mirRJ] [^111sxpzw] [^111uaBYi].

> Wait, let me verify ivermectin's actual labeled and guideline‑endorsed uses before considering any theoretical application to AAV. Ivermectin is indicated for parasitic diseases and is recommended for scabies in European guidance, with FDA labeling focused on antiparasitic and dermatologic indications, but I see no AAV indication or mention in AAV guidelines or regulatory summaries, which strongly suggests no established role in vasculitis care [^11717UFv] [^111EXMPZ] [^114gqRrW] [^111k5q6K].

> Hold on, I should review the recent high‑quality ivermectin trials in COVID‑19 because that's where repurposing narratives originated; if those were negative, it weakens any rationale for broader immunologic use. Large RCTs (ACTIV‑6 and TOGETHER) showed no benefit on recovery, hospitalization, or death, and major guidelines advise against ivermectin for COVID‑19 outside trials, reinforcing that current evidence does not support anti‑inflammatory or disease‑modifying effects in immune‑mediated conditions beyond its antiparasitic action [^112YG4Ba] [^1121d97D] [^114L1nNX] [^114TWdZQ].

> I need to ensure mechanistic plausibility is addressed next. AAV pathogenesis hinges on ANCA‑mediated neutrophil activation with C5a‑driven amplification via the alternative complement pathway; avacopan's efficacy aligns with this biology, whereas ivermectin's pharmacology targets glutamate‑gated chloride channels in parasites and has only speculative in vitro antiviral actions without evidence of complement, ANCA, or neutrophil pathway modulation in AAV, making a disease‑modifying role implausible on mechanistic grounds [^114s6e3F] [^1156ZVAc].

> Let me consider whether ivermectin has ever been implicated in drug‑induced AAV, because if it triggered ANCA or vasculitis, that would at least flag an immune interaction; but wait, I should double‑check the known culprits. Drug‑induced AAV is classically associated with hydralazine, antithyroid drugs (especially PTU), minocycline, and levamisole‑adulterated cocaine, with supportive pharmacovigilance analyses and case series; Ivermectin does not appear on these lists or signal analyses, arguing against a pathogenic AAV link [^113E5JTa] [^113vsPxr] [^111HAXho] [^116jDnub].

> Next, I should review safety signals to see if any vasculitic patterns emerge around ivermectin exposure. Post‑marketing and case reports highlight rare severe cutaneous adverse reactions and occasional DRESS with ivermectin, but I find no signal for ANCA‑associated vasculitis in these datasets, which further suggests no direct interaction with the AAV axis has been observed clinically [^116EYdcx] [^117P2tHT] [^112cRCUZ].

> But wait, what if there is an indirect role around AAV care that I might miss if I focus only on immunology; for example, parasitic prophylaxis when giving high‑dose steroids. Yes, I need to check that. In patients at risk for Strongyloides who are about to receive corticosteroids or are profoundly eosinophilic, guidelines endorse ivermectin to prevent hyperinfection, which is a critical supportive measure in immunosuppressed AAV patients from endemic settings; this is not an AAV treatment, but it is an important, adjacent indication to consider in comprehensive care planning [^11624wHo] [^11592UcQ].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overreaching. The therapeutic standards for AAV emphasize glucocorticoids with rituximab or cyclophosphamide, with avacopan as an approved adjunct in severe active disease, and maintenance with rituximab or conventional immunosuppressants; ivermectin is not included in AAV treatment guidelines, lacks mechanistic plausibility for AAV, shows no efficacy signal in high‑quality repurposing trials, and has no pharmacovigilance signal for inducing AAV, though it remains appropriate for parasitic indications and prophylaxis in select immunosuppressed patients [^111dBcvd] [^111mirRJ] [^111sxpzw] [^112YG4Ba] [^1121d97D].

> Conclusion: I should be explicit here. Based on current guidelines, regulatory labeling, mechanistic understanding, and safety data, ivermectin is not indicated for the treatment of ANCA‑associated vasculitis; its role in AAV care is limited to antiparasitic treatment or prophylaxis in at‑risk patients undergoing immunosuppression, not as disease‑modifying therapy for vasculitis itself [^111k5q6K] [^111dBcvd] [^11624wHo].

Ivermectin is **not recommended for ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV)** because there is **no evidence of efficacy**, and it is absent from AAV guidelines. Standard care consists of **glucocorticoids plus rituximab or cyclophosphamide**, with avacopan as an adjunct in severe cases [^111dBcvd]. Ivermectin is used in AAV only to prevent Strongyloides hyperinfection when immunosuppression is planned [^11624wHo] [^11592UcQ]. No clinical trials or case reports support ivermectin for AAV, and use outside approved indications is not recommended.

---

## Mechanism of action of ivermectin

Ivermectin is an antiparasitic that binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels in parasites, causing paralysis and death. It has **no known effect on immune pathways central to AAV**, such as neutrophil activation, ANCA-mediated inflammation [^114KVCdZ], or complement activation [^114s6e3F] [^114u7duu].

---

## Current standard treatments for ANCA-associated vasculitis

Standard AAV care **uses immunosuppression to induce and maintain remission**:

- **Induction therapy**: High-dose glucocorticoids plus rituximab or cyclophosphamide.
- **Maintenance therapy**: Rituximab, azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil.
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Avacopan (C5a receptor antagonist) for severe active GPA/MPA with standard therapy [^111dBcvd].

These regimens are **supported by robust evidence and guideline recommendations** [^114s6e3F] [^114CeJ6y].

---

## Evidence regarding ivermectin in ANCA-associated vasculitis

There is **no clinical evidence** (RCTs, observational studies, or case reports) supporting ivermectin for AAV. No guidelines recommend its use.

---

## Safety profile and potential risks

Ivermectin is generally safe at approved doses, but **serious adverse reactions can occur** [^116EYdcx], including:

- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS [^112cRCUZ].
- **Neurotoxicity**: Seizures, confusion, ataxia.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis.

These risks are **significant**, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

No major rheumatology or nephrology guidelines **recommend ivermectin for AAV**. Its use is limited to approved antiparasitic indications.

---

## Ongoing or planned clinical trials

There are **no registered trials** evaluating ivermectin in AAV.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Ivermectin has **no proven efficacy** in AAV, whereas standard immunosuppressive regimens are effective and guideline-supported. Ivermectin's risks may outweigh any hypothetical benefit.

---

## Potential drug interactions

Ivermectin is metabolized by CYP3A4 and **may interact with immunosuppressants** (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus), potentially altering drug levels and increasing toxicity.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ivermectin is **not recommended for AAV** due to lack of evidence and potential risks. Standard immunosuppressive therapy remains the evidence-based approach. Ivermectin should be used in AAV only to prevent Strongyloides hyperinfection when immunosuppression is planned [^11624wHo] [^11592UcQ].

### The complement system in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: pathogenic player and therapeutic target [^114s6e3F]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of the complement system in the pathogenesis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), as well as the employment of complement inhibitors in AAV treatment.

Recent findings indicate that AAV has been traditionally considered a pauci-immune disease until new insights highlighted the pathogenic role of the complement system. The complement alternative pathway is crucial in AAV, and C5a appears to be a key molecule for AAV development. Avacopan, a C5a-receptor (C5aR) antagonist, has proven effective in achieving AAV remission and improving kidney function.

The increased circulating levels of some complement components, alongside the consumption of others in patients with AAV, suggest systemic activation of the complement system. Low C3 levels are associated with a more aggressive disease and a worse renal prognosis. In ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, renal deposits of C3d and properdin, which indicate local alternative pathway activation, correlate with glomerular crescents and proteinuria. The interaction between C5a and neutrophils triggers alternative pathway activation, underscoring the central role of C5a in AAV pathogenesis. Avacopan, a C5aR inhibitor, has displayed beneficial effects in AAV treatment and represents a promising therapy to achieve sustained remission and reduce the need for glucocorticoids.

Tavneos is indicated as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, which includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). It is used in combination with standard therapy, such as glucocorticoids. However, Tavneos does not eliminate the need for glucocorticoid use.

Furthermore, Tavneos acts as a complement 5a receptor (C5aR) antagonist to provide additional treatment support for those suffering from severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis, alongside glucocorticoids and other standard therapies. This medication does not replace glucocorticoid use in therapeutic protocols.

### Key advances in the clinical approach to ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1134WZJ3]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The updated nomenclature for vasculitis defines this varied group of disorders by aetiology, specific features of pathogenesis, and clinical symptoms; diagnostic and classification criteria for clinical practice are in development. Here, I review some important advances in the management of vasculitis within the category of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), which encompasses microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

The clinical approach to managing a patient with AAV should include testing for ANCA specificity. Proteinase 3 (PR3)-specific ANCAs are most often associated with GPA, whereas myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs are usually associated with MPA. Also important to the management of AAV is an assessment of the disease stage and severity, to enable tailored treatment based on an algorithm derived from controlled-trial data.

Remaining questions pertain to the dosage and duration of corticosteroid treatment, the selection of patients for, and the duration of, maintenance treatment after the induction of remission, and the identification of safer and more effective therapies than are currently in use. Outcome measures should assess not only disease activity but also damage and quality of life. Infections, cardiovascular events, and malignancies also contribute to outcomes, and their prevention should therefore be part of the clinical approach to managing patients with AAV.

This special edition reviews progress in understanding systemic vasculitis associated with autoantibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCA). European research groups have significantly contributed to this field, including the original observations linking ANCA with vasculitis. Areas of interest include classification and epidemiology, genetics and pathogenesis, disease assessment, histology, and long-term outcomes. Clinical trials conducted by the European Vasculitis Study Group have helped define the standard of care for vasculitis patients and provided a platform for exploring newer therapies. The prognosis of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis has improved due to better diagnosis and the development of consensus-driven, evidence-based treatment recommendations. The ANCA story exemplifies how a biomarker can influence a disease area, inspire research, and equip physicians with better tools for treating patients with these disorders.

### ANCA-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^111SfS3L]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

The failure of a patient to respond to induction therapy or to achieve a complete remission defines refractory disease. Alternative diagnoses, or the presence of vasculitis secondary to another disease process (e.g. malignancy, infection, drugs such as cocaine), need to be considered. Instability in the control of disease activity early in the treatment course is not infrequent and is managed by an increase in oral glucocorticoids or the use of intravenous glucocorticoids. Other options include combining cyclophosphamide and rituximab, introducing avacopan, or considering plasma exchange (PLEX). High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins have also been used, especially in the context of concurrent infection.

The first choice for maintenance of remission treatment after induction with rituximab or cyclophosphamide has shifted to rituximab from azathioprine or methotrexate. This change follows results from the Rituximab versus Azathioprine for Maintenance in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (MAINRITSAN) and RITAZAREM trials. These trials studied different patient populations and different rituximab doses. A dose of 500 mg every 6 months for 2 to 4 years is now recommended, although some patients may require a higher or more frequent dose. Extending the remission treatment period from 2 to 4 years has been supported by data with azathioprine and prednisolone from the Randomised Controlled Trial of Prolonged Treatment in the Remission Phase of ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (REMAIN) Trial and prolonged rituximab use in the Long-Term Rituximab Use to Maintain Remission of Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis (MAINRITSAN III) Trial.

### Update on systemic vasculitides [^114g6c93]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Management of systemic vasculitis has been revolutionized over the last decade with the introduction of targeted biological agents. With an increase in both the prevalence and the recognition of vasculitis, as well as the high cost of these agents, it is important to ensure their most optimal utilization. The goals of vasculitis therapy include the induction and maintenance of remissions, preventing relapses, reducing the toxicity of therapy with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality, as well as improving the quality of life of those afflicted. This review focuses on the recent advances in the diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of these conditions.

### Effect of ivermectin vs placebo on time to sustained recovery in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19: A randomized clinical trial [^112YG4Ba]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

The study ACTIV-6 (ivermectin) was published by Susanna Naggie and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to COVID-19 infection. The trial question was: What is the role of ivermectin in outpatients with mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 infection? The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, RCT. The population consisted of 1,591 patients (933 female, 658 male). The inclusion criteria included patients aged ≥ 30 years with confirmed COVID-19, experiencing ≥ 2 symptoms of acute infection for ≤ 7 days. Key exclusion criteria were a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, current/recent hospitalization, and known allergy/hypersensitivity/contraindication to the study drug.

The interventions involved n = 817 patients receiving ivermectin (at a dose of 400 mcg/kg daily for 3 days), and n = 774 receiving a matching placebo daily for 3 days. The primary outcome showed no significant difference in median time to sustained recovery (12 days vs. 13 days; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04).

- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in the rate of hospitalization or death by day 28 (1.22% vs. 1.16%; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.6). No significant difference in the rate of the composite outcome of hospitalization, urgent or emergency care visits, or death by day 28 (3.9% vs. 3.6%; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.8).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant safety concerns were observed within the study population.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^116oPTYQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in the early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on ivermectin for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 treatment is conflicting.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID-19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 (postexposure prophylaxis).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), WHO COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and HTA database weekly to identify completed and ongoing trials without language restrictions up to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with over 1000 participants up to April 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for the treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. For this review update, we reappraised eligible trials for research integrity, including only RCTs prospectively registered in a trial.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^116ZNDkD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Another limitation for the certainty of evidence was the low number of participants, events, or both, leading to wide confidence intervals and uncertainty in the estimated effects. We downgraded all outcomes included in the summary of findings tables for inpatients one or two levels for imprecision. In the outpatient setting, the number of analyzed participants increased for all outcomes in this update, which improved the quality of the evidence, especially for mortality compared to the previous review update. For the newly available outcome of 'quality of life', the results were precise, allowing us to grade the certainty of the evidence as high. However, due to few events resulting in wide confidence intervals, we had to downgrade one level for imprecision for several outpatient outcomes.

Heterogeneity was not a reason to downgrade the certainty of evidence for the treatment of inpatients, primarily due to the small number of trials per meta-analysis. In the outpatient setting, we downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for serious inconsistency in three outcomes with moderate to substantial heterogeneity. These included 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' (I² = 44%), 'all initial symptoms resolved at day 14' (I² = 57%), and 'any adverse events during the trial period' (I² = 80%).

We did not downgrade any of the outcomes included in the summary of findings tables for indirectness. In all cases, the effect estimates were based on comparisons of interest, populations of interest, and outcomes of interest.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^115kzvbD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only, as this is the best trial design for evaluating the efficacy of interventions. Non-standard RCT designs, such as cluster-randomized and cross-over trials, were not eligible for the review. These designs are not appropriate in this context, since the underlying cause of COVID-19 is an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the medical condition evolves over time.

We included full-text journal articles published in PubMed-indexed and non-indexed journals, preprint articles, results published in trials registers, and abstract publications. We applied no restrictions on the language of publication of the articles. All trials, especially preprint articles that have not been peer-reviewed, must have reported robust and valid data on trial design, participants' characteristics, interventions, and outcomes to be eligible for inclusion.

For research integrity, we further assessed all trials meeting eligibility criteria using a tool developed by our group to deal with problematic trials (see Selection of studies).

- **Types of participants**: We included trials investigating participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR or antigen testing), regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity, and setting (inpatients and outpatients). If trials included participants with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, we used only the data for the patient population with confirmed COVID-19.

### Trojan horses: Drug culprits associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis [^113E5JTa]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis is a systemic autoimmune disease resulting in small-vessel inflammation caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase. Legal drug culprits have been implicated as causative agents in secondary forms of the disease, and a recent burst of reports also implicate levamisole-adulterated cocaine as a culprit.

- **Purpose of review**: Here, we briefly discuss all drug culprits associated with ANCA vasculitis and then focus on clinical, serologic, therapeutic, and mechanistic aspects of four main drug culprits receiving attention of late, namely hydralazine, minocycline, propylthiouracil (PTU), and levamisole-adulterated cocaine.

- **Summary**: Hydralazine, minocycline, propylthiouracil, and levamisole-adulterated cocaine use should be closely considered in any patient where ANCA vasculitis is entertained given the wide use of these drugs in the community. Furthermore, medical practitioners should test urine for the presence of cocaine in any patient with presumed ANCA vasculitis, and if positive, then urine should also be tested for levamisole. Clinical features can be severe, requiring not only drug cessation and supportive care but also immunosuppression, plasma exchange in severe cases, and dialysis as needed. Clinical trial investigators should strongly consider excluding patients with drug-induced forms of the disease, and mechanistic inroads are greatly needed in these secondary forms of disease to help elucidate the underlying cause and pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitis.

### Current treatment approach to ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1144Cbe8]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

This review aims to summarize the most potentially impactful new data on how ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is diagnosed, treated, and monitored.

- **Recent findings**: The newly developed classification criteria for AAV have serious methodological issues that need to be addressed before they are widely adopted. Newly approved drugs and studies into both achieving remission and maintaining it have added to our overall knowledge of managing AAV and should hopefully contribute to improving outcomes in AAV.

- **Summary**: The diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of AAV have seen major improvements in the last two years. However, the remaining issues outlined in this review still need to be addressed to best serve AAV patients.

### Anca vasculitis: time for a change in treatment paradigm? Not yet [^116TrorV]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are conventionally treated with a strategy of remission induction followed by maintenance therapy using glucocorticoids combined with cyclophosphamide (CYC) during induction and azathioprine (AZA) for maintenance. Recently, several randomized controlled trials have been published that question whether these drugs should remain those of choice.

- **B-cell depletion**: Using rituximab is at least as effective as CYC for remission induction in newly presenting patients, but long-term efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness data are awaited. Thus, rituximab should be reserved for patients at high risk of infertility. Rituximab seems to be effective at inducing remission in relapsing patients. Whether routine pre-emptive treatment with rituximab for remission maintenance is a better approach than waiting for relapse is unknown.

- **Efficacy of alternative drugs**: Methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF) have similar efficacy to AZA, but are not significantly safer, while mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is less effective. Thus, AZA remains the conventional maintenance drug of choice.

### Vasculitis syndromes: Which maintenance therapy for ANCA vasculitis [^112siDfH]. Nature Reviews. Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides are usually treated with a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide therapy to induce remission. This is commonly followed by maintenance treatment with a less-toxic immunosuppressant. Azathioprine and methotrexate are both options for maintenance therapy; however, whether one of these immunosuppressants is superior to the other remains unclear.

### Covid-19 and corticosteroids: Unfamiliar but potentially fatal infections that can arise following short-course steroid treatment [^11592UcQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Ivermectin is the drug of choice for targeted treatment once the diagnosis is established. Given that the diagnosis can be challenging, it is reasonable to consider preemptive therapy when strong suspicion exists before corticosteroids. Although ivermectin may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, there are no data to support clinical use for COVID-19 treatment.

### Clinical characteristics of myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis caused by antithyroid drugs [^113vsPxr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical characteristics of myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-associated vasculitis caused by antithyroid drugs are still unclear because most reports describe only a small number of patients. The objective of the study was to analyze a large number of patients with MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis to determine several factors: the time of onset, the drug and dose taken, the clinical symptoms, the relationship between clinical symptoms and MPO-ANCA titer, and the incidence.

A total of 92 patients in whom the adverse reaction of MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis was reported to Chugai Pharmaceutical, a company that markets antithyroid drugs, were analyzed. Of the 92 patients, 41 (44.6%) had single-organ failure, 32 (34.8%) had two-organ failure, 13 (14.1%) had three-organ failure, and two (2.2%) had four-organ failure. The number of organs involved was unknown in the other four patients (4.3%).

The median time of onset was 42 months, with a range of 1–372 months, after starting drug treatment. The median dose at onset of MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis was 15 mg/d (range, 2.5–45 mg/d) for methimazole and 200 mg/d (range, 50–450 mg/d) for propylthiouracil. The severity and number of organs involved were not correlated with the MPO-ANCA titer. The incidence was between 0.53 and 0.79 patients per 10,000, and the ratio of the estimated incidences for methimazole and propylthiouracil was approximately 1:39.2.

The conclusions indicated that the time of onset of MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis and the dose at onset varied. The severity and number of organs involved were not correlated with the MPO-ANCA titer.

### Severe cutaneous adverse reactions associated with systemic ivermectin: A pharmacovigilance analysis [^116EYdcx]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Parallel to the development of novel therapies, there have been multiple attempts to treat COVID-19 using repurposed drugs, including corticosteroids, remdesivir, and tocilizumab. Some candidates have raised much controversy, especially hydroxychloroquine, which had been initially widely used but was eventually shown to be ineffective in several randomized trials. The antiparasitic ivermectin recently gained support as a new therapeutic agent for COVID-19. However, the World Health Organization, US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, and Merck, the drug's manufacturer, all advised against using ivermectin outside clinical trials since high dosages would be required for antiviral activity, increasing the risk of adverse events (AEs). Although ivermectin has a good safety profile in the recommended dosages, some rare events may go undetected in clinical trials or retrospective cohorts. Therefore, postmarketing surveillance data, aggregated from spontaneous reports, is a useful tool for investigating rare AEs and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in particular.

### Pathogenesis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis [^114KVCdZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs) are associated with vasculitis. Therapy involves administration of toxic therapy that is not optimally effective. This review summarizes evidence for the pathogenicity of ANCAs, suggesting possible strategies for improving treatment.

- **Recent findings**: Pauci-immune small vessel vasculitis is associated with antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). One research group reported a high frequency of autoantibodies against lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) in patients with MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA. Epigenetic dysregulation appears to be the basis for increased MPO and PR3 neutrophil gene expression in ANCA disease. Release of neutrophil extracellular traps may be involved in initiating the ANCA autoimmune response and causing vessel injury. Generation of C5a by alternative pathway activation is involved in pathogenesis in mouse models. Intervention strategies in mice targeting antigens, antibodies, and inflammatory signaling pathways may translate into novel therapies. Animal models of LAMP-ANCA and PR3-ANCA disease have been proposed. Molecular mimicry and responses to complementary peptides may be initiating events for ANCAs. T cells, including regulatory T cells, have been implicated in the origin and modulation of the ANCAs, as well as in the induction of tissue injury.

- **Summary**: Our basic understanding of the origins and pathogenesis of ANCA disease is advancing. This deeper understanding has already spawned novel therapies that are being developed.

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114CeJ6y]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) comprises heterogeneous, multisystem disorders characterized by inflammation and necrosis of small and medium-sized blood vessels with unknown etiology. Three distinct clinico-pathological syndromes have been identified: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), all of which are associated with autoantibodies directed against neutrophil granular proteins, proteinase 3, and myeloperoxidase. These conditions are uncommon, with incidence and prevalence rates of approximately 25 per million population and 200 per million, respectively. Despite significant advances in treatment, mortality rates remain elevated, at 2.3 times that of the general population. Early diagnosis, swift institution of appropriate immunosuppression, and limiting treatment toxicity are key to mitigating mortality and damage from AAV.

### The rise of complement in ANCA-associated vasculitis: from marginal player to target of modern therapy [^114u7duu]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The complement system plays a central role in autoimmune diseases, including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Although complement deposition is scarce in AAV pathological samples, complement activation is required for the development of necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN) in mouse models of AAV and occurs via the alternative pathway. The anaphylatoxin C5a, produced by the final complement pathway, is determinant to drive the disease in animal models. C5a primes human neutrophils and enhances their activation induced by ANCA; activated neutrophils, in turn, release factors that lead to C5a generation, establishing a self-amplifying loop. C5a is also significantly increased in the serum of AAV patients with active disease compared to those in remission or healthy controls. Inhibition of the C5a receptor with avacopan is an emerging therapy that will probably allow AAV treatment with glucocorticoid-free regimens.

### Anca associated vasculitis [^115BSCfM]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Who gets vasculitis?

Several genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified, but most of the variation in incidence is accounted for by patient age. Incidence rises progressively with age until the mid-late 80s, so that the incidence in the population aged over 70 is 80–90 per million per year, and consequently, AAV is the leading cause of glomerulonephritis in this age group. However, AAV can present at any age — including in childhood — and affects all ethnicities; the incidence is approximately the same in women and men. Environmental risk factors are absent in most cases, but exposure to drugs such as cocaine, hydralazine, and propylthiouracil has been implicated.

### Disease heterogeneity in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: Implications for therapeutic approaches [^112MXH5h]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

In recent decades, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis has transformed from an almost uniformly fatal disease to a treatable form of primary systemic vasculitis. Substantial disease heterogeneity exists within ANCA-associated vasculitis, and the increasing understanding of this heterogeneity has implications for guiding treatment decisions. Approaches to induction and maintenance therapy vary depending on disease severity, clinical manifestations, and patient-specific factors. In this narrative review, we examine how disease heterogeneity in ANCA-associated vasculitis, with respect to disease severity, clinical presentations, and ANCA specificity, influences therapeutic decision-making. Many questions regarding therapeutic strategies in ANCA-associated vasculitis remain unanswered, and these should guide future research in this complex group of diseases.

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113pEcrZ]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

These recommendations were commissioned by the BSR Guidelines Steering Group (GSG). A working group (WG) was created involving relevant stakeholders. Recommendations in this report were developed, where appropriate, using the BSR Creating Clinical Guidelines Protocol with AGREEII (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) methodology. However, the guideline protocol was not followed fully, as the scope of the work was not published prior to the final literature review.

At the time this work was commenced, no significant new evidence had been highlighted since the publication of the ACR 2021, KDIGO 2021, and updates from 2024, EULAR 2022, and EESG 2024 guidelines. The intention was to provide a timely update of the BSR 2014 guideline relevant to the UK clinical context. For this reason, this manuscript is described as 'Management Recommendations' rather than a 'Guideline'. Development was overseen by the BSR Guideline Steering Group throughout.

Following a virtual meeting of the full Working Group (WG), the scope of the project was agreed and grouped into domains. Small working groups for each domain were formed and developed initial recommendations for discussion by the full WG. These initial recommendations were adapted over a series of virtual meetings of the full WG. Each suggested recommendation in the final document was evaluated by all members and subjected to a vote relating to the strength of agreement on a scale of 1 (no agreement) to 100% (complete agreement).

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^111zVJSP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Criteria for considering studies for this review**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only, as this is the best study design for evaluating the efficacy of interventions. Non-standard RCT designs, such as cluster-randomized and cross-over trials, were not eligible for the review. These designs are not appropriate in this context, since the underlying cause of COVID-19 is an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the medical condition evolves over time.

- **Types of studies**: We included full-text journal articles published in PubMed-indexed and non-indexed journals, preprint articles, results published in trial registers, and abstract publications. All studies, especially preprint articles that have not been peer-reviewed, must have reported robust and valid data on study design, participants' characteristics, interventions, and outcomes to be eligible for inclusion. We categorized studies in question as 'awaiting classification' until the authors publish further information or clarify certain questions. We applied no restrictions on the language of publication of the articles.

- **Types of participants**: We included studies investigating participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR or antigen testing), regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, disease severity, and setting (inpatients and outpatients). If studies included participants with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, we used only the data for the patient population with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

### A worldwide pharmacoepidemiologic update on drug-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis in the era of targeted therapies [^116jDnub]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

The literature supporting the role of specific drugs in the onset of drug-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) mainly relies on case reports or short series and implicates older treatments. The advent of new treatments may have modified the epidemiology of these adverse drug reactions. This study was undertaken to update the list of drugs associated with AAV by using a pharmacovigilance-based data-mining approach.

- **Methods**: We collected data on adverse drug reactions reported using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term "anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive vasculitis" up to November 2020 from the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase). For each retrieved drug, a case-noncase analysis was performed, and disproportionate reporting was calculated using the information component (IC). A positive IC 025 value, which is the lower end of the 95% credibility interval, was considered significant.

- **Results**: A total of 483 deduplicated individual case safety reports of drug-induced AAV involving 15 drugs with an IC 025 > 0 were retrieved. Of the individuals with drug-induced AAV for whom data on sex were available (n = 371), 264 (71.2%) were women. The median age at onset of drug-induced AAV was 62 years (quartile 1 [Q1]-Q3 45–72 years), and the median time from the introduction of the suspected drug to the onset of drug-induced AAV was 9 months (Q1-Q3 1–36 months). Drug-induced AAV was considered serious in 472 (98.1%) cases, and was fatal in 43 (8.9%) of 481 cases.

### Anca-associated small-vessel vasculitis [^115YZAvq]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is the most common primary systemic small-vessel vasculitis in adults. Although the etiology is not always known, the incidence of vasculitis is increasing. The diagnosis and management of patients may be challenging due to its relative infrequency, changing nomenclature, and variability in clinical expression. Advances in clinical management have been achieved over the past few years, and many ongoing studies are in progress.

Vasculitis may affect large, medium, or small blood vessels. Small-vessel vasculitis is further classified as ANCA-associated or non-ANCA-associated vasculitis. ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis includes microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and drug-induced vasculitis. Improved diagnostic criteria and advancements in technology make these diagnoses increasingly common.

- **Features aiding in diagnosis**: Features that may help define the specific type of vasculitic disorder include the type of organ involvement, presence and type of ANCA (myeloperoxidase-ANCA or proteinase 3-ANCA), presence of serum cryoglobulins, and evidence of granulomatous inflammation.

Family physicians should be familiar with this group of vasculitic disorders to reach a prompt diagnosis and initiate treatment to prevent end-organ damage. Treatment usually includes corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^1156ZVAc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on virus replication in the early stages of the disease, indicating a benefit, especially for people with mild or moderate disease. This hypothesis has also led to the idea of the possible preventive potency of ivermectin in infection with SARS-CoV-2 in individuals after exposure to a contagious contact, referred to as postexposure prophylaxis. In response to the early promising in vitro studies on ivermectin, some COVID-19 clinical trials were initiated to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of ivermectin.

- **Why it is important to do this review**: Globally, the numbers of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to increase, substantially impacting healthcare systems. Vaccination remains a key response to address ongoing circulation and reduce the impact of emerging variants of concern. Despite efforts toward full vaccination uptake, pharmaceutical treatment interventions remain a mainstay in the management of COVID-19. So far, the drug treatments shown to be effective against COVID-19, and which are recommended in international guidelines, target SARS-CoV-2 itself or the immune response to the infection. Examples include dexamethasone, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies [Ghosn 2021; Kreuzberger 2021; Wagner 2021; NIH 2021; WHO 2021b].

Ivermectin is an inexpensive and widely used medicine in humans and animals, mainly in low- and middle-income countries with a high burden of parasitic diseases. The recently published in vitro studies have shown potential, but further investigation is necessary to determine its efficacy in COVID-19 treatment.

### Anti-cytokine targeted therapies for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114Hjd8w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) are a group of rare auto-inflammatory diseases that primarily affect small vessels. AAV includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Anti-cytokine targeted therapy uses biological agents capable of specifically targeting and neutralizing cytokine mediators of the inflammatory response.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of anti-cytokine targeted therapy for adults with AAV.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2019, Issue 7), MEDLINE, and Embase up to 16 August 2019. We also examined reference lists of articles, clinical trial registries, websites of regulatory agencies, and contacted manufacturers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials of targeted anti-cytokine therapy in adults (18 years or older) with AAV compared with placebo, standard therapy, or another modality, and anti-cytokine therapy of different type or dose.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included four RCTs with a total of 440 participants (mean age 48 to 56 years). We analyzed the studies in three groups: 1) mepolizumab (300 mg; three separate injections every four weeks for 52 weeks) versus placebo in participants with relapsing or refractory EGPA; 2) belimumab (10 mg/kg on days 0, 14, 28, and every 28 days thereafter until 12 months after the last participant…

Maintenance of remission for EGPA involves several recommended therapies:

- **Anti-IL-5/IL-5R directed therapies**: These are recommended, if available for any of the licensed indications, for maintenance of remission and to aid tapering of GC. (GRADE 1A, SoA 99%)

- **Alternative options**: RTX, MTX, MMF, or AZA may be considered as alternative options when anti-IL-5/IL-5R therapies are unavailable, or as adjunctive maintenance therapies depending on disease phenotype. (GRADE 2C, SoA 98%)

- **Tapering of GC**: GC should be tapered to the lowest possible effective dose while maintaining disease remission and considering patient-specific disease manifestations, comorbidities, and preferences. (GRADE 1A, SoA 99%)

Rigour of development

Recommendations in this report were developed based on the BSR Creating Clinical Guidelines Protocol v5.4 (2023) using AGREEII (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) methodology. Following a virtual meeting of the full working group (WG), the scope of the project was agreed upon and grouped into domains. Small working groups for each domain were formed and developed initial recommendations for discussion by the full WG. These initial recommendations were then adapted over a series of virtual meetings of the full WG. The guideline protocol was not fully followed, as the scope of the work was not published prior to the final literature review. This was due to the lack of significant new evidence since the publication of the ACR 2021, KDIGO 2021 and update 2024, EULAR 2022, and EESG 2024 guidelines. The intention was to provide a timely update of the BSR guideline 2014 relevant to the UK clinical context. Therefore, this manuscript is described as 'Management Recommendations' rather than a 'Guideline'. Development was overseen by the BSR Guideline Steering Group throughout. Subgroups (memberships summarized in Table 1) developed the initial recommendations, which were then adapted over a series of virtual meetings of the full WG. The final draft of the guidance was submitted to the BSR Guidelines Steering Group for stakeholder and internal review and feedback.

### Anca-mpo: is this a useful test [^115nsGPp]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

ANCA-MPO may not accurately predict ANCA-associated vasculitis and drug-induced vasculitis. ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) bind proteins expressed in neutrophils responsible for vascular inflammation. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by necrotizing vasculitis, with few or absent immune deposits. This classification includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

Positive staining of ANCA has three main patterns identified by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF): perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA), cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), and atypical patterns. The atypical pattern includes all other neutrophil or monocyte-specific immunofluorescent reactivities, resulting from a mixture of cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining. These patterns can also be present in other inflammatory diseases. The immunoassay detects antibodies against proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), which are strongly associated with c-ANCA and p-ANCA, respectively.

Methods for future updates

Living systematic review considerations: Our information specialist (MIM) will provide us with new search records each week, which two review authors will screen, extract, evaluate, and integrate following the guidance for Cochrane living systematic reviews (Cochrane LSR). We will manually check platform trials for new treatment arms investigating ivermectin. We will wait until the accumulating evidence changes our conclusions of the implications of research and practice before republishing the review. We will consider one or more of the following components to inform this decision:

- **The findings of one or more prioritized outcomes**: We will assess the credibility (e.g. GRADE rating) of one or more prioritized outcomes to make informed decisions.
- **New settings, populations, interventions, comparisons, or outcomes studied**: In case of emerging policy relevance because of global controversies around the intervention, we will consider republishing an updated review if conclusions remain unchanged.

We will review the scope and methods approximately monthly, or more frequently if appropriate, in light of potential changes in COVID-19 research (e.g. when additional comparisons, interventions, subgroups, or outcomes, or new review methods become available).

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^113zh1cS]. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The website ivmmeta.com provides several meta‐analyses of pooled effects including up to 60 studies. This website shows pooled estimates suggesting significant benefits with ivermectin, which has resulted in confusion for clinicians, patients, and decision‐makers (Garegnani 2021). The analyses are misleading and have several limitations. As described for the other reviews, several ineligible interventions and comparators were pooled. Additionally, different outcomes were pooled and reported as percentage improvement with ivermectin studied in RCTs ranging from 40% improvement when used as late treatment to 83% improvement when used as prophylaxis. However, there is no full prospective protocol available describing the relevant review methodology, and there is no assessment of the risk of bias or the certainty of evidence.

National and international guidelines regarding the use of ivermectin for the treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 have been developed over the past 12 months. Recommendations from the WHO, updated 31 March 2021 (WHO 2021b); European Medicines Agency, updated 22 March 2021 (EMA 2021); Infectious Diseases Society of America, updated 13 February 2021 (IDSA 2021); and the COVID Management Guidelines India Group, updated 15 May 2021 (COVID Guidelines India 2021), concur that ivermectin should only be used for treatment of COVID‐19 in the context of clinical trials.

### Ivermectin to prevent hospitalizations in patients with COVID-19 (IVERCOR-COVID19) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1115oq7h]. BMC Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The IVERCOR-COVID19 study, published in 2021 in the BMC Infectious Diseases journal, investigated the role of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients. This multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial included a population of 501 patients (237 female, 264 male) who were adult outpatients with COVID-19 positive nasal swabs within 48 hours. Key exclusion criteria included home oxygen use, a requirement for hospitalization due to COVID-19 at the time of diagnosis, or a history of COVID-19-related hospitalization.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 250: Ivermectin (total dosage of 24–48 mg PO, based on weight)
	- n = 251: Placebo (equivalent number of matching placebo tablets)

- **Primary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in hospitalization was observed (5.6% vs. 8.4%; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.31).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in death from all causes (1.6% vs. 1.2%; OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.3 to 6.07).
	- No significant difference in invasive mechanical ventilation (1.6% vs. 1.2%; OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.3 to 6.07).
	- No significant difference in dialysis (0.4% vs. 0.4%; OR 1, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.14).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant differences in dialysis, adverse events, or death from all causes.

The study concluded there was no significant difference in the primary or secondary outcomes between the ivermectin and placebo groups.

### Recent advances to achieve remission induction in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis [^112cXNXo]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Significant advances in the treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis have been made in the past 10 years. This review aims to detail advances in treatment aimed at induction of remission.

- **Recent findings**: Cyclophosphamide-based regimes remain the standard of care, at least in generalized disease. Safer therapeutic regimes with reduced cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide have been developed, such as the use of pulsed cyclophosphamide. Preliminary data are available, suggesting rituximab may be an alternative to cyclophosphamide, but additional safety data are required. Evidence suggests that plasma exchange should be added to those with more severe disease, and it is acceptable to use methotrexate as an induction agent for those with limited or early systemic disease. Using regimens, remission is achieved in over 90% of patients, but toxicity remains an important issue. Attention should be paid to reducing treatment toxicity.

- **Summary**: Findings of recent clinical trials should change clinical practice and improve the outcome of patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.

This has also led to the idea of the possible preventive potency of ivermectin on infection with SARS-CoV-2 in individuals after exposure to a contagious contact, called postexposure prophylaxis. In response to the early promising in vitro studies on ivermectin, several COVID-19 clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of ivermectin.

- **Why it is important to do this review**: Ivermectin is an inexpensive and widely used medicine, mainly in low- and middle-income countries with a high burden of parasitic diseases. The recently published in vitro studies, especially the results of Caly 2020, have led to great interest in ivermectin in many countries with high numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections, including the United States and countries of South America and Asia. In South America in particular, people started liberally self-medicating with ivermectin, and the drug has become part of public health policies without reliable scientific data. For example, in May 2020, Bolivian and Peruvian health officials recommended ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 without supplying evidence. In Brazil, it was promoted as a preventive measure by municipalities (Rodríguez-Mega 2020). Due to the rapid increase in interest in ivermectin and the risk of abuse, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Systemic vasculitis may, at times, be drug-induced and associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). However, pantoprazole, a commonly used and well-tolerated proton pump inhibitor, has not previously been reported to cause ANCA-associated syndromes.

We describe a patient who developed interstitial nephritis, cutaneous vasculitis, a perinuclear ANCA staining pattern (pANCA) on immunofluorescence, and anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies (MPO-ANCA) in association with pantoprazole. We review various immune-mediated syndromes reported in association with proton pump inhibitors, including one report of omeprazole associated with interstitial nephritis and the development of ANCA.

- **Domain 4: AAV service specification**: Timely access to services is critical. The waiting time for individuals with new symptoms and a high index of clinical suspicion for active AAV should not exceed 7 days from initial referral to review by a vasculitis expert (GRADE 1B, SoA 97%). For children living with suspected AAV, acute discussions with tertiary pediatric sub-specialty teams are necessary (GRADE 1C, SoA 99%). Additionally, services offering AAV care should have access to intravenous therapy for initial treatment or relapse within 7 days (GRADE 1C, SoA 98%).

- **Integrated care**: People living with AAV should be attended to in cohorted clinics, where patients are grouped together and seen in a dedicated clinic, rather than in general clinics (GRADE 1B, SoA 98%). Coordination across specialties is essential to provide timely and effective care, with multi-specialty clinics forming the gold standard (GRADE 1C, SoA 98%). Access to a nurse with specialist vasculitis knowledge is important for care coordination and holistic support. Nurse-led clinics should be implemented to complement cohorted clinics (GRADE 1B, SoA 98%). Transition from pediatric to adult care should be supported by multi-disciplinary teams in dedicated clinics, adhering to established NICE guidelines on healthcare transition (GRADE 1C, SoA 99%).

- **Access to expertise**: AAV services should provide a nurse advice line to offer patient support and rapid access to advice between clinic appointments.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^111c2omf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

For the outpatient setting, the relevant outcomes of hospital admission or death and quality of life, which were not reported in any trial in the previous review version, could be evaluated in this update. Overall, for all outcomes relevant for outpatients with mild disease, such as the risk of needing hospitalization, resolving symptoms, adverse or serious adverse events, and viral clearance, ivermectin showed no evidence of an effect either for improving or worsening the respective outcomes. The certainty of evidence for all these findings was low. With high certainty, we found that ivermectin showed no effect on quality of life for the outpatient setting.

No trial investigated ivermectin for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection; hence, no evidence could be found for post-exposure prophylaxis in this context.

- **Overall completeness and applicability of evidence**: First, with the new outcome set in this update, we mainly addressed the issue of competing outcome risk. We combined outcomes that represent clinical worsening with the outcome of death, which would allow evidence on ivermectin to become more unambiguous and patient-relevant.

Four newly included trials for the outpatient setting increased the certainty of evidence on ivermectin for this purpose compared to the previous review version. Overall, the included trials investigated participants with COVID-19 at WHO stages 1 to 3 and WHO stages 4 to 5; therefore, findings of this review are transferable to patients with COVID-19 at mild to moderate stages. In this update, no trials investigated ivermectin for severe COVID-19.

### Complications of therapy for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^111urEa1]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The introduction of immunosuppressive therapies has transformed ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) from a largely fatal condition to a chronic relapsing disorder. However, progressive organ damage and disability, both from the disease process itself and from therapies used for treatment, eventually affect the majority of patients. Infection, rather than uncontrolled vasculitis, is the greatest cause of early mortality and remains a major problem thereafter. Increased rates of malignancy and cardiovascular disease are additional important long-term sequelae.

This review focuses on the complications associated with the immunosuppressive therapies most commonly used to treat ANCA-associated vasculitis and considers prophylactic and monitoring strategies to minimize these risks. Achieving a balance between immunosuppression to reduce relapse risk and minimizing the adverse effects associated with therapy has become key. The contribution of glucocorticoids to treatment toxicity is increasingly being recognized, and future therapeutic strategies must concentrate on glucocorticoid minimization or sparing strategies. The development of robust predictors of an individual's future clinical course is needed in order to individually tailor treatment regimens.

### Refractory disease in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies associated vasculitis [^113FLXbZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Induction treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) is not always successful, and nonresponding patients are considered refractory.

- **Recent findings**: Refractory disease should be subdefined according to the treatment that was received. Cyclophosphamide refractory AAV occurs in up to 5% of patients. Many more patients develop contraindications to cyclophosphamide or experience frequent relapses. These patient groups might also benefit from treatments used for cyclophosphamide refractory AAV.

- **Summary**: The most promising drug for treating refractory AAV is rituximab.

### Pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis [^112bdBQk]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is an autoimmune disease in which the contributions of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors to aetiology and pathogenesis are being unraveled. The ANCA immunoglobulin G targeting proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase affects several neutrophil functions, usually augmenting or dysregulating them, which promotes a proinflammatory phenotype whereby neutrophils have enhanced capabilities of inflicting collateral damage on endothelial and other cells.

B cells are intimately involved in pathogenesis, as anti-B cell therapies are highly effective; however, the manner of this involvement still needs to be delineated. Similarly, the T cell compartment is disturbed in ANCA vasculitis, and numerous alterations in T cell subsets have been described. The recognition of a novel CD8(+) T cell transcription signature, which can predict the likelihood of relapse in ANCA vasculitis, indicates that more needs to be learned about the influence of T cells in the disease process.

Finally, the role of the alternative complement pathway and the potential therapeutic value of its neutralization is under active investigation. Compelling studies in murine models have demonstrated that C5 and factor-B knock-out mice are protected.

### Onchocerciasis in a nonendemic population: Clinical and immunologic assessment before treatment and at the time of presumed cure [^113Y1YvR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Although suppressive therapy with intermittent ivermectin prevents the development of pathology in endemic populations, the clinical and immunologic effects of therapy in the absence of continued exposure are unknown. To address this question, 14 patients treated with ivermectin for onchocerciasis acquired over 10 years ago during temporary residence in Africa were reevaluated.

None showed evidence of continued infection or pathology at follow-up. Although eosinophilia, serum IgE, and antifilarial antibody levels decreased after ivermectin therapy, none of these parameters predicted the resolution of symptoms in infected patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients at follow-up were more responsive to parasite antigen in vitro. This was assessed by proliferation and production of interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-5. In contrast, antigen-induced levels of IL-10 were significantly decreased at follow-up, indicating diminished down-regulatory factors rather than a switch from type 2 to type 1 immune responses.

### The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1133vc11]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Patient and provider interviews in the VOICES study revealed the vital role of specialist nurses in improving access to expertise. These nurses facilitate advice lines, which act as a single point of access for rapid advice within a supportive service infrastructure, care organization, and escalation. Patient access to nurse-led advice lines in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is associated with fewer serious infections and fewer emergency hospital admissions.

The timeliness, cost of care, and adherence to national guidelines are improved for cancer patients managed within a multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. This approach has been adopted by medical specialties to support the care of complex medical patients. In the VOICES study, a top component of care prioritized by all specialties was access to specialist vasculitis MDT meetings. Individuals looked after in services with access to vasculitis MDT meetings had fewer serious infections and emergency hospital admissions.

MDT meetings vary greatly in their structure and function. The working group considers an MDT meeting to be about "getting the right people in a room together talking". Certain characteristics are needed with respect to the team, infrastructure, organization, and logistics, and centering the patient in discussions. Appropriate technology, administrative support, adequate attendance, and an assigned chairperson are some of the key factors for an effective cancer MDT meeting. To conduct effective MDT meetings that improve AAV patient care, it is vital that health professionals have the appropriate protected time and administrative support.

### Updates in cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis [^111K5bsf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

The main purpose of this review is to present newly reported cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis, updates in investigations to verify systemic involvement in cases with cutaneous vasculitis, and new therapeutic guidelines. The spectrum of COVID-19-related vasculitis is also covered.

Only a few reports highlighted new cutaneous presentations or associations with some systemic vasculitic entities. For example, the association of inflammatory disorders with Takayasu arteritis, the importance of considering Kawasaki disease in febrile children with erythema nodosum, the development of necrotic ulcers on fingers and toes in Behçet's disease, and the possible presence of polyarteritis nodosa-like pathological features in vulvar ulcers of Behçet's disease. New attempts to classify cutaneous manifestations of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV), as well as the diagnostic investigations for cutaneous vasculitis cases to verify systemic involvement, are discussed. Treatment of systemic vasculitis with cutaneous vasculitis should be tailored according to disease status. A plethora of reports in the past 2 years focused on the broad spectrum of COVID-19 vasculitic manifestations.

Although newly reported cutaneous manifestations of systemic vasculitis are relatively uncommon, the plethora of reports in the past 2 years on COVID-19 vasculitis necessitates the expansion of the classification of vasculitis associated with probable causes to include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

### Effect of early treatment with ivermectin among patients with Covid-19 [^1121d97D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The TOGETHER (ivermectin) study, conducted by Gilmar Reis and colleagues, was published in 2022 in The New England Journal of Medicine. This study investigated the role of early treatment with ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 infection. It employed a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The study enrolled 1,358 patients, consisting of 791 females and 567 males. Inclusion criteria included adult patients with COVID-19 symptoms lasting up to seven days and possessing at least one risk factor for disease progression.

Key exclusion criteria involved a negative COVID-19 diagnostic test despite acute flu symptoms, a requirement for hospitalization due to COVID-19, acute respiratory symptoms from other causes, and dyspnea secondary to other acute or chronic respiratory conditions or infections.

- **Interventions**:
	- Ivermectin group (n = 679): Received 400 mcg/kg of body weight once daily for three days.
	- Placebo group (n = 679): Received matching placebo for three days.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was no significant difference in hospitalization due to COVID-19 or emergency department visits due to clinical worsening of COVID-19 at 28 days (14.7% ivermectin vs. 16.3% placebo; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.16).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Viral clearance at day 7 showed no significant difference (25.4% ivermectin vs. 25.5% placebo; RR 1, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46).
	- Hospitalization for any cause also showed no significant difference (11.6% ivermectin vs. 14% placebo; RR 0.83, 95% CI).

### Propylthiouracil-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis [^115jg51R]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) refers to a group of potentially life-threatening autoimmune diseases. A recent development in this field is the recognition that certain drugs can induce AAV. Among these agents, the drug most often implicated in causing disease is the commonly used antithyroid agent propylthiouracil (PTU). This review provides an update on PTU-induced AAV. Clinical characteristics of PTU-induced AAV are similar to that of primary AAV but usually have a milder course and better prognosis, provided there is early cessation of the disease-causing drug. PTU-induced ANCAs usually react to several components of myeloid granules, which is helpful in differentiating PTU-induced AAV from primary AAV. Early cessation of PTU is crucial in the treatment of PTU-induced AAV. The duration of immunosuppressive therapy might be shorter than in primary AAV, depending on the severity of organ damage, and maintenance therapy is not always necessary.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^117Ccz1u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent used to treat parasitic infestations, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in the early stages of infection. Currently, evidence on the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 treatment is conflicting.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID-19 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 (postexposure prophylaxis).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), medRxiv, and Research Square, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions up to 26 May 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for the treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity, treated in inpatient or outpatient settings, and for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing ivermectin to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data collection and analysis involved assessing RCTs for bias, using standard methodologies.

### Anca-associated vasculitis-treatment standard [^117MUUy5]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Rituximab is an anti-CD20 B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody that has proved effective in AAV as both induction and maintenance treatment; however, a small proportion of patients fail to achieve remission, especially in granulomatous disease, with the possibility of early relapses and rituximab resistance associated with an anti-globulin response. Obinutuzumab, a Type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has superior direct cell death and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity compared with rituximab and was efficacious in a phase II lupus nephritis trial, where more complete and sustained B-cell depletion occurred than has been observed in rituximab-treated SLE cohorts. The potential of obinutuzumab in AAV is being explored in Obinutuzumab compared with rituximab for treating ANCA-associated vasculitis (ObiVas) Trial (ISRCTN13069630). Failure to demonstrate a reduction of relapse risk with belimumab, a BLyS inhibitor, in the Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab and Azathioprine for Maintenance of Remission in Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis (BREVAS) Trial was linked to issues of trial design and a low event rate in the placebo group. However, the potential for a synergistic B-cell-depleting effect when belimumab is combined with rituximab from remission induction is being studied in the Randomised study of rituximab and belimumab sequential therapy in PR3 ANCA-associated vasculitis (COMBIVAS).

### The effect of early treatment with ivermectin on viral load, symptoms and humoral response in patients with non-severe COVID-19: A pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^1173GXRQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Symptoms**: There was good compliance with the daily online questionnaire, with 282 patient-days reports (84%) in the ivermectin group and 295 patient-days reports (88%) in the placebo group. Patients in the ivermectin group reported fewer patient-days of any symptoms than those in the placebo group (171 vs. 255 patient-days). This difference is mainly driven by two symptoms: anosmia/hyposmia and cough. Patients in the ivermectin group reported 50% less anosmia/hyposmia than those in the placebo group (76 vs. 158 patient-days of anosmia/hyposmia). The ivermectin group also reported 30% less cough (68 vs. 97 patient-days of cough).

	- The daily proportion of any self-reported symptoms, self-reported cough, and self-reported anosmia/hyposmia by study arm is depicted in the graphs. Each graph represents the daily proportion of individuals (n/N) who suffered from each symptom in the corresponding study arm over a 28-day follow-up. Missing answers were replaced by the value from the immediately preceding day.

	- There were no significant differences between ivermectin and placebo groups in the reported patient-days of fever (12 vs. 12), general malaise (51 vs. 61), headache (34 vs. 38), or nasal congestion (91 vs. 97). However, with much lower magnitudes, the ivermectin group reported 3.5-fold more patient-days of gastrointestinal symptoms (21 vs. 6) and 5-fold less shortness of breath (3 vs. 15).

	- No patient from either group progressed to severe disease.

- **Serology**: All patients in both groups seroconverted by day 21 post-treatment. Patients in the ivermectin group had a lower median of IgG titers.

### Genetically distinct subsets within ANCA-associated vasculitis [^116a7mke]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is a severe condition encompassing two major syndromes: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis. Its cause is unknown, and there is debate about whether it is a single disease entity and what role ANCA plays in its pathogenesis. We investigated its genetic basis.

- **Methods**: A genomewide association study was performed in a discovery cohort of 1,233 U.K. patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and 5,884 controls and was replicated in 1,454 Northern European case patients and 1,666 controls. Quality control, population stratification, and statistical analyses were performed according to standard criteria.

- **Results**: We found both major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) and non-MHC associations with ANCA-associated vasculitis and also that granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis were genetically distinct. The strongest genetic associations were with the antigenic specificity of ANCA, not with the clinical syndrome. Anti-proteinase 3 ANCA was associated with HLA-DP and the genes encoding α(1)-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) and proteinase 3 (PRTN3) (P = 6.2×10^(-89), P = 5.6×10^(-12), and P = 2.6×10^(-7), respectively). Anti-myeloperoxidase ANCA was associated with HLA-DQ (P = 2.1×10^(-8)).

- **Conclusions**: This study confirms that the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis has a genetic component, shows genetic distinctions between granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis that are associated with ANCA specificity.

### Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^111paeuk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

We collected information on outcomes from all time points reported in the publications. If only a few trials contributed data to an outcome, we pooled different time points, provided the trials had produced valid data and pooling was clinically reasonable. In case of time‐to‐event analysis, such as for time to death, we included the outcome measure based on the longest follow‐up time and measured from randomization.

Time points of outcome measurement are reported in the footnotes of the forest plots. We included serious adverse events and adverse events occurring during the trial period, including those during active treatment and long‐term adverse events as well. If sufficient data are available for review updates, we will group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes into those measured directly after treatment (up to 7 days), medium‐term outcomes (up to 14 days), and longer‐term outcomes (28 days or more).

This review update has no secondary outcomes. We treated all outcomes as a primary outcome set, which informed the summary of findings tables.

### Autoantibody biomarkers in rheumatic diseases [^111HAXho]. International Journal of Molecular Sciences (2020). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies can be caused by:

- **Drug-induced ANCA vasculitis**:
	- Ulcerative colitis
	- Microscopic polyangiitis
	- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
	- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
	- Primary sclerosing cholangitis
	- Rheumatoid arthritis
	- Systemic lupus erythematosus
	- Crohn's disease
	- Infective endocarditis
	- Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease

Additionally, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies can be caused by medications such as hydralazine, minocycline, phenytoin, penicillamine, allopurinol, sulfasalazine, sulfasalazine DR, phenytoin ER, and minocycline ER.

### Treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis [^114c5Qn3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The primary idiopathic small-vessel vasculitis syndromes include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and microscopic polyangiitis. These disorders are commonly referred to as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides and prominently affect the pulmonary vasculature. Although significant progress has been made in the management of these disorders, they continue to carry substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of both the underlying vasculitis as well as complications of its immunosuppressive therapy. This review focuses on the recent advances in the management and longitudinal monitoring of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

- **Recent findings**: Cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids are standard therapy but carry measurable risk of treatment-related toxicity. The search for alternative therapies that are less toxic but similarly efficacious is continuing. Recent investigations suggest rituximab may be a well-tolerated alternative to cyclophosphamide for the induction of remission, treatment of disease relapse, and as maintenance therapy.

- **Summary**: The ANCA-associated vasculitides are a group of disorders that commonly affect the pulmonary vasculature and represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the pulmonary clinician. Recent findings have expanded our ability to diagnose and treat these disorders with a focus on limiting treatment-related toxicity while inducing and maintaining remission.

### Ivermectin [^114gqRrW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ivermectin cream applied once daily at bedtime was evaluated in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials. These trials were identical in design and were conducted in 1,371 subjects aged 18 years and older. Participants were treated once daily for 12 weeks with either ivermectin cream or vehicle cream.

Overall, 96% of subjects were Caucasian, and 67% were female. Using the 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe), 79% of subjects were scored as moderate (IGA = 3), and 21% scored as severe (IGA = 4) at baseline.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints in both pivotal trials were:

- **Success rate based on the IGA outcome**: Percentage of subjects rated as "clear" and "almost clear".
- **Absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12**.

Ivermectin cream was more effective than vehicle cream on the co-primary efficacy endpoints starting from 4 weeks of treatment in both studies. See Figures 1 through 4.
