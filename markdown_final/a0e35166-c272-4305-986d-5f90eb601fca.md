## Question

Rejection g tube feeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to reject or forgo gastrostomy tube (G-tube) feeding, including ethical, evidence-based, and practical considerations across populations and settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical contexts where rejection is being considered. Then, I should verify the ethical and legal frameworks that govern refusal of artificial nutrition. Next, I will examine disease-specific evidence where benefits are limited or harms outweigh benefits. After that, I need to check patient-specific factors that modify decisions. Then, I should review practical alternatives to tube feeding. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework and outline documentation and communication steps, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts in which "rejection" of G-tube feeding is commonly contemplated, because the rationale differs by scenario: advanced dementia, end-of-life or palliative care, severe neurologic disability in children, and conditions with high procedural risk or poor tolerance such as severe epidermolysis bullosa. I should also consider scenarios where families or patients decline based on values, quality-of-life goals, or perceived burdens, and I need to ensure I distinguish refusal of placement from discontinuation after initiation, as both are ethically and clinically distinct decisions [^1114qEh3] [^1112vPt6] [^115912CU] [^116LHtjN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should anchor the ethical and legal foundation before discussing specifics. Patient autonomy is paramount, and artificial nutrition and hydration are medical treatments that can be accepted or declined by patients or their authorized surrogates, consistent with advance directives and substituted judgment. Beneficence requires that we weigh expected benefits against burdens, and non-maleficence cautions against interventions that cause harm without meaningful benefit. Shared decision-making and, when needed, ethics consultation are essential, and I need to ensure I cite the appropriate society positions and guidelines that codify these principles [^1114qEh3] [^1134adD1] [^113xVc4P].

> Next, I should review disease-specific evidence where rejection of G-tube feeding is particularly justified. Let me consider advanced dementia first. Multiple high-quality sources conclude that tube feeding does not improve survival, quality of life, or functional status compared with careful hand feeding, and is associated with agitation, restraints, and pressure ulcers; therefore, choosing comfort-focused hand feeding is ethically and clinically appropriate and should be presented as a legitimate alternative rather than "doing nothing" [^113xVc4P] [^1134adD1] [^113oB4hG] [^115yKhCz].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric and severe systemic disease contexts. In severe epidermolysis bullosa, G-tube placement and feeds can precipitate abdominal distension, poor tolerance, and persistent peristomal leakage with ulceration, leading some centers to de-emphasize G-tubes. This does not mean G-tubes are never appropriate, but it does mean that in EB the balance of harms and benefits may favor rejection or alternative strategies, and I should be cautious to frame this as population-specific rather than a global prohibition [^115912CU].

> I need to check other scenarios where rejection is reasonable. In end-stage disease with limited prognosis, the marginal benefit of G-tube feeding is often outweighed by procedural risks, care burdens, and lack of improvement in meaningful outcomes. Additionally, some patients may have anatomic or physiologic risk profiles (e.g., severe gastroparesis, recurrent aspiration despite precautions) where gastric feeding is unsafe and postpyloric options are either not feasible or not aligned with goals of care. Here, refusal or selection of non-gastric strategies may be appropriate [^1114qEh3] [^113jjYgB] [^116cyQaZ].

> Let me think about patient-specific factors that modify decisions. Age and comorbidities alter procedural risk and expected benefit, prognosis and goals of care should drive the intervention choice, and cultural or religious values may influence acceptance of artificial nutrition. I should also confirm that decisional capacity or surrogate authority is in place and that communication is tailored to literacy and language needs. Where conflict exists, structured decision aids and ethics support can reduce decisional distress for families and clinicians [^1114qEh3] [^1158gBgU] [^116LHtjN].

> Next, I should review alternatives to G-tube feeding when rejection is being considered. Careful hand feeding with liberalized diets and comfort measures is an endorsed approach in advanced dementia, nasogastric or nasoduodenal routes may be used short term when feasible, parenteral nutrition is rarely indicated except in intestinal failure, and in select cases no artificial nutrition is chosen, with focus on comfort and symptom control. I need to ensure these options are presented alongside G-tube placement in shared decision-making conversations [^1134adD1] [^112j9tfK] [^113cSQWf].

> But wait, what if a G-tube has already been placed and the family now wishes to discontinue? I should confirm that stopping enteral feeds is ethically permissible when continued feeding no longer aligns with goals of care or is causing burdens without benefit, and I should anticipate and manage symptoms such as hunger or thirst with comfort measures, recognizing that contemporary palliative care guidance supports forgoing artificial nutrition in appropriate contexts [^1114qEh3] [^1112vPt6].

> I will now synthesize a decision framework to guide rejection. If the patient or surrogate declines after informed consent, that ends the discussion. If benefits are unlikely (e.g., advanced dementia with poor prognosis), rejection is reasonable. If risks outweigh benefits (e.g., severe EB with poor tolerance), rejection is reasonable. If alternatives meet goals better (e.g., comfort-focused hand feeding), rejection is reasonable. If uncertainty remains, a time-limited trial with predefined stop criteria can be proposed, and I should double-check that this framework aligns with guideline-based shared decision-making [^1114qEh3] [^1134adD1] [^113xVc4P].

> Hold on, I should verify the documentation elements. Record the clinical indication or lack thereof, the patient's or surrogate's values and preferences, the evidence-based risks, benefits, and alternatives discussed, the explicit statement of rejection with rationale, and confirm alignment with advance directives. In systems that use order sets, I need to ensure language avoids misinterpretation, for example using "Comfort Feeding Only" to clarify continued hand feeding rather than "do not feed", and I should include plans for monitoring and comfort if artificial nutrition is forgone [^1114qEh3] [^112j9tfK].

> Let me reconsider one potential pitfall. I initially almost conflated "tube malfunction" data with reasons to reject G-tubes, but I should correct that: the ASGE guidance showing higher malfunction with IR-G compared with PEG is about modality selection and does not by itself justify rejecting enteral access entirely. It supports choosing PEG when appropriate, not a blanket rejection of G-tubes, so I need to be precise in using that evidence to inform technique rather than to argue against enteral nutrition per se [^115fW7G2] [^114khqtd] [^114voNED].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure that any decision to reject G-tube feeding is grounded in patient-centered goals, evidence about limited benefit in specific diseases, and careful weighing of harms and burdens. Shared decision-making, clear documentation, and comfort-focused alternatives are essential, and clinicians should be prepared to support families through decisional conflict and to revisit decisions as conditions evolve [^1114qEh3] [^1134adD1] [^113xVc4P].

Gastrostomy tube feeding may be declined due to **ethical concerns** about quality of life, autonomy, and end-of-life care, especially in advanced dementia or terminal illness [^113xVc4P] [^1114qEh3]. Clinically, **complications** such as infection, leakage, tube dislodgement, and buried bumper syndrome can cause significant morbidity and caregiver burden [^11694t7R] [^115dvZ6C] [^116smAqQ]. Patients or families may also reject feeding due to cultural or religious beliefs, or the perceived burden of care [^1158gBgU]. Evidence shows **no survival or aspiration benefit** in advanced dementia, reinforcing the ethical basis for refusal [^115yKhCz] [^113oB4hG]. Decisions should be individualized, with shared decision-making and advance directives guiding care [^1114qEh3].

---

## Ethical and moral considerations

Ethical principles strongly influence the decision to **reject G-tube feeding**, particularly in advanced dementia or terminal illness:

- **Autonomy**: Patients or surrogates have the right to refuse medical interventions, including artificial nutrition, based on personal values and preferences [^1114qEh3].

- **Beneficence and non-maleficence**: Tube feeding may not improve quality of life and can cause harm, such as discomfort, restraints, and clinical complications [^113oB4hG].

- **Quality of life**: Many patients and families prioritize comfort and dignity over prolonged life with artificial feeding, especially in advanced dementia or terminal illness [^113xVc4P].

---

## Clinical complications and risks

Gastrostomy tube feeding carries **significant clinical risks** that may lead patients or families to reject it:

| **Complication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Infection | Peristomal infection is common, occurring in over half of pediatric cases [^11694t7R] |
| Leakage | Gastric leakage around the tube site is frequent and can cause skin irritation and maceration [^115dvZ6C] |
| Tube dislodgement | Accidental dislodgement is common, especially in children, requiring urgent replacement [^115hdVAh] |
| Buried bumper syndrome | The internal bumper becomes embedded in the gastric wall, causing pain, blockage, and requiring endoscopic intervention [^116smAqQ] |
| Aspiration pneumonia | Despite tube feeding, aspiration risk persists, particularly in patients with dysphagia or impaired consciousness [^113jjYgB] |

---

These complications can significantly **impact patient comfort**, increase caregiver burden, and lead to repeated hospitalizations or interventions.

---

## Patient and family preferences

Patient and family preferences play a critical role in **rejecting G-tube feeding**:

- **Cultural and religious beliefs**: Some cultures and religions view artificial feeding as unnatural or incompatible with their values.

- **Perceived burden of care**: Families may reject tube feeding due to the significant caregiving responsibilities, including tube maintenance, feeding regimens, and management of complications [^113tSQ3v].

- **Desire for normalcy**: Families may prioritize oral feeding and normal eating experiences over artificial nutrition, even if it means accepting nutritional risks [^116LHtjN].

---

## Evidence regarding outcomes

Evidence regarding the **effectiveness of G-tube feeding** is mixed, and in some cases, it does not demonstrate clear benefits:

- **Advanced dementia**: Tube feeding does not improve survival, reduce aspiration pneumonia, or enhance quality of life in patients with advanced dementia. Careful hand feeding is recommended as an alternative [^1134adD1] [^115yKhCz].

- **Pediatric populations**: While G-tube feeding can improve nutritional status and growth in children with severe feeding difficulties, it also carries risks of complications and may impact family quality of life [^115bNgmQ] [^11694t7R].

- **General patient population**: Tube feeding is associated with significant complications, including infection, leakage, and tube malfunction, which may outweigh potential benefits in some patients [^115fW7G2].

---

## Legal and regulatory considerations

Legal and regulatory frameworks support the right to refuse **medical interventions**, including G-tube feeding:

- **Advance directives**: Patients can document their preferences regarding artificial nutrition and hydration in advance directives, which are legally binding [^notfound].

- **Surrogate decision-making**: Surrogate decision-makers can refuse tube feeding based on the patient's previously expressed wishes or best interests [^1134adD1].

- **Institutional policies**: Hospitals and long-term care facilities have policies supporting patient autonomy and the right to refuse medical interventions, including artificial nutrition [^notfound].

---

## Alternative nutritional strategies

When G-tube feeding is rejected, **alternative nutritional strategies** may be considered:

- **Oral feeding**: Careful hand feeding, dietary modifications, and swallowing therapy may be used to maintain oral intake safely [^1134adD1].

- **Nasogastric feeding**: Temporary nasogastric tube feeding may be considered in specific situations, such as short-term nutritional support or when G-tube placement is contraindicated [^notfound].

- **Comfort feeding only**: In advanced dementia or terminal illness, comfort feeding only, focusing on patient comfort and dignity, is recommended [^112j9tfK].

---

## Psychological and emotional impact

The psychological and emotional impact of G-tube feeding can be **significant** for patients and families. Many experience loss of normal eating, increased medicalization, and social isolation, while families face caregiver stress, guilt, and anxiety related to tube feeding and its complications [^113YhZZH] [^116LHtjN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and professional recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **shared decision-making**, patient autonomy, and individualized care when considering G-tube feeding. The American Geriatrics Society recommends careful hand feeding over tube feeding in advanced dementia, while the American College of Gastroenterology supports patient autonomy and individualized decision-making regarding artificial nutrition [^113xVc4P] [^1114qEh3].

---

## Conclusion

Gastrostomy tube feeding may be rejected for **ethical reasons**, clinical risks, patient and family preferences, and lack of demonstrated benefit in certain populations. Decisions should be individualized, with shared decision-making and advance directives guiding care. Alternative nutritional strategies, such as oral feeding and comfort feeding only, should be considered when G-tube feeding is rejected.

Conclusion

PEG is a safe, efficient, and advantageous procedure to respond to the need for inadequate calory intake, stunted growth, and food difficulties. The gain of weight is significant, counterbalancing frequent but minor complications. Patients carrying PEG are mostly suffering from neuromuscular disorders, as they are particularly at risk of being unable to maintain adequate nutrition orally. It is essential to evaluate the presence of GERD before PEG insertion in patients who are symptomatic or at risk of developing GERD. Oral feeding should be encouraged whenever possible. Interestingly, many patients improve their oral feeding behavior due to stress relief in patients and caregivers, respectively.

### Tutorial on adult enteral tube feeding: indications, placement, removal, complications, and ethics [^113cSQWf]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition, generally preferred to parenteral nutrition, is indicated when patients cannot meet their energy and metabolic demands. Gastrostomy tubes are placed directly into the stomach (either endoscopically, surgically, or radiologically) through the abdominal wall. Routine gastrostomy tube care is important to maintain well-functioning tubes. Postpyloric feeding tubes are preferable to gastric feeding tubes if patients have a history of aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux, severe gastroparesis, and/or recurrent nausea and vomiting. Feeding jejunostomy tubes are placed surgically and are indicated if gastric feeding is unsafe or impossible. Dual-lumen gastrojejunostomy tubes are used when both gastric decompression and feeding are desired. The general risks of enteral tube feeding include diarrhea, metabolic derangements, and aspiration. Additional complications for gastrostomy tubes, which can arise at any time, include tube dysfunction (clogging or deterioration), infection, bleeding, peristomal leakage, ulceration, gastric outlet obstruction, and accidental removal. After percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement, there are also early or late complications that may occur. Multiple factors should be considered in the decision-making process for feeding tube placement. It is important to be realistic about the patient's prognosis and goals and to discuss the risks and benefits ahead of time. Consultation with palliative care or clinical ethics specialists should be considered in certain clinical scenarios.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to nutritional support, BSG 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering jejunal feeding initially via a nasojejunal tube if gastric feeding is unsuccessful. Consider inserting an endoscopic (through a gastrostomy or as a direct jejunostomy) or surgical tube if nasojejunal tube feeding is successful.

ASGE guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes — implantation metastasis risk and panel guidance: Mechanical translocation during transoral passage is not the only putative etiology of implantation metastasis, with literature also suggesting hematogenous spread, and implantation metastasis has been reported with transcutaneous direct PEG and IR-G without transoral passage. The panel expressed concerns about inequitable access to IR gastrostomy and transcutaneous direct PEG, noting limited expertise and potential adverse outcomes with IR-G; thus, although transcutaneous direct PEG may be advisable, it is not mandatory, and the panel refrained from recommending against transoral pull PEG in aerodigestive malignancies. The panel states that the risk of implantation metastasis should be discussed during informed consent, that IR-G or transcutaneous direct PEG should be offered where available, and that the gastrostomy site should be periodically assessed for implantation metastasis; better-quality studies are needed.

### Comfort feeding only: a proposal to bring clarity to decision-making regarding difficulty with eating for persons with advanced dementia [^112j9tfK]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

Feeding and eating difficulties leading to weight loss are common in the advanced stages of dementia. When such problems arise, family members are often faced with making a decision regarding the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. The existing evidence based on observational studies suggests that feeding tubes do not improve survival or reduce the risk of aspiration, yet the use of feeding tubes is prevalent in patients with dementia, and the majority of nursing home residents do not have orders documenting their wishes about the use of artificial hydration and nutrition. One reason is that orders to forgo artificial hydration and nutrition get wrongly interpreted as "do not feed", resulting in a reluctance of families to agree to them. Furthermore, nursing homes fear regulatory scrutiny of weight loss and wrongly believe that the use of feeding tubes signifies that everything possible is being done. These challenges might be overcome with the creation of clear language that stresses the patient's goals of care. A new order, "comfort feeding only", that states what steps are to be taken to ensure the patient's comfort through an individualized feeding care plan, is proposed. Comfort feeding only through careful hand feeding, if possible, offers a clear goal-oriented alternative to tube feeding and eliminates the apparent care-no care dichotomy imposed by current orders to forgo artificial hydration and nutrition.

### Blended diets and effects on gastrointestinal symptoms in children with gastrostomy tubes: a survey study [^113m9GvD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of respondents (80.8%; 21/26) consider commercial enteral formula the first choice for children with gastrostomy, while for 11.5% (3/26) of the sample, a mix of BD and commercial formula is preferred (Figure 1). The main reason for using BD is definitely parental request (14/26; 53.8%), followed by formula feeding intolerance (6/26; 23.1%) (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Main reasons for using blended diets in children with gastrostomy.

As for the preferred BD composition, there is a clear predominance of home‐made blended feeds (15/26; 57.7%), followed by commercial blended feeds (4/26; 15.3%), a combination of both (4/26; 15.3%), and adjustments based on parents' preferences (1/26; 3.8%). The remaining 7.8% (2/26) confirms not to use BD in clinical practice. The favorite delivery method for BD is the syringe (17/26; 65.4%); pumps are used by 23.1% (6/26), and gravity bags by 7.8% (2/26). The main reasons for not using BD are summarized in Figure 3. For this question more than one answer was possible.

### State-of-the-art review of blenderized diets-status and future directions [^114mb5YN]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 What are the potential benefits of blenderized tube feeds?

3.4.1 Regulation of GI intolerance symptoms?

Some patients on enteral feeds develop recurring feeding intolerance, postprandial gagging, retching, and dumping symptoms that may be attributable to gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or post‐fundoplication increased gastric hypersensitivity, impaired accommodation, and rapid emptying. The various studies conducted thus far have all indicated a positive correlation between change from CMFs to BTFs and improvement in reflux symptoms, gagging, retching, and oral feeding aversions. It is worth noting, however, that most of these reports have been based on retrospective and uncontrolled observational studies. The improved symptoms also allow for faster administration of syringe feedings.

3.4.2 Response of aerodigestive symptoms to BTFs

Chronic cough, aspiration pneumonia, and frequent hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses may represent aerodigestive manifestations of GER induced by bolus gastrostomy feeds. Hron et al. reviewed the clinical outcomes in 70 medically complex children who transitioned to BTFs (n = 42) compared to CMFs (n = 28) and found a significant reduction in the frequency of hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses in association with the transition to BTFs. The increased viscosity of BTF compared to CMF was credited for the anti‐reflux effects.

3.4.3 Response of intestinal microbiome to BTFs

Gallagher et al.examined the intestinal microbiome in 17 medically complex children before and after transitioning from CMF to HBTFs. They found significantly increased bacterial diversity associated with the change in enteral feeds. Chandrasekar et alcompared the fecal microbiome of children on CMF (n = 8) and BTFs (n = 10) and found a trend for greater alpha diversity in association with BTFs. Marchesi et al.examined the fecal microbiomes of children enterally fed with CMF versus HBTFs compared with their healthy siblings consuming a regular diet. They found that children nourished with HBTFs had microbiomes similar to those of their healthy siblings, in contrast to a uniquely different microbiome among children enterally fed with CMF. Furthermore, HBTF induced a more complex microbiome than CBTFs. In contrast, the mechanisms of exclusive enteral nutrition therapy with CMF for disease and symptom remission of Crohn's disease in children involve inducing lower diversity in the gut microbiome. Therefore, dietary interventions that enhance or suppress diversity in the gut microbiome may need to be selected based on clinical status and disease.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^113FDBtu]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

ASGE guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes — In patients with normal foregut anatomy requiring enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG over interventional radiology–guided gastrostomy as the initial approach for gastrostomy, and best practice advice states that transillumination, 1-to-1 indentation, and safe-track needle technique with air aspiration should be performed during PEG and that prophylactic antibiotics (eg, cefazolin) should be administered at the time of initial gastrostomy. For antithrombotic therapy, the ASGE suggests against routine withholding of antiplatelet drugs for PEG and suggests that periprocedural management of anticoagulants be based on a multidisciplinary discussion including the patient, weighting the risk of bleeding vs cardiovascular events; PEG may be performed while patients are on antiplatelet medications, and tightening the bumper for 24 hours then loosening may be considered to tamponade potential bleeding, with caution to avoid excessive tightening to minimize the risk of a buried bumper. For timing of enteral use, the ASGE recommends that PEG tubes may be used for feeding early (within 4 h) over routine delays; medications may be administered immediately after placement when there are no clinical contraindications, and routine measurement of gastric residual volume is not indicated. In malignant dysphagia, the ASGE suggests either transoral PEG or transcutaneous direct PEG; patients should be counseled about the risk of implantation metastasis during informed consent, and the gastrostomy site should be periodically examined to assess for implantation metastasis.

### Preferences of older African-Americans for long-term tube feeding at the end of life [^1158gBgU]. Aging & Mental Health (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to elicit preferences and reasons behind preferences for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement in an older African-American sample. Five focus groups were conducted with subjects invited from the Geriatric Clinic of an urban tertiary care hospital. Thematic and latent content analyses were used. Five broad themes emerged as reasons behind the acceptance or rejection of a PEG tube, namely: the nature of the illness; the quality of life at the time of the decision; the concern about dependency; experiences; and religion (including issues of death). The issue of proxy also arose and contained three themes: fear of loss of decision-making ability; trust in family or caregivers as proxy even when the proxy choices differed from their own choices; and trust in the doctor and family to respect personal decisions. Use of a qualitative approach enabled potentially sensitive issues to be discussed. Preferences and the reasons behind these preferences may not always be anticipated by clinicians.

### Complications of percutaneous gastrostomy and gastrojejunostomy tubes in children [^111UEdd1]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous feeding tubes are generally considered a safe option for enteral feeding and are widely used in children who require long-term nutritional support. However, complications are not infrequent and can range from bothersome to life-threatening. Radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearances of potential complications for optimal patient care. In this review, we discuss radiologic appearances of common complications and less frequent but serious complications related to percutaneous feeding tubes. Additionally, as fluoroscopic feeding tube evaluation is often requested as the initial imaging study, we also discuss the fluoroscopic appearances of some uncommon complications.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: methodology and review of evidence [^111Gwjmj]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

This article from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) provides a full description of the methodology used to inform the final guidance outlined in the accompanying summary and recommendations article for strategies to manage endoscopically placed gastrostomy tubes. This article was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and specifically addresses the utility of PEG versus interventional radiology–guided gastrostomy (IR-G), the need for withholding antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, appropriate timing to initiate tube feedings, and appropriate selection of the gastrostomy technique in patients with malignant dysphagia. In patients needing enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG as the preferred technique for initial gastrostomy over IR-G. The ASGE recommends that tube feeding can be safely started within 4 hours of the gastrostomy without the need for an intentional delay. The ASGE suggests that a PEG can be performed without the need to withhold antiplatelet medications. In patients on anticoagulants who need to undergo PEG placement, the ASGE suggests that the periprocedural management of anticoagulants should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion with the patient regarding the risk of bleeding versus cardiovascular adverse events. In patients with malignant dysphagia, either transoral "Pull" PEG or transcutaneous "Direct" PEG can be performed for initial enteral access.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^116cyQaZ]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Gastroparesis-related enteral access — Proper and early management of mild gastroparesis through diet modifications can effectively divert these risks, and when diet changes are inadequate to manage symptoms and malnutrition is observed, a more aggressive approach is warranted; rehydration and electrolyte replacement are priorities, followed by intravenous (IV) antiemetics and prokinetics, and patients who are unable to maintain hydration, electrolytes within range, and adequate perfusion are candidates for feeding through NJT or jejunostomy tube, with consideration of gastric tubes for decompression or newer combination (gastrostomy with jejunal extension) tubes, while separate tubes for feeding and decompression, although more cumbersome for patients and caregivers, may be beneficial because of the risk of tube migration with compromised peristalsis when using a gastrostomy-jejunostomy tube.

We identified 4 RCTs, which included 290 patients, 145 of whom underwent intentionally delayed tube feed initiation after PEG placement and 145 underwent early tube feed initiation. All studies had Qumseya scores of ≥ 7. Early tube feed initiation was defined variously within 1 hour, within 3 hours, at 3 hours, and at 4 hoursafter PEG tube placement. Intentionally delayed tube feed initiation was performed at 24 hours in 3 of the studies, and the day after PEG placement in 1 study. We additionally identified 4 non-RCT comparative studies comprising 3 retrospective cohorts, and 1 prospective observational study, which included 829 total additional patients, 371 of whom underwent early feeding and 458 underwent delayed feeding. For these non-RCT comparative studies, early tube feed initiation was defined at 3 hours, before 4 hours, or at or before 4 hours after PEG placement. Tube feed initiation was considered delayed if performed at or later than 4 hours, more than 4 hours, between 4 and 24 hours, or 16 to 24 hours after PEG placement.

For the meta-analysis, we defined early tube feed initiation at or before 4 hours after PEG tube placement and delayed initiation over 4 hours after PEG placement. Hence, 1 retrospective cohortthat considered early tube feed initiation before 24 hours and delayed after 24 hours was excluded from our analysis. Outcomes were measured for both the RCTs alone and the RCTs and non-RCTs combined (total 516 early and 603 delayed initiations of feeding) (Tables 4 and 5). Definitions/criteria for clinical adverse events were not standardized or consistently reported for the included studies. Tube feed type and administration (aside from timing) was also not standardized or consistently reported.

Gastrostomy feeding tubes — tube malfunction with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) versus interventional radiology–guided gastrostomy (IR-G) shows lower malfunction with PEG, with incidence 11.9% (274 of 2302) for PEG versus 19.3% (398 of 2060) for IR-G and pooled effect OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28–0.92; p = 0.02. Definitions of "tube malfunction" varied across studies and included tube dislodgment, clogging, replacement, peristomal erythema, and pain, and evidence was rated down for quality due to this variation. A recently published meta-analysis, including 3 large administrative databases, similarly found lower malfunction with PEG (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33–0.95; p = 0.03). The panel noted that IR-G commonly uses 18F tubes, thinner than PEG tubes (typically 20F to 24F), that the larger PEG tube diameter is very likely associated with a lower risk of clogging, and that observed differences may reflect tube size as well as technique; a patient representative reported prior tube-related malfunction with an IR-G but no adverse experience after a subsequent PEG.

ASGE guideline — early tube feed initiation after PEG includes practice recommendations and caveats. The panel made a strong recommendation for early initiation of tube feed after PEG tube placement with overall low to moderate quality evidence. The panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement should not be performed. The panel noted a misconception that delaying feeds allows the stoma to heal and stated the stoma site takes at least several weeks to heal. It emphasized that early initiation may not be clinically appropriate in some situations (patients on vasopressors, with severe ileus or obstruction, or with bowel ischemia) and that early initiation may not always be feasible due to logistics. The panel also noted that medications may be given immediately via the PEG after placement unless there are contraindications to enteral medications.

American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline — percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) versus interventional radiology–guided gastrostomy (IR-G) and periprocedural medication management provides that, in patients needing enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG as the preferred technique for initial gastrostomy over IR-G, and the ASGE recommends that tube feeding can be safely started within 4 hours of the gastrostomy without the need for an intentional delay. The ASGE suggests that a PEG can be performed without the need to withhold antiplatelet medications. In patients on anticoagulants who need to undergo PEG placement, the ASGE suggests that the periprocedural management of anticoagulants should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion with the patient regarding the risk of bleeding versus cardiovascular adverse events. In patients with malignant dysphagia, either transoral "Pull" PEG or transcutaneous "Direct" PEG can be performed for initial enteral access.

Mortality

For all-cause mortality at 30 days, data from 2 RCT and 3 non-RCT studies, demonstrated similar mortality (9.3% for delayed vs 12% for early, OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.51–1.35; p = 0.45) (Fig. 10). When including only the 2 RCTs, mortality rates were statistically comparable (23.3% for delayed vs 24.6% for early, relative risk ratio [RR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.06–14.00; p = 0.79) (Fig. 11). While assessing the certainty of evidence, we rated down for imprecision.

Short-term (< 72 hours) mortality was examined in 3 studies, which demonstrated no statistically significant difference (1.3% for delayed vs 1.6% for early, OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.24–4.8; p = 0.94) (Fig. 12). When considering only the 2 RCTs, no significant mortality difference was noted (6.7% vs 3.3%, RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.03–95.63; p = 0.31) (Fig. 13). The evidence was rated down for imprecision.

Adverse events

All 8 studies examined adverse events and demonstrated no difference in the incidence of adverse events (15.4% for delayed vs 18.4% for early, OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.69–1.35; p = 0.85) (Fig. 14). When including only the 4 RCTs, no statistically significant difference was observed (12.4% vs 12.4%, RR 1.02; 95% CI, 0.23–4.47; p = 0.96) (Fig. 15). The evidence was rated down for imprecision.

### Bolus versus continuous feeding regimens post gastrostomy tube placement in children [^111YjWiS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Owing to the frequency of gastrostomy tube placement in children and the numerous regimens used to start feeds after placement we attempted to see if it matters if the initial feeds after a gastrostomy tube placement are provided in a bolus or continuous manner.

Methods

Using a prospective randomized trial, children were randomized to initial bolus or continuous chimney feeding after gastrostomy tube placement. Feeding tolerance and complications related to the gastrostomy tube were collected for 4 weeks after placement.

Results

Demographics were similar in the two groups. Times to goal feeds were similar in both groups, but in the first two weeks more feeding modifications were required in the bolus group. Other than the rate of leakage during the second week after placement which occurred more in the bolus group, all other clinical outcomes were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Other than minor, clinically insignificant differences noted above, the method of initial feeding after a gastrostomy tube placement does not affect feeding tolerance or gastrostomy tube complication in the first month after placement.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic, level II.

### American Geriatrics Society feeding tubes in advanced dementia position statement [^1134adD1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Advanced dementia — oral feeding approaches and care practices note that oral feeding may be one of few remaining pleasures and a time for socialization for a person with advanced dementia, and diets should be liberalized based on resident preference, and adequate fluids should be given with feedings to enhance the taste of foods. Continued careful hand feeding should be considered to be an accepted alternative to tube feeding, and feeding tubes should never be viewed as a cheaper, more efficient way of feeding. When individuals with advanced dementia develop a loss of appetite, weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or aspiration, a discussion of feeding should occur without delay, which should involve a multidisciplinary assessment of reversible causes of not eating and discussions with family about the plan of care in relation to the stage of dementia. Tube feeding is a medical therapy that an individual's surrogate decision-maker can decline or accept in accordance with advance directives, previously stated wishes, or what it is thought the individual would want.

Feeding tube placement in patients at increased risk of aspiration is guided by society recommendations and evidence. The 2016 ASPEN guidelines for critical care recommend initiation of gastric feeding for most ICU patients, although patients with increased aspiration risk should have postpyloric placement. The 2018 ESPEN guidelines agree and go a step further to specify that jejunal feeding would be preferred in high-risk patients. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies showed a decreased rate of pneumonia with postpyloric placement, as well as increased nutrient delivery, and if postpyloric placement is not feasible and the patient is fed via gastric placement, it is imperative to monitor closely for signs and symptoms of aspiration and intolerance.

### How often should percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tubes be replaced? A single-institute retrospective study [^112wgXTK]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Since Gauderer et al introduced PG for the long-term nutritional support of paediatric patients in 1980, the demand for PG placement has risen as the numbers of patients in nursing homes and geriatric long-term care facilities have broadly increased. According to National Hospital Discharge Survey analyses performed by Grant and Herman, there was a dramatic increase in the incidence rates of PG between 1988 and 1999 (from 61 000 to 138 000); moreover, PG accounted for 10.9 per 1000 discharges (1.09%) among hospitalised patients aged 65 years or older in the USA.

Very limited data are available from few studies that compared the longevities of tubes made of different materials such as latex, silicone, and polyurethane. Although certain studies were designed as randomised controlled trials, comparisons between the types (pull vs balloon) and sizes of PG tubes were not performed in detail, and the sample sizes in each study were small.

Our current study compared the longevities of four different types of silicone-based PG-related enteral feeding tubes, and included approximately 600 samples. The median tube exchange intervals were 13 months, 7 months, 5.5 months, and 55 days for PGP, PGB, PGJL, and PGJM, respectively. When we compared our results to those of previous studies, the median exchange interval of PGP was longer than those found in randomised controlled trials of silicone-based PG tubes. Likewise, median PGB exchange intervals were longer than those previously determined for five silicone-based commercial PGB tubes online supplemental table 1.

While the common sense notion is that a larger diameter tube ought to have a longer half-life and a lower risk of occlusion, there have been no trials to investigate this hypothesis. We found that a larger PGB tube diameter was indeed associated with a longer median exchange interval that increased stepwise going from 18 to 20 to 24 Fr.

### American Geriatrics Society feeding tubes in advanced dementia position statement [^113xVc4P]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

Advanced dementia — eating difficulties and outcomes are summarized, noting that eating difficulties are considered a natural part of the disease process and, when persistent, characterize the end stage of dementia. In the Choices, Attitudes, and Strategies for Care of Advanced Dementia at the End-of-Life (CASCADE) study that followed individuals with advanced dementia over 18 months, more than 85% of the study cohort experienced eating difficulties, with subsequent 6-month mortality approaching 50%. Pneumonia, febrile episodes, and eating problems indicate a transition from advanced dementia to end of life, with each of these "complications" having a 6-month mortality that approaches 50%. Once persistent eating difficulties arise, family caregivers are often confronted with decisions that typically include whether to continue hand feeding or initiate tube feeding (through placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or feeding tube), and the preponderance of evidence does not support the use of tube feeding to avoid eating difficulties in older adults with advanced dementia.

Management options

Assess first whether leakage is caused by a problem of the tube itself (eg, poorly fitting tube or connected administration set, inside blockage, kinking, degeneration or cracking).
Specify the nature of the leakage (eg, feed, fluids, gastric contents). The pH can be tested using a pH indicator strip.
Stop tube feeding and investigate if leakage is seen within the first 72 hours and if it is associated with pain following initial gastrostomy tube insertion.
Protect the surrounding skin using a barrier film or cream.
Place a foam dressing or a super absorbent gauze dressing under the fixation device to absorb exudate and protect the exit site from further irritation/maceration.
Ask for a wound care consultant.
Uncap the tube and connect it to a drainage bag; or use a stoma bag (with adequate skin protection) placed over the ostomy site to collect excess leakage.
Review medication and consider starting antisecretory therapy (proton pump inhibitor).
Do not replace the initial tube by a larger diameter tube as this may cause enlargement of the tract, resulting in exacerbation of the leakage.
Remove and place a new PEG at a different site allowing the original site to close and heal.
Convert the PEG to a PEG-J (postpyloric feeding line through the PEG tube) for jejunal feeding, potentially combined with gastric drainage.

### Enteral tube feeding for older people with advanced dementia [^115yKhCz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The use of enteral tube feeding for patients with advanced dementia who have poor nutritional intake is common. In one US survey 34% of 186,835 nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment were tube fed. Potential benefits or harms of this practice are unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the outcome of enteral tube nutrition for older people with advanced dementia who develop problems with eating and swallowing and/or have poor nutritional intake.

Search Strategy

The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched in April 2008. Citation checking was undertaken. Where it was not possible to accept or reject, the full text of the citation was obtained for further evaluation.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies that evaluated the effectiveness of enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube or via a tube passed by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were planned to be included. In addition, controlled observational studies were included. The study population comprised adults aged 50 and over (either sex), with a diagnosis of primary degenerative dementia made according to validated diagnostic criteria such as DSM-IV or ICD-10 (APA 1994; WHO 1993) and with advanced cognitive impairment defined by a recognised and validated tool or by clinical assessment and had poor nutrition intake and/or develop problems with eating and swallowing. Where data were limited we also considered studies in which the majority of participants had dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted and assessed by one reviewer, checked by a second and if necessary, in the case of any disagreement or discrepancy it was planned that it would be reviewed by the third reviewer. Where information was lacking, we attempted contact with authors. It was planned that meta-analysis would be considered for RCTs with comparable key characteristics. The primary outcomes were survival and quality of life (QoL).

Main Results

No RCTs were identified. Seven observational controlled studies were identified. Six assessed mortality. The other study assessed nutritional outcomes. There was no evidence of increased survival in patients receiving enteral tube feeding. None of the studies examined QoL and there was no evidence of benefit in terms of nutritional status or the prevalence of pressure ulcers.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the very large number of patients receiving this intervention, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that enteral tube feeding is beneficial in patients with advanced dementia. Data are lacking on the adverse effects of this intervention.

### Can an effective end-of-life intervention for advanced dementia be viewed as moral? [^114YDU4K]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

2 A BRIEF PERSPECTIVE ON TUBE FEEDING

The history of forgoing tube feeding in advanced dementia provides a perspective for forgoing assisted oral feeding. Box 3 summarizes the 2021 findings of Davies et al.

This review validates the Alzheimer's Association's 2015 position and recommendations in "Feeding Issues in Advanced Dementia". It stated, "In comparison with careful hand‐feeding, tube feeding by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or nasogastric tube offers no advantages and incurs a number of disadvantages", and, "It is ethically permissible to withhold nutrition and hydration artificially administered… in the end stages of the disease".

While the Alzheimer's Association's position statement "encouraged surrogates to discuss the risks and benefits of all feeding alternatives… consistent with the person's values", it did not consider the decision to withdraw "careful hand feeding" among "all alternatives". Yet this may be the last resort for many PLADs who want a peaceful and timely dying. This article focuses on the debate regarding whether this intervention can be considered moral, and therefore acceptable, which is required for those in power to implement it.

In 2019, the controversy regarding ceasing assisted feeding reached national proportions after ethicists at AMDA — The Society for Post‐Acute and Long‐Term Care Medicine — proposed Policy A19, which was adopted. (AMDA's 5000 member/providers care for residential patients in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.) Policy A19 categorically recommended not honoring any advance directive that conditionally requested ceasing assisted feeding unless providers interpreted patients' behavior as being consistent with refusal or distress. The interpretation of non‐verbal patients' behavior is fraught with false negatives and false positives, the magnitudes of which are not known.

### Use of feeding tubes among hospitalized older adults with dementia [^115EaS3g]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Receipt of Feeding Tubes

Receipt of a feeding tube was defined using a combination of Canadian Classification of Health Interventions codes and OHIP fee codes billed by physicians indicating insertion of a gastrostomy, gastrostomy-jejunostomy, or jejunostomy tube during index hospitalization. Further details are given in eTable 3 in Supplement 1.

Cohort Characteristics

We described the following characteristics of all individuals in this cohort: age at admission, sex, neighborhood income quintile (based on postal codes linked to the 2016 census data), and rurality (defined by Statistics Canada as living in a rural or small community with a population size < 10 000 persons outside the commuting zone of larger urban centers). Among those who received an RAI-HC or RAI-MDS assessment, we also reported the following: marital status, presence of chewing or swallowing problems, relationship with their primary caregiver (only RAI-HC), and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-hospitalize (DNH) orders (only RAI-MDS). We also reported their health profiles and functional and cognitive status as measured by the Activities of Daily Living Self-Performance Hierarchy Scale (ADL-H; scores range from 0–6), the Cognitive Performance Scale (scores range from 0–6), and the Changes in Health, End-Stage Disease and Signs and Symptoms Scale (CHESS; scores range from 0–5), which is a measure of health instabilities and an indicator of being at the end of life. Details of these scales have been previously reported and found to be valid, and reliable. Higher scores on these measures indicate higher levels of impairment or instability.

Characteristics of the Hospitalization and Outcomes Post Hospitalization

We examined the following characteristics captured during individuals' index hospitalization: (1) the proportion admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization and mean length of stay (in days) in the ICU; (2) among those who received a feeding tube, mean time from admission to receipt of feeding tube and hospital length of stay (in days); and (3) discharge disposition, specifically whether individuals died in hospital or were discharged home, to the ICU, or to inpatient care. We reported 14-, 30-, 90-, 180-, and 360-day mortality rates from admission date of index hospitalization. Among those who survived until discharge from index hospitalization, we examined rates of mortality and rehospitalization or emergency department visits within 1 year post discharge.

### Helping children stop or avoid enteral feeding [^113BWAwV]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Lessons and Limitations

Team members work only between one and five session per week on the team, so we cannot undertake more intensive work or manage children as in-patients. We mainly co–consult, which is very effective, but this limits the number of children we can see to a maximum of eight per week. This can make it difficult to reappoint children timeously after a missed appointment and a recent audit suggested that this can lead to delays in the weaning process.

Early in the clinic we encouraged children who could drink to transfer straight from enteral feeds on to high energy oral sip feeds. While most of these children then progressed on to a normal diet, two children then remained on a wholly liquid diet for many years and one of these transferred onto adult service still not eating any solid food. Since then we have learned that a slower transition onto normal food allows a gradual and more successful acquisition of feeding skills.

We have also managed a handful of children whose parents chose to withdraw their feeds very rapidly. In two of these cases the children had residual oromotor difficulties and became significantly undernourished before restarting tube feeds, while another young person showed no inclination to eat and after 10 days insisted on restarting enteral feeds. Only one of these children has since been successfully weaned. We learned from this that weaning should be only be undertaken at a pace congruent with the child's oromotor development and that over-rapid withdrawal may cause rejection of future attempt to wean.

### The role of endoscopically placed feeding or decompression tubes [^1112vPt6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The minimally invasive nature of endoscopically placed gastrostomy tubes makes them a viable consideration in palliative care. Complications related to the procedure appear to correlate with age and underlying comorbidities. However, in many instances, the scientific basis for establishing benefit or harm from tube placement is methodologically inadequate. Decisions must be preceded by a discussion of the value and potential risk of artificial nutrition in a particular setting, respecting the wishes and beliefs of each patient and his or her family. The decision to use PEG placement for any reason should be consistent with legal and ethical principles, reflect patient autonomy over any other consideration (including beneficence), and arise from a clear determination of the goals of care (and whether the PEG placement will truly help meet those goals). Whenever possible, further studies with better design are needed to evaluate whether the use of PEG truly affects quality of life and patient outcome in palliative care. PEG tubes for decompression are placed successfully most of the time. Symptom relief occurs usually within 7 days of the procedure. Overall, the morbidity related to the PEG procedure for decompression is only slightly higher than when the same technique is used for nutritional purposes. The appropriate timing for PEG tube placement for nutritional support and for decompression throughout the course of disease progression may be difficult to determine and yet may be a factor in its overall efficiency. Only minor modifications of the basic technique used for PEG placement for nutritional purposes are required to adapt the technique to a variety of other applications in palliative care.

### Nutrition assessment and support of organ transplant recipients [^112RpJpk]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Timely nutrition assessment and intervention in organ transplant recipients may improve outcomes surrounding transplantation. A pretransplant nutrition assessment should include a variety of parameters including physical assessment, history, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory tests. Malnutrition compromises posttransplant survival; prolonged waiting times worsen outcomes when patients are already malnourished. Severe obesity may decrease graft function and survival in kidney transplant recipients. In the pretransplant phase, nutritional goals include optimization of nutritional status and treatment of nutrition-related symptoms induced by organ failure. Enteral tube feeding is indicated for patients with functional gastrointestinal tracts who are not eating adequately. Parenteral nutrition is rarely needed pretransplant except in cases of intestinal failure. When determining pretransplant nutrient requirements, nutritional status, weight, age, gender, metabolic state, stage and type of organ failure, malabsorption, induced losses, goals, and comorbid conditions must be considered. During the acute posttransplant phase, adequate nutrition is required to help prevent infection, promote wound healing, support metabolic demands, replenish lost stores, and perhaps mediate the immune response. Nutrient recommendations reflect posttransplant metabolic changes. The appropriateness of posttransplant nutrition support depends on the prevalence of malnutrition among patients with a specific type of organ failure and the benefits when nutrition support is given. Organ transplantation complications including rejection, infection, wound healing, renal insufficiency, hyperglycemia, and surgical complications require specific nutritional requirements and therapies. Many potential applications of nutrition in the pre- and posttransplant phases exist and require further study.

This guideline document was prepared by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy using the best available scientific evidence and considering a multitude of variables including, but not limited to, adverse events, patients' values, and cost implications. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide the best practice recommendations that may help standardize patient care, improve patient outcomes, and reduce variability in practice.

We recognize that clinical decision-making is complex. Guidelines, therefore, are not a substitute for a clinician's judgment. Such judgments may, at times, seem contradictory to our guidance due to many factors that are impossible to fully consider by guideline developers. Any clinical decisions should be based on the clinician's experience, local expertise, resource availability, and patient values and preferences.

This article is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care, or as encouraging, advocating for, mandating, or discouraging any particular treatment. Our guidelines should not be used in support of medical complaints, legal proceedings, and/or litigation, as they were not designed for this purpose.

### A systematic review and quality appraisal of guidelines and recommendations for home enteral tube feeding in adults [^113tSQ3v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The practical utility of a guideline is only possible when developed with a plan of implementation. Most guidelines disregarded facilitators, barriers, and resource considerations to applying their recommendations. Qualitative studies with HETF service users and providers have highlighted the benefit of having access to providers with expertise in HETF including management of complications. There are often financial barriers however in accessing services and challenges with co-ordinating care by a multidisciplinary team. Oftentimes what may be clinically most suitable for a patient (e.g. feeding mode, formula choice or frequency of review) may not be feasible within the client and health service resources. Guidelines acknowledged implementation barriers and facilitators although tools and resources to address these were infrequently provided as were monitoring and auditing criteria. This may in part be secondary to the minimal involvement of key stakeholders in the development process and external review of these guidelines. Quality appraisals of guidelines for critical care nutrition and medical nutrition therapy in liver cirrhosis have also highlighted similar limitations in stakeholder consultation, applicability and consideration of values and preferences in formulating recommendations. Economic analyses are also crucial in assuring the implementability of recommendations although were noticeably absent in the guidelines assessed. Cost savings have been reported with the implementation of HETF-dedicated outpatient clinics and advanced practice dietitian roles in gastrostomy management – both practices which would have allowed for closer adherence to HETF guidelines. With ethical restrictions in the conduct of RCTs, economic modelling may serve as a more suitable approach to showcase the benefit of recommendations made for this population group.

All three high quality guidelines were recommended for use with modifications secondary to the prospect of improving quality with subsequent updates. NICE guidance was originally developed over two decades ago with an overall high methodological quality although with some informal consensus methods. New evidence has been considered in the need to update this guideline and some supporting tools to facilitate implementation have been provided although the healthcare space has changed drastically since its original inception. For instance, community-based replacement of gastrostomy tubes following traumatic displacement has become more commonplace following the COVID-19 pandemic with the NHS also issuing a recovery plan for urgent and emergency services which involved expanded community services. The guideline would now likely benefit from more current and meaningful consultation with stakeholders to ensure its relevance and usability. Similarly, ESPEN guidelines' quality could also be improved through wider or more clearly explicated consultation with consumers and policymakers. This has proven difficult secondary to unclear guidance although some direction has been provided and the Cochrane Multi-Stakeholder Engagement (MuSE) Consortium seeks to provide guidance on the matter.

### Tolerance to nasogastric tube feedings… [^114YASjY]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE PRESENT study was undertaken because of the frequent occurrence of diarrhea among patients receiving a standard tube-feeding formula which has been in use at the Mayo Clinic for five years. 1 While many patients have tolerated the formula well over long periods of time, the incidence of frank diarrhea, sometimes within a few hours of the first feeding, has seemed high enough to cast suspicion on the formula itself as being the causative factor in some instances. An examination of the composition of this formula reveals it to be very high in protein and carbohydrate and very low in fat, as compared with a normal diet, 2 with most of the protein and carbohydrate being derived from milk. The aims of the study were to determine the frequency of occurrence of symptoms of intolerance among patients taking the standard tube-feeding formula. SMITH EB, WOLLAEGER EE, VICTOR SM.

Noted gaps include that feeding tubes often require periodic exchange with limited evidence-based protocols and that adverse events in ascites can include bacterial peritonitis, failure of tract maturation, and leakage of peritoneal fluid after PEG removal; there is also a low but finite risk of implantation metastasis with PEG, including the pull technique.

ASGE guideline — early versus intentionally delayed feeding after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is addressed with defined timing and evidence scope. "Recommendation 3. In patients who undergo PEG placement, the ASGE recommends that PEG tubes may be used for feeding early (within 4 hours) over routine delays in initiation (strong recommendation and low to moderate quality of evidence)". The review identified "4 RCTs, which included 290 patients, 145 of whom underwent intentionally delayed tube feed initiation after PEG placement and 145 underwent early tube feed initiation", with early defined "within 1 hour", "within 3 hours", "at 3 hours", or "at 4 hours" after placement and delayed at "24 hours" in most RCTs. Additional evidence included "4 non-RCT comparative studies comprising 3 retrospective cohorts and 1 prospective observational study", totaling "829 total additional patients, 371 of whom underwent early feeding and 458 underwent delayed feeding", where early was defined as "at 3 hours", "before 4 hours after PEG placement", "within 4 hours", or "at or before 4 hours after PEG placement", and delayed as "at or later than 4 hours", "more than 4 hours", "between 4 and 24 hours", or "16 to 24 hours after PEG placement"; outcomes of interest included "all-cause mortality at 30 days, short-term mortality (< 72 hours), adverse events, vomiting, aspiration, peristomal leak, wound infection, and PEG site stomatitis".

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^114yBgtN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — gastric versus post-pyloric feeding and aspiration risk: Conversion to a post-pyloric feeding tube should be carried out only when gastric feeding has been shown to be poorly tolerated or the patient is at high risk for aspiration (strong recommendation, moderate-to-high level of evidence). Simultaneous aspiration/decompression may be accomplished using a dual lumen aspirated nasoenteric tube, a combined percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy (GJ) tube, or both gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). The incidence of reflux, regurgitation, and aspiration all decrease significantly as infusion is diverted from the stomach to the proximal jejunum, and a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs showed a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia with small bowel compared with gastric feeding while duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality did not change. Although gastrointestinal dysfunction occurs in 30–70% of ICU patients, most will tolerate gastric feeding, and small bowel placement may delay initiation because it requires greater expertise.

### Nonoral feeding for children and youth with developmental or acquired disabilities… [^114NddHV]. publications.aap.org (2014). Low credibility.

Children Who Have Myelomeningocele A common feature among children who have myelomeningocele is the presence of a Chiari II malformation, which can be associated with central apnea and/or dysphagia. In infants, the "suck, swallow, breathe" rhythm can be disrupted. Excessive gag reflex can be confused with GER. Children who have vocal cord dysfunction related to the Chiari II malformation may require tracheotomy; not uncommonly, nonoral feeding via gastrostomy tube is recommended for pulmonary safety. 20 For infants affected by these conditions, nasogastric tube feeding or gastrostomy tube feeding may be required from birth for months at a minimum. 28 Reid and colleagues provide an excellent review of feeding issues relative to cleft lip, cleft palate, Pierre-Robin sequence, and other cleft conditions. Their longitudinal studies spotlight the conditions for which adjunctive nonoral feeding measures might be indicated.
29.

30 The reflux can be related to a spectrum of underlying and sometimes uncommon conditions, including anatomic conditions, such as hiatal hernias or structural anomalies. Helicobacter pylori gastritis as a cause remains a point of debate. 31, 32 Celiac disease can be a comorbid condition in various genetic syndromes. 33, 34 Behavioral characteristics, related to underlying pain or temperament differences, can be confused with GER. Eosinophilic esophagitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in children not responding to appropriate reflux management.
35. It is important to also consider a primary underlying central nervous system injury in the differential. For example, a group of infants who had either perinatal injury or dysphagia without specific etiology were found to have high-intensity lesions in the lower pons and medulla and pontomedullary atrophy on MRI studies.

This suggests that a vagovagal reflex, mediated by brainstem function, might contribute to the disturbed motility of the upper digestive tract in some children. In some circumstances, families and members of their support system may decide against further nonoral nutrition/hydration interventions. 40 The complexities and contradictions in "coming to consensus" on this topic were nicely outlined with several concerns generated from families: Is the enteral feeding a confirmation of the permanence of the child's disability. Will it increase discrimination and be viewed as additional stigma. Will it produce a loss of the nurturing, parental experience for the caregiver.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with antithrombotic therapy — bleeding risk and periprocedural management are characterized with defined outcomes and ASGE suggestions. Significant bleeding is defined as requiring endoscopic intervention, transfusion requirements, hemoglobin drop of ≥ 2 g/dL, or clinical signs of active bleeding. Compared with patients not on aspirin, those on aspirin did not have a significant increase in bleeding (4 studies; OR, 1.39; 95% CI, .56–3.44; p = 0.32), and patients on clopidogrel did not have an increased rate of bleeding (4 studies; OR, 1.26; 95% CI, .18–8.81; p = 0.72). No increase in bleeding was found with dual-antiplatelet therapy, although only 2 studies reported patient-level data (OR, .75; 95% CI, .16–3.59; p = 0.25), and the rate of bleeding for patients on anticoagulation compared with not on anticoagulation also did not differ, with only 2 studies available. The panel noted that withholding antithrombotic medications could result in harm, particularly an increased risk of cardiovascular events, and the ASGE suggests against routine withholding of antiplatelet drugs, including dual-antiplatelet therapy, in patients who need to undergo PEG tube placement; additionally, the ASGE suggests that the periprocedural management of anticoagulants should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion including the patient and their representatives.

### Buried bumper syndrome [^116smAqQ]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Buried bumper syndrome is suspected if there is increased leakage around the PEG tube. Other signs include resistance to infusion and/or abdominal pain with infusion of feeding. Induration of the tissue surrounding the tract can be seen. There may be a history of the PEG tube being forcibly pulled. On physical examination, the internal bumper may be palpable.

Once the internal bumper is trapped in the gastrostomy tract, the cardinal feature of buried bumper syndrome is the impossibility of advancing the tube and the internal bumper farther into the stomach with the external bumper/bolster moved back. Initially there will be difficulty in rotating the PEG tube. With continued feeding, the tract may expand, and rotation of the tube will be become possible, as in our case.

The ideal way to diagnose buried bumper syndrome is with endoscopy, in which the internal bumper is seen buried within the gastric wall. With imaging, a CT scan may show a migrated internal bumper. Fluoroscopy through the PEG tube will still show contrast material entering the stomach because the gastrostomy tract is still open, and the diagnosis may be missed.

### Blended diets and effects on gastrointestinal symptoms in children with gastrostomy tubes: a survey study [^111UHPGr]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

An additional factor for not using BD could be self‐confidence in the management of this nutritional strategy. Notably, although our sample includes mainly highly experienced Pediatric Gastroenterologists, only a minority of the respondents (38.5%) states to have an advanced level of experience with the use of BD, while most of the sample (61.6%) declares to have a low level of experience or to need support/supervision for the use of BD in clinical practice. In fact, as already reported by Eustace et al. increasing interest on BD does not parallel with physicians' familiarity with this nutritional option, highlighting the need for specific education of healthcare professionals caring for enterally fed patients. The Authors detected an overall poor level of confidence with BD among physicians and advanced practice providers, probably due to the lack of previous training or guidance on BD, with 73.3% of the sample feeling either not very confident or not confident at all, in line with data from our sample. A useful support for healthcare professionals working in the field of home enteral tube‐feeding is represented by practice toolkits defined by scientific associations, that provide basic background to BD use and best practice guidance on nutritional adequacy, food preparation, administration of feeds, and clinical monitoring.

Data from our sample show that the main reasons for using BD are parental request and formula feeding intolerance, in line with an investigation involving Greek Registered Dietitians that identified as primary reasons for BD prescription parental request (72%) and improvement of food tolerance (22.9%). Regarding parental request, the adoption of a home‐made BD can enhance caregivers' satisfaction. As reported by Hron et al.parents who administer a BD feel gratified by the alignment of their child's nutritional regimen with familial philosophy, and by the reduced medicalization of daily routine. As for feeding intolerance management, several studies report that patients unable to tolerate standard commercial EN formula may benefit from BD use. Specifically, a significant improvement in constipation, nausea/vomiting, and reflux with reduced need of anti‐reflux medications is reported in children fed BD compared to those receiving standard commercial EN. Data from our sample are consistent with these results, as most of the respondents report a positive effect on vomiting, constipation and nausea.

### Jejunal feeding: when is it the right thing to do? [^1137tdp6]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to commence jejunal feeding in patients with structural abnormalities, which prevent oral or intragastric feeding, is usually straightforward. However, decisions surrounding the need for jejunal feeding can be more complex in individuals with no clear structural abnormality, but rather with foregut symptoms and pain-predominant presentations, suggesting a functional origin. This appears to be an increasing issue in polysymptomatic patients with multi-system involvement. We review the differential diagnosis together with the limitations of available functional clinical tests; symptomatic management options to avoid escalation where possible including for patients on opioids; tube feeding options where necessary; and an approach to weaning from established jejunal feeding in the context of a multidisciplinary approach to minimise iatrogenesis.

Enteral nutrition timing after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement — Given the lack of significant difference in outcomes between the early and delayed feeding groups, the panel made a recommendation for early (within 4 hours) versus intentionally delayed tube feed initiation after PEG tube placement and rated the evidence as moderate quality. Early tube feeding after PEG tube placement may not be clinically appropriate in certain situations, including severe ileus, obstruction, or bowel ischemia, and in most cases medications may be given immediately through the PEG tube after placement unless there are contraindications to enteral medications. Based on the available evidence, the panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement is not indicated.

Enteral access modality selection — Based on low-quality evidence and lower risk of all-cause mortality and tube malfunction, the panel made a conditional recommendation for PEG compared with IR-G; accordingly, the ASGE suggests PEG over IR-G as the modality of choice for initial enteral access. The panel also noted that in situations where IR-G is frequently performed or PEG is unavailable, IR-G can be considered an appropriate method for enteral access, and that IR-G feeding tubes are typically of a smaller diameter (12F-18F) that predisposes them to tube-related malfunction, including clogging and need for readjustment.

### Gastrostomy tube feeding in children with epidermolysis bullosa: consideration of key issues [^115912CU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Complications of severe forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) almost invariably lead to chronic malnutrition, jeopardizing immune status, growth, iron status, bone health, wound healing, and quality of life. Although gastrostomy tube (G-tube) feeding has successfully addressed the difficulties of providing nutrition and medications in some children attending our center, others have developed problems such as abdominal distension, poor feed tolerance, and leakage of gastric contents with persistent localized skin ulceration, posing enormous challenges to skin management and nutritional maintenance. Suspicions that G-tube placement and feeding cause or exacerbate these problems has led to a decline in placements at our center over the last 10 years. We therefore recognized that it should not be rejected without due consideration of why some patients seem more prone to complications than others. Thus, information on selected issues and outcomes of G-tube placement was obtained from records of 66 patients undergoing surgery between 1989 and 2008. The complex interrelationships of the sequelae of severe EB, changes in practice over 20 years and lack of data for patients treated early in the series make it impossible to draw firm conclusions at this stage, however, our scrutiny provides valuable information on which to base debate and future studies. It also offers well as useful insights for fellow professionals involved in nutrition support in children with severe EB.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^1114qEh3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Nutritional therapy at end-of-life — gastrostomy decisions and strength of recommendations. The decision to place a gastrostomy tube in an end-of-life situation should be determined by patient autonomy and the wishes of that patient and their family, even though the nutrition therapy may do little to change traditional clinical outcomes (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). Regardless of prognosis, placement of a gastrostomy device should be based on whether achieving enteral access and initiating EN successfully meet the goals of the patient and/or their family, and percutaneous gastrostomy placement should be considered even if the only benefit is to improve family quality of life, ease of providing nutrition/hydration/medications, or facilitate transfer closer to home (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### Early versus late tube feeding initiation after PEG tube placement: does time to feeding matter? [^116j4NJb]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Variation exists in the timing of tube feed initiation after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The aim of our study was to review outcomes of early tube feed (ETF) versus late tube feed (LTF) initiation after PEG tube placement.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all trauma patients who underwent PEG tube placement from 1/2014 to 12/2018. ETF was defined as initiation < 24 h and LTF > 24 h after placement. The primary outcome measure was feeding intolerance and secondary outcomes included post-operative complications. All statistical analyses were performed using standard statistical methods (e.g. Pearson's Chi-squared, Fisher's exact and Mann Whitney-U tests).

Results

There were 295 patients (164 ETF and 131 LTF) that received a PEG tube at our level 1 trauma center. There was no difference with feeding intolerance at 12 h (5% vs. 4%; p = 0.88), 24 h (1% vs. 2%; p = 1.00), and 48 h (4% vs. 4%; p = 1.00). There was no difference when comparing intolerance symptoms such as nausea and vomiting (1% vs. 2%; p = 0.79), abdominal tenderness (2% vs. 3%; p = 0.76), high gastric residuals (2% vs. 2%; p = 1.00) and aspiration (0% vs. 2%; p = 0.39). There was no difference when comparing post-operative complications (4% vs. 8%; p = 0.21).

Conclusions

Early tube feeding after PEG placement is safe and equivalent to late tube feeding in the adult trauma population. Future prospective studies are warranted to establish the optimal timing for initiation of tube feeds after PEG tube placement.

### Decision-making around gastrostomy-feeding in children with neurologic disabilities [^116LHtjN]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to understand the decision-making experiences, perspectives, and beliefs of parents of children with a neurologic disability around gastrostomy tube-feeding.

Design and Methods

We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies to explore the experiences of parents of children with a neurologic disability around gastrostomy-feeding. We searched 5 electronic databases from inception to July 2010. Two authors independently selected articles and extracted data. Concepts and themes relevant to decision-making were constructed by using thematic analysis.

Results

Eleven studies were selected in which experiences relevant to decision-making were reported. The decision-making process was characterized by decisional conflict. Concepts important to understanding conflict were categorized under 3 themes: values; context; and process. The value and meaning of feeding by mouth and, in contrast, with a gastrostomy tube was the dominant theme that led to internal distress for parents in decision. Feeding by mouth was seen as an enjoyable activity, an important social process, but also a struggle. Gastrostomy-feeding represented a loss of normality, a sign of disability, and a disruption of maternal nurturing and bonding. Context (child and family characteristics) and process (information sharing and support) modified the decision-making experience.

Conclusions

Values associated with gastrostomy-feeding and feeding by mouth, the context of child and family, and the process of decision-making facilitated by the health care system shape parental experiences and decisional conflict. This framework will help guide interventions, such as patient decision aids, that are aimed at improving parental decision-making.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^115RQFrr]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding initiation — Recommendation 3 states that in patients who undergo PEG tube placement, the ASGE recommends that PEG tubes may be used for feeding early (within 4 hours) over routine delays in initiation, with a strong recommendation and low to moderate quality of evidence. For the evidence synthesis, early feeding was defined as initiation at or before 4 hours after PEG tube placement and delayed initiation as over 4 hours, and 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) plus 4 non–randomized controlled comparative studies totaling 1120 patients were identified. All-cause mortality at 30 days was similar based on 2 RCTs: 23.3% for delayed versus 24.6% for early initiation; when 3 observational studies were additionally included, these values were 9.3% versus 12% for delayed versus early initiation. Short-term (< 72 hours) mortality was similar between early and delayed feeding in RCTs (6.7% vs 3.3%) and across all studies (1.3% vs 1.6% for delayed versus early). All studies showed no difference in overall adverse event rate (12.4% vs 12.4%), which was also observed when combining observational studies (15.4% vs 18.4% for delayed versus early feeding).

### A study of postoperative complications occurring at home with pediatric gastrostomy feeding tubes [^11694t7R]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) provide long-term feeding assistance to children with severe feeding dysfunction. Although there are a host of complications that occur at home with current pediatric G-tube feeding, their prevalences and outcomes remain relatively unstudied. This study aims to identify and describe such complications.

Methods

A dual-round survey was administered to 98 participants through the Feeding Tube Awareness Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that supports parents and caretakers of G-tube-fed children. Information was collected broadly regarding G-tube complications, causes, and attitudes toward such complications.

Results

Infection (56%), itching/irritation/redness (52%), and leakage (51%) were the leading G-tube related complications. The average time that G-tubes were replaced was 3.4 ± 1.2 months as compared to the typical recommended period of up to 6 months. Of the caretakers who had not experienced G-tube displacement, 7.9% wanted to see a change in current G-tubes to address the issue, compared with 75% of those who had experienced displacement. This 67.1% differential in caretakers' attitudes toward G-tubes based on their prior experience with a particular complication was the largest gap among all other listed complications.

Conclusions

G-tube complications are prevalent and varied. A sizable portion of G-tube users experience complications severe enough to require intervention. Of these, G-tube displacement is particularly critical and frequently precedes other prevalent complications, namely gastric leakage, infection, and tissue granulation.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^1155AF7w]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) provides an evidence-based approach for strategies to manage endoscopically placed gastrostomy tubes. This document was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. The guideline addresses the utility of PEG versus interventional radiology-guided gastrostomy (IR-G), need for withholding antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications before PEG tube placement, appropriate timing to initiate tube feeding after PEG, and selection of the appropriate technique of gastrostomy in patients with malignant dysphagia. In patients needing enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG as the preferred technique for initial gastrotomy over IR-G. The ASGE recommends that tube feeding can be safely started within 4 hours of gastrostomy. The ASGE suggests that PEG can be performed without withholding antiplatelet medications. The ASGE suggests that the periprocedural management of anticoagulants should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion regarding the risk of bleeding versus cardiovascular events. In patients with malignant dysphagia, either transoral "pull" PEG or direct PEG can be performed for initial enteral access.

### Consensus clinical management guideline for-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [^116dzRCP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastroenterology, Feeding, and Nutrition

Individuals with PLAN commonly experience dysphagia. Children with infantile PLAN gradually lose oral feeding abilities, which eventually result in the inability to maintain adequate nutrition and/or hydration, and risk of aspiration pneumonia. Discussion of this progression and early preparation for the eventual need for gastrostomy tube feeding will help make this transition smoother for families. A feeding specialist or team should continue to re-evaluate, make recommendations about food textures, safe feeding approaches, and nutritional supplementation and determine the timing of referral for gastrostomy tube placement.

Although early efforts are often directed toward increasing intake, in children with decreasing mobility (eg, those with infantile PLAN), caloric intake will likely later need to be decreased to avoid excessive weight gain.

When is the ideal time to place a gastrostomy tube?

A gastrostomy tube should be placed when the individual cannot eat safely or maintain nutritional or hydration status, or when oral feeding has become excessively difficult or time-consuming, if not sooner. The goal is to proceed while the nutritional status is still optimal, and the family is not in crisis. This is best achieved using shared decision making, informing and supporting caregivers while considering caregiver and individual values. Providers should begin the conversation early, particularly for children with infantile PLAN, all of whom will require gastrostomy tube feedings. Connecting families to patient organizations could help provide practical information and support.

How should constipation be managed?

Constipation is often a significant challenge in PLAN that can impact comfort and quality of life. A principle of management is to develop a consistent regimen that prevents constipation rather than responding with as-needed treatments when constipation becomes problematic. Dietary management and physical activity and movement (eg, stander use) can be very helpful. Caution should be used around medications with constipation as a side effect (iron, trihexyphenidyl, glycopyrrolate). Stool softeners are typically used for constipation not responsive to dietary changes. Given that autonomic dysfunction in PLAN can affect gastric motility, the addition of a motility agent may be needed. Suppositories or enemas can be used as needed. In challenging cases, a gastroenterologist should be involved.

### Definitions and clinical guidance on the enteral dependence component of the avoidant / restrictive food intake disorder diagnostic criteria in children [^114ttKuf]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of the current article is to offer definitive guidance on weaning children who are reliant on nasogastric/gastrostomy feeding tubes. To date, no internationally recognized definitions or principles for interventions exist, and clinics have been reliant on creating their own unique intervention criteria. To achieve the aim, 2 goals are set out within the current article. The first goal was to definitively define the process of tube weaning. To achieve this, both tube dependency and oral eating also required definitions. It is necessary for these 2 additional definitions to fully understand the process of tube weaning and the transition that the child is making within these clinical interventions. The second goal of this article was to propose a set of minimum measurement criteria within a tube weaning protocol so that different clinical practices and perspectives may be measured accurately. This would then allow outcomes from different clinical services to be compared for efficacy. The culmination of this article is a set of 5 core principles that should govern clinics that adhere to the auspices of evidence-based practice. These principles, if adopted, will provide the basis of a set of internationally recognized criteria within this field of pediatric gastroenterology.

Enteral nutrition (EN) support includes both the delivery of nutrients via feeding tubes or the provision of oral nutritional supplements, and is indicated in patients with at least a partial functioning of the digestive tract, when oral intake is insufficient to meet the patients' needs or is unsafe. Once the indication for EN has been formulated, the decision on the type of mixtures to be used requires careful evaluation, taking into account factors affecting both the patient and the mixture. Moreover, changing in the clinical conditions of the patient, progression of the pathology, and potential complications associated with EN may require reassessments of the nutritional protocol. Blended tube feeding is the provision of pureed foods administered via a gastrostomy tube. While aware of the benefits associated with the use of commercial formulas, such as body weight recovery and reduced microbiological risks compared to blended diets (BD), in recent years there has been a growing interest among families and caregivers in adopting home‐made foods as an alternative to commercial EN formulas. Family members perceive this choice, especially from an emotional perspective, as an opportunity to provide their child with the best possible care despite artificial nutrition. Another benefit associated with the use of BD in tube‐fed children is the improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms, such as retching and vomiting.

### Pediatric gastrostomy feeding tube weaning strategies: a scoping review [^116Tcr2n]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

A pediatric feeding disorder is defined as impaired oral intake that is not age‐appropriate and is associated with medical, nutritional, feeding skill, and psychosocial dysfunction. A minority of children who struggle with oral intake require long‐term tube feeding to meet nutrition and hydration needs necessary for growth and development, an estimated prevalence of 2.7%–5.6%. Despite long‐term tube feeding being an efficient means of nutritional rehabilitation, one of the consequences is tube dependency, defined as the active refusal to eat or drink, or lack of motivation or ability to eat, which results in the child remaining dependent on the feeding tube (FT), although there are no medical indications for its continuation.

Additionally, FTs may limit opportunities for socialization, incur medical complications, increase healthcare costs, negatively impact child and family quality of life, and contribute to parental stress. Further, children with a history of unpleasant feeding experiences (i.e. coughing, gagging, reflux, and emesis) will often develop negative mealtime associations, which can further contribute to food aversions, defined as extreme and consistently negative reaction to oral fluids or diet, which interferes with nutrition requirements. Thus, in children who have developed these associations, the transition from FTs to oral feeding may be met with resistance.

Despite the high prevalence of feeding difficulties in the pediatric care setting and the challenges that come with transitioning to oral feeds, there are no standard guidelines for gastroenterologists and other practitioners on who, when, where, or how to wean FTs. The first, and to our knowledge, only set of clinical practice recommendations for weaning children from FTs emerged in 2021 from the French Network of Rare Digestive Diseases (FIMATHO) and the French‐Speaking Group of Paediatric Hepatology, Gastroenterology and Nutrition (GFHGNP). This multidisciplinary group included pediatricians, pediatric gastroenterologists, speech‐language pathologists, psychologists, dieticians, and occupational therapists. They described eligibility criteria for weaning a child from FT to oral feeding if (i) the underlying disease is nonprogressive, (ii) the nutritional status is age appropriate or stable, (iii) the child demonstrates a functional and safe swallow, and (iv) the child and his/her parents are ready.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding initiation timing — practice recommendations state to use a PEG tube for feedings within several hours of placement, and "current literature supports ≤ 4 hours in adults and children". Clinicians should also educate providers on the appropriate timing of use of the PEG tube postprocedure and review procedural documentation for time of PEG insertion. As context, tube feedings have traditionally been delayed to the next day and up to 24 hours after the procedure, with no consensus regarding initiation after placement.

Conclusion

The present series reaffirms that PEG-tube placement is relatively free from serious immediate and long- term complications and an acceptable modality. Majority of caregivers and patient felt PEG-tube helped in prolonging the survival and helpful in feeding. The real benefit in terms of quality of life is still doubtful and an ethical dilemma. Studies are needed to assess the actual nutritional gain objectively in these patients especially in setting of lower income countries.

Tube replacement

Most transoral bumper-type tubes can be maintained for 1 or 2 years (or sometimes longer), but eventually replacement will be required because of breakage, occlusion, dislodgement or degradation. The replacement can be performed in several ways: endoscopically, radiologically, surgically and bedside replacement (depending on the type of gastrostomy tube being replaced).

Prevention

See preventive measures in the paragraph 'tube blockage'.

Management actions

Replace the tube in a non-urgent but timely manner if it is diagnosed with signs of fungal colonisation, with material deterioration or compromised structural integrity. Especially silicon tubes are at risk for colonisation (figure 5).
Consider a balloon-type tube that can be inserted 'blindly' (without endoscopy) in a matured tract.
For a bumper-type tube, cut the tube just above the skin and push the internal bumper into the stomach ('cut and push' method). Migration is usually uneventful, even with large-calibre tubes.
Endoscopic retrieval of the bumper is advocated in case of previous bowel surgery and in patients at risk of strictures, which could hinder spontaneous migration and elimination of the sectioned bumper.

Aims and scope

The aim of this ASGE guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the management of feeding tubes placed through a gastrostomy in patients requiring enteral access. This article, subtitled "Methodology and review of evidence", provides a detailed account of the evidence synthesis process that ultimately led to our recommendations, summarized in the article subtitled "Summary and recommendations".

This guideline addressed the following clinical PICO questions using the GRADE format.
(1) In patients with normal foregut anatomy needing initial enteral access, is PEG or interventional radiology–guided percutaneous gastrostomy (IR-G) the preferred modality of choice?
(2) In patients undergoing PEG, should antiplatelets or anticoagulants be held before the procedure to prevent continuing bleeding or other adverse events?
(3) In patients who undergo PEG placement, should tube feeds be initiated early or be intentionally delayed?
(4) In patients with malignant dysphagia requiring gastrostomy placement, is transoral "Pull" PEG or transcutaneous "Direct" gastrostomy the preferred modality to reduce the risk of implantation metastasis?

Discussion

The panelists noted a misconception that the delayed initiation of tube feeds allows the stoma site to heal. Instead, the stoma site takes at least several weeks to heal. Another concern with early tube feed initiation has been that gastric wall injury during PEG placement may transiently decrease gastric motility, resulting in increased gastric residual volume. Although several studies included in our analysis reported gastric residual volume as an outcome, the routine measurement of gastric residuals is of unclear clinical significance and may lead to unnecessary tube feed discontinuation. In addition, the measurement of gastric residual volume and the definition of high gastric residuals are not standardized and varied between the studies that reported them. The panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement should not be performed, and this was not included in our analysis.

Theoretically, earlier tube feed initiation may allow patients to reach goal rates quicker, resulting in earlier discharge, decreased length of hospitalization, and decreased health care cost. There were no studies that compared cost-effectiveness, time to reach goal tube feed rate, or hospital length of stay. The panel noted that the difference in nutritional status is likely clinically insignificant between early and delayed tube feed initiation, but no studies reported this.

For patient value assessment, our patient advocate emphasized a desire to have tube feeding initiated as soon as possible to not delay or interrupt nutrition therapy and felt reassured that there were no increased adverse events noted for earlier tube feed initiation. The expert panel also noted a theoretical benefit of reducing the risk of ileus with earlier tube feed initiation.

Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality. Given the lack of a significant difference in outcomes between the early and delayed groups in RCTs, the theoretical benefits of earlier tube feed initiation, input from the experts on the panel, and the patient value assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation for early initiation of tube feed after PEG tube placement.

The panel emphasized that although earlier tube initiation after PEG tube placement is recommended, there are clinical situations where tube feed initiation after PEG tube placement may not be clinically appropriate, such as patients on vasopressors, with severe ileus or obstruction, or patients with bowel ischemia. In addition, although intentional delay is not recommended, early tube feed initiation after PEG tube placement may not always be feasible due to delays related to the logistics of initiating tube feeds. The panel noted that in most cases, although it was not studied specifically, medications may be given immediately via the PEG after placement, unless there are contraindications to enteral medications.

ASGE gastrostomy feeding tubes — practice considerations and counseling: Experts noted that mechanical translocation during transoral passage is not the only putative etiology, and implantation metastasis has also been reported with a "Direct" PEG as well as IR-G. The panel expressed significant concerns regarding inequitable access to "Direct" PEG and refrained from making a recommendation against use of transoral "Pull" PEGs in patients with aerodigestive malignancies. The risk of implantation metastasis should be discussed with the patient during the informed consent process, and in centers where IR-G or "Direct" PEG is available, these options should be offered; further, the site of the gastrostomy should be examined for implantation metastasis.

ASGE guideline on gastrostomy tubes — quality of evidence categories and stakeholder implications are summarized as follows: High indicates "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect" with the interpretation that "Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect". Moderate indicates "We are moderately confident in the estimate of the effect; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different", and "Further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and may change the estimate". Low indicates "Our confidence in the estimate of the effect is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect", and "Further research is very likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate". Very low indicates "We have very little confidence in the estimate of the effect; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect", and "Any estimate of the effect is very uncertain". For strong recommendations, patients: "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not"; clinicians: "Most individuals should receive the test. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; policymakers: "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Compliance with this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For conditional recommendations, patients: "Most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not"; clinicians: "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; policymakers: "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders".

Malfunction of a feeding tube

For this outcome, 20 studies were reviewed. Notably, 3 large administrative databases were excluded for the initial evaluation. The quality of evidence was rated down due to the retrospective design of the studies. Further, the definition of tube malfunction varied across different studies and included tube dislodgment, clogging of the tube, need for replacement, peristomal erythema, and pain at the site of gastrostomy. Because of the varying definition, evidence was rated down further for quality. The incidence of tube-related malfunction was 11.9% (274 of 2302) for PEG versus 19.3% (398 of 2060) for IR-G (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28–0.92; p = 0.02, Fig. 3).

Of note, the recently published meta-analysis, which included 3 large administrative databases, also reached a similar conclusion and demonstrated a lower incidence of tube malfunction with PEG than with IR-G (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33–0.95; p = 0.03).

The interventional radiologist in the expert panel noted that the most frequently used gastrostomy tubes in IR-G are typically 18F in diameter. These are thinner than feeding tubes placed during PEG, which are typically 20F to 24F. The larger diameter of the PEG feeding tube is very likely associated with a lower risk of clogging of the tube. Hence, this difference may not necessarily be solely due to technique but also due to the size/diameter of the tube. The panel also included a patient representative who had experienced tube-related malfunction with an IR-G but noted no adverse experience with a subsequent PEG.

Question 10: How to assess gastrointestinal intolerance?

Gastrointestinal (in)tolerance is often defined with certain symptoms/signs, with 'tolerance' meaning the absence of these symptoms and signs. 'Enteral feeding intolerance' (EFI) is commonly defined as a certain amount of gastric residual volumes (GRV), capturing only upper gastrointestinal (GI) problems after initiation of enteral tube feeding, while both upper and lower parts of the GI tract can be involved (Fig. 3). In most of available studies, patients with EFI were more severely ill compared to patients tolerating EN, suggesting that EFI could be an epiphenomenon or a marker of disease severity. In several studies, the occurrence of EFI as a feature of GI dysfunction was shown to independently associate with adverse outcome, as an additional organ dysfunction.

### How often should percutaneous gastrostomy feeding tubes be replaced? A single-institute retrospective study [^113ZSFJk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) is an effective method for delivering enteral nutrition to the gastric lumen while bypassing the oral cavity in patients who cannot tolerate oral or nasogastric tube feeding. The rate of this procedure has greatly increased since the 1980s commensurate with the growth in home nursing care. Currently published guidelines for this procedure and its postoperative care recommend PG tube insertion for candidates who are at risk of moderate-to-severe malnutrition within 2–3 weeks of nasogastric tube feeding. Although this minimally invasive procedure is quite safe and instructions for tube care are well-known, the risks of minor or major complications (such as wound infection, occlusion, peristomal leakage, tube dislodgement, stomal hypergranulation, and buried bumper syndrome) increase as long as tube feeding persists. Because of such complications, the PG tube should be exchanged periodically; however, physicians and nurses have remained uncertain about the optimal time to perform these exchanges with respect to the different types of tubes as well as the patients' conditions. There have been a few studies comparing the durability of PG tubes constructed of different materials in small populations; however, no clinical data have been published addressing how often PG tubes need to be replaced. Within this context, the aim of this study was to investigate longevity of PG tube patency according to type, and thus to determine the optimal replacement time.

### Outcomes for gastrostomy-fed children and their parents: qualitative findings from the 'your tube' study [^113YhZZH]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To identify child and parent outcomes relevant to having a gastrostomy, and to specify outcomes believed to be particularly salient to type of diet (formula vs blended food).

Method

Twenty parents, two children (both 12y), and 41 professionals (dietitians [n = 10]; nurses [n = 12]; paediatricians [n = 12]; speech and language therapists [n = 7)]) were recruited. Parents and children were interviewed; professionals participated in focus groups. Children (2–18y) represented included those on formula (n = 11), blended-food (n = 7), and mixed (n = 2) diets. All had been tube-fed for at least 6 months. Neurological, genetic, and metabolic conditions were represented.

Results

Participants identified a range of children's outcomes relevant to a gastrostomy, including physical health, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep, and time spent feeding. The children described experiences of exclusion caused by being tube-fed. Time, sleep, and emotional health were regarded as most salient to understanding parents' gastrostomy outcomes. Participants believed type of diet would most likely effect gastrointestinal symptoms, time spent feeding, sleep, and physical health.

Interpretation

Findings indicate a number of refinements to, and allow further specification of, the current 'initial' core outcome set for tube-fed children. Findings also have implications for choice of outcomes measures. Further qualitative research with children and young people is needed. What this paper adds Sleep is a key outcome for children and parents. Gastrointestinal symptoms and physical health were regarded as outcomes most likely to be affected by type of diet. Well-being and participation were identified as key distal outcomes. Gastrostomies are complex interventions. Further specification of the core outcome set is possible.

Gastrostomy tube insertion has become a more common practice in pediatric patients. An increasing number of children both in health-care facilities and at home are relying on temporary or long-term enteral feeding. Gastrostomy tube placement can be accomplished by various methods and by a variety of specialists. Despite the overall safety of these procedures, both early and late complications can occur. It is important for pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists to be familiar with and aware of the indications, safety, and management of gastrostomies.

Conclusion

Complications of gastrostomy placement may be minor or major. Fortunately the majority of gastrostomy placement complications are minor but nevertheless often affecting quality of life. Major complications are rare but prevention and early recognition are important. In this regard, the presence of a multidisciplinary nutritional support team can play a very important role in decreasing morbidity and mortality. This review was written from a clinical viewpoint and focused on evidence-based recommendations to prevent and manage major adverse events.
