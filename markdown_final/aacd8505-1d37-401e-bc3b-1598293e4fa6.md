## Question

What is the medical term for peripheral toe cyanosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the proper medical term is for blue discoloration of the toes ("peripheral toe cyanosis"). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the phrase describes a sign (color change) versus a syndrome (with an implied mechanism). Then, I should compare key acral vascular entities that cause blue toes: acrocyanosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, perniosis (chilblains), and blue toe syndrome. Next, I will verify defining features such as persistent versus episodic discoloration, pain/inflammation versus painless changes, and symmetry. Finally, I will cross-check terminology in the references to ensure the most precise term is selected and confirm the conclusion aligns with standard usage in dermatology and vascular medicine [^113AhPgJ] [^112bFAaV] [^117Xu2Cz].

> Let me first confirm what "peripheral toe cyanosis" implies clinically. The phrase points to a distal acral blue discoloration of the toes, often accentuated by cold, and without necessarily implying pain, ulcers, or embolic phenomena; that pattern maps most directly to acrocyanosis, which is defined as persistent, typically painless, symmetric cyanosis of the distal extremities (toes and fingers) with cool skin, and characteristically the color change persists after cold exposure rather than occurring in discrete attacks [^113AhPgJ] [^112bUS8G].

> Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating this with Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's is an episodic vasospastic disorder with well-demarcated, attack-based color changes classically progressing from pallor to cyanosis to rubor in response to cold or stress; the cyanotic phase is only one part of a triphasic or biphasic event, and the term Raynaud's labels the vasospastic process rather than a static state of cyanosis, so using it to name a persistent discoloration would be imprecise here [^112bFAaV] [^113ipp9x] [^117BPzRh].

> Hold on, I should also consider perniosis (chilblains). Perniosis produces cold-induced inflammatory lesions that can be tender or pruritic, often edematous or violaceous with papules, plaques, or even ulceration; that is an inflammatory acral injury pattern rather than a generic term for cyanotic discoloration alone, so it doesn't best capture a simple description of "peripheral toe cyanosis" as a sign [^114igzvx] [^117KTJzU].

> I need to check for blue toe (purple toe) syndrome as well. Blue toe syndrome denotes acute or subacute violaceous discoloration due to distal ischemia or microembolism and is typically painful and potentially limb-threatening; it is a specific clinicopathologic syndrome and would be too narrow and mechanistic a label for a general sign descriptor like "peripheral toe cyanosis" unless there are features suggesting occlusion or emboli, which are not specified here [^117Xu2Cz] [^113woCha].

> Let me reconsider broad descriptors such as "peripheral vasculopathy". That language appears in drug safety labeling to denote possible circulatory symptoms and color changes in digits, but it functions as an umbrella descriptor rather than a precise diagnostic term for persistent acral cyanosis; for a focused medical term that names the color change itself, acrocyanosis remains the more exact fit [^114Xd9Ys] [^116gjtw1].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the best-matching term. The description "peripheral toe cyanosis" aligns most closely with acrocyanosis, which literally combines "acro-" (extremities) and "cyanosis" (blue discoloration) and is used across dermatology and vascular medicine to denote persistent, painless, symmetric blue discoloration of acral sites such as the toes; that mapping is the most direct and terminologically accurate choice here [^113AhPgJ] [^112bUS8G].

> But wait, what if the cyanosis were central (for example, methemoglobinemia) rather than acral vasomotor in origin? Central causes typically produce generalized or mucosal discoloration and systemic hypoxemia patterns rather than isolated toe changes; the wording "peripheral toe cyanosis" points to an acral phenomenon, which supports acrocyanosis as the appropriate term while reminding us to consider systemic cyanosis only when the distribution or oxygenation data suggest it [^112C81L8] [^11318vkU].

> Conclusion after double-checking definitions: The formal medical term that best corresponds to "peripheral toe cyanosis" is acrocyanosis [^113AhPgJ] [^112bUS8G].

---

The medical term for peripheral toe cyanosis is **acrocyanosis** [^112bUS8G], defined as persistent, symmetric, painless bluish discoloration of the toes and other distal extremities [^113AhPgJ], resulting from vasoconstriction and reduced oxygenation of superficial blood vessels [^111QBdZM]. It is important to distinguish **acrocyanosis** from other causes of toe cyanosis — such as Raynaud's phenomenon [^112bFAaV], perniosis [^114igzvx], or blue toe syndrome [^117Xu2Cz] — because management and prognosis differ [^1124He7o].

---

## Clinical features of acrocyanosis

Acrocyanosis typically has the following **clinical features**:

- **Symmetric discoloration**: Persistent, symmetric bluish discoloration of the toes [^112bUS8G].

- **Temperature dependence**: Worsens with cold exposure and improves with warmth [^113AhPgJ].

- **Painless**: Generally painless, though mild discomfort or tingling may occur [^111QBdZM].

- **Moist skin**: Often associated with hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) of the affected areas [^112bUS8G].

- **No tissue damage**: Unlike other conditions, acrocyanosis does not typically cause ulceration or tissue necrosis [^113AhPgJ].

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of acrocyanosis involves **persistent vasoconstriction** [^112bUS8G] of small arterioles and venules in the distal extremities, causing reduced oxygenation of superficial blood vessels and cyanosis. It is often triggered or worsened by cold exposure or emotional stress [^113AhPgJ].

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to **differentiate acrocyanosis** from other causes of peripheral toe cyanosis:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing factors** |
|-|-|-|
| Raynaud's phenomenon | Episodic color changes (white, blue, red), pain, triggered by cold or stress | Triphasic color change, episodic, often painful [^1124He7o] [^112bFAaV] |
| Perniosis (chilblains) | Erythematous or violaceous lesions, swelling, itching, pain, cold exposure | Inflammatory lesions, often painful, associated with cold exposure [^114igzvx] |
| Blue toe syndrome | Sudden onset blue discoloration, pain, embolic or thrombotic etiology | Acute onset, painful, associated with emboli or thrombosis [^117Xu2Cz] |
| Methemoglobinemia | Central cyanosis, chocolate-brown blood, systemic symptoms | Elevated methemoglobin levels, systemic symptoms [^112C81L8] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Acrocyanosis is a **primarily clinical** diagnosis, based on characteristic features and exclusion of other causes. Evaluation may include:

- **Clinical history and physical examination**: Detailed history and examination to exclude other causes of cyanosis [^117BTyGa].

- **Laboratory tests**: Basic laboratory tests to rule out systemic causes (e.g. methemoglobinemia, polycythemia) [^112C81L8].

- **Capillaroscopy**: May be performed to assess capillary abnormalities [^116goDzA], particularly if Raynaud's phenomenon is suspected [^117RZar5].

---

## Management

Management is primarily **conservative**:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Avoidance of cold exposure, wearing warm clothing, smoking cessation [^113AhPgJ].

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine) may be considered in severe cases [^113ipp9x].

- **Patient education**: Educating patients about the benign nature of the condition and strategies to prevent exacerbations [^112bUS8G].

---

## Prognosis

Acrocyanosis is generally a **benign condition** with a good prognosis and does not typically progress to tissue necrosis or ulceration; however, persistent symptoms may cause cosmetic concerns or mild discomfort [^112bUS8G].

---

Acrocyanosis is the medical term for **peripheral toe cyanosis**, characterized by persistent, symmetric, painless bluish discoloration of the toes resulting from vasoconstriction and reduced oxygenation of superficial blood vessels. Differentiate it from **Raynaud's, perniosis, and blue toe syndrome**, as **management and prognosis differ** [^113woCha].

### Raynaud's phenomenon (primary) [^1124He7o]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic, reversible vasospasm of the peripheral arteries (usually digital), causing pallor, followed by cyanosis and/or redness, often with pain and, at times, paraesthesia. On rare occasions, it can lead to ulceration of the fingers and toes, and in some cases, of the ears or nose. This review focuses on primary (idiopathic) Raynaud's phenomenon, occurring in the absence of an underlying disease. The prevalence of primary Raynaud's phenomenon varies by sex, country, and exposure to workplace vibration.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of drug treatments for primary Raynaud's phenomenon? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 9 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amlodipine, diltiazem, nicardipine, and nifedipine.

### A visually striking case of primary acrocyanosis: A rare cause of the blue digit [^113AhPgJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cold environments can trigger a variety of conditions which, in their acute phase, often present to the emergency department. Primary acrocyanosis is a distinct, rare condition that may be missed, resulting in misdiagnosis and mismanagement. It is a peripheral vascular disorder defined by painless, symmetrical discoloration of the distal appendages and uniquely characterized by the persistence of skin color changes after cold exposure.

We present a case of a 24-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with peripheral cyanosis after cold exposure and was eventually diagnosed with primary acrocyanosis by rheumatology. The prognosis for primary acrocyanosis is quite good in comparison to other acrosyndromes. Once secondary causes of acrocyanosis have been ruled out, it can be managed conservatively with lifestyle modifications and potential follow-up with rheumatology.

### Blue (or purple) toe syndrome [^117Xu2Cz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The blue (or purple) toe syndrome consists of the development of blue or violaceous discoloration of one or more toes in the absence of obvious trauma, serious cold-induced injury, or disorders producing generalized cyanosis. The major general categories are: (1) decreased arterial flow, (2) impaired venous outflow, and (3) abnormal circulating blood. Depending on its pathogenesis, the discoloration may be blanching or non-blanching. An accurate diagnosis is critical because many of the causes threaten life and limb. However, the patient's medical history, accompanying non-dermatologic findings on physical examination, and a discriminating use of laboratory tests are usually more important than the nature of the cutaneous abnormalities in determining the cause.

- **Learning objectives**: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to define the blue (or purple) toe syndrome, categorize the causes, and recognize the important historical, clinical, and laboratory findings that differentiate the causes and lead to the correct diagnosis.

### Chronic idiopathic acrocyanosis [^112bUS8G]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Acrocyanosis is an uncommon condition characterized by symmetric coolness and violaceous discoloration of the hands and feet. The nose, ears, lips, and nipples are also often affected. The disease is temperature-dependent and generally worsens with cold exposure. Acrocyanosis is often secondary to a variety of underlying causes. We present a very interesting case of a 44-year-old woman with almost lifelong idiopathic acrocyanosis. Differential diagnoses are discussed in this article.

### Pernio-like eruption associated with COVID-19 in skin of color [^117KTJzU]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Similar to prior reports, most of these patients reported no prior COVID-19–associated symptoms or mild, nonspecific symptoms that self-resolved without seeing a physician. The age range for these patients was from 25 to 44 and included four males and three females. At the time of presentation to a dermatologist, patients reported having a pernio-like eruption from a range of 2 to 8 weeks. Four patients could definitively pinpoint potential exposures, either through contact with a known COVID-19 positive individual or interactions with high-risk environments without personal protective equipment, such as healthcare settings or international travel.

None of the patients had a history of pernio or prior rheumatologic disease. Additionally, these patients could not pinpoint cold or damp exposures that may have precipitated their skin findings, as most were sheltering in place indoors. Patients were seen in the clinic in Redwood City, California, where average nighttime low and daytime high temperatures were 43–62°F in February, 45–65°F in March, and 46–69°F in April. Patients were generally healthy at the time of presentation. Clinically, patients presented with a range of physical examination findings from erythema and swelling to purpuric and petechial macules, mostly on the toes, but also on the fingers in one case. No other cutaneous findings were reported.

Compared with Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) I and II findings previously reported in the literature, we note findings on FST III to V may be more subtle.

### Calcium channel blockers for primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon [^113ipp9x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasospastic disease characterized by digital pallor, cyanosis, and extremity pain. Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is not associated with underlying disease, but secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with connective tissue disorders such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and mixed connective tissue disease. Calcium channel blockers promote vasodilation and are commonly used when drug treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon is required.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) versus placebo for treatment of individuals with Raynaud's phenomenon with respect to Raynaud's type (primary vs. secondary) and type and dose of CCBs.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (May 19, 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to May 19, 2017), Embase (1947 to May 19, 2017), clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Portal. We applied no language restrictions. We also searched bibliographies of retrieved articles and contacted key experts for additional and unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing calcium channel blockers versus placebo.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed search results and risk of bias and extracted trial data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

- **Main results**: This review contains 38 RCTs (33 cross-over RCTs) with an average duration of 7.4 weeks and 982 participants. However, not all trial data were complete.

### Coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon [^116dJVKU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Erythromelalgia is characterized by episodes of redness, heat, and pain in the extremities that can be triggered or worsened by heat. Raynaud's phenomenon occurs in response to cold exposure and presents as pallor of the fingers or toes, often followed by cyanosis and rubor. Although the two conditions may appear to be opposites in symptomatology and clinical presentation, there are very rare reports of their coexistence. A case of coexistent erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon is presented.

The pathophysiology is reviewed to elucidate a common mechanism underlying some cases of the two seemingly opposite conditions. A review of the literature indicates that causative and pathophysiologic similarities between the two conditions may exist in some cases. Rare reports of coexistence of the two disease processes further strengthen such research findings.

### Ritalin [^116gjtw1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients of the possibility of painful or prolonged penile erections (priapism) and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention in the event of priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Circulation problems in fingers and toes (peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon)**: Instruct patients about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms. Fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red. Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes. Instruct patients to call their physician immediately upon noticing any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking Ritalin. Further clinical evaluation, such as a rheumatology referral, may be appropriate for certain patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: Advise patients that Ritalin may cause slowing of growth and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma**: Advise patients that increased IOP and glaucoma may occur during treatment with Ritalin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

- **Motor and verbal tics, and worsening of Tourette's syndrome**: Advise patients that motor and verbal tics and worsening of Tourette's syndrome may occur during treatment with Ritalin. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if there is an emergence of new tics or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome.

### Posttraumatic unilateral perniosis: A case report [^1158RmQz]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old nonsmoking woman was referred to our hospital for a second opinion regarding slightly tender swelling, erythrocyanotic discoloration, and occasionally spontaneous ulceration of her right hand (Fig 1). The symptoms were present for six years, occurring periodically during autumn and winter, and were slowly progressive. One year before the onset of symptoms, the patient was bitten by a dog on her right hand, resulting in extensive soft tissue injury, for which she underwent surgical reconstruction. The patient did not exhibit symptoms or signs of cutaneous or systemic lupus erythematosus. Her medical history included metacarpal fractures in the right hand about 20 years ago and Lyme disease 10 years ago.

Her family history was negative for autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. Before referral, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans was suspected, and she was treated unsuccessfully with antibiotics, highly potent topical steroids, and prednisolone. Later, IgG and IgM Borrelia antibodies were found to be negative. An arterial Doppler examination by a vascular surgeon found no abnormalities. A diagnosis of unilateral perniosis was considered, and the patient was referred to our hospital for confirmation.

- **Clinical presentation**:
	- A. Unilateral erythrocyanotic swelling with ulcerations of the right hand.
	- B. For comparison, the left hand is unaffected.

To exclude underlying diseases, we performed a punch biopsy from the dorsal side of the fourth finger of her right hand and additional laboratory tests. Histopathology from the biopsy supported the diagnosis of perniosis.

### Chilblains in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: A review [^114igzvx]. Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Chilblains were first described over a hundred years ago as cutaneous inflammatory lesions, typically on the digits, occurring on cold exposure. Chilblains can be primary or secondary to a number of conditions, such as infections, including COVID-19, and immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs) with SLE being the most common. Chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE) was first described in 1888 as cold-induced erythematous lesions before the terms 'chilblains' or 'perniosis' were coined. Diagnostic criteria exist for both chilblains and CHLE. Histopathologically, CHLE lesions show interface dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunofluorescence demonstrates linear deposits of immunoglobulins and complement in the dermo-epidermal junction. This narrative review focuses on chilblains secondary to immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, primarily the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of CHLE.

### Azstarys [^114Xd9Ys]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise patients and their caregivers of the possibility of painful or prolonged penile erections (priapism) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical attention in the event of priapism.

- **Circulation problems in fingers and toes**: Instruct patients about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms. Fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or change color from pale, to blue, to red. Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes. Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking Azstarys. Further clinical evaluation, such as a rheumatology referral, may be appropriate for certain patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: Advise patients and their caregivers that Azstarys can cause slowing of growth and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Raynaud's phenomenon: Pathogenesis and management [^111JJ4XH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is a common clinical disorder for which patients frequently seek the expertise and care of dermatologists. It is manifested by vasospasm of the fingers and toes, often associated with exposure to cold temperature or emotional stress. The phenomenon is named after Maurice Raynaud, who, as a medical student, defined the first case in 1862 as episodic, symmetric, acral vasospasm characterized by pallor, cyanosis, suffusion, and a sense of fullness or tautness, which may be painful. Despite more than 140 years of research, the pathophysiology of Raynaud's phenomenon continues to elude investigators. Accordingly, although many pharmacologic treatments have been reported, there is still no cure or gold standard therapy. Furthermore, response to treatment varies and is difficult to predict. Recently, there has been renewed interest in finding the pathogenetic mechanisms of Raynaud's phenomenon, an effort that has led to more potential targeted therapeutics. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent breakthroughs in the pathogenesis and treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Part i: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical considerations of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon [^112bFAaV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a relatively common disease with both primary and secondary forms. It is well understood as a vasospastic condition affecting the acral and digital arteries, resulting in characteristic, well-demarcated color changes typically in the hands and feet in response to cold or stress. Secondary RP (SRP) has been described in association with a variety of rheumatologic and non-rheumatologic diseases, environmental exposures, and/or medications. While both primary RP and SRP may impact the quality of life, SRP may lead to permanent and potentially devastating tissue destruction when undiagnosed and untreated.

It is therefore crucial for dermatologists to distinguish between primary and secondary disease forms early in clinical evaluation, investigate potential underlying causes, and risk stratify SRP patients for the development of associated autoimmune connective tissue disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of both forms of RP are described in detail in this review article.

### Paraneoplastic acral vascular syndrome in a patient with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS G12A oncogenic mutation [^111K96PM]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Paraneoplastic acral vascular syndrome (PAVS) is a rare condition characterized by signs of digital ischemia, including Raynaud's phenomenon, acrocyanosis, and digital gangrene, in the context of an underlying neoplastic process. Prompt recognition of this syndrome, as well as accurate identification and classification of the associated neoplastic condition, are crucial. This report describes the case of a woman diagnosed with PAVS secondary to stage IV non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma harboring a Kirsten Rat Sarcoma viral homolog oncogene (KRAS) G12A mutation (p. Gly12Ala).

### Occupational acral dermatitis and where the twain shall meet [^1132TZYN]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

This contribution, which is somewhat of a departure from the usual format, will focus on dermatologic conditions that are consequences of the patients' choices of employment, hobby, or even other forms of recreation. Most of the cutaneous changes involve the hands and feet, and each is labeled according to the anatomic location.

### Oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in the rat: involvement of oxalate in cold hyperalgesia but not mechanical allodynia [^1164wi1X]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

Oxaliplatin is a key drug in the treatment of advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, but it causes acute peripheral neuropathy (acral paresthesias triggered by exposure to cold) and chronic neuropathy (abnormal sensory and motor dysfunction). Oxaliplatin is metabolized to oxalate and dichloro(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (Pt(dach)Cl(2)). Although the chelating of Ca(2+) with oxalate eliminated from oxaliplatin is thought to be one of the reasons for the neuropathy, there is little behavioral evidence. In this study, we investigated the involvement of oxalate in oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats.

Oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg, i.p., twice a week) induced cold hyperalgesia/allodynia (cold-plate and acetone tests) in the early phase and mechanical allodynia (von Frey test) in the late phase. Oxalate (1.3 mg/kg, i.p., twice a week) induced cold hyperalgesia/allodynia in the early phase but did not induce mechanical allodynia. On the other hand, Pt(dach)Cl(2) (3.8 mg/kg, i.p., twice a week) induced mechanical allodynia in the late phase but did not induce cold hyperalgesia/allodynia.

The pre-administration of calcium or magnesium (0.5 mmol/kg, i.v.) before oxaliplatin or oxalate prevented cold hyperalgesia but not mechanical allodynia. However, treatment with calcium or magnesium after the development of neuropathy could not attenuate cold hyperalgesia or mechanical allodynia. These findings suggest the involvement of oxalate in oxaliplatin-induced cold hyperalgesia but not mechanical allodynia, highlighting the usefulness of prophylactic treatments.

### Methylin [^112ziSSM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise patients of the possibility of painful or prolonged penile erections (priapism) and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention in such cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Circulation problems in fingers and toes (peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon)**: Instruct patients about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Associated signs and symptoms include numbness, coolness, pain, or color changes in fingers or toes, ranging from pale to blue to red. Patients should report any new numbness, pain, skin color changes, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes to their physician. Immediate consultation with a physician is advised if unexplained wounds appear on fingers or toes while taking Methylin. Further clinical evaluation, such as a rheumatology referral, may be appropriate for certain patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: Advise patients that Methylin may cause slowing of growth and weight loss in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma**: Advise patients that increased IOP and glaucoma may occur during treatment with Methylin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### The registry of the German network for systemic scleroderma: Frequency of disease subsets and patterns of organ involvement [^114V6JWW]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Organ involvement was defined as follows: RP was characterized by spasms of small digital arterioles/arteries at the fingers and toes, usually triggered by cold and emotional stress. Clinically, a sudden pallor of individual digits was followed by reactive hyperemia, and in severe cases, by cyanosis. The age at RP onset was considered to be the age at which this symptom appears. We defined the first non-RP onset as the time or age when the first skin changes (puffy fingers, sclerodactyly, truncal scleroderma) developed, and the second non-RP onset as the time or age at which the first organ lesions occurred. All registered patients were asked for the date or age when RP, skin changes, and organ manifestations were noticed or diagnosed.

Skin involvement was evaluated using the Rodnan skin score, which assesses skin thickness by clinical palpation of 17 body areas on a scale of 0–3. Thickening and fibrosis of the skin, as one of the first recognized phenomena in SSc, still forms the basis of most classification criteria and proposed subsets of the disease. With respect to these symptoms, the participants of the centers were trained several times through meetings of the network or EUSTAR-organized Rodnan skin score courses (Budapest, January 2005; Bad Nauheim, January 2007) to ensure standardized and correct performance of skin scoring within the network.

Digital tip ischemia was associated with digital pitting scars, ulcerations, or gangrene, or both. Pulmonary manifestation was established when pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and/or isolated pulmonary hypertension were found.

### Primary Raynaud's phenomenon in an infant: A case report and review of literature [^112umaTj]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is an extremely unusual finding in early infancy. In the present report, we describe a one-month-old previously healthy male infant who presented with unilateral acrocyanosis. Although infantile acrocyanosis is known to be a benign and self-resolving condition, it is generally bilateral and symmetric. The unilateral nature of the acrocyanosis was an atypical finding in this infant. Consequently, he was closely monitored to evaluate the progression of his acrocyanosis. Based on his benign clinical course and failure to demonstrate other etiologies contributing to his acrocyanosis, he was diagnosed with primary RP.

Due to the rarity of RP in children, we review the progress in understanding the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of RP and additionally discuss the differential diagnosis of unilateral and bilateral acrocyanosis in infants.

### Identification of new mutations in the ETHE1 gene in a cohort of 14 patients presenting with ethylmalonic encephalopathy [^11357xT1]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by progressive encephalopathy, petechiae, acrocyanosis, and chronic diarrhea, often leading to a fatal outcome early in life.

- **Methods**: Fourteen patients with EE were investigated for mutations in the ETHE1 gene.

- **Results**: Of the 14 patients, 5 were found to carry novel mutations.

- **Conclusions**: This work expands our knowledge of the causative mutations of EE.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, specifically concerning systemic antifungals, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend considering fluconazole (150–450 mg/week for 3 months in fingernail infection and at least 6 months in toenail infection) as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. Obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC). Monitor LFTs in cases of high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk due to concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

### An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT statement: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and management [^113pgHsL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with several clinical features and complications. These include digital clubbing, acrocyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, dyspnea, chronic cough, honeycombing, and lower-lobe predominant interstitial lung disease (ILD). Additional features may include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cor pulmonale, fatigue, traction bronchiectasis, and cigarette smoking.

Patients may also present with a restrictive spirometry pattern, obesity, and an overall clinical impression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Radiological findings often include interstitial infiltrates, reduced oxygen saturation (↓ SpO2), obstructive sleep apnea, and increased blood hemoglobin. Gastroesophageal reflux, exposure to dust, weight loss, dry cough, usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, rales, decreased blood oxygen levels, lung cancer, loss of appetite, and ground-glass opacities are also noted features.

### Primary Raynaud's phenomenon in an infant: A case report and review of literature [^113FPTmP]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is an extremely unusual finding in early infancy. In this report, we describe a one-month-old previously healthy male infant who presented with unilateral acrocyanosis. Although infantile acrocyanosis is known to be a benign and self-resolving condition, it is generally bilateral and symmetric. The unilateral nature of the acrocyanosis was an atypical finding in this infant. Consequently, he was closely monitored to evaluate the progression of his acrocyanosis. Based on his benign clinical course and the absence of other etiologies contributing to his acrocyanosis, he was diagnosed with primary RP. Due to the rarity of RP in children, we review the progress in understanding the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of RP, and additionally discuss the differential diagnosis of unilateral and bilateral acrocyanosis in infants.

### Cold agglutinin related acrocyanosis and paroxysmal haemolysis [^115LagUZ]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical features of severe cold agglutinin related paroxysmal agglutination and haemolysis could be confused with a number of conditions. A 61-year-old lady presented with features of acute peripheral ischaemia; she had recently been started on treatment for Raynaud's disease. Haematological investigations revealed the presence of potent cold haemagglutinins to be the cause of her symptoms, but no definite cause for the raised titres was found. She was managed conservatively by keeping her hands and feet warm and administering regular chlorambucil for a suspected underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. It is important to differentiate the features of Raynaud's disease from those of severe haemagglutination so that identification of any underlying disorder can be made and appropriate treatment instituted.

### Lost bones: Differential diagnosis of acro-osteolysis seen by the pediatric rheumatologist [^113W5j5G]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Historically, occupational acro-osteolysis was reported in association with polyvinyl chloride, presenting with Raynaud phenomenon and SSc-like skin changes. This is largely a disease of the past, with no new cases reported in the last two decades.

Acro-osteolysis has been reported secondary to local trauma and thermal injury. It has been described in the setting of repetitive trauma in two adolescent ballet dancers and an adult surfer. Reports of frostbite leading to acro-osteolysis suggest that it tends to occur months after the injury and typically spares the thumb. The mechanism is thought to be related to vascular insufficiency or direct cellular injury and may involve superimposed infection. A recent case has been reported of brachyonychia and nail dystrophy one year following severe cold exposure, followed by seasonal chilblains, clubbing, disruption of nailfold capillaries, and acro-osteolysis of the terminal tufts on imaging, with an otherwise negative systemic work-up. Severe burns are also a rare cause of acro-osteolysis. A recent case of ankylosis of interphalangeal joints, flexion contracture deformity, and terminal tuft resorption was reported in the hand of a woman recovering from a burn injury.

Lastly, unilateral lower extremity acro-osteolysis has been reported as the presenting feature of occult spinal dysraphism in several patients, including cases in children. Whereas most causes of acro-osteolysis outlined above would manifest with bilateral involvement, unilateral acro-osteolysis should prompt the clinician to consider local trauma.

### Idiopathic perniosis presenting as acral purpuric lesions: Clustering of cases before COVID-19 pandemic and their comparison with chilblain like lesions reported in the literature [^116BXeWp]. Dermatologic therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Perniosis, also known as chilblains, are acral inflammatory skin lesions developing in susceptible individuals as an abnormal reaction to cold. In the absence of a discernible cause, it is labeled as idiopathic perniosis (IP). With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there was an upsurge of reports of chilblain-like lesions (CLL), especially in young patients, possibly related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Twelve clinically suspected and histopathologically confirmed cases of IP, seen from November 2019 through February 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathological characteristics of these cases were reviewed and compared with CLL reported in the literature.

The mean age of patients was 26.58 ± 15.18 years, with an equal male to female ratio.

- **Histopathological findings**: Characteristic findings included spongiosis (100%), dermal edema (100%), perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (100%) with peri-eccrine accentuation (66.7%), keratinocyte necrosis (50%), focal basal vacuolar damage (58.3%), and lymphocytic vasculitis (58.3%).

- **Dermoscopy findings**: Notable findings were variable background colors ranging from dull red and violaceous to copper red and brown orange. Coiled vessels were observed in 44.4% of cases, and orange-red structureless areas were seen in 63.9% of cases. Lesions over palms and soles preferentially exhibited white dots/clods and lines (38.9%).

There appear to be no exclusive histopathological or dermoscopy features that definitively distinguish CLL from IP. However, certain clues can be appreciated: keratinocyte necrosis and severe dermal edema tend to favor IP, while fibrin thrombi with the involvement of both superficial and deep dermal vessels tend to favor CLL.

### Acute-onset, painful, acral granuloma annulare in a 52-year-old female [^111SHQP9]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Granuloma annulare (GA) most commonly presents as annular plaques on the hands or feet. On histology, this disease is defined by the presence of a palisaded or interstitial lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, mucin deposition, and collagen alteration. Localized, generalized, and subcutaneous GA is frequently encountered, but rarer GA variants also exist. Acute-onset, painful, acral GA (AOPAGA) is a rarely reported localized GA variant. Here, we present a 52-year-old AOPAGA patient.

### Vasculitis in an infant born to a mother with longstanding cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa: A case report and review of literature [^111HcKEH]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

We present a neonate born to a mother with a known diagnosis of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (cPAN) who presented with acrocyanosis on the first day of life, which progressed to livedo reticularis and eventual digital necrosis and autoamputation. Our case, along with several previously reported cases, indicates that maternal vasculitis flares or new-onset maternal vasculitis during pregnancy may contribute to the development of neonatal vasculitis. Of note, acral necrosis appears to be a unique disease manifestation in neonates, not often seen in older patients. This report aims to increase patient and clinician awareness of this rare condition.

### Assessment of acute acral lesions in a case series of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112JaoV3]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The second alternative is that acrocyanosis and perniosis were a subacute manifestation of the infection, in which patients no longer had detectable viral particles. Additionally, in situations in which the viral inoculum was small, it is conceivable that RT-PCR results were negative, patients did not develop other symptoms, and the serologic response was of low intensity and not detectable with the tests currently available. Serologic responses have been shown to be lower in young individuals than in older ones. In this scenario, the only manifestations of COVID-19 could be endotheliitis and a facility for thrombosis in the distal small vessels of the extremities.

Endotheliitis and thrombosis have been described in patients with severe COVID-19 with previous endothelial damage and cardiovascular comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, obesity). However, the absence of those risk factors and the unaltered results of the coagulation tests performed in our patients do not support this explanation.

Finally, a third possibility, which is not supported by the results of all of the complementary examinations carried out in our patients, is that these skin lesions are not induced by the virus but by the quarantine state itself. Accordingly, this quarantine perniosis appeared mainly in children isolated in houses that were not well suited for individuals who spent long periods barefoot or only wearing socks and with very little physical activity.

- **Limitations**: This study was carried out in a short period and with patients from a single center. Furthermore, there is still lim

### Congenital methaemoglobinaemia diagnosed in an adolescent boy [^11318vkU]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old boy of Asian origin presented with a history of bluish discoloration of the finger and toenail bed with associated mild fatigue on exertion since early childhood. Clinical examination revealed bilaterally symmetric uniform central cyanosis without associated clubbing. Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems was normal. Pulse oximetry revealed an oxygen saturation of 87% in all four limbs. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed no evidence of shunt lesions.

In view of the past diagnosis of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae made at four years of age, a repeat cardiac catheterization study was conducted, revealing no shunt at any level. Interestingly, arterial oxygen tension of the chocolate-brown blood was normal in all the samples, suggesting the possibility of methaemoglobinaemia. Co-oximetry revealed methaemoglobin levels of 36%, confirming the diagnosis. Secondary causes were ruled out. The family was counseled about the hereditary nature of the condition.

### Acral hemorrhagic Darier disease: A case report of a rare presentation and literature review [^113Z996t]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Twenty cases of Darier disease (DD) with acral hemorrhagic features, with 79% in female patients, have been reported in the literature. Eight of these cases described this phenotype as being transmitted within a kindred. Furthermore, only three of these cases reported purely hemorrhagic DD initially, similar to our patient and his mother, although these patterns of presentation depend on multiple factors, including the time of evaluation. In most cases, classic DD papules developed first in the individuals, and acral hemorrhagic lesions developed only later in life or after treatment with a systemic retinoid. Few others, such as our patient, had minimal physical findings of DD other than acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf and acral hemorrhagic lesions. The majority of other patients with acral hemorrhagic features also had classic DD lesions. Only seven cases have reported the sequencing results of the ATP2A2 gene in affected individuals. Although the acral hemorrhagic manifestation of DD has been associated with missense mutations in regions of the ATP2A2 gene that encode transmembrane regions of the SERCA2 protein, a consistent phenotype-genotype correlation has not been determined.

### Treatment of gangrenous digit-threatening paraneoplastic acrocyanosis with vasodilator therapy [^114j85sv]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A man in his 70s, recently diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, reported a two-month history of discoloration, pain, and paraesthesia affecting his fingers. Clinical assessment noted peripheral acrocyanosis with areas of digital ulceration and gangrene. After further evaluation to determine potential causes, he was diagnosed with paraneoplastic acrocyanosis. He subsequently underwent robotic cystoprostatectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy for cancer management. In conjunction with chemotherapy, vasodilatory therapy was administered through two courses of intravenous synthetic prostacyclin analogue iloprost along with sildenafil. This treatment resulted in a significant improvement in digital pain and gangrene, with healing of ulceration.

### The differing pathophysiologies that underlie COVID-19-associated perniosis and thrombotic retiform purpura: a case series [^113mFqRe]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019 and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in early March 2020. Its higher infectivity and lower mortality rates differentiate it from SARS-CoV. Most patients with COVID-19 have a self-limited illness. However, there are predisposed populations, including the elderly and patients with certain pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, in whom higher mortality rates have been observed.

We recently reported that a complement-driven pauci-inflammatory thrombotic form of septal capillary injury causes severe progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of COVID-19. We showed that patients critically ill with COVID-19 have widespread systemic complement activation destroying microvasculature and exacerbating thrombophilia, resulting in organ dysfunction attributable to vascular thrombosis. This type of complement-driven thrombotic syndrome is rarely encountered as a complication of COVID-19 in the pediatric setting, where the clinical course is typically banal. However, uncommonly, children have developed perniosis or a multisystemic inflammatory syndrome resembling Kawasaki disease during the COVID-19 pandemic and presumably in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The skin is an easily accessible window to understand the pathophysiological basis of COVID-19 and its heterogeneous clinical phenotype.

### Trex-1-related disease associated with the presence of cryofibrinogenemia [^112RVH9y]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Cryofibrinogenemia is a rare cryopathy presenting as acrocyanosis following exposure to cold. Familial presentation has been described, but the underlying molecular cause remained undetermined.

Forty members from a large family with an initial diagnosis of familial cryofibrinogenemia were interviewed and examined to determine affected status and collect DNA. Exome sequencing was performed on three affected individuals from distinct branches of the pedigree.

Seventeen family members reported a history of acrocyanosis with cold exposure; none reported symptoms suggestive of lupus. Exome sequencing of three subjects identified the heterozygous mutation D18N in the TREX1 gene, which was then confirmed by Sanger sequencing in all affected as well as two unaffected family members. The mutation is already associated with familial chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE), and a systematic review of literature was undertaken to compare reports of familial CHLE and cryofibrinogenemia. Both entities were found to share highly similar clinical presentations, suggesting they are part of the same syndrome in which cryofibrinogenemia and lupus manifestations have variable penetrance.

Familial cryofibrinogenemia without lupus should be added to the spectrum of TREX1-related disease.

### Acral manifestations of paraneoplastic and collagen vascular diseases [^116FuKmk]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The skin often signals a number of systemic diseases, making skin findings of paramount significance. Paraneoplastic diseases and collagen vascular diseases are vitally important illnesses. These conditions may also present with many different acral skin findings. Paraneoplastic skin diseases, associated with some cancers, are by definition nonmalignant skin disorders and can occur before, simultaneously, or after the diagnosis of cancer. Acral paraneoplastic diseases include acanthosis nigricans maligna, acquired pachydermatoglyphia, acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, palmoplantar keratoderma, and paraneoplastic nail disorders. Collagen vascular diseases include the acral skin findings of lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Any acral skin finding may be encountered as the first indication of an undiagnosed malignancy or collagen vascular disease. The role of the dermatologist is significant, often being the first physician to suspect a malignancy or collagen vascular disease.

### Cutaneous findings in patients with acromegaly and its relationship with concomitant endocrinopathies [^116ymLs1]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Skin changes in acromegaly are often the first sign of the disease. The aim of this study was to describe the cutaneous findings in patients with acromegaly. Additionally, a secondary aim was to investigate the possible association of these findings with remission status and concomitant endocrinopathies.

In this prospective multicenter study, 278 patients over the age of 18 years with acromegaly who were followed up in 14 different tertiary healthcare institutions were included. These patients, who were followed up by the Endocrinology Department, were then referred to a dermatologist for dermatological examination. The frequency of skin lesions was investigated by detailed dermatologic examination. Dermatological diagnoses were reached by clinical, dermatological and/or dermoscopic examination, and rarely skin punch biopsy examinations in suspicious cases. The possible association of the skin findings between remitted and non-remitted patients and with concomitant endocrinopathies were evaluated.

The most common skin findings in patients with acromegaly in our study were skin tags (52.5%), cherry angiomas (47.4%), seborrhoea (37%), varicose veins (33%), acneiform lesions (28.8%), hyperhidrosis (26.9%), and hypertrichosis (18.3%). Hypertrichosis was significantly more prevalent in non-remitted patients (p: .001), while xerosis cutis was significantly more prevalent in remitted patients (p: .001). The frequency of diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism was significantly higher in patients with varicose veins and seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Assessment of acute acral lesions in a case series of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117AYzzh]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Key points**:

	- **Question**: What is the association between acute acral lesions and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children and adolescents?

	- **Findings**: In this case series of 20 patients aged 1 to 18 years with new-onset acral inflammatory lesions, all lacked systemic manifestations of COVID-19. Both reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and serologic test results were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

	- **Meaning**: An association between acral skin disease and COVID-19 has yet to be proved.

### Cryofibrinogenaemia with a good response to stanozolol [^1154i3DX]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

We report a 63-year-old patient with an IgA-kappa multiple myeloma in complete remission who developed necrotic lesions on both ears and papular, purpuric lesions on his legs and cheeks. The initial differential diagnosis included perniosis and skin necrosis secondary to interferon treatment, but subsequent investigation revealed cryofibrinogenaemia as the underlying cause. Stanozolol therapy, administered at 2 mg/12 h, achieved complete clearance of the skin lesions.

Cryofibrinogenaemia is a disease which can be under-diagnosed unless it is considered in the work-up of a patient with thrombotic skin lesions. Stanozolol is useful as first-line therapy for this disorder.

### Enjaymo [^113Y6KLY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the CARDINAL study, serious adverse reactions occurred in 10 out of 24 (42%) patients who received Enjaymo. The most common adverse reaction, occurring in more than 5% of patients, was acrocyanosis (n = 2). A fatal adverse reaction of pneumonia due to Klebsiella occurred in one patient who received the medication.

Permanent discontinuation of Enjaymo due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2 out of 24 (8%) patients. The adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation included pneumonia due to Klebsiella (n = 1) and acrocyanosis (n = 2).

Dosage interruptions were necessary for 7 out of 24 patients as a result of adverse reactions. Reasons for dosage interruption included pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia, upper abdominal pain, bacterial urinary tract infection, urosepsis, acrocyanosis, viral infection, increased blood creatinine, and infusion-related reactions.

The most common adverse reactions, reported in 25% or more of patients in the CARDINAL study, included urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection, bacterial infections, dizziness, fatigue, peripheral edema, arthralgia, cough, hypertension, and nausea.

### Raynaud's phenomenon (primary) [^117BPzRh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic vasospasm of the peripheral arteries, causing pallor, followed by cyanosis and redness with pain, and sometimes paraesthesia. On rare occasions, it can lead to ulceration of the fingers and toes, and in some cases, of the ears or nose. This review focuses on primary (idiopathic) Raynaud's phenomenon, occurring in the absence of an underlying disease. The prevalence of primary Raynaud's phenomenon varies by sex, country, and exposure to workplace vibration.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for primary Raynaud's phenomenon? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amlodipine, diltiazem, exercise, inositol nicotinate, keeping warm, moxisylyte (thymoxamine), naftidrofuryl oxalate, nicardipine, nifedipine, prazosin, and smoking cessation.

### Confirmation of fixed quarterly riliprubart regimen in patients with cold agglutinin disease using population PK/PD and exposure-response analyses [^1154GpPn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Another participant presented with a TEAE of acrocyanosis and discontinued riliprubart treatment after the initial 3.5 g IV dose. This participant had initially shown signs of acrocyanosis following a 15 mg/kg IV dose of riliprubart in Study PDY16370, which persisted during approximately one year of monthly 600 mg SC riliprubart treatment. After receiving the first 3.5 g IV dose, the acrocyanosis was considered worsened by the investigator. Acrocyanosis is a vascular manifestation of CAD, and there are currently no known pathophysiological mechanisms by which riliprubart would contribute to the onset or worsening of acrocyanosis. The etiology of acrocyanosis is poorly understood, complicating the assessment of any causal relationship in this rare disease population.

Selecting the right dosage is crucial but challenging, particularly in rare diseases, where there are uncertainties about the relationship between a drug's mechanism of action and disease pathophysiology, as well as in determining clinically meaningful changes in endpoints. These challenges are compounded in dose-finding studies by the small affected population in rare diseases. The study overcame these challenges by employing M&S approaches and leveraging prior clinical experiences with therapies that have a similar mechanism of action. The increased focus on M&S in designing clinical trials and dose determination has transformed the clinical development landscape for rare diseases. This field has expanded significantly, incorporating advanced modeling techniques.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^1173FZLM]. American Family Physician (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on tinea pedis:

- **Definition**: Tinea pedis, also known as athlete's foot, is a common dermatophytic infection affecting the skin on the feet.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of tinea pedis involves dermatophyte fungi, particularly *Trichophyton rubrum*, which thrive in warm, moist environments and cause the infection by breaking down keratin in the skin.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of tinea pedis in adults worldwide is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for tinea pedis include wearing closed-toe shoes, which can create a warm, moist environment conducive to fungal growth, as seen in athletes, soldiers, and miners. Other factors such as male gender and a personal or family history of tinea pedis have also been associated with an increased risk of the disease.

- **Disease course**: Most commonly, tinea pedis presents in the interdigital form, with symptoms such as itching, burning, malodor, redness, and scaling of the skin. In some cases, the infection can be asymptomatic, leading to a condition known as occult tinea pedis. More rare clinical presentations include chronic hyperkeratotic (moccasin distribution), vesicular, and ulcerative forms.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of tinea pedis is generally good as it is usually a self-limiting condition. However, it can recur or progress to more severe forms if not treated promptly.

### Cutaneous manifestations of Fabry disease: A systematic review [^117CHd5k]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

On January 1, 2024, a final systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases using different MeSH terms to retrieve studies on Fabry disease (FD) and skin manifestations. To include literature for which MeSH terms were not attached, relevant words in the text were also used in the literature search. Reference lists were manually searched for additional studies. The search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. As skin manifestations in FD patients are diverse, various search terms involving different skin manifestations were used to ensure the search was systematic and comprehensive. The following search string was used: (("fabry"[All Fields] OR "fabry's"[All Fields] OR "angiokeratoma corporis diffusum"[All Fields]) AND ("skin"[All Fields] OR "lymphedema"[All Fields] OR "angiokeratoma"[All Fields] OR "angiokeratomas"[All Fields] OR "hemangioma"[All Fields] OR "angioma"[All Fields] OR "angiomas"[All Fields] OR "hypohidrosis"[All Fields] OR "hyperhidrosis"[All Fields] OR "anhidrosis"[All Fields] OR "sweat"[All Fields] OR "sweating"[All Fields] OR "hair"[All Fields] OR "telangiectasiae"[All Fields] OR "telangiectasia"[All Fields] OR "telangiectasias"[All Fields])). Figure 2 illustrates the search profile.

The literature search was conducted by authors R.N. A.C. and M.M., who screened all titles and abstracts to identify studies meeting the described study criteria.

### Laser peripheral iridoplasty as initial treatment of acute attack of primary angle-closure: a long-term follow-up study [^116AawpW]. Journal of Glaucoma (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term clinical course and complications of patients with acute primary angle-closure treated with immediate laser peripheral iridoplasty followed by laser peripheral iridotomy.

Consecutive patients with acute primary angle closure, treated at the Prince of Wales Hospital from July 1997 through January 2000, were evaluated to document the clinical course and any complications from the laser treatment. Parameters such as visual acuity, intraocular pressure, gonioscopic findings, corneal and lens clarity, iris appearance, pupillary reaction, and progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy were analyzed.

Thirty eyes of 29 Chinese patients with acute primary angle closure were initially treated with either argon or diode laser peripheral iridoplasty. The mean follow-up period was 33.0 ± 9.3 months. Notably, 21 eyes (70%) had no further attacks and maintained normal intraocular pressure without medication, while 9 eyes (30%) developed chronic angle-closure glaucoma with peripheral anterior synechiae. All treated eyes presented with pigmented laser marks on the peripheral iris, but none exhibited peripheral corneal burns.

In conclusion, long-term follow-up data indicated that 30% of Chinese eyes with acute primary angle closure, treated initially with laser peripheral iridoplasty followed by laser peripheral iridotomy, developed peripheral anterior synechiae and an increase in intraocular pressure. There were minimal long-term complications associated with the treatment.

### The purple digit: An algorithmic approach to diagnosis [^113woCha]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The acute onset of purple digits is a concerning manifestation and may represent an underlying, potentially life-threatening disease. Correctly identifying the etiology of purple digits is essential for proper management and can aid in the diagnosis of systemic disease. Multiple causes of purple digits and significant overlap in clinical presentation can make diagnosis difficult. Despite the various causes of acute purple digits in the published literature, an algorithmic approach to the evaluation and management of the most common and alarming etiologies has yet to be established.

The initial step in evaluating a patient with purple digits is to determine if the cause is associated with hypoxemia or trauma. If the patient is in stable condition, the dermatologist needs to assess if the process could be related to cold exposure, such as Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, pernio, cryoglobulinemia, or frostbite. If the disease occurs independent of temperature, physical examination and histological evaluation of the skin are recommended.

The lack of peripheral pulses is concerning for acute arterial thrombosis from peripheral vascular disease or arterial embolism. Non-blanching skin changes on the digit that lack inflammation, and show microthrombosis, most likely represent a bleeding or platelet abnormality. However, if microthrombi are identified, more life-threatening processes, such as purpura fulminans or embolic phenomenon, may be occurring. Evidence of blood vessel inflammation suggests a leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

### Confirmation of fixed quarterly riliprubart regimen in patients with cold agglutinin disease using population PK/PD and exposure-response analyses [^112Vgxxi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Safety analysis:

Four treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in four patients: iron-deficiency anemia, re-hemolysis, fatigue, and acrocyanosis. Three of these TEAEs, namely iron-deficiency anemia, re-hemolysis, and fatigue, were of Grade 2 severity. The patient experiencing the TEAE of re-hemolysis also reported re-hemolysis earlier in the study before transitioning to the 3.5 g IV quarterly riliprubart regimen with an additional Day 29 dose. One TEAE of acrocyanosis was classified as Grade 3 and assessed as related to riliprubart by the investigator, resulting in the temporary interruption of the drug for this patient. Another patient discontinued participation in the study due to a post-treatment adverse event of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, attributed to the progression of underlying Waldenstrom's disease; this event was assessed as unrelated to riliprubart by the investigator. Notably, no TEAEs of meningococcal infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, serious hypersensitivity reaction, or anaphylaxis were reported.

### Cutaneous manifestations of Fabry disease: A systematic review [^111E8Wth]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Literature search**: A total of 968 records were identified across the databases of Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed (Figure 4).

- **Study characteristics**: The 23 included papers consist of one randomized controlled trial (RCT), one prospective, controlled, non-randomized clinical study, four retrospective studies, eight cross-sectional studies, and nine case series (n = 10,757 patients in total [controls included], n = 2,396 patients with any skin manifestation), describing skin manifestations in Fabry disease (FD).

	Fifteen of the 23 included studies described angiokeratomas. Five studies focused on telangiectasia. Thirteen studies described sweat abnormalities, such as anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, and hyperhidrosis. Nine studies described lymphoedema, and two studies covered hair abnormalities.

- **Patient characteristics**: Sweat abnormalities were the most common skin manifestation, affecting 57.6% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 54.7%–60.5%). Angiokeratomas were observed in 51.5% of patients (95% CI 48.3%–54.2%). Telangiectasia, lymphoedema, and hair abnormalities affected 19.9% (95% CI 17.1%–22.7%), 15.7% (95% CI 14.9%–16.6%), and 7.5% (95% CI 0.1%–15.7%) of patients, respectively.

A wide range of different variables were measured.

### Acrocyanosis secondary to esophageal cancer [^111QBdZM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of discoloration of fingers and a 1-week history of cough and sore throat. Physical examination revealed purple discolorations on fingers (Fig. 1A) and toes (Fig. 1B). Computed tomography of the chest, looking for causes of the symptoms, showed esophageal wall thickening and possible findings of metastatic cancer. Upper endoscopy revealed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's discolored fingers were diagnosed as acrocyanosis based on its appearance and the history.

- **Figure 1**: Purple discolorations on the initial visit. A: Fingers; B: Toes.

Acrocyanosis is characterized by persistent cyanosis mainly in the peripheral extremities. It is generally painless but may be accompanied by moist skin and aggravated by cold exposure. It is difficult to distinguish primary (no known cause) acrocyanosis from secondary by appearance alone. Secondary acrocyanosis relates to many conditions, including malignancies, hemopathy, neurologic disorders, psychiatric disorders, and medications. He was diagnosed with secondary acrocyanosis due to esophageal cancer. Acrocyanosis secondary to malignancy can also be classified as a paraneoplastic vascular syndrome, which may manifest with acrocyanosis, gangrene, and/or Raynaud's phenomenon. Clinicians should consider conducting a survey for secondary causes if acrocyanosis is observed.

### ESVM guidelines - the diagnosis and management of Raynaud's phenomenon [^1127a3a6]. VASA. Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten (2017). High credibility.

The ESVM 2017 guidelines recommend referring pediatric patients aged under 12 years with Raynaud's phenomenon to secondary care, as primary Raynaud's is less common in this age group. This is particularly important for follow-up and surveillance, as well as determining the indications for specialist referral.

### Primary Raynaud's phenomenon in an infant: A case report and review of literature [^1168jXD5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The infant described in this report presented with unilateral acrocyanosis at one month of age. He was diagnosed with primary RP at 9 months. This diagnosis was based on his clinical course and exclusion of other causes of unilateral acrocyanosis, including vascular anomalies, thromboembolism, and thoracic outlet syndrome. Even though acrocyanosis is a very common condition in the newborn period, involvement of only one hand was an atypical finding for infantile acrocyanosis. This finding provided a clue to consider the possibility of RP in the differential diagnosis.

- **Table 1: Causes of acrocyanosis**
	- **: Need to look for other signs of Horner's syndrome on the ipsilateral side of the face (ptosis, anhidrosis, miosis of the pupil or unequal pupils, poor light reflex, and enophthalmos).
	-: Need close clinical evaluation for the presence of central cyanosis.

Over the last decade, significant advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of RP. Irrespective of the underlying etiology, RP is manifested via vasospasm of the small muscular arteries and arterioles of the digits. Similar to benign acrocyanosis of infancy, RP is also triggered by exposure to cold and emotional stress. It can be asymmetric and may last longer than benign acrocyanosis. Based on the available data, overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, along with an imbalance of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances, may be the most likely etiology for RP. In patients with RP, digital cutaneous neurons show a deficient release of a potent vasodilator, the calcitonin-gene-related peptide.

### Raynaud's phenomenon (secondary) [^111YXTaX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodic vasospasm of the peripheral vessels, resulting in pallor, cyanosis, and redness, often accompanied by pain and sometimes paraesthesia, and, in rare cases, ulceration of the fingers and toes. This phenomenon manifests as episodic color changes of the digits, typically in response to cold exposure or stress. The classic triphasic color change includes white (ischemia), blue (deoxygenation), and red (reperfusion). Raynaud's phenomenon can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to various conditions and causes. This review focuses on secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review to address the following clinical questions: What are the effects of self-help measures for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon? What are the effects of drug treatments for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon? Our search included Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other significant databases up to May 2007. BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. Harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) were included.

- **Results**: We identified 25 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. A GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions was performed.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review presents information related to the effectiveness and safety of various interventions, including alpha-blockers and angiotensins.

### A case of pseudocyanosis [^113kqPin]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Cyanosis is an ominous physical sign indicating significant cardiac or respiratory disease. However, bluish discoloration mimicking cyanosis could occur in methaemoglobinaemia. Given the clinical implications are very different, it is important that the aetiology of bluish discoloration of tissues is correctly identified. A case is reported where the antianginal agent nicorandil was identified as the most likely cause for methaemoglobinaemia.

### Assessment of acute acral lesions in a case series of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1121Se61]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been identified as the cause of a pandemic called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this context, some associated skin diseases have been described. Cutaneous lesions referred to as acute acro-ischemia have been reported as a possible sign of COVID-19 in adolescents and children.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the pathogenesis of these newly described acute acral lesions.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prospective case series was conducted at La Fe University Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in Valencia, Spain, between April 9 and April 15, 2020. Among 32 referred patients, 20 children and adolescents with new-onset inflammatory lesions did not have a diagnosis.

- **Exposures**: Patients were not exposed to any drug or other intervention.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: We performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and a range of blood tests for possible origins of the lesions. Skin biopsies were performed in 6 patients.

- **Results**: Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 were female and 13 were male, with an age range of 1 to 18 years. Clinical findings fit into the following patterns: acral erythema (6 patients), dactylitis (4 patients), purpuric maculopapules (7 patients), and a mixed pattern (3 patients). None of the patients had remarkable hematologic or serologic abnormalities, including negative antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Biopsies performed in 6 patients showed histologic findings characteristic of perniosis.

### Prevalence, risk factors and associations of primary Raynaud's phenomenon: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^115MWccE]. BMJ Open (2015). High credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon may result in skin color changes in response to cold or stress. It can be associated with various factors such as anorexia, repetitive action or vibration, and carpal tunnel compression. The phenomenon is also linked to coronary artery disease, cold fingers or toes, and pulmonary hypertension. Other associations include cigarette smoking, female sex, age under 35 years, atherosclerotic disease, and connective tissue diseases. Additionally, injuries to the hands or feet, as well as exposure to vinyl chloride and mercury, can be related to Raynaud's phenomenon.

### Older age onset of systemic sclerosis - accelerated disease progression in all disease subsets [^117Mypyc]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The definition for organ manifestations and clinical signs is as follows:

- **Raynaud's phenomenon (RP)**: Defined by repetitive spasms of small digital arterioles/arteries at fingers and/or toes.

- **First non-RP onset**: Defined as the time/age when first skin changes or first organ manifestation (first non-RP symptom) occurs. For skin manifestation, the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) was used.

- **Pulmonary hypertension (PH)**: Defined by an increase of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAPm) of ≥ 25 mmHg at rest, evaluated by right heart catheterization. An estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) > 35/40 mmHg, as determined by echocardiography, was used to define likely PH.

- **Lung fibrosis**: Defined by bilateral fibrosis, confirmed by both X-ray and high-resolution CT scan of the chest, together with restrictive pulmonary changes seen in the pulmonary function test [forced vital capacity (FVC) < 80%].

- **Gastrointestinal involvement**: Included gastrointestinal motility disturbance, dysphagia, nausea, malabsorption, oesophageal stenosis, gastroesophageal reflux, or intestinal pseudo-obstruction.

- **Heart involvement**: Defined as one of the following: dyspnea (NYHA), syncope, palpitations, pericarditis, conduction disturbance, or diastolic dysfunction on the echocardiogram.

- **Kidney involvement**: Defined as the presence of renal insufficiency secondary to acute renal crisis (creatinine clearance age-related < 80 mL/min). The diagnosis of proteinuria was fulfilled in cases of albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/24 h or ≥ 20 mg/L, as well as proteinuria ≥ 300 mg/24 h or ≥ 200 mg/L.

- **Skeletal muscle involvement**: This section is incomplete.

### Clinical heterogeneity in ethylmalonic encephalopathy [^111QTkLw]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is a recently described inborn error of metabolism characterized clinically by developmental delay and regression, petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, and chronic diarrhea. We describe monochorionic twins presenting with hypotonia in infancy and diagnosed with ethylmalonic encephalopathy on the basis of biochemical findings. They are compound heterozygotes for missense mutations in ETHE1. Magnetic resonance imaging changes affecting the white matter, corpus callosum, and basal ganglia were seen in both patients.

At 10 years of age, they have severe axial hypotonia but never displayed petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, or chronic diarrhea. Their clinical courses differ markedly; one had an episode of coma when she was 3 years old and now has spastic quadriparesis and cannot speak. The other can freely use her upper extremities, with her pyramidal syndrome being mostly limited to the lower extremities, and can speak two languages. These patients illustrate the clinical heterogeneity of ethylmalonic encephalopathy, even in monochorionic twins.

### Acrocyanosis in a young adult: A rare presentation of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma [^112khxPq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas (EAPs) are rare catecholamine-secreting tumours. Patients commonly present with headaches, palpitations, anxiety, diaphoresis, and raised blood pressure and heart rate, which can be sustained or episodic. Less commonly, they may exhibit Raynaud's phenomenon. We present a case of an adult woman who experienced unilateral upper limb acrocyanosis and hypertension, secondary to EAP. These symptoms resolved completely after the surgical removal of the tumour.

- **Covid-19-associated perniosis**:

	- **Case 1**: A 16-year-old boy developed bilateral painful perniotic-like plaques on his toes. He had been confined to his home and denied any significant cold exposure. His brother had a cough and fever several weeks earlier, which resolved without viral diagnostic testing. A nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Serologies to assess for past SARS-CoV-2 infection were not performed.

		*Clinical morphology*: In early April of 2020, the patient, a 16-year-old New York City resident, developed bilateral perniotic-like skin lesions without cold exposure. These lesions were more extensive than conventional perniosis and included areas of ulceration and focal targetoid areas.

	- **Case 2**: A 48-year-old female resident of New City, New York, developed fever, mild leucocytosis, a purpuric macular skin rash of the legs, and perniotic lesions on the toes. A skin biopsy was performed on one of the toe lesions. Her nasopharyngeal swab test for COVID-19 was negative, and her COVID-19-associated IgG and IgM serologies were also negative.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^112C81L8]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for methemoglobinemia, specifically with respect to methemoglobin levels, EHA/ERN-EuroBloodNet 2021 guidelines recommend recognizing that key symptoms of methemoglobinemia are related to methemoglobin levels. Methemoglobin levels in inherited conditions range between 10–30%, accounting for the occurrence of cyanosis and dark brown blood as the main signs. Patients are generally asymptomatic or may present with headaches, tachycardia, and mild dyspnea at these levels (10–30%) of methemoglobin.
