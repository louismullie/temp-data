Answer Choices:
A. 3
B. π√3/2
C. 3√3
D. π√3

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how fast the water level was dropping at noon, given that the tide varies sinusoidally with a high of 15 feet at 8 A.M. and a low of 3 feet 6 hours later at 2 P.M. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about modeling the tide as a sinusoidal function and determining its amplitude, vertical shift, period, and phase shift. Then, I should verify the derivative of that function to get the rate of change. Next, I will calculate the elapsed time from the high tide to noon and plug that into the derivative to find the instantaneous rate. Finally, I will check the units and match the result to the correct answer choice, making sure I haven't made any algebraic or trigonometric errors along the way.

> Let me first confirm the key parameters for the sinusoidal model. The amplitude is half the difference between high and low tide, so (15 − 3)/2 = 6 feet. The vertical shift (midline) is the average of high and low, so (15 + 3)/2 = 9 feet. The period is twice the time from high to low tide, which is 2 × 6 = 12 hours, so the angular frequency B = 2π/12 = π/6 radians per hour. Since high tide occurs at t = 8 A.M. I should use a cosine function with a phase shift so that the maximum is at t = 8, which means no additional phase shift is needed for a standard cosine form centered at t = 8. Thus, the model is h(t) = 9 + 6 cos(π/6 (t − 8)), where t is in hours and h is in feet [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the derivative before I proceed. The rate of change of the water level is dh/dt = −6 × (π/6) sin(π/6 (t − 8)) = −π sin(π/6 (t − 8)). I initially thought the coefficient might be 6π, but hold on, I should double-check: 6 × π/6 simplifies to π, not 6π, so the correct derivative is −π sin(π/6 (t − 8)) feet per hour [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the time at which we need the rate. Noon is 4 hours after the 8 A.M. high tide, so t − 8 = 4 hours. Plugging this into the derivative, dh/dt at noon equals −π sin(π/6 × 4) = −π sin(2π/3). I need to ensure the sine value is correct: sin(2π/3) = sin(120°) = √3/2, so the rate is −π × √3/2 = −π√3/2 feet per hour. The negative sign indicates the water level is dropping, and the question asks for how fast it is dropping, so the magnitude is π√3/2 feet per hour [^notfound].

> Let me consider the answer choices and make sure I match the correct option. The magnitude π√3/2 corresponds to choice B. I should confirm that none of the other options match this value: 3 is too small, 3√3 is about 5.2, and π√3 is about 5.4, whereas π√3/2 is about 2.72, which aligns with our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is B [^notfound].

The water level drops at a rate of **π√3/2 feet per hour** at noon. This is found by modeling the tide as a sinusoidal function, taking its derivative to get the rate of change, and evaluating at noon (4 hours after high tide). The calculation shows the rate is **−π√3/2 ft/hr**, so the magnitude is π√3/2 ft/hr.

---

## Step 1: Model the tide as a sinusoidal function

Let the water level be modeled by a cosine function:

h(t) = A cos(B(t - C)) + D

where:

- (A) is the amplitude,
- (B) is the angular frequency,
- (C) is the phase shift (time of high tide),
- (D) is the vertical shift (mean water level).

Given:

- High tide at 8 A.M. (t = 8) with h = 15 ft,
- Low tide at 2 P.M. (t = 14) with h = 3 ft,
- The period is 12 hours (from high to low tide is 6 hours, so full period is 12 hours).

Calculate the parameters:

- **Amplitude**: (A = [(15–3)/2] = 6) ft,
- **Vertical shift**: (D = [(15 + 3)/2] = 9) ft,
- **Angular frequency**: (B = [2π/12] = [π/6]) rad/hr,
- **Phase shift**: (C = 8) (since high tide is at 8 A.M.).

Thus, the model is:

h(t) = 6 cos([π/6](t - 8)) + 9

---

## Step 2: Find the rate of change of the water level

Differentiate h(t) to get the rate of change:

h'(t) = -6 × [π/6] sin([π/6](t - 8)) = -π sin([π/6](t - 8))

---

## Step 3: Evaluate the rate of change at noon

At noon, t = 12 (4 hours after high tide). Substitute t = 12 into h'(t):

h'(12) = -π sin([π/6](12–8)) = -π sin([4π/6]) = -π sin([2π/3])

Since (sin([2π/3]) = [√3/2]):

h'(12) = -π × [√3/2] = -[π√3/2] ft/hr

The negative sign indicates the water level is dropping, so the rate is **π√3/2 ft/hr**.

---

## Step 4: Match the answer to the choices

The calculated rate matches option B: **π√3/2**.

---

The water level is dropping at **π√3/2 feet per hour** at noon.

Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. Sodium retention. Fluid retention. Congestive heart failure in susceptible patients. Potassium loss. Hypokalemic alkalosis. Hypertension. Musculoskeletal Muscle weakness. Steroid myopathy. Loss of muscle mass. Osteoporosis. Vertebral compression fractures. Aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads. Pathologic fracture of long bones. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisolone tablets may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated.

In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage.

Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisolone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal rhythm.

Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 p. m. to a peak level about 6 a. m. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 a. m. and 8 a. m. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day, the lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing's disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during the longterm pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses.

### Groundwater level observations in 250, 000 coastal US wells reveal scope of potential seawater intrusion [^dffe67cf]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To date, our understanding of seawater intrusion is founded on either (i) local-scale studies (Fig. 1; ref.) or (ii) hydrologic models.

Fig. 1
Local-scale studies of submarine groundwater discharges and seawater intrusion.

These local-scale studies use a variety of approaches, including hydrological models, seepage meters, and solute concentration measurements (see review by Santos et al.). We show locations where local-scale studies have demonstrated or simulated the occurrence of submarine groundwater discharge (blue points), or a landward gradient or seawater intrusion (red points). For primary results and discussion of important local considerations see refs. –. For reviews of studies of submarine groundwater discharge research and seawater intrusion prior to the year 2000 see refs. For primary references see Supplementary Table 5), which reviews 108 studies. We present a series of conceptual models based on previous studies as cross sections. a In Puget Sound – (Washington state), high relief, high recharge rates and modest groundwater use create seaward hydraulic gradients and concomitant submarine groundwater discharge. b In the Salinas Valley – (California), decades of extensive groundwater pumping and limited local recharge (due to a shallow aquitard) have increased landward hydraulic gradients and induced seawater intrusion. Seawater has moved several kilometers inland in both the shallow (180-foot) aquifer and the deeper (400-foot) aquifer. c In the West Coast Basin, (Los Angeles, California), high groundwater withdrawals have created landward hydraulic gradients and seawater intrusion, but the installation and operation of injection wells have increased hydraulic heads in the aquifer close to the coast. d In the Gulf Coast of Alabama, hydraulic heads lie just above sea level yet some intrusion has occurred. e Near Miami, (Florida), a shallow carbonate aquifer (Biscayne) has experienced seawater intrusion, likely exacerbated by the construction of leaky canals. f In Savannah(Georgia), groundwater withdrawals have drawn down a piezometric surface that once lay above sea level to now lie below sea level, creating a landward hydraulic gradient. g In Cape May(New Jersey), landward gradients are clearly reflected in piezometric data for confined aquifers (e.g. the Cohansey and Atlantic City 800-foot sand), highlighting the potential vulnerability of confined aquifers to seawater intrusion.

CDC Yellow Book 2026 — dehydration and sweat losses in heat-related illness: Apart from environmental conditions and intensity of exercise, dehydration is the most important predisposing factor in heat-related illness. Dehydration reduces exercise performance, decreases time to exhaustion, and increases internal heat load, and temperature and heart rate increase in direct proportion to the level of dehydration. Sweat is a fluid containing sodium and chloride; although it is hypotonic (contains lower concentration of sodium than blood), sweat rates may reach 1 liter per hour, resulting in substantial fluid and sodium loss.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive systematic review to assess the benefits of altered daily water intake interventions. Our study was restricted to RCTs to focus on the reported causal effects of water. We found that increased water intake (and decreased intake in one study) was statistically significantly associated with beneficial effects on several clinical outcomes. Some end points were assessed by more than 1 study and showed mixed results as to whether a statistically significant effect was detected.

Stations for tidal bay porewater sampling at low and high tide were installed across a tidal bar and channel (Fig. 1b) at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 m depths (Supplementary Data 1). Tidal bay porewater was salinity-stratified at high tide, with ca. 40 ppt water at 1 m below the surface (Fig. 4). At low tide, tidal bay porewater was temperature-stratified, as surface waters warmed above 33 °C while water at 1 m depth only warmed to 29 °C. Tidal bay porewater chemistry varied substantially through a tidal cycle, with transient aragonite saturation indices as low as 0.1 and as high as 17 and sulfate depleted relative to chlorinity-normalized concentrations by up to −3.3%.

Fig. 4
Tidal bay porewater geochemistry.

Contours show the low and high tide structure of tidal bay porewater temperature (T), salinity (S), aragonite saturation (Ω), and sulfate anomaly at the interior basin inlet on the southwestern side of Little Ambergris Cay.

Water was also sampled at 7 depths from the hypersaline pond (43 to 48 ppt) at the southern end of the cay that contained the calcified domes (Fig. 1b) (Supplementary Data 1). The pond contained largely invariant DIC and alkalinity concentrations near ca. 6 mmol/kg (Supplementary Fig. 1). In the pond, small alkalinity fluctuations caused Ω to generally decrease with depth from 18.8 to 2.2. Sulfate was in excess of chlorinity-normalized concentrations by 2.8% to 6.2%.

Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenal cortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenal cortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight.

The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing's disease, a syndrome of adrenal cortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects.

### Prevention and treatment of nonfreezing cold injuries and warm water immersion tissue injuries: a supplement to the Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines [^406c2a32]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of nonfreezing cold injuries (NFCIs; trench foot and immersion foot) and warm water immersion injuries (warm water immersion foot and tropical immersion foot) in prehospital and hospital settings. The panel graded the recommendations based on the quality of supporting evidence and the balance between benefits and risks/burdens according to the criteria published by the American College of Chest Physicians. Treatment is more difficult with NFCIs than with warm water immersion injuries. In contrast to warm water immersion injuries that usually resolve without sequelae, NFCIs may cause prolonged debilitating symptoms, including neuropathic pain and cold sensitivity.

6.2.1.1 Clarification — turnover rate determination and combined facilities: Use flow rates from flow meters to calculate TURNOVER rates and do not use the manufacturer's pump rate. For an RWF slide combined with a pool, it "must have a turnover rate that matches the rate for the pool", where pool refers to either WADING or SWIMMING POOLS but not CHILDREN'S POOLS, and the slide water must come directly from and return directly to the pool basin. When a facility meets more than one RWF type, the more protective TURNOVER rate applies (e.g., a CHILDREN'S POOL with interactive features must be 0.5 hours), except that a slide combined with a pool may match the pool rate; if also combined with another facility or if modified, the most protective TURNOVER rate applies.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^c7146ef4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Weight Loss

Four studies (22%), evaluated the effect of water on weight change in participants with overweight and obesity. In 3 parallel group RCTs, adults with overweight and obesity randomized to consume 1500 mL of water per day before meals for a period of 12 weeks to 12 months had greater weight loss compared with those in the control groups (approximately 100%, 87%, and 44% more weight vs control groups).

In a fourth studyincluding 38 participants who reported drinking less than 1000 mL/d, drinking 2000 mL/d was not associated with weight over a 6-month period (effect estimate, 0.0 [95% CI, −0.1 to 0.1]; P = 0.88). The study recruited only 63% of its target, and at 6 months, the intervention group reported drinking 1135 (95% CI, 900 to 1400) mL/d. Compared with the other 3 studies assessing weight change, this study was distinct because it included adolescents aged 17 years or younger, whereas the other studies included adults only, and the water intervention in this study was not premeal intake.

Fasting Blood Glucose

Two studies (11%), assessed the effect of a water intervention on fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Sedaghat et alrandomized 40 patients with recently diagnosed (< 5 years) type 2 diabetes into a water intervention or control group that received no water recommendation. The water intervention consisted of drinking 250 mL before breakfast, 500 mL before lunch, and 250 mL before dinner for a total of 8 weeks. There was a significant between-group difference in mean change in FBG in the intervention (−32.6 mg/dL) vs the control group (5.3 mg/dL) (P = 0.003) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). On the other hand, Nakamura et altested a water intervention consisting of drinking 550 mL within 2 hours of waking and 550 mL before bedtime and found that FBG increased by approximately 0.6 mg/dL after 12 weeks in both groups. This RCT consisted of 60 adults with baseline FBG between 90 and 126 mg/dL and excluded participants receiving medication and/or lifestyle modification for diabetes. Baseline FBG of study participants was approximately 97 mg/dL, substantially lower than that in Sedaghat et al, which was approximately 225.7 mg/dL in the intervention group and 221.7 mg/dL in the control group.

Table 3.2.3 Cold injuries — non-freezing (trench foot, pernio) and freezing (frostbite) — management and key thresholds are outlined as follows: Non-freezing injuries occur in "wet settings 0°C–15°C (32°F–59°F)". Trench foot management includes "Dry passive rewarming, elevation, pain relief (ibuprofen if tolerated, narcotics if severe pain)" and "Avoid rapid active rewarming". Pernio presents with "Erythrocyanotic papules, pruritus, pain" and management is "Dry, protect, prevent more cold/wet exposure, pain relief as above". For frostbite, initiate "Rapid water rewarming for all stages 37°C–39°C (98.6°F–102.2°F) with pain relief as above" after addressing hypothermia ("Search for and treat any coexisting hypothermia first"). For first-degree frostbite, "Add ibuprofen 400 mg twice daily for anti-inflammatory effect if not already using for pain"; for second-degree, "may aspirate clear bullae"; for third-degree, provide "definitive care for thrombolytics or iloprost within 48 hours", "leave bullae intact", and note that "Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) scintigraphy or magnetic resonance imaging predicts tissue loss".

Assessment of supporting evidence — boiling and hot-water use: Bringing water to boil (100°C/212°F) will kill pathogenic microorganisms. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. Bringing water to boil at 5000 m elevation (16,000 ft) to boil (83°C/181°F) will kill pathogenic organisms. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. Tap water that has been tanked for 30 min or longer and is too hot to touch (60°C) significantly reduces the number of pathogenic microorganisms but should be used for short periods only when other methods are unavailable. Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence. Additionally, boiling is the only easily recognizable endpoint without using a thermometer, and if fuel is scarce, heat water until first sign of simmering (small bubbles rising from the bottom), reduce or remove heat, and leave container covered for 30 min; as a rule of thumb, water too hot to touch falls within the pasteurization range, and tap water kept hot in a tank for at least 30 min and too hot to keep a hand immersed for 5 s (estimated 55–65°C; 131–149°F) has been suggested for short periods of need, while in the long-term drinking from water heaters is not advised because of higher levels of metals and chemical contaminants at elevated temperatures.

Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) — prehospital care — Victims with swollen feet should not walk unless walking is necessary for evacuation, and victims who must walk should wear thick socks for padding in nonconstricting footwear, if possible (1C). Treat associated conditions, including hypothermia and frostbite, before treating NFCI (1B); extremities with NFCI should be rewarmed passively at room temperature (1A) and should be elevated (1B). Rewarming with warm water, forced air, or a heating pad should not be attempted (1A), and administer analgesia as needed for pain (1A).

### The immersion foot syndrome. 1946 [^c5c3c1f6]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

1. Prolonged exposure of the extremities to cold insufficient to cause tissue freezing produces a well-defined syndrome. 'Immersion foot' is one of the descriptive but inaccurate terms applied to this syndrome. The clinical features, aetiology, pathology, prevention, and treatment of immersion foot are considered in detail. A discussion on pathogenesis is also included. 2. In the natural history of a typical case of immersion foot there are four stages: the period of exposure and the pre-hyperaemic, hyperaemic, and post-hyperaemic stages. 3. During exposure and immediately after rescue the feet are cold, numb, swollen, and pulseless. Intense vasoconstriction sufficient to arrest blood-flow is believed to be the predominant factor during this phase. 4. This is followed by a period of intense hyperaemia, increased swelling, and severe pain. Hyperaemia is due to the release in chilled and ischaemic tissues of relatively stable vasodilator metabolites; pain may be the result of relative anoxia of sensory nerve-endings. 5. Within 7–10 days of rescue the intense hyperaemia and swelling subside and pain diminishes in intensity. A lesser degree of hyperaemia may persist for several weeks. Objective disturbances of sensation and sweating and muscular atrophy and paralysis now become apparent. These findings are correlated with damage to the peripheral nerves. 6. After several weeks the feet become cold-sensitive; when exposed to low temperature they cool abnormally and may remain cold for several hours. Hyperhidrosis frequently accompanies this cold-sensitivity. The factors responsible for these phenomena are incompletely understood; several possible explanations are considered. 7. Severe cases may develop blisters and gangrene. The latter is usually superficial and massive loss of tissue is rare. 8. The hands may be affected but seldom as severely as the feet. The essential features of immersion hand are the same as those of immersion foot. 9. Prognosis depends upon severity. The extent of anaesthesia at 7–10 days has been found a useful guide to the latter, and has formed a basis of a method of classification. 10. Rapid warming of chilled tissues is condemned. Cold therapy is of value for the relief of pain in the hyperaemic stage, but should not be used in the pre-hyperaemic stage. Sympathectomy and other measures designed to increase the peripheral circulation should not be employed immediately after rescue, but may have a place in the treatment of the later cold-sensitive state. This paper records the results of observations made during 1941 and 1942. Delay in publication has been necessary because of war-time difficulties of maintaining contact between authors. In this respect we have received much help from Surgeon Rear-Admiral J. W. McNee. We wish to thank Professors R. S. Aitken and J. R.

### Prevention and treatment of nonfreezing cold injuries and warm water immersion tissue injuries: a supplement to the Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines [^f5915a5a]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Warm water immersion injuries — diagnosis and clinical course can usually be established clinically by history and physical examination. Warm water immersion foot results from immersion in warm water at 15 to 32°C (59–90°F) for as long as 3 d and presents with painful feet, white, wrinkled plantar surfaces, and sometimes mild swelling, with weight bearing causing pain and paresthesias described as tingling or "walking on rope". Tropical immersion foot results from immersion in warm water at 22 to 32°C (72–90°F) for > 3 d and initially causes burning pain greater on the dorsum than the soles and swelling often too severe to replace boots; by hospital admission, feet are usually bright red with demarcation above the boots and pitting edema of the dorsa and ankles.

Halogen disinfection — field-use factors and concentration targets indicate that higher concentrations are more effective, but lower concentrations can be used with longer contact times; cold water slows the chemical disinfection reaction, so extend contact times; organic contamination consumes halogen, so double the amount of chlorine or iodine in cloudy water, clarify water to remove contaminants, and due to uncertain halogen demand it is prudent to use 3–4 mg L⁻¹ as a target halogen concentration range for clear surface water, while lower concentrations (eg, 2 mg L⁻¹) can be used for backup treatment of questionable tap water or high quality well water; taste becomes distinct above 2–3 mg L⁻¹, and techniques that reduce residual disinfectant levels should only be used at the time of consumption, not if water will be stored.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^1eb0921f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Non-freezing cold injuries — Trench foot (or immersion foot) is a non-freezing cold-related injury after prolonged immersion of the feet in water 15°C (< 59°F), with stage 1 numbness and clumsiness during exposure that progresses on rewarming to stage 2 with mottling and color changes, stage 3 involving hyperemia and pain with or without tissue loss, and stage 4 that may leave the patient with intense sensitivity to repeated cold exposure and neuropathic pain; treatment includes passive rewarming, drying, elevation, and analgesics. Pernio (or chilblains) are purplish lesions that occur primarily on the skin of hands and earlobes after exposure to cold wet conditions, with pruritus and pain that are exacerbated by rapid rewarming; prevention (keeping skin warm and dry) is key; pharmacologic treatment with nifedipine shows promise; however, this use is considered off-label and warrants caution and clear instructions to the traveler because of the risk of hypotension with associated dizziness.

### Storing and managing water for the environment is more efficient than mimicking natural flows [^9b09c70f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Inflow pass-through performance

Performance on environmental baseflow and flow shaping objectives generally improve as a larger portion of inflow passes through the reservoir (Fig. 3A, B). Larger pass-through flows come closer to mimicking natural flows and variability. Pass-through of 10% of inflows through the reservoir fails to meet environmental demands. In dry years, environmental baseflow deliveries average 44% of demand and flow shaping deliveries average 20% of demand (Fig. 3A). In wet years, the 10% pass-through delivers 32% of environmental baseflow demand, on average, and flow shaping deliveries average 30% of demand (Fig. 3B). Environmental baseflow demands are met more often in dry years than wet years because the regulatory requirements that environmental baseflows represent are smaller in dry years than wet years. For all years with 10% pass-through, the interquartile range of environmental baseflow shortages is 203–780 Mm³/yr (165–632 thousand acre-feet per year [taf/yr]) (Fig. 4A), and flow shaping shortages range from 617–762 Mm³/yr (500–618 taf/yr) (Fig. 4B).

### How does washing without water perform compared to the traditional bed bath: a systematic review [^ec0c5366]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Results of physiological washing without water outcomes

Outcomes related to hygiene and skin condition are regarded to be physiological outcomes of washing without water in this review. The high quality study by Schoonhoven et al. measured outcomes related to residents' skin condition, being any skin abnormalities and significant skin lesions. If the skin of certain parts of the body was not intact, the severity of the skin lesion was considered to be significant, whereas skin abnormalities included, amongst others, erythema and skin discoloration. A significant difference in the prevalence of skin abnormalities over time (6 weeks) was observed between the washing without water group, in which the prevalence decreased, and the traditional bed bath group, in which the prevalence increased. However, no significant difference was found regarding the occurrence of significant skin lesions over time. Other findings related to the skin condition were presented in the studies of moderate quality from Sheppard and Brenner and Gillis et al. The results of Sheppard and Brenner showed a significant difference between the washing without water group and the traditional bed bath group regarding skin dryness in favor of washing without water. Furthermore, Gillis et al. concluded that skin hydration at the cheek increased significantly more when washing without water was adopted compared to the traditional bed bath. No differences were found for skin hydration at hands or legs. Physiological outcomes related to hygiene were only reported in the study of moderate quality by Larson et al. where no significant differences were found.

### Epidemiologic features of acute pediatric diarrhea in managua, Nicaragua, from 2011 to 2019 [^24055e2b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Risk factor analysis.

Individual- and household-level risk factors for acute diarrhea were analyzed. Younger age was strongly associated with diarrhea across the study period; the incidence of diarrhea decreased significantly with increasing age (Table 2). With increasing age, the model-predicted incidence rate of diarrhea occurrence decreased (Figure 2). The steepest slope was between 2 to 4 years of age, followed by a period of slow decline and a subsequent sharp decrease between 10 to 14 years of age. Male children had a slightly greater crude incidence rate of diarrhea compared with female children, but in both univariable and multivariable analyses, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence rate by gender. Higher BMI categories were associated with a decreased incidence of diarrhea in the univariable, but not the multivariable, analysis.

Figure 2. Incidence rates of acute diarrhea per 1,000 person-years by age and hours without water. (A) Effects of age. (B) Effects of hours without water. Trend lines were estimated using generalized additive modes, which do not assume the modeled relationships have a linear form.

In a multivariable analysis, participants who reported at least 8 hours per day without water supply in the home had an incidence rate of diarrhea 1.17 times greater than participants in homes having an uninterrupted water supply during the day (Table 2). A linear relationship between the hours without water in the home and the incidence rate of diarrhea at the individual level was found, holding other covariates fixed (Figure 2).

We performed the same risk factor analysis with other statistical models appropriate for count data, all of which exhibited similar goodness-of-fit metrics. Predictions from alternative models were very similar to the main results (Supplementaland).

Protection from cold — measures should be taken to minimize exposure of tissue to cold, including avoiding environmental conditions that predispose to frostbite, specifically below 0°C (some risk 0 to −15°C and increasing risk below −15°C, even with low wind speeds), protecting skin from moisture, wind, and cold, and avoiding perspiration or wet extremities. Additional measures include increasing insulation and skin protection (eg, adding clothing layers, changing from gloves to mitts), ensuring beneficial behavioral responses (eg, not being under the influence of illicit drugs, alcohol, or extreme hypoxemia), using chemical hand and foot warmers and electric foot warmers to maintain peripheral warmth with cautions that warmers should be close to body temperature before activation and must not be placed directly against skin or constrict flow if used within a boot, and regularly checking oneself and the group for extremity numbness or pain.

Warm water immersion injuries (WWIF and tropical immersion foot [TIF]) — WWIF and TIF are transient syndromes caused by prolonged exposure to warm water. WWIF presents with white, wrinkled soles of the feet, is caused by exposure to water at temperatures of 15 to 32°C (59–90°F) for < 3 d, resolves in 1 to 3 d if the feet are dried and elevated, and can also affect the hands. TIF is more severe, presents with symmetrical erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the ankles and dorsa of the feet, and is caused by exposure to warm water at temperatures of 22 to 32°C (72–90°F) for > 3 d; it is treated by drying and elevation of the feet with recovery taking from 4 to 12 d. Neither WWIF nor TIF cause sequelae, and terms including "paddy-field foot", "jungle foot", "tropical jungle foot", "jungle rot", and "paddy foot" are not well defined, with jungle foot usually referring to TIF.

Acaricides for house dust mites — do not recommend the use of acaricides to eliminate mite populations owing to their limited efficacy at decreasing allergen levels and concerns about the use of chemical agents in the home (Strength of recommendation: moderate, B evidence). Benzyl benzoate active powder kills 90% of mites in culture within 12 hours and 100% in 24 hours but needs to be reapplied at 2- to 3-month intervals, and carpet treatment decreased airborne and carpet dust mite allergen concentrations by more than 64% without shown clinical benefit. In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 12 adult patients with asthma assessed at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, there were no significant differences in mean allergen levels or in lung function or medication use versus control. Other agents show laboratory or short-term effects: disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (2 cups per 2 gallons of H₂O per 100 square feet) decreased survival and population growth of D farinae and D pteronyssinus by 98% at 8 week; tri-n-butyltin maleate killed all mites after 1 day at 25°C and 75% RH; and priminose methyl reduced Der p 1 by greater than 90% for 6 weeks. Because of exposure concerns, acaricides are not recommended for use on mattresses.

Frostbite — Injury begins with ice crystal formation in tissue, and with education and proper gear, most frostbite is preventable; the majority of cases occur in unprepared people unable to secure shelter or after accidents. Superficial frostbite (1st and 2nd degree) may include reddening of the skin and edema with or without clear fluid-filled blister formation; superficial tissue loss is possible, but there is a favorable prognosis, whereas deep frostbite (3rd and 4th degree) involves vascular thrombosis, blood filled blisters, and deep tissue necrosis. Frostbitten skin may appear blanched and may feel numb; efforts should be made to rewarm the skin quickly in water heated to 37°C–39°C (98.6°F–102.2°F), and if no thermometer is available, test water with uninjured skin to ensure water is not scalding; offer analgesics because rewarming may be intensely painful, and once tissue thaws, refreezing causes worsened injury, so it is preferable to delay rewarming until sustained thaw can be assured.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^3fe4030a]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Pool content turnover rate — definition, 6-hour standard, and calculation are detailed. The turnover rate is the number of times a pool's contents can be filtered though its filtration equipment in a 24-hour period, and a 6-hour turnover rate will result in 98% clarification if the pool is properly designed. A typical-use pool should have a pump and filtration system capable of pumping the entire contents of the pool though the filters every 6 hours; to determine compliance, use Turnover rate = pool volume (gallons)/flow rate×60 (minutes in hour). A sample calculation shows Turnover rate = 90,000 (gallons in pool)/ 180 gallons per minute×60 (minutes in hour), yielding an 8.3-hour turnover rate = 90,000 (pool volume in gallons)/10,800, which would not meet the required turnover rate of 6 hours.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^3fcc20a9]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In severe hyponatraemia cases, cerebral oedema may develop as water shifts from extracellular stores to balance out the relative hyponatraemia in the vascular space. To compensate this shift from causing too many homoeostatic changes, the brain loses osmotic solutes to try to protect itself from cerebral oedema. If hyponatraemia is corrected too rapidly, brain cells shrink as serum sodium is corrected. It has been previously established that correction of the sodium should not occur more rapidly than approximately 0.5–1 mmol/L/hour or a total of 10 to 12 mmol/L per 24 hours, while some have even proposed not to exceed 6 mmol/L. Once treatment has commenced to correct the hyponatraemia, frequent serum sodium checks should be performed to allow close monitoring and adjustment of fluid infusion rates. If the serum sodium level begins to rise too rapidly and adjustment of intravenous fluids is insufficient to slow down the over rapid correction, infusion of hypotonic fluids to decrease the serum sodium level may be required to prevent the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome. This complication can be caused by exceeding generally agreed safe limits of serum sodium correction, with corrections greater than 12 mmol/L over 24 hours, 25 mmol/L over 48 hours, or inadvertent hypernatraemia during correction of hyponatraemia, resulting in rapid swelling of the nervous system parenchyma that cannot adapt quickly enough to the changing osmolality. Despite the severity and devastating consequences of this syndrome, neurologists should not shy away from aggressively treating symptomatic patients who had an acute stroke with hyponatraemia because without prompt treatment, seizures, coma or death may ensue.

### Primary immune deficiencies with aberrant IgE production [^1e9e2b0f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

IgE antibodies play a central role in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases and in host immunity against parasitic infections. IgE has potent activities on mast cells and basophils. IgE class switching is a very tightly controlled process, and serum IgE levels are very low compared with other immunoglobulin isotypes. Transcription factors that activate or inhibit the IgE gene promoter, as well as T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokines are important in the regulation of IgE levels. Hyper-IgE syndrome; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX); Omenn syndrome; and atypical complete DiGeorge syndrome are primary immune deficiencies that are associated with elevated serum IgE levels. Increased IgE levels in IPEX, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and Omenn syndrome are likely related to increased T(H)2 cytokine production caused by decreased a number or function of CD4(+)CD25(+)forkhead box protein P3(+) regulatory T cells. The link between signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 mutations and elevated serum IgE levels in hyper-IgE syndrome is unclear. Insight into IgE regulation provided by the study of primary immune deficiencies with elevated IgE has important implications for allergic diseases.

### How does washing without water perform compared to the traditional bed bath: a systematic review [^1d0ec14d]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A nurse enters Mr. Johnson's room to give him a bed bath. Mr. Johnson is surprised that she only brings a small package with her instead of the washbasin with water, soap and towels that he would expect. After she explains to Mr. Johnson what she is going to do and after she uncovers him, the nurse opens the package and takes a washcloth. Mr. Johnson feels that the washcloth is wet when it is wiped over his face. After the first washcloth, seven other washcloths are used to bathe all his body parts separately while other body parts are covered again to mitigate cold and vulnerability. His skin dries within a minute, even though no towel is used. When the nurse is finished, she throws away all the washcloth, together with the empty package.

This hypothetical scenario represents the actual bathing practice in an increasing number of European and American health care institutions for immobile patients who, irrespective of the cause or level of immobility, need to be bathed in bed. The package with washcloths in the example is often called "washing without water", which can be described as disposable, prepacked products for the full body wash consisting of a non-woven carrier (washcloth) and a no-rinse cleansing fluid that allows nursing staff to bathe someone without the use of water. This definition of washing without water does not include products for disinfection of the body or products used to sanitize certain body areas, such as the perineum.

Personal hygiene assistance, including bathing, is a key nursing activity that is reasoned to be related to quality of life and quality of care. Bathing has been argued to have an effect on patient well-being and patient comfort. Furthermore, preserving skin integrity and personal hygiene are proposed to be important physiological functions of bathing, which in turn prevent infections and disease.

### Safely returning America to work part II: industry-specific guidance [^f1411be5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 transmission — respiratory routes and distancing limits are described as follows: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is frequently transmitted by the respiratory route with particles dispersed as droplets or aerosol; droplets are larger and heavier and fall to the ground relatively quickly in still air, whereas aerosols are smaller particles that remain suspended for longer times and may be transmitted further. Certain procedures such as intubation, bronchoscopy, or suctioning are likely to create many aerosol particles, and aerosols may also be generated by singing or similar activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a "6-foot perimeter" distancing based on droplets falling to the ground within that distance, but this rule is not completely protective because smaller particles or aerosols may be produced or develop and droplets may be carried by convective air movement, remaining airborne and traveling further; these are affected by airflow rates, direction, and turbulence. Non-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs) to reduce transmission include air ventilation/filtration, surface cleaning and sanitation, hand hygiene, avoiding touching the face, and physical distancing, within a hierarchy of exposure control that includes personal protective equipment, and respirators and face coverings are generally the least effective means of controlling most exposures.

### Phase variation of nadA in invasive Neisseria meningitidis isolates impacts on coverage estimates for 4C-menB, a menB vaccine [^eab6ffe3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

FIG 2
NadA 5′TAAA repeat tract lengths of 6, 9, and 12 are predominant in UK clinical meningococcal isolates. Whole-genome sequences of invasive disease meningococcal isolates isolated in the United Kingdom between July 2010 and October 2016 were extracted from the MRF-MGL database. Sequences were analyzed using PhasomeIt to extract and analyze nadA 5′TAAA repeat tracts. Repeat numbers were classified into the following expression classes: low, 3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 repeats; and intermediate/high, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20 repeats. (A) MenB isolates separated by NadA variant. (B) MenW isolates separated by NadA variant. (C) MenB and MenW isolates expressing NadA-2/3 peptides grouped by predicted expression based on repeat number. Data were analyzed by the chi-square test (*, P ≤ 0.001).

Alternating repeat lengths lead to periodic expression in different NadA variants.

NadA expression was measured by ELISA and Western blotting for MenB:CC32, MenB:CC213, MenB:CC269, MenB:CC1157, and MenB:CC11/MenW:CC11 isolates with differing repeat numbers and NadA variants. Periodic expression was observed in both MenB and MenW strains; however, the pattern varied depending on the NadA variant. MenB:CC11 and MenW:CC11 isolates harboring NadA-2/3 had similar patterns of periodic expression, with 6, 9, 12, and 15 repeats producing low levels of expression (Fig. 3A; Fig. S1A and S2A). Both 17 and 20 repeats also resulted in low NadA expression, suggesting that the periodicity may be altered by these long repeat tracts. All other repeat numbers produced higher levels of expression, with 7 and 10 repeats producing intermediate levels of expression compared to the high expression levels with 8 and 11 repeats, respectively. Application of this NadA expression pattern to all invasive isolates with NadA-2/3 peptides indicated that low-expression repeat numbers occurred in a significantly larger number of isolates than the high-expression repeat numbers for both the MenB and MenW serogroups (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively; chi-square test) (Fig. 2C).

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^371e4f4c]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Replacement of body fluids is important for repair of circulation and renal functions, enhancing glucose excretion and decreasing levels of counterregulatory hormones that stimulate hyperglycemia.

The objectives of fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy in DKA are restoration of circulating volume, replacement of sodium and the extracellular and intracellular fluid deficit of water, restoration of glomerular filtration with enhanced clearance of glucose and ketones from the blood, and avoidance of excessive rates of fluid administration so as not to exacerbate the risk of cerebral edema (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Management of diabetic ketoacidosis (adapted from).

Initial intravenous fluid administration should begin immediately with an isotonic solution (0.9% sodium chloride) in a 10 to 20 ml/kg bolus over 1 to 2 hours. Subsequent fluid management (deficit replacement) should be with 0.9% normal saline for at least 4–6 hours; thereafter, deficit replacement should be with a solution with a tonicity greater than or equal to 0.45% saline with added potassium. The remainder replacement intravenous fluid should be given over at least 48 hours. Urinary losses should not be added to the calculation of replacement fluids.

Potassium replacement may be initiated as soon as urine output is documented, as long as serum potassium levels are ≤ 6.5 mEq/L, usually from the second hour of resuscitation phase, and 20–40 mEq/L of potassium will be included to the fluid regimen, at a maximum rate of 0.5 mEq/kg/hour. There is no consensus about administering potassium chloride or potassium phosphate, and a total correction with a 19.1% potassium chloride (KCl) solution is also accepted. If potassium phosphate salts are used, it is recommended to use half of 25% monopotassium phosphate (1 mL = 1.8 mEq of potassium) and half of 19.1% KCl (1 mL = 2.5 mEq of potassium)

Phosphate levels are usually low in DKA and may drop even further after insulin therapy is initiated; there is a theoretical reason for its replacement that is the decrease in tissue oxygenation due to a fall in 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) levels (phosphate depletion syndrome), however, the benefits of its replacement have not yet been proven, since it may induce hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia.

### Dutch learn to live with, instead of fight, rising seas… [^ddb6193d]. jp.reuters.com (2009). Low credibility.

By Ben Berkowitz AMSTERDAM
- The watermark column inside Amsterdam's city hall is more than just a tourist attraction, it's a reminder that the Dutch capital like much of the rest of the Netherlands is well below sea level. Some 70 percent of the country's economic output is generated below sea level, protected by a complex-system of ancient dikes and modern cement barriers that hold back water from the sea and the multitude of rivers that weave through the country. Now, with scientists' predicting that sea levels will rise by about one meter this century, the Dutch are reversing centuries of tradition to create natural flood plains for rivers as well as rebuild mangrove swamps as buffers against the sea. "We've been adapting for 1, 000 years. That's nothing new. It's just that climate change is going faster than it was before, " said Lennart Silvis, the operational manager of the public-private Netherlands Water Partnership.

Instead of raising dikes, the Dutch want to reclaim land and build public recreation areas that can absorb storm surges. Rather than dredging sand to maintain beaches, they are looking at dumping piles of sand offshore to create "sand engines" shifted by the tides. Marshes may be renewed to break the power of incoming waves. There is even a campaign called "Room for the River" which would weaken levees to recreate natural flood plains along rivers, including the Rhine and its tributaries which flooded in 1995 following heavy rainfall that almost led to a calamity. While the dikes can be shored up, as happened in 1995 preventing the country from being submerged in 6 meters of water, the dikes could collapse if the sand and clay that form the barriers absorb too much water over time.

Hence the need for a longer-term solution given the possibility the Netherlands may face sustained pressure from its rivers throughout this century as glaciers in Switzerland melt, raising the water level of the Rhine. River discharge in the country is expected to rise 12. 5 percent in the coming years. This is on top of rising levels already seen in the past 10 to 12 years. Those who work to promote such ideas say natural water buffers are a smarter move than building higher flood walls that may not stand the test of time as sea and river levels rise. "100 billion spent on safety alone under uncertain conditions is maybe not the wisest investment, " said Raimond Hafkenscheid, director of the Co-operative Program on Water and Climate in The Hague. SWIMMING TO SURVIVE Perhaps no country on Earth lives with rising seas in the way the Netherlands does.

If the nationwide network of pumping stations failed, within a week the entire country would be covered in 1 meter of water. From the age of four, virtually all children in the Netherlands start five years of swimming classes. Achieving the final "diploma" requires a test that includes treading water for half a minute, navigating an obstacle and then swimming 100 meters while fully dressed in heavy winter clothing. It may sound extreme, but for Dutch families that remember the great flood of 1953, which killed over 1, 800 people, wiped two villages off the map and required one of the post-war era's largest international relief efforts, it is a small price to pay for peace of mind. That flood, the source of the high watermark at Amsterdam city hall, drove water levels 4. 5 meters above normal.

### Impact of prolonged fasting on the risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in the urine: calcium phosphate lithogenesis during prolonged fasting in a healthy cohort [^b1ef4be8]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Intermittent fasting and curtailing water intake for extended periods were likely common in Paleolithic times. Today it occurs for religious and dietary reasons. This restriction in intake should cause a decrease in the urine flow rate while raising the concentration of certain substances in urine to the point of precipitation. In this study we measured the risk of CaHPO 4 precipitation following 18 hours of food and water deprivation.

Materials and Methods

Urine samples were periodically collected from 15 healthy subjects who fasted and abstained from drinking any liquid for 18 hours. The urine constituents Ca 2+, HPO 4 2- and pH involved in CaHPO 4 formation were measured at various times throughout the fasting day. A comparison was made with control data, which consisted of diurnal urine collections taken throughout a separate nonfasting day prior to the fasting day.

Results

The mean ± SEM urine flow rate decreased significantly from 0.93 ± 0.1 mL per minute in the control group to 0.37 ± 0.05 mL per minute in the fasting group (p < 0.05). Mean Na + and Ca 2+ excretion rates decreased significantly from 127 ± 12 to 54 ± 13 μmol per minute and from 3.2 ± 0.4 to 0.80 ± 0.21, respectively. Mean urinary Na + and Ca 2+ concentrations also decreased from 161 ± 11.6 to 122 ± 16.0 mmol/l and from 3.7 ± 0.5 to 2.0 ± 0.55, respectively. Urinary pH and the concentration of phosphate, citrate and magnesium were not significantly affected.

Conclusions

Although the steady decrease in the urine flow rate was statistically significant during 18 hours of food and water deprivation, there was no evidence that the calculated risk of CaHPO 4 precipitation in the healthy subjects had increased.

### Clinical implications for exercise at altitude among individuals with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^913d1801]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Cardiovascular hemodynamic changes that occur in response to acute (minutes to hours) and chronic (days to weeks) exposure to hypoxia compared with sea level.

Acutely, heart rate, cardiac output, muscle flow, and stroke volume increase. However, with sustained exposure, all of these variables decrease to levels at or below sea level. Blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance decrease during acute exposure, but may increase progressively with time to levels at or above sea level values. From Baggish et al. Reprinted by permission from Springer. © 2014.

The impact of a hypoxic stimulus may vary between individuals based on medical history, risk factors, and medications. However, there are a few major issues common to all patients with cardiovascular disease that must be emphasized. First, reductions in oxygen availability may exacerbate symptoms. Second, the combination of hypoxia with other environmental stressors (temperature, exercise, dehydration, or injury) may precipitate an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Third, mountainous locations are in remote environments with limited access to health care. As such, outcomes following an ACS may be worse than sea‐level conditions. Finally, sudden cardiac death (SCD) may occur. For example, the risk of SCD for hiking (1 in 780 000) and downhill skiing (1 in 630 000) at altitude is ≈4‐ and 2‐fold higher than the SCD risk among the general population, respectively, especially on a per‐hour basis when compared with other endurance activities at sea level such as jogging (1 in 3 000 000).

### Performance analysis of ultrahigh-speed vitreous cutter system [^ff8f6fb4]. Retina (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate flow rates and duty cycle for different sizes of ultra-high-speed pneumatic vitreous cutters.

Methods

A precision balance measured the mass of water and vitreous removed from a vial. Porcine vitreous was obtained within 12 hours of killed at a local slaughterhouse and kept at 4 °C. Twenty-, 23- and 25-gauge (n = 3 of each gauge) pneumatic cutters were tested at 0 (water), 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, and 5,000 cuts per minute with aspiration levels of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 mmHg. Frame-by-frame analysis of high-speed video was used to determine the duty cycle.

Results

Larger gauge cutters associated with higher aspiration levels produced greater vitreous and water flow rates (P < 0.05). As the cut rate increased, the vitreous flow rate increased (maximum flow at 5,000 cuts per minute) and the water flow rate decreased (P < 0.05). The duty cycle of the new-generation cutters decreased as cut speeds increased, using all 3 gauges (P < 0.001). Vitreous flow rates averaged 10 times less than water flow rates using the same cutter at the same settings.

Conclusion

Ultra-high-speed vitreous cutters produce consistent vitreous and water flow rates across the tested range of cuts per minute and aspiration levels.

Table 2
Dermatological and neurological profile of the study participants

About 25% of the participants had high level of diabetes foot risk, while 2.5% and 5% had moderate and low levels of diabetes foot risk, respectively (figure 1A). Male participants had significantly high level diabetic foot risk compared with female participants (26.1 vs 23.1; p < 0.0001) (figure 1B).

Figure 1
(A) Level of diabetic foot risk in the study population. (B) Level of diabetic foot risk by gender.

The participants in the moderate and high levels of diabetes foot risk were 3–4 years older than those in the low and very low foot risk groups (p < 0.001). The median FBS levels were found to be significantly different from very low-risk (139 mg/dL), low-risk (145 mg/dL), moderate-risk (156 mg/dL) and HR groups (150 mg/dL); p < 0.001. However, they were found to be high in the moderate-risk group compared with the very low-risk, low-risk and HR groups. Similarly, there was a significant increase of PPBS levels noted from very low-risk to moderate-risk groups (210, 213, 230 mg/dL; p < 0.001), with a slight dip in HR group (217 mg/dL). Median HbA1c% (8.3% vs 8.0% and 8.1%; p < 0.001) was higher in HR group compared with other groups. It was noted that 70% of people with HR feet were found to have diabetic nephropathy, while none was present in other groups. The proportion of retinal complications increased significantly from very low-risk to HR group (8.7%; 11.3%; 24.3% and 75.5%, p < 0.001) and the difference was statistically significant (table 3).

5. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids, which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli. Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Acute adrenocortical insufficiency.

Average and large doses of cortisone or hydrocortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Patients with a stressed myocardium should be observed carefully and the drug administered slowly since premature ventricular contractions may occur with rapid administration. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

Appropriate examination of any joint fluid present is necessary to exclude a septic process. A marked increase in pain accompanied by local swelling, further restriction of joint motion, fever, and malaise are suggestive of septic arthritis. If this complication occurs and the diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Sodium retention Fluid retention. A.

### Chlorhexidine vs routine foot washing to prevent diabetic foot ulcers: a randomized clinical trial [^ea653e58]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Daily use of a chlorhexidine wipe for foot washing compared with a soap and water wipe did not lead to a statistically significant reduction in the hazard of new foot complications among veterans at high risk for a diabetic foot ulcer. When significant imbalances in key variables were adjusted for, there was little change. We chose to adjust for preulcer at randomization because of the imbalance with randomization and its association with the primary outcome. A preulcer is often the precursor of an ulcer. In the prespecified subgroup sensitivity analyses of those with a prior foot complication, we also adjusted for time since healing for the same reasons. These sensitivity analyses made little difference to effect estimates and no difference to conclusions regarding the primary outcome. Chlorhexidine resistance, as estimated by chlorhexidine MICs from bacteria on the feet after trial completion, did not differ significantly between treatment groups, and the bounds of the CIs were not clinically significant and consistent with the error of the assay (ie, an absolute log 2 –normalized mean difference MIC less than 1 or a less than 2-fold difference). Adverse events were not significantly greater in the chlorhexidine group.

### Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-deficient hematopoietic cells can be efficiently mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [^3f2ed8db]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is an essential cytoskeleton regulator found in cells of the hematopoietic lineage and controls the motility of leukocytes. The impact of WAS gene deficiency on the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells in circulation has remained unexplored but information would be pertinent in the context of autologous gene therapy of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The response to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilization was investigated in a murine WAS knock-out model of the disease, by measuring hematologic parameters, circulation and engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. In the steady-state, adult WAS knock-out mice have B-cell lymphopenia, marked neutrophilia, increased counts of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells and splenomegaly, presumably caused by the retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells due to high levels of splenic CXCL12. In spite of these anomalies, the administration of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor mobilizes progenitor/stem cells in WAS knock-out mice to the same level and with the same kinetics as in wild-type control mice. Mobilized peripheral blood cells from WAS knock-out mice can be transduced and are able to engraft into lethally-irradiated hosts reconstituting multiple lineages of cells and providing more effective radio-protection than mobilized cells from wild-type control mice. Surprisingly, the homing and the peripheral blood recovery of B lymphocytes was influenced by the background of the host. Thus, in the absence of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, effective mobilization is achieved but partial correction may occur as a result of an abnormal hematopoietic environment.

### Long-term outcome and lineage-specific chimerism in 194 patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome treated by hematopoietic cell transplantation in the period 1980–2009: an international collaborative study [^16ecfeef]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

In this retrospective collaborative study, we have analyzed long-term outcome and donor cell engraftment in 194 patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) who have been treated by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in the period 1980–2009. Overall survival was 84.0% and was even higher (89.1% 5-year survival) for those who received HCT since the year 2000, reflecting recent improvement of outcome after transplantation from mismatched family donors and for patients who received HCT from an unrelated donor at older than 5 years. Patients who went to transplantation in better clinical conditions had a lower rate of post-HCT complications. Retrospective analysis of lineage-specific donor cell engraftment showed that stable full donor chimerism was attained by 72.3% of the patients who survived for at least 1 year after HCT. Mixed chimerism was associated with an increased risk of incomplete reconstitution of lymphocyte count and post-HCT autoimmunity, and myeloid donor cell chimerism < 50% was associated with persistent thrombocytopenia. These observations indicate continuous improvement of outcome after HCT for WAS and may have important implications for the development of novel protocols aiming to obtain full correction of the disease and reduce post-HCT complications.

Introduction: We sought to use mechanical power to describe "lung rest" in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Mechanical power describes work done by the ventilator on the patient's respiratory system over time. This concept unifies tidal volume, rate, and total pressure delivered during the ventilatory cycle into a discrete value that may be useful to guide ventilatory support. We hypothesized that initiation of ECMO led to decreased mechanical power delivered to the patient.

Methods: We reviewed the charts of the three medical intensive care unit patients at our institution supported with ECMO for severe ARDS. We collected data on plateau pressure, driving pressure, and mechanical power before initiating ECMO, then at < 6 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after. We calculated the mechanical power delivered by the ventilator to the patient in Joules per minute as 0.098 × respiratory rate × tidal volume × (peak pressure − ½ × driving pressure)[1].

Results: All patients were alive at discharge and at 90 days. Mean PaO₂/FiO₂ at ECMO initiation was 64 ± 38, mean plateau pressure was 37 ± 3 cm water. All patients received neuromuscular blockade at initiation of ECMO. Following ECMO initiation, mechanical power decreased by an average of 58% ± 14% initially, by 69% ± 4% at 24 hours, and by 66% ± 17% at 72 hours (Fig. 1). By comparison, driving pressure changed by an average value of -0.3 ± 8.0, -0.3 ± 5.5, and -2.0 ± 4.6 cm water over those same intervals. Average plateau pressure changed by -3.3 ± 5.7, -4.7 ± 5.5, and -1.7 ± 6.4 cm water during the same time period (Fig. 2).

Conclusions: In our limited case series, mechanical power decreased significantly following initiation of ECMO in patients with severe ARDS. We suggest mechanical power may be more useful than changes in driving pressure or plateau pressure when pursuing "lung rest" during ECMO.

TABLE 1
Outcomes of included publications

The outcomes of all the included publications are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. Based on 12 studies with 345 participants, we found a mean (over the total number of included studies) of 6125 steps per day (range: 3342 to 10,124) in people at low or moderate risk of ulceration (IWGDF risk 1 and 2); the weighted mean, over the total number of participants included in these studies, was 5384 steps. Based on 8 studies with 291 participants, we found a mean (over the total number of included studies) of 6167 steps per day (range: 4548 to 8450) in people at high risk of ulceration (IWGDF risk 3); the weighted mean, over the total number of participants included in these studies, was 6239 steps. Finally, based on 6 studies with 186 participants, we found a mean (over the total number of included studies) of 4248 steps per day (range: 1219 to 8153) in people with a foot ulcer; the weighted mean, over the total number of participants included in these studies, was 4484 steps.

When comparing weight‐bearing physical activity in studies categorised based on climate, those people living in a temperate oceanic climate appeared to be more active compared to those living in hotter and more humid climates (Figure 3). This was seen in people who are at risk of foot ulceration (18 studies; means: 7712 vs. 5224 steps/day, respectively; weighted means: 7040 vs. 4742 steps/day, respectively; Figure 3). This was seen even more markedly in people with a foot ulcer (6 studies; means: 6819 vs. 2945 steps/day, respectively; weighted means: 7076 vs. 3328 steps/day, respectively; Figure 3).

### Risks of infectious diseases in newborns exposed to alternative perinatal practices [^f6f57469]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Delayed bathing — World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and observed benefits: Delayed bathing is the practice of not performing the first bath for several hours after birth. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that bathing be delayed until after 24 hours after birth, and if cultural reasons prohibit this 24-hour delay, then the delay should be a minimum of 6 hours. Outside of a general recommendation for delayed bathing, no other organizations apart from the WHO have explicit recommendations on timing, and the optimal time for delaying bathing is not clear. The most-often cited benefit of delayed bathing is increased rates of breastfeeding, which has been observed in several retrospective studies.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to late postoperative imaging, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain baseline surveillance CT at 1 month postoperatively in patients with after endovascular AAA repair. Obtain continued surveillance with duplex ultrasound at 12 months and then annually thereafter, if there is no evidence of endoleak or sac enlargement.

### Non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation in an adult with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [^8b71b3e1]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

Early bone marrow transplant is now standard treatment for infants with severe immunodeficiencies such as Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), but results in older children and adults are poor. Non-myeloablative transplant has shown promise in the treatment of older children, who are likely to have active infections and organ damage. We describe a non-myeloablative transplant of a 26-year-old man with WAS, undertaken because of severe infections and vasculitis. Partial engraftment and immunorestoration were achieved. The patient is well 1 year post transplantation.
