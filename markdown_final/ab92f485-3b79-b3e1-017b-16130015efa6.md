## Question

In which settings would you expect the DONORS checklist to meaningfully reduce donor losses, and what adherence target should you aim for?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking in which settings the DONORS checklist would be expected to meaningfully reduce donor losses to cardiac arrest, and what adherence target should be aimed for. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core evidence from the DONORS randomized trial and its adherence threshold. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale linking checklist use to hemodynamic and endocrine stabilization. Next, I will examine external observational data for consistency and dose-response signals. After that, I need to consider system-level modifiers that make implementation more or less effective. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with a clear adherence target and implementation caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal evidence. The DONORS cluster randomized trial found that the overall intention-to-treat effect on donor loss to cardiac arrest was not statistically significant, but a prespecified sensitivity analysis showed a marked reduction when adherence exceeded 79 percent, with cardiac arrest dropping from 14.8 percent in controls to 5.3 percent in the high-adherence subgroup, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.41 and a 95 percent confidence interval of 0.22 to 0.78, which is both statistically and clinically meaningful [^054d53db] [^054d53db].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response signal and whether a threshold is plausible. Post hoc analyses in DONORS explored adherence by quintiles and suggested a dose-response relationship, reinforcing that higher adherence tracks with lower arrest rates. This aligns with the concept that checklist effectiveness depends on actually completing the recommended actions rather than merely having the checklist available [^4dea841d] [^f3a75881].

> I need to check the mechanistic rationale next. The DONORS checklist operationalizes 13 goals and 14 actions spanning ventilation, hemodynamics, hormonal therapy, electrolytes, temperature, and infection prophylaxis, with explicit emphasis on vasopressin for diabetes insipidus and hemodynamic support, corticosteroids, and tight control of MAP, sodium, and glucose. These targets directly address the pathophysiology of brain death–related shock, vasoplegia, and endocrine failure that precipitate cardiac arrest in potential donors [^774284b4] [^f2fa2bf3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial. I should review corroborating data. Observational quality-improvement programs using goal-directed protocols consistently associate checklist use with fewer cardiac arrests and more organs per donor; for example, the Santa Catarina program showed cardiac arrests fell from 27.3 percent to 14.6 percent and then to 12.1 percent as adherence rose, and meeting more individual goals correlated with lower arrest odds, supporting a dose-response pattern and external validity despite nonrandomized designs [^f0f82d6e] [^53548723] [^cd6aea35].

> Let me consider system-level modifiers that could blunt or amplify benefit. High-performing systems already embed donor management goals and standardized order sets, which may attenuate the incremental effect of adding a checklist; conversely, systems with variable care, limited coordination, or low baseline adherence are more likely to realize gains. Importantly, DONORS itself noted that participation in research may improve control-group outcomes, suggesting a Hawthorne effect that could make true differences harder to detect, so real-world gains may be larger when baseline care is suboptimal [^f2fa2bf3] [^e1a0fded].

> I should double-check the adherence target and whether 79 percent is a practical benchmark. The DONORS analysis identified 79 percent as the median adherence in the intervention group and showed benefit only above that level; given that checklist items are repeated every 6 hours and include both process and physiologic targets, sustaining at least 80 percent adherence is a reasonable operational goal, acknowledging that perfect compliance is rarely achievable in complex ICU care [^4dea841d] [^774284b4].

> But wait, what if the checklist is implemented poorly or used sporadically. The DONORS authors explicitly concluded that providing the checklist alone is insufficient without measures to enhance adherence, and observational programs emphasize embedding the checklist into workflow with case managers or transplant coordinators prompting real-time corrections. Thus, effectiveness depends on leadership buy-in, training, bedside prompts, and feedback loops rather than passive dissemination [^f3a75881] [^6a82f90a] [^2fd2087b].

> Let me synthesize the settings where benefit is most likely. I would expect meaningful reductions in donor losses to cardiac arrest when the DONORS checklist is implemented in ICUs with variable donor management practices, limited protocolization, or lower baseline adherence, particularly in hospitals that manage a moderate to high volume of brain-dead donors and can sustain training and workflow integration. Conversely, centers already using robust donor management goals and achieving high adherence may see smaller incremental gains, though even small absolute reductions can translate into more transplanted organs at a population level [^054d53db] [^f0f82d6e] [^cd6aea35].

> Final answer, with caveats: The DONORS checklist is most likely to meaningfully reduce donor losses to cardiac arrest in ICUs with inconsistent or suboptimal donor management, where structured implementation and adherence support can convert potential donors to actual donors. Aim for at least 80 percent adherence to the checklist actions, recognizing that benefit appears when adherence exceeds roughly 79 percent, and ensure that implementation includes training, workflow integration, and real-time prompts to sustain high compliance [^054d53db] [^4dea841d] [^f3a75881].

The DONORS checklist reduces donor loss to cardiac arrest when **adherence exceeds 79%** [^054d53db], with a **59% relative risk reduction** in this subgroup (5.3% vs 14.8%; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22–0.78) [^1860d9f8]. Benefit is greatest in settings with **high adherence and structured support** (trained staff, standardized workflows, and real-time prompts) [^774284b4] [^6a82f90a]. No significant benefit is seen with low adherence or in uncontrolled settings, so **target ≥ 80% adherence** and embed the checklist into ICU workflows to realize meaningful reductions in donor loss [^f3a75881] [^4dea841d].

---

## Evidence from the DONORS trial

- **Design**: Cluster RCT across 63 Brazilian ICUs; 1,535 brain-dead potential donors [^054d53db].
- **Intervention**: 13-goal, 14-action checklist administered every 6 hours until organ retrieval [^774284b4].
- **Primary outcome**: Loss to cardiac arrest; 9.4% intervention vs 14.8% control (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46–1.08; P = 0.11) [^054d53db].
- **Key finding**: With adherence > 79%, donor loss fell to 5.3% vs 14.8% in controls (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22–0.78; P = 0.006) [^1860d9f8].

---

## Settings where the DONORS checklist is most effective

The checklist's impact is **adherence-dependent** and amplified by structured implementation:

| **Setting characteristic** | **Evidence of effectiveness** |
|-|-|
| High adherence (> 79%) | - 59% relative risk reduction in donor loss [^054d53db] <br/> - Dose-response relationship observed [^4dea841d] |
| Structured implementation | - Trained staff [^774284b4] <br/> - Standardized workflows [^0638488d] <br/> - Real-time prompts [^2fd2087b] <br/> - Associated with improved adherence and outcomes [^cd6aea35] |
| ICU settings with supportive infrastructure | - Dedicated transplant coordinators [^6a82b90a] <br/> - Institutional support [^c932805c] <br/> - Multidisciplinary teams [^0638488d] enhance adherence and effectiveness |

---

## Settings where the DONORS checklist is less effective

Conversely, the checklist is less effective when **adherence is low** or implementation is unstructured. Low adherence (< 79%) shows no significant reduction in donor loss, and uncontrolled settings without standardized workflows, training, or prompts have limited impact [^f3a75881] [^6a82b90a].

---

## Recommended adherence target

Based on the DONORS trial, **aim for ≥ 80% adherence** to realize meaningful reductions in donor loss; below this threshold, benefits are inconsistent or absent [^054d53db] [^4dea841d].

---

## Practical strategies to achieve high adherence

- **Training**: Standardized education for ICU and transplant staff [^774284b4].
- **Workflow integration**: Embed checklist into EMR or paper flowsheets with prompts [^e1a0fded].
- **Real-time feedback**: Use coordinators or case managers to flag nonadherence [^2fd2087b].
- **Quality assurance**: Regular audits and feedback loops to sustain performance [^c932805c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The DONORS checklist reduces donor loss to cardiac arrest when **adherence exceeds 79%** [^054d53db], with the greatest benefit in settings with structured implementation and supportive infrastructure. Programs should **target ≥ 80% adherence** through training, workflow integration, and real-time feedback to realize meaningful reductions in donor loss [^f3a75881].

### Evidence-based checklist to delay cardiac arrest in brain-dead potential organ donors: the DONORS cluster randomized clinical trial [^054d53db]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The effectiveness of goal-directed care to reduce loss of brain-dead potential donors to cardiac arrest is unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist in the clinical management of brain-dead potential donors in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Donation Network to Optimize Organ Recovery Study (DONORS) was an open-label, parallel-group cluster randomized clinical trial in Brazil. Enrollment and follow-up were conducted from June 20, 2017, to November 30, 2019. Hospital ICUs that reported 10 or more brain deaths in the previous 2 years were included. Consecutive brain-dead potential donors in the ICU aged 14 to 90 years with a condition consistent with brain death after the first clinical examination were enrolled. Participants were randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. The intention-to-treat data analysis was conducted from June 15 to August 30, 2020.

Interventions

Hospital staff in the intervention group were instructed to administer to brain-dead potential donors in the intervention group an evidence-based checklist with 13 clinical goals and 14 corresponding actions to guide care, every 6 hours, from study enrollment to organ retrieval. The control group provided or received usual care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was loss of brain-dead potential donors to cardiac arrest at the individual level. A prespecified sensitivity analysis assessed the effect of adherence to the checklist in the intervention group.

Results

Among the 1771 brain-dead potential donors screened in 63 hospitals, 1535 were included. These patients included 673 males (59.2%) and had a median (IQR) age of 51 (36.3–62.0) years. The main cause of brain injury was stroke (877 [57.1%]), followed by trauma (485 [31.6%]). Of the 63 hospitals, 31 (49.2%) were assigned to the intervention group (743 [48.4%] brain-dead potential donors) and 32 (50.8%) to the control group (792 [51.6%] brain-dead potential donors). Seventy potential donors (9.4%) at intervention hospitals and 117 (14.8%) at control hospitals met the primary outcome (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46–1.08; P = 0.11). The primary outcome rate was lower in those with adherence higher than 79.0% than in the control group (5.3% vs 14.8%; RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22–0.78; P = 0.006).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cluster randomized clinical trial was inconclusive in determining whether the overall use of an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist reduced brain-dead potential donor loss to cardiac arrest. The findings suggest that use of such a checklist has limited effectiveness without adherence to the actions recommended in this checklist.

Conclusions

This cluster randomized clinical trial was inconclusive in determining whether guiding clinical management by using an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist for donor care can reduce the loss of potential organ donors to cardiac arrest. Providing a checklist, per se, appeared to have limited effectiveness if appropriate measures were not taken to enhance the adherence to the recommended actions.

### Positive impact of a clinical goal-directed protocol on reducing cardiac arrests during potential brain-dead donor maintenance [^149d8913]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Our study has some limitations. First, the observational nature of this study only allows us to infer associations between the use of the checklist and the decrease in the loss of donors due to CA. Second, the data on therapeutic interventions performed on PBDDs to whom the checklist was not applied are not entirely reliable because these data were derived from secondary records. Third, we did not evaluate the quality of the organs donated or graft function and survival, which limited the scope of the analysis of the effects of interventions. Fourth, regional factors that may influence the total time of the PBDD maintenance process and therefore the occurrence of CA in PBDDs must be considered, such as the differences in BD diagnosis methodologies.

The overlap of medical, administrative, logistical, and legal aspects during the donation process makes the management of PBDDs extremely complex, sometimes stressful, and highly dependent on the involvement of an organized care team. The use of clinical protocols in this situation may help as a guidance and alert tool towards meeting goals. To promote adherence to clinical protocols, three fundamental aspects must be followed: to set goals based on the best available evidence; to standardize management; and to simplify the protocol to the maximum. In addition, standards of care provide opportunities for future observational studies or randomized trials that can help to provide new and better evidence on this subject.

### Evidence-based checklist to delay cardiac arrest in brain-dead potential organ donors: the DONORS cluster randomized clinical trial [^4dea841d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary outcome considered age (> 60 vs ≤ 60 years), cause of brain death (traumatic vs nontraumatic), and patient illness severity on ICU admission (> median vs ≤ median Simplified Acute Physiology Score [SAPS] 3). A set of prespecified sensitivity analyses evaluated whether checklist adherence higher than the median adherence in the intervention group was associated with the primary outcome. Adherence to each action was considered complete if the recommended course of action was performed or if no action was needed according to the checklist. For each brain-dead potential donor, we identified the proportion of all checklist recommendations with adherence (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2) and the median checklist adherence across donors in the intervention group. Next, we reproduced the generalized estimating equation model to stratify data from the intervention group according to whether their checklist adherence was greater than vs less than or equal to the prespecified median adherence. Post hoc analyses explored the relationship between checklist adherence and the rate of brain-dead potential donor loss to cardiac arrest. We extended the sensitivity analysis of checklist adherence among donors to quintiles of adherence, assessing for a dose-response relationship. Reasoning that adherence may have more to do with sites than patients, we assessed for a modifying effect of high vs low levels of adherence at the hospital level.

Prespecified exploratory analyses were conducted at the individual level. To each exploratory outcome (eMethods 2 in Supplement 2), we considered data collected from all the time points along the clinical management. Post hoc analyses besides the sensitivity analyses and the reasons for conducting them are described in eTable 3 in Supplement 2.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted for the primary outcome of the study according to occurrence of potential failures in the screening and inclusion of consecutive patients, estimated number of brain death notifications in the ICU, and donation rate for each site before the study.

P < .05 indicated statistical significance. We did not impute outcome data except in the context of the sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome. We conducted all analyses from June 15 to August 30, 2020, using the survival and geepack packages in R, version 3.5.2 (R Development Core Team).

Discussion

In DONORS, use of an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist did not result in significant reduction in brain-dead potential donor losses to cardiac arrest. Goal-directed checklists can serve as tools to promote adherence to the existing evidence-based clinical interventions, which could translate into better quality of care and improved outcomes. The checklist seemed to have contributed to greater adherence to essential goals: adequate circulatory parameters and serum sodium level less than 155 mEq/L. These findings could be explained by higher adherence to vasopressin use in the intervention group, an important factor in both hemodynamic and diabetes insipidus control. However, we were unable to demonstrate the effect of the checklist on brain-dead potential donor loss to cardiac arrest.

There might be alternative explanations for the lack of a statistically significant effect of the checklist on brain-dead potential donor loss to cardiac arrests. First, although DONORS, to our knowledge, was the largest randomized clinical trial of donor management ever conducted, it may have been underpowered to detect a clinically relevant effect size. The point estimate decrease in brain-dead potential donor loss to cardiac arrest was 5.2% (relative risk difference, 36.5%). In previous sample size calculations, a 10% decrease in cardiac arrests among brain-dead potential donors was estimated based on the pilot study. However, the cardiac arrest rate in the present study (14.8%) was lower than the rate in the pilot study (27.1%). It is possible that an overall improvement in the management of brain-dead potential donors over time, regardless of the study context, leads to lower baseline rates of cardiac arrests. Furthermore, the quality of the hospitals apparently did not influence the main outcome (eTables 14 and 15 in Supplement 2); thus, as previously reported, we cannot disregard that the mere participation in research activity may improve the control group outcomes.

### Evidence-based checklist to delay cardiac arrest in brain-dead potential organ donors: the DONORS cluster randomized clinical trial [^1860d9f8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The study DONORS was published by Glauco A Westphal and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Brain death, Liver transplantation, Kidney transplantation, Cardiac transplantation and Lung transplantation. In the DONORS study, the trial question was: what is the effect of evidence-based, goal-directed checklist in brain-dead potential donors in the ICU? In the DONORS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DONORS study, the population was: 1535 patients (626 female, 909 male). The inclusion criteria were brain-dead potential donors in the ICU. The key exclusion criteria were patients unsuitable for organ donation according to the criteria of Brazil's National Transplant System; hospitals with any clinical decision-making tools already in place. In the DONORS study, the interventions were: n = 743 goal-directed evidence-based checklist (bedside use of a goal-directed evidence-based checklist to guide the management of potential brain-dead donors) n = 792 usual care (routine care without providing information about the checklist). In the DONORS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in potential organ donors lost due to cardiac arrest (9.4% vs. 14.8%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.08). In the DONORS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in actual organ donors (44% vs. 41.2%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.26) No significant difference in organs recovered per actual organ donor (2.8 units vs. 2.8 units; MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.25) Significant decrease in potential organ donors lost due to cardiac arrest in those with adherence > 79.0% (5.3% vs. 14.8%; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.78). In the DONORS study, the conclusion was: in brain-dead potential donors in the ICU, goal-directed evidence-based checklist was not superior to usual care with respect to potential organ donors lost due to cardiac arrest.

Key messages

The management of PBDDs is extremely complex and depends on the involvement of a highly organized care team.
The systematic application of a checklist for the clinical management of PBDDs is useful to increase physicians' awareness and the quality of care.
The use of clinical protocols during PBDD management may help the care team as a guidance and alert tool towards meeting goals.
Meeting clinical goals during clinical management of PBDDs leads to a progressive reduction in CAs, contributing to an increase in actual donors.
Governmental and/or associative initiatives promoting coordinated actions of the donation and transplant process may amplify the effects and strongly contribute to reducing the imbalance between the supply and demand of transplant organs.

### Positive impact of a clinical goal-directed protocol on reducing cardiac arrests during potential brain-dead donor maintenance [^6f69b02b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The most realistic option to mitigate the imbalance between the high demand for organ transplantations and the low number of transplantations performed is to maximize the use of organs from brain death (BD) donors. This maximization depends on reducing the underreporting of BD, family refusals, incorrect contraindications, and potential brain-dead donor (PBDD) loss after cardiac arrest (CA).

Many donors are lost because they are not properly managed during the first 24 hours. This shortfall highlights the importance of the proactive contribution of intensive care professionals to mitigate the imbalance between supply and demand of organs for transplantation.

In 2011, a joint action of the Brazilian Association of Critical Care Medicine and the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplantation resulted in the preparation of the Brazilian Guidelines for Potential Multiple Organ Donors. The initiative aimed to provide parameters of standard care for PBDDs and to reduce loss of donors because of management failures. Guidelines usually fail to achieve rapid impacts on bedside manner changes and rarely consider their practical applicability, and the large-scale transformation of the best scientific evidence into clinical practice is a challenge that may take years. The establishment of protocols may help reduce this time, and the management of the process guided by checklists may play a key role in enabling "real-time route corrections". The Surviving Sepsis Campaign experience is a practical example of the large-scale adoption of a multifaceted model driven by treatment goals. Its positive effects on outcomes result from organizational adjustments which could be adapted to the context of potential organ donor management without requiring additional resources.

Compliance with the checklist and its components

Table 3 shows that use of the checklist was associated with lower odds of occurrence of CA (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18; 0.49, p < 0.001). The frequency of CAs decreased as the number of checklist items complied with increased, and the odds of those losses were substantially lower upon compliance with four or more checklist intervention items (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.11; 0.34, p < 0.001). Full compliance with the nine checklist interventions was not observed; the maximum performance levels met seven items in only nine patients.

OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval

Of 465 PBDDs, 83 were not managed with the checklist. Potential donors managed without the checklist were more frequent in the first quarter (n = 31, 37.5%) and were then evenly distributed throughout the study period (10.2 ± 2.5 per quarter). Both groups (with and without checklist) were similar to each other regarding clinical and demographic characteristics and the following treatment goals: donor maintenance, duration ranging from 12 to 24 hours, temperature > 35 °C upon protocol completion, diuresis ranging from 1 to 4 ml/kg/h, serum sodium < 150 mEq/L, blood glucose < 180 mg/dl, and the number of organs donated/donor (with checklist: 2.0 ± 0.5 organs vs without checklist: 2.1 ± 0.3 organs, p < 0.83). In contrast, the use of corticosteroids (p < 0.001), vasopressin (p < 0.001), adequate ventilation (p < 0.001), and MAP levels upon management completion (73 ± 44 mmHg vs 63 ± 44 mmHg, p < 0.05) were higher when the management checklist was applied.

The odds of CA have been higher among PBDDs > 60 years old and those with more organ dysfunction at baseline. However, these variables did not stand out as CA predictors in the multivariate analysis. Considering the nearly absolute vasopressin deficiency that occurs in the first minutes after BD, early replacement of this hormone has been formally recommended for the 80% of PBDDs needing vasopressors. Vasopressin replacement is independently associated with an increased rate of organ recovery and a less overall graft rejection due to poor function. The good pressure control related to vasopressin administration corroborates the association of vasopressin use and obtaining MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with the decrease in CAs observed in our results. However, meeting isolated goals such as MAP ≥ 65 mmHg may not suffice to prevent CA among PBDDs. This point is reinforced by the observation that the decrease in the number of CAs was more consistent when a greater number of interventions were used in combination (Table 3), reflecting the quality of care provided.

Despite the good compliance with the checklist already observed in the first months, donor loss due to CA decreased slowly over time (Fig. 2). The prioritization of hospitals with a history of a high number of organ donors, the slower recruitment of lower-performance hospitals, and the learning curve of care teams may explain this delay. Additionally, even with an active education program, the incorporation of new evidence and guideline recommendations may take years and usually fail to achieve rapid impacts at the bedside.

It could be seen as negative that a checklist is needed to do what should be done, but it is known that health care centralized on the physician may result in noncompliance with guideline recommendations, especially in highly complex processes such as the management of donors. In contrast, there are many demonstrations that the systematic use of multidisciplinary checklists as alert devices for the physician improves the process of care, decreasing catheter-related bloodstream infections, surgical-related morbidity and mortality, and clinical outcomes in the ICU. It is also known that the mere existence of a checklist does not ensure its effective application, highlighting the importance of managing the bedside protocol, wherein a case manager advises the care team. In the context of PBDD management, inhospital transplantation coordinators should be encouraged to play the leading role of case managers, alerting the care team based on a goal checklist.

Study Interventions

For patients in the intervention group, a goal-directed checklist to guide brain-dead potential donor care (Figure 2) was administered bedside. The DONORS investigators convened a task force to develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of brain-dead potential donors, using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) methodin accordance with standards of the Guidelines International Network and the US Institute of Medicine(eMethods 1 in Supplement 2). The recommendations from the guideline served as the basis for the evidence-based checklist tested in this trial.

Figure 2.
Bedside Goal-Directed Checklist to Guide the Care of Brain-Dead Potential Donors

ΔPp indicates pulse pressure respiratory variation; ΔSV, stroke volume respiratory variation; CVP, central venous pressure; FiO 2, fraction of inspired oxygen; H 2 O, water; Hb, hemoglobin; IV, intravenous; K +, potassium; MAP, mean arterial pressure; Mg ++, magnesium; Na +, sodium; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure; Sa 2, arterial oxygen saturation; and Vt, tidal volume.

The checklist was designed to maximize the conversion of potential to actual organ donors by preventing the loss of brain-dead potential donors to cardiac arrest and to increase organ viability. It consists of 13 goals and 14 actions, including mechanical ventilation, vasoactive support, hormonal supplementation, electrolyte control, body temperature control, and administration of antibiotics and blood products (Figure 2).

Expert clinicians visited all sites randomized to the intervention group to provide standardized 4-hour training sessions to the ICU and in-hospital donation and transplant coordination staff. The content of these sessions included world and national scenarios of organ donation, recommendations from the evidence-based clinical practice guideline, and the composition and administration of the paper-based bedside checklist.

Based on studies that analyzed the effect of meeting physiological goals on referral after 6 hoursand after 12 to 18 hours of the donor referral, as well as before procurement, the checklist was administered every 6 hours, while the patient was considered a brain-dead potential donor. Given the nature of the intervention, both investigators and health care staff were aware of the study group assignment.

Variables analyzed

The following variables were analyzed:
Hospital characteristics: number of inpatient beds, number of ICU beds, status as a teaching hospital, status as a trauma care referral center, existence of a transplant center, existence of a transplant coordination unit connected to the ICU, and type of hospital administration (public or private).
Characteristics of potential donors: gender, age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, organ dysfunctions and number of organ dysfunctions at the start of BD investigation (neurological dysfunction was not considered), cause of BD, presence of infection, and clinical management site defined as inside the ICU or outside the ICU (emergency room or postanesthesia recovery unit).
Variables related to the checklist: compliance with the checklist was considered to indicate bedside use, regardless of the number of interventions met; compliance with each target was considered when the goal was effectively reached.
Outcome variables: the primary outcome variable was the occurrence of CA, and the following variables related to the donation process were also evaluated: actual donations, mean number of organs retrieved per donor (ORPD), and donor loss because of family refusal or medical contraindication. The outcome variables were evaluated at 4-month intervals during the 2 years of observation and were compared with the results recorded in the previous 2 years, which served as the baseline for the indicators. The outcomes from the two 4-month periods following the observation period were also analyzed to evaluate performance consistency. Finally, to assess the impact of this improvement program in the real world, we assessed data from the annual reports of the Transplant Center of Santa Catarina between 2011 (year before the program) and 2014 (year of program completion).

### Positive impact of a clinical goal-directed protocol on reducing cardiac arrests during potential brain-dead donor maintenance [^cfcec67f]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Meeting care goals in PBDD management designed to restore the respiratory, cardiovascular, and endocrine-metabolic physiology during the period preceding organ harvesting is associated with an increased number of organs transplanted per donor and reduced loss of donors by CA.

In a pilot study we reported the association between the managed BD protocol guided by a goal checklist and the decrease in CAs among PBDDs. Recognizing both the challenge and the importance of reproducing those results on a large scale, we conducted a multicenter program to improve the standard of care for PBDDs. The BD protocols were guided by an adaptation of the classical "VIP" approach, a mnemonic method proposed by Max Weil and Herbert Shubin to systematize and simplify a sequence of fundamental principles for the management of shock as "Ventilation, Infusion, and Pumping". The post scriptum "PS" has been added to refer to "Pharmacological support and some Specificities", composing the acronym VIPPS.

Our purpose is to describe a quality improvement project that includes the implementation of a checklist based on the VIP approach for the management of potential multiple organ donors and to analyze its impact on the occurrence of CA.

Compliance with the checklist and its association with CAs and ORPD over time

Increased compliance with the checklist occurred between the first and second 4-month periods (52.1% vs 85.8%, p < 0.001), with rates around 80% maintained until the end of the study (Fig. 2a).

Family refusals and contraindications remained constant throughout the intervention period (Fig. 2b). The comparison between the two study years and the performance of the state transplant system in the two previous years (CA: 27.3%) showed downward trends in CAs in the second (20.6%, p = 0.08) and third (19%, p = 0.09) 4-month periods. After 24 months, CAs decreased to 14.6% (p = 0.002), reaching 12.1% in the following two 4-month periods (p < 0.001). Simultaneously, increases in actual donations were observed (Fig. 2c). At the baseline, the mean number of ORPD was 2.54 ± 1.08, which increased to 2.78 ± 1.03 ORPD (p = 0.11) after 24 months and to 2.90 ± 0.93 ORPD (p < 0.004) in the following two 4-month periods.

### The impact of meeting donor management goals on the number of organs transplanted per expanded criteria donor: a prospective study from the UNOS region 5 donor management goals workgroup [^ec3dd4e7]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The shortage of organs available for transplant has led to the use of expanded criteria donors (ECDs) to extend the donor pool. These donors are older and have more comorbidities and efforts to optimize the quality of their organs are needed.

Objective

To determine the impact of meeting a standardized set of critical care end points, or donor management goals (DMGs), on the number of organs transplanted per donor in ECDs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective interventional study from February 2010 to July 2013 of all ECDs managed by the 8 organ procurement organizations in the southwestern United States (United Network for Organ Sharing Region 5).

Interventions

Implementation of 9 DMGs as a checklist to guide the management of every ECD. The DMGs represented normal cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and endocrine end points. Meeting the DMG bundle was defined a priori as achieving any 7 of the 9 end points and was recorded at the time of referral to the organ procurement organization, at the time of authorization for donation, 12 to 18 hours later, and prior to organ recovery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was 3 or more organs transplanted per donor and binary logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors with P < .05.

Results

There were 671 ECDs with a mean (SD) number of 2.1 (1.3) organs transplanted per donor. Ten percent of the ECDs had met the DMG bundle at referral, 15% at the time of authorization, 33% at 12 to 18 hours, and 45% prior to recovery. Forty-three percent had 3 or more organs transplanted per donor. Independent predictors of 3 or more organs transplanted per donor were older age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95 per year [95% CI, 0.93–0.97]), increased creatinine level (OR = 0.73 per mg/dL [95% CI, 0.63–0.85]), DMGs met prior to organ recovery (OR = 1.90 [95% CI, 1.35–2.68]), and a change in the number of DMGs achieved from referral to organ recovery (OR = 1.11 per additional DMG [95% CI, 1.00–1.23]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Meeting DMGs prior to organ recovery with ECDs is associated with achieving 3 or more organs transplanted per donor. An increase in the number of critical care end points achieved throughout the care of a potential donor by both donor hospital and organ procurement organization is also associated with an increase in organ yield.

### Positive impact of a clinical goal-directed protocol on reducing cardiac arrests during potential brain-dead donor maintenance [^55cd25f9]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using the VIP approach checklist reduced the odds of CA in PBDDs prior to organ harvesting 2.3-fold, increasing actual multiple organ donations over time. The number of CAs was inversely proportional to the number of treatment goals met. Hence, the VIP approach seems to be useful to increase awareness of physicians to guarantee a "standard of care" during the management of PBDDs. To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter report providing evidence of benefits from a management protocol of potential organ donors guided by a goal checklist in a developing country.

This program for improvement of BD donor management had the characteristics of a task force for dissemination and application of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines of PBDD management endorsed by the national associations of critical care and transplantation. The main recommendations from the Guidelines were organized into a goal checklist used to guide case management. Our local experience with a management protocol enabled establishing a strong association between attaining a set of goals organized into bundles and decreasing CAs among PBDDs. The prospect of broadening the results from that pilot study prompted this regionwide program to improve the management of PBDDs. Inspired by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, this donor management optimization initiative consisted of an institutional process of performance improvement which, according to its own characteristics, does not meet all scientific rigor required to assess the impact of the best evidence on clinical outcomes.

From our perspective, the VIP approach checklist is an alternative to the existing donor optimization care bundles, proposing an adaptation of a classic strategy for the management of the circulatory shock. The VIP approach provides a simple sequence of procedures intrinsically directed to the restoration of DO 2 and shock control, which is present in 80% of PBDDs and is the leading cause of CA in these individuals.

Despite the positive impact of our checklist on CA, a rate of 12.1% of CAs may sound high for some. In this context, it is important to consider that the incidence of CA reported in our results accounts for all events that occurred after starting the first BD diagnostic test, which will result in a necessarily larger number of CAs than those presented in countries which take into account only the CAs that occurred in consented PBDDs.

### Management of donation after brain death (DBD) in the ICU: the potential donor is identified, what's next? [^0638488d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The success of any donation process requires that potential brain-dead donors (PBDD) are detected and referred early to professionals responsible for their evaluation and conversion to actual donors. The intensivist plays a crucial role in organ donation. However, identification and referral of PBDDs may be suboptimal in the critical care environment. Factors influencing lower rates of detection and referral include the lack of specific training and the need to provide concomitant urgent care to other critically ill patients. Excellent communication between the ICU staff and the procurement organization is necessary to ensure the optimization of both the number and quality of organs transplanted. The organ donation process has been improved over the last two decades with the involvement and commitment of many healthcare professionals. Clinical protocols have been developed and implemented to better organize the multidisciplinary approach to organ donation. In this manuscript, we aim to highlight the main steps of organ donation, taking into account the following: early identification and evaluation of the PBDD with the use of checklists; donor management, including clinical maintenance of the PBDD with high-quality intensive care to prevent graft failure in recipients and strategies for optimizing donated organs by simplified care standards, clinical guidelines and alert tools; the key role of the intensivist in the donation process with the interaction between ICU professionals and transplant coordinators, nurse protocol managers, and communication skills training; and a final remark on the importance of the development of research with further insight into brain death pathophysiology and reversible organ damage.

### Victory out of tragedy: organ donation [^a2daf5f7]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of protocols in organ donation

Because of the complexities involved in the caring for the critically ill patient and the numerous considerations for optimizing donation, it is useful to have written guidelines to direct the steps taken during the organ donation process. Most organ donors donate after neurological determination of death and may have been earlier managed with the goal of optimizing brain tissue outcome. Many intensive care units have catastrophic brain injury guidelines, which are useful in guiding patients with neurological injuries to recovery.

For the potential donor with severe irreversible neurological injuries, however, care shifts from maximizing neurological recovery to the maintenance of the remaining organ systems. Often, there are conflicts about which organ systems to prioritize as attempts to optimize one system may be deleterious to another. Unless the intensivist knows a priori that a particular organ will not be suitable for transplantation, one is faced with a delicate balancing act between the competing needs of several different organ systems. Therefore, the use of a checklist of standardized critical care endpoints, or Donor Management Goals, or donor management protocols, will be beneficial in guiding care providers to optimize the number of organs suitable for transplant from donors.

### Positive impact of a clinical goal-directed protocol on reducing cardiac arrests during potential brain-dead donor maintenance [^f0f82d6e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The disproportion between the large organ demand and the low number of transplantations performed represents a serious public health problem worldwide. Reducing the loss of transplantable organs from deceased potential donors as a function of cardiac arrest (CA) may contribute to an increase in organ donations. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that a goal-directed protocol to guide the management of deceased donors may reduce the losses of potential brain-dead donors (PBDDs) due to CA.

Methods

The quality improvement project included 27 hospitals that reported deceased donors prospectively to the Transplant Center of the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. All deceased donors reported prospectively between May 2012 and April 2014 were analyzed. Hospitals were encouraged to use the VIP approach checklist during the management of PBDDs. The checklist was composed of the following goals: protocol duration 12–24 hours, temperature > 35 °C, mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, diuresis 1–4 ml/kg/h, corticosteroids, vasopressin, tidal volume 6–8 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure 8–10 cmH 2 O, sodium < 150 mEq/L, and glycemia < 180 mg/dl. A logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of CA.

Results

There were 726 PBDD notifications, of which 324 (44.6) were actual donors, 141 (19.4%) CAs, 226 (31.1%) family refusals, and 35 (4.8%) contraindications. Factors associated with CA reduction included use of the checklist (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, p < 0.001), maintenance performed inside the ICU (OR 0.49, p = 0.013), and vasopressin administration (OR 0.56, p = 0.04). More than three interventions had association with less CAs (OR 0.19, p < 0.001). After 24 months, CAs decreased from 27.3% to 14.6% (p = 0.002), reaching 12.1% in the following two 4-month periods (p < 0.001). Simultaneous increases in organ recovered per donor and in actual donors were observed.

Conclusions

A quality improvement program based on education and the use of a goal checklist for the management of potential donors inside the ICU is strongly associated with a decrease in donor losses and an increase in organs recovered per donor.

### Interventions for increasing solid organ donor registration [^5ef16332]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A solution for increasing the number of available organs for transplantation is to encourage more individuals to register a commitment for deceased organ donation. However, the percentage of the population registered for organ donation remains low in many countries.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of various interventions used to increase deceased organ donor registration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 11 August 2020 through contact with an Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs and quasi-RCTs of interventions to promote deceased organ donor registration. We included studies if they measured self-reported or verified donor registration, intention to donate, intention to register a decision or number of individuals signing donor cards as outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies and extracted data from included studies. We assessed studies for risk of bias. We obtained summary estimates of effect using a random-effects model and expressed results as risk ratios (RR) (95% confidence intervals; CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD; 95% CI) or standardised mean difference (SMD; 95% CI) for continuous outcomes. In multi-arm trials, data were pooled to create single pair-wise comparisons. Analyses were stratified by specific intervention setting where available.

Main Results

Our search strategy identified 46 studies (47 primary articles, including one abstract) comprising 24 parallel RCTs, 19 cluster RCTs and 3 quasi-RCTs. Sample sizes ranged from 138 to 1,085,292 (median = 514). A total of 16 studies measured registration behaviour, 27 measured intention to register/donate and three studies measured both registration behaviour and intention to register. Interventions were delivered in a variety of different settings: schools (14 studies), driver's motor vehicle (DMV) centres (5), mail-outs (4), primary care centres (3), workplaces (1), community settings (7) and general public (12). Interventions were highly varied in terms of their content and included strategies such as educational sessions and videos, leveraging peer leaders, staff training, message framing, and priming. Most studies were rated as having high or unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment and low risk for the remainder of the domains. Data from 34/46 studies (74%) were available for meta-analysis. Low certainty evidence showed organ donation registration interventions had a small overall effect on improving registration behaviour (16 studies, 1,294,065 participants: RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.43, I2 = 84%), intention to register/donate (dichotomous) (10 studies, 10,838 participants: RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.42, I2 = 91%) and intention to register/donate (continuous) (9 studies, 3572 participants: SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.36, I2 = 67%). Classroom-based interventions delivered in a lecture format by individuals from the transplant community may be effective at increasing intention to register/donate (3 studies, 675 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55, I² = 0%). Community interventions targeting specific ethnic groups were generally effective at increasing registration rates (k = 5, n = 4186; RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.40, I² = 85%), although heterogeneity was high. In particular, interventions delivered in the community by trained peer-leaders appear to be effective (3 studies, 3819 participant: RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.06, I² = 87%), although again, the data lacked robustness. There was some evidence that framing messages (e.g. anticipated regret) and priming individuals (e.g. reciprocity) in a certain way may increase intention to register/donate, however, few studies measured this effect on actual registration. Overall, the studies varied significantly in terms of design, setting, content and delivery. Selection bias was evident and a quarter of the studies could not be included in the meta-analysis due to incomplete outcome data reporting. No adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

In our review, we identified a variety of approaches used to increase organ donor registration including school-based educational sessions and videos, leveraging peer leaders in the community, DMV staff training, targeted messaging and priming. The variability in outcome measures used and incompleteness in reporting meant that most data could not be combined for analysis. When data were combined, overall effect sizes were small in favour of intervention groups over controls, however, there was significant variability in the data. There was some evidence that leveraging peer-leaders in the community to deliver organ donation education may improve registration rates and classroom-based education from credible individuals (i.e. members of the transplant community) may improve intention to register/donate, however, there is no clear evidence favouring any particular approach. There was mixed evidence for simple, low-intensity interventions utilising message framing and priming. However, it is likely that interest in these strategies will persist due to their reach and scalability. Further research is therefore required to adequately address the question of the most effective interventions for increasing deceased organ donor registration.

### Application of the 2017 KDIGO guideline for the evaluation and care of living kidney donors to clinical practice [^88cc16eb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2017 "Clinical Practice Guideline on the Evaluation and Care of Living Kidney Donors" was developed to assist medical professionals who evaluate living kidney donor candidates and provide care before, during, and after donation. This guideline Work Group concluded that a comprehensive approach to donor candidate risk assessment should replace eligibility decisions on the basis of assessments of single risk factors in isolation. To address all issues important to living donors in a pragmatic and comprehensive guideline, many of the guideline recommendations were on the basis of expert consensus opinion even when no direct evidence was available. To advance available evidence, original data analyses were also undertaken to produce a "proof-of-concept" risk projection model for kidney failure. This was done to illustrate how the community can advance a new quantitative framework of risk that considers each candidate's profile of demographic and health characteristics. A public review by stakeholders and subject matter experts as well as industry and professional organizations informed the final formulation of the guideline. This review highlights the guideline framework, key concepts, and recommendations, and uses five patient scenarios and 12 guideline statements to illustrate how the guideline can be applied to support living donor evaluation and care in clinical practice.

### Donor and transplant candidate selection for solid organ transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic [^3cbd07a5]. American Journal of Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus responsible for a worldwide pandemic has forced drastic changes in medical practice in an alarmingly short period of time. Caregivers must modify their strategies as well as optimize the utilization of resources to ensure public and patient safety. For organ transplantation, in particular, the loss of lifesaving organs for transplantation could lead to increased waitlist mortality. The priority is to select uninfected donors to transplant uninfected recipients while maintaining safety for health care systems in the backdrop of a virulent pandemic. We do not yet have a standard approach to evaluating donors and recipients with possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our current communication shares a protocol for donor and transplant recipient selection during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to continue lifesaving solid organ transplantation for heart, lung, liver, and kidney recipients. The initial results using this protocol are presented here and meant to encourage dialogue between providers, offering ideas to improve safety in solid organ transplantation with limited health care resources. This protocol was created utilizing the guidelines of various organizations and from the clinical experience of the authors and will continue to evolve as more is understood about SARS-CoV-2 and how it affects organ donors and transplant recipients.

KDIGO grading of recommendations and implications — Level 1 ("We recommend") versus Level 2 ("We suggest") — are defined with explicit stakeholder guidance: For Level 1, patients are told that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and policy makers that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". For Level 2, patients are told that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and policy makers that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined".

Practice points — ungraded, consensus guidance — are defined and their uses described: "In addition to graded recommendations, KDIGO guidelines now include 'practice points' to help clinicians better evaluate and implement the guidance from the expert Work Group". "Practice points are consensus statements about a specific aspect of care, and they supplement recommendations for which a larger quantity of evidence was identified". "They are issued when a clinical question was not supported by a systematic review, often to help readers implement the guidance from graded recommendation". These statements "represent the expert judgment of the guideline Work Group, but they also may be based on limited evidence", may cover topics "on monitoring, frequency of testing, dosing adjustments for the severity of CKD, and use of therapies in specific subgroup populations", and "were sometimes formatted as a table, a figure, or an algorithm to make them easier to use in clinical practice".

Follow-up timing and processes — As part of the informed consent process for donation, transplant centers should educate donor candidates on the importance of follow-up, disclose donor responsibilities and potential costs of follow-up participation, and develop a personalized follow-up plan. Because donors in many countries report regular follow-up with a primary provider, donor follow-up and care may be appropriately performed by a primary care provider to preserve convenience for the donor, but communication of follow-up information back to the transplant center is necessary, the role of a primary care provider in a donor's follow-up plan should be established before donation, and the transplant center should always be available as a resource for the donor's primary care provider. Documentation of a donor's acknowledgement of their responsibility to participate in follow-up through a signed care plan has been proposed as part of education, although efficacy in achieving follow-up participation has not been formally evaluated. The establishment of standardized follow-up at serial time points provides a pattern for follow-up care that the donor may be more likely to continue on regular, yearly preventive healthcare visits, and regular contact between the transplant center and the donor and/or the donor's primary care physician also increases familiarity of staff with issues that develop after donation. In the United States, early follow-up reporting by centers to the national transplant registry is limited to 2 years postdonation and has historically suffered from missing data and frequent loss-to-follow-up; follow-up deficiencies have correlated with younger donor age, black race, lack of insurance, lower educational attainment, and greater distance to the transplant center. Among US centers in 2008 to 2012, large annual living donation volumes were associated with increased rates of follow-up deficiencies; however, implementation of mandatory thresholds for collection of postdonation clinical and laboratory data in the United States in 2013 with regulatory implications has led to improved rates of early follow-up data collection and high levels of follow-up across the volume spectrum. There is a real need for comprehensive, long-term (lifetime) follow-up of living donors, and short-term follow-up cannot detect gradual, progressive complications that occur later after donation.

### Positive impact of a clinical goal-directed protocol on reducing cardiac arrests during potential brain-dead donor maintenance [^941c9a5b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The following treatment goals were associated with reduced risk of CA among the 382 PBDDs to whom the checklist was applied: temperature ≥ 35 °C (p = 0.001), MAP ≥ 65 mmHg (p < 0.001), corticosteroid administration (p = 0.006), vasopressin administration to PBDDs using vasoconstrictors (p = 0.042), and protocol duration ranging from 12 to 24 hours (p = 0.07) (Table 4).

Table 4
Risk of occurrence of cardiac arrest among patients to whom the donor management checklist was applied according to the meeting of treatment goals

Multivariate analysis and the occurrence of CA

A global model of multivariate analysis was designed based on the hospital and potential donor characteristics and the clinical management goals that were associated with the occurrence of CAs (Table 5). The variables associated with decreased CAs were a hospital with more than 250 beds, performing organ transplants, management of PBDDs performed in the ICU, and use of the management checklist. Public hospitals, accounting for 81.5% of the hospitals in the system, were associated with higher odds of occurrence of CAs.

Based on the findings presented in Table 4 we performed a multivariate analysis model restricted to the 382 PBDDs to whom the checklist was applied to assess the individual effects of checklist components on CAs (Table 5). The variables best associated with decreased CAs were the administration of vasopressin for donors using vasoconstrictors and MAP ≥ 65 mmHg upon protocol completion.

### Interventions aimed at healthcare professionals to increase the number of organ donors: a systematic review [^8564b201]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this systematic review describes interventions that lead to higher numbers of organ donors. The main finding is that collaborative care pathways, in which donor identification criteria are identified, training of healthcare professionals (also in the ED) and additional focus on support of relatives of potential donors, could be promising interventions to increase the number of organ donors. The paucity of data in peer-reviewed journals asks for a call to action to publish the results of initiatives to improve organ donation.

### Increased transplanted organs from the use of a standardized donor management protocol [^22e37b8f]. American Journal of Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

The organ shortage has resulted in increasing recipient waiting lists and waiting-list deaths. The increased use of expanded donors has been associated with increased discarding of procured organs because of poor organ function. A structured donor management algorithm or critical pathway was tested to determine its effect on the donor management and procurement process. A pilot study examined donors from 88 critical care units in 10 organ procurement organizations managed under the critical pathway and compared them to retrospective data collected at those same pilot sites. The total number of organs both procured and transplanted per 100 donors was significantly greater (p < 0.01) in the critical pathway group when compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in 1-year graft survival for any of the organs recovered, and no significant difference in the rate of delayed graft function in the kidneys transplanted. Use of a structured donor management algorithm results in significant increases in organs procured and organs transplanted without any reduction in the quality of the organs being transplanted.

### Challenges to research and innovation to optimize deceased donor organ quality and quantity [^da436dfa]. American Journal of Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Solid organ transplantation is encumbered by an increasing number of waitlisted patients unrequited by the current organ supply. Preclinical models suggest that advances in deceased donor management and treatment can increase the quantity and quality of organs available for transplantation. However, the science of donor intervention and the execution of high quality, prospective, multi-center, randomized-controlled trials are restricted by a myriad of logistical challenges mired in regulatory and ethical ambiguity. By highlighting the obstacles to conducting research in deceased donors, this report endeavors to stimulate the creation of a multi-disciplinary framework to facilitate the design, implementation and supervision of innovative trials that increase the quantity and/or quality of deceased donor organs.

pDCD Implementation and Oversight

Good Practice Statements.

50) pDCD programs should seek out formal institutional approval within the existing hospital reporting structure.
51) There should be an integrated, collaborative approach to pDCD implementation with all hospital stakeholders, family and/or public partners, regional ODOs, and transplant programs.
52) Local coroners should be contacted early in the process of developing local pDCD procedures.
53) Communication and education of staff should be considered a priority during the development and implementation of a pDCD protocol.
54) pDCD case management review, including regular debriefing and a periodic quality assurance process, should occur.
55) Support for healthcare professionals involved in pDCD should be provided.

Justification.

The establishment of a pDCD program should involve multidisciplinary collaboration with oversight from appropriate local authorities. The need for communication and education of all involved stakeholders has also been broadly emphasized in recent publications and was a frequently expressed sentiment during our pDCD symposium. Quality control for this low-frequency, high-impact event is critical for pDCD programs. This process should involve medical and ethical oversight, ideally with linkage to measures of donor family experiences and transplant outcomes. Establishing robust ethical oversight also decreases the potential impact of institutional bias toward organ donation. Organ donation and transplantation activity are often a high-profile endeavor within a healthcare system, and the positive exposure associated with these programs may lead to a perception that donation activity takes precedence over ethical safeguards. The recognition and mitigation of this source of potential conflict interest is an important aspect of maintaining professional and public trust in the donation system.

Although we do not provide specific recommendation for documentation, inherent in the quality assurance component of recommendation 54 is the assumption that the process of pDCD be well documented. We encourage teams developing pDCD practices to visit the Canadian Blood Services website link listed below to see sample clinical and administrative checklists as well as documentation tools.

### Textbook outcome as a quality metric in living and deceased donor kidney transplantation [^78e2c4d7]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

A final limitation of our study is that our formulation of TO measures outcome quality for transplants a center chooses to perform but does not take into consideration donor allografts or potential recipients turned away. TO is adjusted for donor and recipient risk and therefore should not encourage risk aversion, but the psychology and behavioral patterns of risk and loss aversion in transplantation are well described. At present, newly implemented patterns of broader sharing in national kidney allocation policy are "leveling the playing field" between centers and "averaging out" differences in organ procurement organization performance. Enormous gains are predicted to result from more aggressive kidney donor use. Policy should be crafted to encourage and reward maximal donor use, and TO should not factor into calculations of risk tolerance.

Quality measurement can serve to protect patient safety, encourage efficient use of healthcare resources, promote equity in access to care, and lead to discovery and sharing of best practices. No single quality measure accomplishes all of these objectives. TO is ideally suited to transplantation programs wishing to compare their performance with that of peer institutions and improve performance in specific domains. Programs that successfully increase TO rates will see improved long-term patient survival. We are actively working to correlate TO with patient satisfaction, and we do believe that TO should be a patient-facing metric, helping patients to understand their transplantation experience. TO has little use in the regulatory aspects of kidney transplantation because most patients who fail to experience TO still achieve the enormous health benefits of freedom from dialysis. It is important to note that large and small transplantation centers can achieve high observed:expected TO ratios. Given the enormous geographic disparities in access to kidney care throughout the US, it is important to develop policies that support small and large transplantation programs delivering high-quality care.

Donor registries — When national or regional donor registries exist, capture of donor follow-up information, either through center reporting or direct donor contacts, facilitates data aggregation, assessment and dissemination of current donor outcomes data. Informed consent for collection of follow-up information for registry reporting should be requested during the consent for donor evaluation, and in countries where registries do not exist, efforts should be made to establish and maintain a donor registry to support ongoing reporting of postdonation outcomes. Some countries have instituted systematic approaches to longer-term living donor follow-up and registry reporting, and the EULID project began with an 11-nation assessment of living donation practices in Europe that recommended mandatory living donor registration and follow-up data collections through a centralized donor database system.

### Universal vs targeted chlorhexidine bathing and nasal decolonization… [^24d4f85e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Targeted decolonization was least costly and UD resulted in the fewest HOB events. Targeted decolonization was the cost-effective strategy from payer and hospital perspectives. Compared with TD, UD had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $119 700 per HOB averted from the payer perspective, and $126 600 per HOB averted from the hospital perspective. Depending on willingness-to-pay, UD may be preferred in scenarios with a higher proportion of patients with medical devices, greater reductions in HOB from decolonizing in those with devices, and lower adherence under TD. We then identified the cost-effective strategy as that with the highest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio underneath the willingness-to-pay threshold. We assumed that payers had a willingness-to-pay threshold of $25 000 per HOB averted, and hospitals had a willingness-to-pay threshold of $10 000 per HOB event prevented.

We varied key parameters to test how cost-effectiveness differed beyond the base case assumptions, depending on the patient population served or other factors relevant for decision-making. In one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses, we varied each of the following key parameters, holding others constant: proportion of patients with medical devices who had a history of MRSA colonization and were admitted to a surgical ward, adherence to bathing under TD compared with UD, and willingness-to-pay to prevent each HOB event. We also performed a 4-way deterministic sensitivity analysis, varying the following parameters at the same time within plausible ranges for US hospitals: proportion of patients with medical devices, reduction in hazard rate ratio of HOB among those with devices who received the decolonization intervention, willingness-to-pay to prevent a single HOB, and adherence to decolonization under TD compared with UD. In addition, as the hospital's willingness-to-pay threshold to prevent HOB increased, and as the intervention became more effective in preventing HOB than estimated in the trial, the cost-effectiveness of the UD strategy exceeded that of TD. Overall, from the payer perspective, UD was favored in approximately two-thirds of the explored parameter scenarios, and UD was favored in half the parameter scenarios explored from the hospital perspective. The outcome evaluated, HOB, is highly relevant as an imminent hospital quality standard, expected to ultimately replace central-line–associated bloodstream infection.

### Process improvement in thoracic donor organ procurement: implementation of a donor assessment checklist [^d04a64c3]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Donor organs are often procured by junior staff in stressful, unfamiliar environments where a single adverse event can be catastrophic. A formalized checklist focused on preprocedural processes related to thoracic donor organ procurement could improve detection and prevention of near miss events.

Methods

A checklist was developed centered on patient identifiers, organ compatibility and quality, and team readiness. It went through five cycles of feedback and revision using a panel of expert procurement surgeons. Educational in-service sessions were held on the use of the checklist as well as best organ assessment practices. Near miss events before the survey were tallied by retrospective review of 20 procurements, and near misses after checklist implementation were prospectively recorded. We implemented the checklist for 40 donor lung and heart procurements: 20 from Cleveland Clinic and 20 from the University of Minnesota. A final survey assessment was used to determine ease of use.

Results

Nine near miss events were reported in 20 procurements before use of the checklist. Thirty-one near miss events of 40 organ procurements were identified and potentially prevented by the checklist. Eighty-seven percent of fellows found the checklist to be unobtrusive to work flow, and 100% believed its use should be mandatory. Mortality was the same before and after implementation of the checklist despite increased patient volumes.

Conclusions

Implementation of a simple checklist for use during thoracic organ procurement uncovered a substantial number of near miss events. A preprocedural checklist for all thoracic organ transplants in the United States and abroad is feasible and would likely reduce adverse events.

### Donor intervention and organ preservation: where is the science and what are the obstacles? [^68b527d9]. American Journal of Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

The organ shortage is widely acknowledged as the most critical factor hindering the full realization of success for solid organ transplantation. Innovation in the areas of donor management and organ preservation offers the most realistic hope to improve both the quality and size of the current organ supply. Although the basic science dissecting the complex processes of brain death and ischemia/reperfusion injury is replete with exciting discoveries, the clinical science investigating donor management and organ preservation is sparse in contrast. This review will survey the current landscape of trials to mitigate organ injury through interventions administered to donors in vivo or organs ex vivo. Consideration will then be given to the scientific, logistical and ethical obstacles that impede the transformation of laboratory breakthroughs into innovative treatments that simultaneously improve organ quality and supply.

### Effect of state policies on organ donation and transplantation… [^82097579]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

eTable 7. Sensitivity Analysis-Relationship between Policy Passage and Organ Donation Rates with Five-Year Time-lagged Effects eTable
8. Sensitivity Analysis-Relationship between Policy Passage and Organ Donation Rates using Fixed Effects Binomial Regression Specification eTable 9. Sensitivity Analysis-Relationship between Number of Policies Passed and Organ Donation Rates. The establishment of revenue policies, in which individuals contribute to a protected state fund for donation promotion activities, was associated with a 5. 3% increase in the absolute number of transplants.

We examined primary legal sources to create indicator variables for the passage of 6 major types of state policies designed to increase organ donation: dedicated revenue pools comprising individual voluntary contributions and protected state funds for donor recruitment activities, such as community outreach campaigns, worksite campaigns, and hospital-based interventions to encourage donation and improve. Revenue policies were associated with a 4. 9% increase in the number of deceased donors per capita, as well as an
8. 0% increase in the number of transplants of organs from deceased donors. This increase represents an additional 6. 5 deceased donors and 8 transplants from deceased donors per state, per year. Regressions using a narrow time frame showed similar effects of the revenue policies on overall outcomes. Policies that establish state-based revenue pools were associated with increases in the absolute number of transplants, specifically among deceased donors. However, the magnitude of the effect was small, with revenue policies contributing to an additional 6. 5 deceased donors and 8 transplants from deceased donors per year for an average state. The small observed benefits from the institution of revenue pools — the only policy that had a statistically significant effect — may be owing to several possible mechanisms. Funding from revenue pools may be used for recruitment activities not covered under public education, such as community outreach campaigns and worksite campaigns. Funds may also be used to educate physicians, lawyers, funeral directors, and other professionals who may affect the public's willingness to donate.

### Positive impact of a clinical goal-directed protocol on reducing cardiac arrests during potential brain-dead donor maintenance [^2fd2087b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This is a quality improvement project with prospective data collection in 27 hospitals that reported deceased donors to the Transplant Center of the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, over six 4-month periods from May 2012 to April 2014. The hospitals were encouraged to use a goal checklist for the management of PBDDs.

Design of the goal checklist for case management

The main recommendations from the Brazilian Guidelines for Potential Multiple Organ Donors were pooled to create a goal checklist based on the adapted form of the VIP approach (Additional file 1), to achieve nine goals to be met upon protocol completion: (1) adequate mechanical ventilation (tidal volume ranging from 6 to 8 ml/kg predicted weight + positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ranging from 8 to 10 cmH 2 O + plateau pressure < 30 cmH 2 O) and FiO 2 titration to obtain SaO 2 > 90%; (2) mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg; (3) diuresis ranging from 1 to 4 ml/kg/h; (4) temperature ≥ 35 °C upon protocol completion; (5) vasopressin when a vasoconstrictor is required; (6) corticosteroids; (7) blood glucose < 180 mg/dl; (8) serum sodium < 150 mEq/L; and (9) protocol duration ranging from 12 to 24 hours.

The compliance with the items was supervised by inhospital transplant coordinators, who alerted the care team if any noncompliance was observed.

Hospital selection

All hospitals that reported deceased donors to the Transplantation Center were selected. The eight hospitals with the highest numbers of BD notifications (60% of actual organ donations) were selected to perform onsite training of inhospital transplant coordinators and ICU teams. The training of teams from the other hospitals was restricted to biannual meetings of transplant coordinators. The hospitals were classified according to characteristics that may affect performance.

### Protocols for uncontrolled donation after circulatory death: a systematic review of international guidelines, practices and transplant outcomes [^66b36ddb]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

This systematic review has several limitations. Although organisations provided us with draft protocols or guidelines for uDCD, only fully developed guidelines were included in the review, reducing the overall scope of guidelines to assess. The AGREE II appraisal process was used to assess the quality of guideline development. Though well supported, this tool is not the only accepted method for this purpose. The lack of homogenous data from the studies reporting transplant outcomes also precluded a meta-analysis and prevented the linking of outcomes to specific protocols used for the uDCD process.

KDIGO living kidney donor guideline recommendation grading — within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the certainty of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D. Level 1 implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Certainty-of-evidence grades are A High ("We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect".), B Moderate ("The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), C Low ("The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect".), and D Very low ("The estimate of the effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect".).

According to the Standards of the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA) 2020 [1] unrelated stem cell donor registries are responsible for compliance of their donor centres with these Standards. To ensure high stem cell product quality and high standards for safety and satisfaction of voluntary unrelated stem cell donors, we present here guidelines for audits of donor centres (DC) that can be used by new and established donor registries. They have been developed for registries relying on independent national or international DCs for the recruitment and management of Unrelated Donors (UD) for verification typing (VT)/extended tying (ET), work up processes and Hemopoietic Progenitor Cell (HPC) donation. The main goal of these guidelines is to support registries in verifying and auditing their affiliated DCs to ensure they are compliant with the WMDA Standards, as well as WMDA recommendations. We define the general requirements and recommendations for collaboration with the DC and guidelines to manage the UD, step by step from recruitment to follow-up. We also provide a checklist, intended to serve as a resource for auditors performing an audit at a DC.

### Increasing the pool of deceased donor organs for kidney transplantation [^c7e60028]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Expanding the pool of available deceased donor kidneys is critical for improving the outcomes of prospective and current renal transplant candidates. A number of interventions have been proposed that may increase the pool of donors in the US. However, these interventions have variable levels of empirical evidence supporting their potential beneficial impact. Proposed interventions include the instigation of policies for presumed donor consent, the expansion of donor registration, increased quality oversight of transplant providers, financial incentives for donors, increased reimbursement for higher risk donors, alterations in organ allocation policies and distribution, and the selective use of donors with potential or known risk for disease transmission. Many of these interventions have contentious elements that may have delayed or impeded their implementation; however, these options should be considered in the context of the diminishing prognoses for prospective transplant patients, given the increasing scarcity of donor organs relative to the population need. In this Review, we outline the proposed interventions and briefly discuss salient issues that characterize the debates concerning their implementation and effectiveness. Ultimately, any intervention must be based on the best evidence available, with consideration of numerous stakeholders and in conjunction with a careful evaluation of long-term and potential unintended consequences.

### The impact of meeting donor management goals on the number of organs transplanted per donor: results from the United network for organ sharing region 5 prospective donor management goals study [^5a2143ac]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Many organ procurement organizations have implemented critical care end points as donor management goals in efforts to increase organs transplanted per donor after neurologic determination of death. Although retrospective studies have demonstrated an association between meeting donor management goals and organ yield, prospective studies are lacking.

Design

In June 2008, nine donor management goals were prospectively implemented as a checklist and every donor after neurologic determination of death was managed to meet them. The donor management goals represented normal cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and endocrine end points. Data were collected for 7 months. Donor management goals "met" was defined a priori as achieving any seven of the nine donor management goals, and this was recorded at the time of consent, 12–18 hrs later, and prior to organ recovery. The primary outcome measure was ≥ 4 organs transplanted per donor, and binary logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of this outcome with a p < .05.

Setting

All eight organ procurement organizations in the five Southwestern United States (United Network for Organ Sharing Region 5).

Subjects

All standard criteria donors after neurologic determination of deaths.

Intervention

Prospective implementation of a donor management goal checklist.

Measurements and Main Results

There were 380 standard criteria donors with 3.6 ± 1.7 organs transplanted per donor. Fifteen percent had donor management goals met at the time of consent, 33% at 12–18 hrs, and 38% prior to organ recovery. Forty-eight percent had ≥ 4 organs transplanted per donor. Donors with ≥ 4 organs transplanted per donor had significantly more individual donor management goals met at all three time points. Independent predictors of ≥ 4 organs transplanted per donor were age (odds ratio = 0.95 per year), final creatinine (odds ratio = 0.75 per 1-unit increase), donor management goals "met" at consent (odds ratio = 2.03), donor management goals "met" prior to organ recovery (odds ratio = 2.34), and a change in the number of donor management goals achieved from consent to 12–18 hrs later (odds ratio = 1.13 per additional donor management goal).

Conclusions

Meeting donor management goals prior to consent and prior to organ recovery were both associated with achieving ≥ 4 organs transplanted per donor. However, only 15% of donors have donor management goals met at the time of consent. The donor hospital management of patients with catastrophic brain injuries, before the intent to donate organs is known, affects outcomes and should remain a priority in the intensive care unit.

Death determination using neurologic criteria — there are two sets of criteria for death determination: a circulatory-respiratory criteria set in which the patient has permanently lost circulation, respiration, and responsiveness, and a neurologic criteria set in which the patient has irreversible cessation of whole brain function including the brainstem; the neurologic criteria require permanently absent whole brain function clinically assessed by the absence of evidence of cortical function and brainstem reflexes and by apnea; this section uses the terms brain death criteria and neurologic criteria for death determination interchangeably, although the latter is technically more correct and preferred; the 1995 American Academy of Neurology Quality Standards Subcommittee created medical standards for determination using neurologic criteria that included ancillary tests (cerebral angiography, electroencephalography, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and cerebral scintigraphy), a checklist for the clinical examination, and a requirement for ancillary testing when the clinical examination cannot be completed; despite these standards, variability exists in requirements such as minimal acceptable temperature, number of examinations, observation period between examinations, performance of the apnea test, and the number of physicians and the type and need for confirmatory tests vary among and within countries; in 2010 the subcommittee published revised evidence-based recommendations for adult patients and noted that no evidence of recovery of brain function was observed among individuals who meet the 1995 criteria and therefore recommended that the guidelines be used; additional background is available in online supplement I.

### Advancing the science of organ donor management [^4c700fc4]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

There is an increasing burden of responsibility for intensivists to optimize donation potential after the declaration of brain death in patients with catastrophic brain injury. Best practice for donor management, if present, has been formed on low quality and mainly observational studies or consensus. In particular, research into the use of corticosteroids has shown varied benefit. The specific and limited results of the CORTICOME study are less important than the systematic methodology and the development of rigour in the study of deceased organ donation. Donor management would benefit from continued systematic analysis of current literature, understanding of the physiologic basis for therapy, and further prospective controlled trials. Worldwide collaboration partnerships and funding are needed to optimize the management of deceased organ donation.

Determinants of the strength of recommendation — balance of benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, values and preferences, and resource use and costs — are specified as follows: "The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the more likely a strong recommendation is provided. The narrower the gradient, the more likely a weak recommendation is warranted". "The higher the certainty of evidence, the more likely a strong recommendation is warranted. However, there are exceptions for which low or very low certainty of the evidence will warrant a strong recommendation". "The more variability in values and preferences, or the more uncertainty in values and preferences, the more likely a weak recommendation is warranted", with values "obtained from the literature, when possible, or were assessed by the judgment of the Work Group when robust evidence was not identified". For resources, "The higher the costs of an intervention — that is, the more resources consumed — the less likely a strong recommendation is warranted", and considered resources included "direct healthcare costs; non-healthcare resources, such as transportation and social services; informal caregiver resources (e.g., time of family and caregivers); and changes in productivity".

Conclusion

Organ donation is an important process that ensures the availability of organs for individuals whose only opportunities for survival lie on receiving transplants. Efforts to ensure the success of every step of the process are therefore of utmost importance. Recommendations for all institutions that care for the critically ill patient include incorporating skilled team-driven approaches to the consent process, protocol-guided steps for the management of potential donors, and adequate balance of the physiological status of donors. Optimal hemodynamic management, multidrug hormone replacement therapy, and efficient organ recovery are strategies to improve organ yield and the viability of donor organs.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^bc193d94]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI commentary — living kidney donor risk prediction tool limitations and related consent guidance are described as follows: The tool "does not include family history of kidney disease or donation to an immediate relative with kidney failure" and "does not include other important clinical variables", such that "for donor candidates with these risk factors, the tool may underestimate risk". It "was constructed using a life-table approach" with follow-up "from only 4 to 16 years", whereas donor risk spans "multiple decades", and "The lifetime estimates generated are therefore inherently imprecise approximations". The website "(http://www.transplantmodels.com/esrdrisk) does not readily acknowledge most of these limitations", and outcomes compared were "only to 15 years postdonation". Accordingly, "The tool should be used only with a clear understanding that it may well generate incorrect information about long-term outcomes" and "should be considered as a possibly valuable step". An "additional predictive tool by Massie et al" exists, but "Both the pre- and postdonation tools require additional validation and study before being considered standard of care". Given current constraints, "the lack of tools to estimate future risk with precision makes the goal unreachable at this time", and programs "currently lack both the data and the experience to be able to follow the KDIGO recommendation to set their own acceptable absolute thresholds for long-term risks of kidney failure". The commentary "question[s] the prescription in recommendation 1.11 to express risks 'as absolute as well as relative risks'", agreeing the absolute risk is key because the increase "will usually be relatively low", while stating informed consent would include "the disclosure of the best-available estimates of relative risk of kidney failure due to kidney donation", and it notes recommendation "1.17" "is a UNOS requirement to provide what is termed the 'Independent Living Donor Advocate'.

Living kidney donor research recommendations highlight priorities to determine the best methods to achieve informed consent from living kidney donor candidates, including what methods are most useful to impart information including risks and outcomes and what methods are most useful to assess comprehension. Through focus groups and/or surveys, develop standardized criteria for circumstances under which intended recipients should be asked for permission to disclose certain personal health information to the living kidney donor candidate, so that donor candidates can make an informed decision about whether to proceed with donation or not. Develop standardized criteria for when donation and transplant should not proceed in the absence of disclosure, weighing considerations of privacy law, ethics, and the concerns of donor and recipient candidates. Perform postdonation surveys to measure donors' assessments of the quality of standardized informed consent processes, including if the information provided before donation met the donor's needs and prepared them for the donation. Compare experiences of donors who donated before and after the implementation of country-specific regulations for better informed consent processes for the pre-donation stage. Evaluate appropriate circumstances and approaches to substitute decision making and use of surrogate consent, including definition of the necessary supporting ethical framework for particular scenarios. Develop ethically-grounded, practical strategies to consider and manage evaluation of living kidney donor candidates initiated by the intended recipient or their representatives through mass advertising and social media.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^6af56765]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU consensus statement — developed through the collaborative efforts of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American College of Chest Physicians, and the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations — convened a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional task force divided into 13 subcommittees across general and organ-specific areas; because the available literature was overwhelmingly comprised of observational studies and case series, representing low-quality evidence, a decision was made that the document would assume the form of a consensus statement rather than a formally graded guideline, with the goal to provide critical care practitioners with essential information and practical recommendations related to management of the potential organ donor; contextual need includes that, as of December 2013, over 120,000 patients comprised the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) waiting list, and in 2012 only 22,187 organ transplantations from 8,143 deceased donors were performed, with over 6,467 patients dying while waiting for an available organ.

### Donor time to death and kidney transplant outcomes in the setting of a 3-hour minimum wait policy [^6701794f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

For patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis, a kidney transplant offers advantages in survival, quality of life, and health care costs. However, as the global prevalence of chronic kidney disease increases, transplant waiting times continue to lengthen, with only one-fourth of the individuals listed for transplant in the US receiving a deceased-donor kidney within 5 years. Strategies that either expand the deceased-donor pool or improve use of organs from existing donors are thus required.

The key to improving use of organs from potential donors is identifying factors that are incorrectly perceived to compromise outcomes. One such potential factor is time to death (TTD) in controlled donation after circulatory death (DCD). Concerns persist that the potential warm ischemic insult from lengthy TTD may affect recipient outcomes. Many organ donation organizations (ODOs) therefore have strict DCD wait times of no more than 1 or 2 hours after withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST), with only 6.7% of US ODOs routinely waiting even 2 hours. Thus, substantial numbers of viable kidneys are potentially lost due to these strict wait times.

With the introduction of the UK National Organ Retrieval Service over a decade ago, the national standard for DCD minimum wait time was set to a minimum of 3 hoursbased on a single center's demonstration that favorable kidney transplant outcomes can be achieved from donors with prolonged TTD. Thus, the UK has over a decade of experience transplanting kidneys from donors with prolonged TTD. Coupled with high UK DCD donation rates, this provides a unique dataset to assess how the duration of TTD is associated with outcomes after DCD kidney transplant.

### Financial incentives versus standard of care to improve patient compliance with live kidney donor follow-up: protocol for a multi-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial [^adc7a1cf]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This randomized controlled trial will provide valuable information about whether using small financial incentives is an effective strategy to promote patient compliance with donor follow-up. If financial incentivization proves to be effective in this setting, the results of this RCT could serve as evidence to guide potential center-level and national initiatives to provide financial incentives for all live kidney donors. On the other hand, if financial incentivization does not effectively improve compliance, this will suggest that alternative interventions to increase live donor engagement with post-donation follow-up care should be explored.

This RCT has several limitations which merit discussion. Historically, donors have been predominantly Caucasian. In 2016, Caucasian donors donated 70% of living donor kidneys in the United States; comparatively, 77% of the donors in our cohort are Caucasian. As such, our results may have limited generalizability to minority populations (ex: African American, Hispanic, and Asian donors). In addition, because the gift cards are mailed to participants assigned to the intervention arm rather than distributed in person, it is possible that some may not reach the intended recipient. However, we will use USPS Certified Mail, which requires a signature by the recipient for delivery, and will record any delivery failures. Finally, it is possible that unblinded intervention arm assignment could result in ascertainment bias; however, it would be infeasible to blind study participants in this RCT, as the intervention is dependent on the participant's expectation of a financial incentive for follow-up completion.

Despite the aforementioned limitations, this trial has several key strengths. To our knowledge, it is the first clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of using financial incentives to promote donor compliance with postdonation monitoring efforts by a transplant hospital. Additionally, our randomized design will provide high-quality evidence to inform center-level and national efforts to improve donor follow-up compliance. If found to be effective, financial incentivization could serve as a useful strategy in center-level and national initiatives to improve postdonation care for live kidney donors.

Methods

The AAST Critical Care Committee chose organ donation as a topic for review. A working group was then created from the larger committee, which identified relevant questions for literature review based on the members' review of controversial or developing issues surrounding the logistics of organ donation. This review was done at each author's discretion using society guidelines as well as peer-reviewed original research published in the last 10 years. To develop consensus, the content was then reviewed by the working group and then the Critical Care Committee as a whole. Of note, these recommendations are based on best practice expert consensus and are not based on formal processes such as Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology or Delphi consensus.

### Organ donation and transplantation: a multi-stakeholder call to action [^96d3cb74]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Although overall donation and transplantation activity is higher in Europe than on other continents, differences between European countries in almost every aspect of transplantation activity (for example, in the number of transplantations, the number of people with a functioning graft, in rates of living versus deceased donation, and in the use of expanded criteria donors) suggest that there is ample room for improvement. Herein we review the policy and clinical measures that should be considered to increase access to transplantation and improve post-transplantation outcomes. This Roadmap, generated by a group of major European stakeholders collaborating within a Thematic Network, presents an outline of the challenges to increasing transplantation rates and proposes 12 key areas along with specific measures that should be considered to promote transplantation. This framework can be adopted by countries and institutions that are interested in advancing transplantation, both within and outside the European Union. Within this framework, a priority ranking of initiatives is suggested that could serve as the basis for a new European Union Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation.

### How Spain reached 40 deceased organ donors per million population [^9c51bbeb]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

With 40 donors and more than 100 transplant procedures per million population in 2015, Spain holds a privileged position worldwide in providing transplant services to its patient population. The Spanish success derives from a specific organizational approach to ensure the systematic identification of opportunities for organ donation and their transition to actual donation and to promote public support for the donation of organs after death. The Spanish results are to be highlighted in the context of the dramatic decline in the incidence of brain death and the changes in end-of-life care practices in the country since the beginning of the century. This prompted the system to conceive the 40 donors per million population plan, with three specific objectives: (i) promoting the identification and early referral of possible organ donors from outside of the intensive care unit to consider elective non-therapeutic intensive care and incorporate the option of organ donation into end-of-life care; (ii) facilitating the use of organs from expanded criteria and non-standard risk donors; and (iii) developing the framework for the practice of donation after circulatory death. This article describes the actions undertaken and their impact on donation and transplantation activities.

Fluid management for lung donation — targets and conservative strategies are detailed. In a large prospective trial in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a liberal strategy targeted CVP, 10–14 mm Hg or PAOP, 14–18 mm Hg versus a conservative strategy targeting CVP, < 4 mm Hg and PAOP, < 8 mm Hg. The conservative fluid strategy was associated with superior oxygenation and a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and need for intensive care, and a lung donor–specific protocol minimized use of crystalloids and employed diuretics to maintain neutral or negative fluid balance. In 404 kidney recipients, a conservative fluid strategy with CVP below 6 mm Hg did not adversely affect renal graft survival or increase the risk of delayed graft function. Recommendation: Fluid management protocols, aiming for neutral or net negative fluid balance to avoid volume overload.

### Challenges and opportunities in organ donation after circulatory death [^854e0518]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

DCD donation has come a long way since its clinical implementation and is now the main pathway to organ donation in many centres. At the same time, many countries still lack a DCD programme and must engage in a focused effort to tackle legislative gaps and develop the organizational infrastructure and the teams so they can address the increasing demand for transplantation in their jurisdictions. There is no doubt that the renewed interest in DCD donation has been facilitated by the development of machine perfusion technology that has transformed transplant outcomes and increased organ utilization. Although there remain many challenges in DCD transplantation, the continued development of perfusion strategies together with regenerative therapies holds not only the potential to further expand the use of DCD but also to enable precision organ perfusion and repair so that no donated organs will be discarded.

### Organ donation in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^0dc70da1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Medical management of the potential donor

What specific interventions are considered best practices in the optimization of the patient as a potential donor prior to brain death?

Recommendation

Patients with devastating brain injury (DBI) should be managed with an initial period of aggressive resuscitation and full support with the goal of physiological stability. Therapies that support hemodynamic stability, end-organ perfusion, and euvolemia will both benefit the patient and preserve the potential of organ donation. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in DBI includes thyroid hormone, corticosteroids, insulin, vasopressin, or a combination thereof, with early HRT requiring more study.

Discussion

There are extensive guidelines for the management of identified and confirmed organ donors, but it is less clear-cut which of these management strategies should be applied to patients who have not yet formally transitioned to the donation process. A reasonable approach may incorporate donor-specific management strategies that also support the clinical goals of resuscitation and stabilization.

A fundamental strategy in caring for patients with DBI who are potential donors is to avoid de-escalating care prematurely. Unless there is clear guidance from the LAR or advanced directives which limit further therapies, or inadequate medical resources, patients with DBI should be aggressively resuscitated to optimize perfusion and normalize as many physiological parameters as possible. This strategy enables improved neuroprognostication, allows time for the LAR to engage in decision making, and may also provide the necessary conditions for formal brain death examination. Together, these strategies help preserve the option of donation.

### Financial incentives versus standard of care to improve patient compliance with live kidney donor follow-up: protocol for a multi-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial [^ef4e86e4]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Live donor kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment modality for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with superior clinical outcomes and quality of life compared to deceased donor kidney transplantation or remaining on dialysis. Live kidney donors currently contribute nearly one third of the kidneys used for transplantation each year in the US. While live kidney donation poses minimal post-surgical risks to patients, donors face a small but measurable increase in the risk of developing ESRD and other chronic diseases in the long-term. Prior work suggests that donors who develop de novo disease are at greater risk for ESRD. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and glomerulonephritis account for over 60% of ESRD cases in donors. Routine laboratory and clinical screening can detect subclinical disease indicators such as hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and hematuria long before they progress to chronic disease or ESRD. In fact, our group's preliminary work found that serum creatinine measured as early as 6 months postdonation was predictive of later ESRD development; a 10 mL/min/1.73m 2 increase in postdonation eGFR was associated with 40% decreased risk of ESRD.

Transplant hospitals are required to monitor donors for 2 years postdonation but have historically struggled to meet federally-mandated data reporting requirements. For donors from 2008 to 2012, the vast majority of transplant hospitals had noncompliant 2-year follow-up data; 69 and 84% of hospitals were noncompliant with clinical and laboratory data reporting requirements, respectively. In 2013, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) implemented a policy mandating that hospitals report clinical data (i.e. presence of hypertension, diabetes, dialysis, kidney related complications, recent hospitalizations, medical insurance status, income, and vital status) for 80% and laboratory data (i.e. serum creatinine and urine protein) for 75% of donors at 6-months, 1-year, and 2-years postdonation (Supplement 1). While the rate of compliant donor follow-up increased after this policy change (33% pre-policy to 54% post-policy), only 43% of transplant hospitals met all OPTN-mandated 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year thresholds for donors who donated in 2013. Transplant hospitals commonly cite barriers such as donor inconvenience, direct and indirect costs to donors, donors not wanting to return to the program, and the burden of data collection. Tools to improve donor engagement and strategies that mitigate patient and administrative burden are needed.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^b9aae863]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis — response assessment timing and monitoring emphasizes continuous evaluation and flexible timelines. Large clinical trials often evaluate response at 6–12 months, but improvement of proteinuria and eGFR is continuous and variable; the timeframes in Figure 11 are clinical trial assessment points and do not mean one should wait before making decisions, as patients should be assessed continuously and alternatives considered early if response is unsatisfactory. Outside of a formal clinical trial setting, the Work Group suggests that if patients are improving, allowing 18–24 months to achieve a complete response is reasonable in patients who show continuous improvement. Long-term data indicated favorable outcomes predicted by achieving a proteinurial level of 0.7–0.8 g/d after 12 months of therapy, and a post hoc analysis suggested normalization of complement and ≥ 25% reduction of proteinuria after 8 weeks predicted favorable outcomes. In this context, the PERR at Week 104 was the primary endpoint in the BLISS-LN trial.

Live donor kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for most patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease; however, the rate of living kidney donation has declined in the United States. A consensus conference was held June 5–6, 2014 to identify best practices and knowledge gaps pertaining to live donor kidney transplantation and living kidney donation. Transplant professionals, patients, and other key stakeholders discussed processes for educating transplant candidates and potential living donors about living kidney donation; efficiencies in the living donor evaluation process; disparities in living donation; and financial and systemic barriers to living donation. We summarize the consensus recommendations for best practices in these educational and clinical domains, future research priorities, and possible public policy initiatives to remove barriers to living kidney donation.

### Audit of donor centre: guidelines by the world marrow donor association quality and regulation working group [^05e9e8cf]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Format and timing of audits

From UD recruitment, consenting, testing, management, and the collection of donors personal, genetic, and medical data, the essential procedures rely on high-quality standards at DCs. As the DR provides the volunteer UD with all necessary information about their role as an UD, the DR is also responsible for ensuring that they comply with WMDA Standards as a minimum requirement.

Regular audits provide the means of monitoring compliance. The DC should embed these audits within their own quality system. The following formats and frequencies of audits are recommended.

It is recommended that a full audit is conducted, including an on-site or remote/virtual inspection of any DC that is to be newly contracted by a registry. During the application period, all national and WMDA requirements must be considered. If it is not possible to conduct the audit on-site, a remote audit can be considered, provided that the technical and data protection criteria are met. Additionally, a paper-based audit is required to ensure compliance with the WMDA Standards.

For already contracted, experienced DCs, a biennial paper-based audit should be conducted by the DC, reviewing at least the following points:
Change of address or other important contact information to ensure that all critical communications with collection centre (CC), transplant centre (TC), and UD can be accomplished in a timely manner.
Relevant staff changes (e.g. Medical Director, CEO, physicians, or coordinators).
Changes in accreditation, registration, or license status.
UD issues which may include the number of serious adverse events and serious adverse reactions occurring and reported to the DR.
Changes in suppliers, testing laboratories or other affiliated facilities, if required by the DR.

It is recommended that once every 4 years the DR performs a full on-site audit based on these guidelines and the provided checklists. Whenever a DC fails to meet the basic requirements, immediate clarification must be made and both corrective and preventative actions must be taken by the DC.

The DR should have a mechanism to re-audit the DC in 6 months — 1 year to ensure that the corrective action plan/preventive plan was functioning as intended.

If the DC fails to comply with the request in the time allotted, the DC activity can be either suspended, or withdrawn.

Each registry should establish its own auditing group of staff fully trained in audit procedures.

### Organ donation in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^51168dac]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Clinicians should recognize the potential effects of treatment limitations on a patient's ability to donate their organs. The implications of treatment limitations should be discussed by the OPO with the patient's surrogate prior to enacting limitations.

Discussion

Patients' decisions about donation are valid medical choices. The challenge presented by limitation or 'no escalation' of treatments is that it may be detrimental to a patient's wish to be an organ donor. Clarity is best achieved through specific patient/family discussions regarding what life-saving interventions are concordant with goals of care. Decisions about treatment limitations are best made independently of those for organ donation but should not hinder organ donation if that is still desired by the patient/LAR. Although treatment limitations may align with some end-of-life preferences with respect to allowing natural death, patient-centered care should account for all pertinent preferences, not just those regarding survival.

Procedural and institutional safeguards exist to maintain a boundary between survival-directed care and potential donor management, such as the use of an OPO 'designated requestor' distinct from the clinical team to approach LARs regarding organ donation. Additionally, institution-specific and state-specific procedures for declaration of death must be strictly followed to maintain the dead donor rule — the ethical principle that death must not be induced in the service of organ recovery for donation. For example, the National Conference on Donation after Cardiac Death recommends 'not less than two minutes is acceptable and not more than five minutes is recommended' as standard time from asystole to death declaration.

The uDCD is a viable option for increasing the organ donation pool, yielding success in kidney, liver, and lung transplantation.
Depending on regional perspectives, there are a number of procedural, medical, legal, and ethical challenges such as definitions of refractory cardiac arrest, time limits for organ ischaemia, timing and type of consent required, determination of death, and organ-preserving interventions.
Current guidelines for uDCD are based on limited levels of evidence
Standardization of definitions and processes would avoid the current existing variability in practices and heterogeneity of outcomes
The maintenance of trust by health professionals and by the public is a key point for the long-term success and widespread implementation of the uDCD strategy.

Study procedures

Study personnel at each site will be responsible for approaching patients who undergo donor nephrectomy at their respective sites (i.e. MDJH study personnel will recruit MDJH patients and MDUM study personnel will recruit MDUM patients). At each site, study personnel will obtain a list of patients who have undergone donor nephrectomy from surgical providers (co-investigators on this study) or hospital records and will approach all of these patients as possible participants. Only requisite study personnel will have access to lists of potential patients. Study personnel will approach donors in one of the following settings: (1) the inpatient clinical transplant unit after patients have undergone donor nephrectomy, prior to their discharge; or (2) at the donor's first medically-required outpatient clinic visit. Informed consent will be documented using a written consent form. If patients are unable to be contacted at these times, study personnel will contact the patient via telephone and describe the study using a telephone screening script. If patients are not interested in learning more about the study, study personnel will record this refusal. If patients are interested in participating, study personnel will use an oral consent script to obtain consent. The number of acceptances, eligible enrollments, and refusals will be recorded; then the list will be destroyed. Surgeon and clinician members of the study team will not participate in recruitment activities to avoid the potential for coercion and appearance of conflict of interest. As much time as necessary will be allowed for obtaining consent. After providing informed consent, participants will be randomized to the intervention or the control arms using opaque, sealed envelopes.

All study participants will be instructed to complete required follow-up activities as is standard of care. Study personnel at MDJH and MDUM will monitor patient compliance with 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. Study personnel at MDUM will provide periodic enrollment and follow-up compliance updates to the MDJH study team using a HIPAA-compliant REDCap database. Enrollment data will include patient name, date of birth, date of donation, demographic information (including gender, race, and ethnicity), contact information, and an electronic copy of the informed consent form. Follow-up compliance data will include the dates of completion of clinical (i.e. questionnaire) and laboratory follow-up components for each participant. Only requisite study personnel will have access to the REDCap database.

### Protocols for uncontrolled donation after circulatory death: a systematic review of international guidelines, practices and transplant outcomes [^4fb8a280]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

uDCD is a complex and labour-intensive process. Although there has been an extended experience with uDCD in Spain, pioneering the strategy with seven programs, the international experience remains at an early stage of development and thus critical analysis and summative evaluation are difficult. The purpose of this review was to assemble and evaluate the uDCD guidelines and outcomes in order to inform the medical, ethical, legal, and logistic issues to be addressed in the ongoing development of future protocols and health policy. We summarize two sources to inform practice: international guidelines and transplant outcome reports. We have created an illustration of the clinical pathway and timelines that describe the process (Fig. 2).

Several countries in Europe (France, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and Switzerland) have guidelines for uDCD. In North America, after several failed attempts to implement this strategy, New York City is the only area to have developed uDCD guidelines. Assessment of uDCD guidelines by using the AGREE II appraisal process revealed that although most of the guidelines scored well in relation to the domains of "Scope and purpose", "Stakeholder involvement", and "Clarity of presentation", improvements were necessary in the domains of "Rigour of development" and "Editorial independence".

### Effect of a novel multicomponent intervention to improve patient access to kidney transplant and living kidney donation: the EnAKT LKD cluster randomized clinical trial [^cd32f275]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have the best chance for a longer and healthier life if they receive a kidney transplant. However, many barriers prevent patients from receiving a transplant.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent intervention designed to target several barriers that prevent eligible patients from completing key steps toward receiving a kidney transplant.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This pragmatic, 2-arm, parallel-group, open-label, registry-based, superiority, cluster randomized clinical trial included all 26 CKD programs in Ontario, Canada, from November 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. These programs provide care for patients with advanced CKD (patients approaching the need for dialysis or receiving maintenance dialysis).

Interventions

Using stratified, covariate-constrained randomization, allocation of the CKD programs at a 1:1 ratio was used to compare the multicomponent intervention vs usual care for 4.2 years. The intervention had 4 main components, (1) administrative support to establish local quality improvement teams; (2) transplant educational resources; (3) an initiative for transplant recipients and living donors to share stories and experiences; and (4) program-level performance reports and oversight by administrative leaders.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the rate of steps completed toward receiving a kidney transplant. Each patient could complete up to 4 steps: step 1, referred to a transplant center for evaluation; step 2, had a potential living donor contact a transplant center for evaluation; step 3, added to the deceased donor waitlist; and step 4, received a transplant from a living or deceased donor.

Results

The 26 CKD programs (13 intervention, 13 usual care) during the trial period included 20 375 potentially transplant-eligible patients with advanced CKD (intervention group [n = 9780 patients], usual-care group [n = 10 595 patients]). Despite evidence of intervention uptake, the step completion rate did not significantly differ between the intervention vs usual-care groups: 5334 vs 5638 steps; 24.8 vs 24.1 steps per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.87–1.15).

Conclusions and Relevance

This novel multicomponent intervention did not significantly increase the rate of completed steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. Improving access to transplantation remains a global priority that requires substantial effort.

Organ procurement organization (OPO) notification timing — Timely notification of the OPO is essential and is defined by CMS regulation as notification of an impending death within 1 hour of one or more specified clinical triggers being met; recommendations specify that ICU caregivers should notify OPOs within 1 hour after a patient meets specified clinical triggers and that clinicians should consider organ donation as part of end-of-life decisions. Examples of clinical triggers include the initial indication of a nonrecoverable neurologic injury (e.g., documented loss of cranial nerve reflexes), when a formal brain death examination is contemplated, and before initiating a discussion that may lead to withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Several experts have recommended separating requests for donation from family notification of brain death ("decoupling"), but one analysis suggested that decoupling does not significantly improve authorization rates after neurologic determination of death, and there are ethical reasons to separate the decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies from the decision to pursue organ donation.

### Active donor management during the hospital phase of care is associated with more organs transplanted per donor [^4b981e55]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Meeting donor management goals when caring for potential organ donors has been associated with more organs transplanted per donor (OTPD). Concern persists, however, as to whether this indicates that younger/healthier donors are more likely to meet donor management goals or whether active management affects outcomes.

Study Design

A prospective observational study of all standard criteria donors was conducted by 10 organ procurement organizations across United Network for Organ Sharing Regions 4, 5, and 6. Donor management goals representing normal critical care end points were measured at 2 time points: when a catastrophic brain injury was recognized and a referral was made to the organ procurement organization by the DH; and after brain death was declared and authorization for organ donation was obtained. Donor management goals Bundle "met" was defined as achieving any 7 of 9 end points. A positive Bundle status change was defined as not meeting the Bundle at referral and subsequently achieving it at authorization. The primary outcomes measure was having ≥ 4 OTPD.

Results

Data were collected for 1,398 standard criteria donors. Of the 1,166 (83%) who did not meet the Bundle at referral, only 254 (22%) had a positive Bundle status change. On adjusted analysis, positive Bundle status change increased the odds of achieving ≥ 4 OTPD significantly (odds ratio 2.04; 95% CI 1.49 to 2.81; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

A positive donor management goal Bundle status change during donor hospital management is associated with a 2-fold increase in achieving ≥ 4 OTPD. Active critical care management of the potential organ donor, as evidenced by improvement in routinely measured critical care end points can be a means by which to substantially increase the number of organs available for transplantation.

### Importance of incorporating standardized, verifiable, objective metrics of organ procurement organization performance into discussions about organ allocation [^88445c0f]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Identifying and supporting specific organ procurement organizations (OPOs) with the greatest opportunity to increase donation rates could significantly increase the number of organs available for transplant. Accomplishing this is complicated by current Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients/Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services metrics of donation rates and OPO performance that rely on eligible deaths. These data are self-reported and unverifiable and have been shown to underestimate potential organ donors. We examine the limitations of current OPO performance/donation metrics to inform discussions related to strategies to increase donation. We propose changing to a simple, verifiable, and uniformly applied donation metric. This would allow the transplant community to (1) better understand inherent differences in donor availability based on geography and (2) identify underperforming areas that would benefit from systems improvement agreements to increase donation rates.

### Donation physician specialists and missed organ donation opportunities [^e1a0fded]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The absolute number of deceased organ donors is a nuanced metric that is influenced by multiple factors, some of which are not necessarily related to system performance, which is why it was considered a secondary outcome. Even so, the donation rate in Alberta increased following the start of the DP program by almost 70%. Donation rates are high in some countries that do not have DPs, such as the US, and it is likely that DP implementation would have variable impact across regions. The cost investment for this program was approximately $700 000 (CAD) per year. Although we did not perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, considering that kidney transplantation is both more efficacious and less costly than other forms of renal replacement therapy, it is likely that our DP program was highly cost-effective.

Routine referral to an ODO is required by legislation in many jurisdictions, including Alberta. Mandatory consideration of donation potential, followed by offering donation when eligible, has been legally required in Alberta since 2009. Legislation changed in 2023 to require notification of the ODO irrespective of eligibility. Although ICU and EM staff were notified, with regular reminders, of new legislation, we found this change to be associated with only modest, statistically nonsignificant improvement in missed opportunities and ODO referral rate.

The number of organs recovered per donor did not change with DP implementation. We did not specifically audit compliance with national evidence-based recommendations for care of DNC donors. However, these recommendations are directly incorporated into a province-wide electronic order set that is used in every donor. Thus, management of deceased organ donors is highly standardized, with consistent physiologic goals, mechanical ventilation settings, and use of donor-specific treatments. It was therefore not expected that there would be major changes in donor management with a DP program.

Previous studies have not assessed whether donation metrics differ depending on characteristics of the MRP. We found that when the MRP was a DP, there were fewer missed opportunities and more ODO referrals. Although this affected provincial metrics, our observation that outcomes improved over time regardless of whether the MRP was a DP suggests that the program was associated with other positive outcomes for system performance.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^42b82efc]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential organ donor management in the ICU — the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the American College of Chest Physicians convened a working group to create a consensus document with the goal of providing critical care practitioners essential information and practical recommendations to assume a central role in donor management; intensivists are often involved after catastrophic brain injury and, once futility is determined, goals shift to maintaining hemodynamic stability, diagnosing neurologic death, preparing families, and preserving the option of organ donation, and after neurologic death is declared they play an important role by collaborating with OPO personnel and implementing management strategies to preserve organ function; the co-chairs decided this would be a consensus statement rather than an evidence-based guideline, and ACCP defines a consensus statement as a written document representing the collective opinions of a convened expert panel; a concise summary of recommendations without the literature review is available in Supplemental Digital Content 2.
