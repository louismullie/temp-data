## Question

Insomnia in the elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing insomnia in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining insomnia and its prevalence in the elderly. Then, I should verify age-related sleep physiology and the key contributors to late-life insomnia. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including screening, history, tools, and when to order polysomnography. After that, I need to confirm first-line nonpharmacologic treatments and their evidence base. Then, I will examine pharmacologic options, dosing, duration, and deprescribing strategies, including special populations. Finally, I should integrate comorbidity management, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't overgeneralize. Insomnia disorder is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, occurring despite adequate opportunity and causing daytime impairment, with chronicity defined as at least three nights per week for three months or more, and prevalence estimates in older adults commonly range from about 23% to 45% depending on criteria and cohort, underscoring that insomnia is not simply "normal aging" but a prevalent clinical disorder with functional consequences [^113Jhmj3] [^112exNR4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation without reviewing age-related sleep physiology. Older adults experience increased sleep fragmentation, reduced slow-wave sleep, and circadian phase advance with earlier bedtimes and morning awakenings; these changes interact with medical comorbidities, psychiatric disorders, medications, and psychosocial factors to produce clinically significant insomnia, so I need to ensure I distinguish expected aging changes from pathologic sleep disruption when I evaluate patients [^111VPHpY] [^113zA3XN].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, starting with screening. A single sleep question at routine visits ("Are you satisfied with your sleep?") meaningfully increases detection, and if positive, I should obtain a detailed sleep history covering bedtime routines, nocturnal awakenings, timing, daytime consequences, comorbidities, and medications, ideally with a two-week sleep diary and validated instruments such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or Insomnia Severity Index to quantify severity and track change over time [^116beeU3] [^117H5CGa] [^111VPHpY].

> Wait, let me verify when to order polysomnography because I don't want to overuse it. Polysomnography is reserved for suspected obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder, REM behavior disorder, or when the history is atypical or refractory to standard therapy; routine labs are not generally indicated unless clinical suspicion points to thyroid disease, anemia, or other systemic contributors [^116beeU3] [^114kYjvs].

> Next, I should review first-line treatment, and I need to ensure I'm aligned with guidelines. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults, including older adults, with durable benefits beyond medication and without the safety liabilities of hypnotics; multicomponent behavioral therapy and stimulus control also show benefit in older adults, and I should remember that sleep hygiene education alone is insufficient as a standalone therapy for chronic insomnia even though it remains supportive [^116NEnff] [^113pUoNH] [^111ijSmS] [^113DsqLR].

> Let me consider adjunctive nonpharmacologic options and their evidence, and I should double-check the strength of data. Exercise programs can modestly improve sleep onset latency and global sleep quality in older adults, and bright light therapy may help when circadian misalignment contributes; mindfulness-based interventions and tai chi are reasonable low-risk options when available, though the highest-quality evidence remains for CBT-I and related behavioral therapies [^115X5o3K] [^116tw5ZV] [^114gM4hC].

> Now, I need to check pharmacologic options and their risk–benefit profiles in older adults, because safety is paramount. Melatonin receptor agonists such as prolonged-release melatonin 2 mg are guideline-supported for adults over 55, particularly for sleep maintenance complaints, with a favorable safety profile; ramelteon has modest efficacy for sleep onset with minimal adverse effects; dual orexin receptor antagonists like daridorexant or lemborexant are effective for sleep onset and maintenance and may be reasonable when CBT-I is unavailable or insufficient, though long-term geriatric safety data are still evolving [^112Pw3DQ] [^116UfSZv] [^114MfRu1] [^116CYwJZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) might be broadly acceptable in older adults given short-term efficacy, but I should verify the long-term safety signal. Short-term randomized trials show small improvements in sleep parameters, yet observational data consistently associate Z-drugs with increased risks of falls and fractures in older adults; therefore, if used at all, they should be short-term, at the lowest effective dose, with explicit plans for deprescribing and close monitoring, and many guidelines advise avoidance when possible in the elderly [^116oSMfN] [^1136knSb] [^115gJVR7].

> I should confirm the stance on benzodiazepines because this is a common pitfall. Benzodiazepines are generally contraindicated for routine insomnia management in older adults due to cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, dependence, and withdrawal risks; if a short course is considered for severe, refractory cases, it should be ultra-short-term with careful tapering and only after safer options have failed, with explicit deprescribing plans and fall risk mitigation [^111zCC1X] [^1124NSMU] [^112pGi9m].

> Let me review dosing principles and duration limits so I don't inadvertently prolong risky therapy. Start low, go slow, prefer shorter half-life agents to limit next-day sedation, and limit hypnotic use to the shortest possible duration, ideally no more than 2 to 4 weeks, with reassessment at each visit. For prolonged-release melatonin, evidence supports use up to about 3 months in appropriate older adults, and for dual orexin receptor antagonists, some regional guidance allows continuation for several months if effective and tolerated, but ongoing monitoring for adverse effects and functional outcomes remains essential [^115K3JaA] [^113Xs6Gk] [^116UfSZv] [^116CYwJZ].

> I need to ensure I address comorbidities because insomnia and medical or psychiatric conditions have bidirectional relationships. Treating comorbid depression, anxiety, chronic pain, or primary sleep disorders can improve insomnia, and conversely, targeted insomnia treatment may ameliorate comorbid symptoms; in complex presentations, guidelines support treating insomnia concurrently with comorbid conditions rather than assuming insomnia will resolve once the comorbidity is controlled [^111VPHpY] [^115KFRQc] [^112kgeNX].

> But wait, what if the patient has Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease where standard CBT-I may be less feasible. In dementia, maintain daytime activity and sleep hygiene, avoid benzodiazepines and related hypnotics when possible due to fall and cognitive risks, and consider suvorexant, which has FDA labeling for insomnia in Alzheimer's disease; in Parkinson's disease, screen for RLS and treat it when present, as RLS commonly worsens sleep in this population [^115rwrQw] [^112Mxcu3] [^111fSewU].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up so I don't miss deterioration or adverse effects. Track sleep diaries, ISI scores, daytime function, and adverse effects at each visit; if hypnotics are prescribed, reassess within 1 to 2 weeks for efficacy and harms, and implement deprescribing plans early; for patients on BZRAs chronically, use slow, structured tapers with behavioral support to improve discontinuation success and reduce withdrawal or rebound insomnia [^116beeU3] [^112pGi9m] [^114ik92u].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical clinical algorithm to ensure nothing critical is missing. Screen routinely, confirm diagnosis with history and tools, initiate CBT-I as first-line, layer exercise or light therapy when indicated, treat comorbidities concurrently, reserve pharmacotherapy for refractory cases with explicit time limits and deprescribing plans, and avoid benzodiazepines in older adults whenever possible. This sequence aligns with major guidelines and balances efficacy with geriatric safety [^116NEnff] [^115G4aEM] [^113Xs6Gk].

> Finally, I should double-check the key controversies and correct any overstatements. I initially implied Z-drugs could be used "short-term" broadly, but given the lack of long-term randomized safety data and consistent observational signals for falls and fractures, many experts favor avoiding Z-drugs in older adults or restricting them to exceptional, ultra-short bridging scenarios with close monitoring; similarly, while some European guidance allows intermittent BZRA use in selected patients, North American geriatric guidance emphasizes avoidance and deprescribing, so shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit discussions are essential [^116oSMfN] [^113NgeWU] [^111zCC1X] [^1124NSMU].

Insomnia in the elderly is common and often multifactorial, driven by medical, psychiatric, and pharmacologic contributors [^1113SJSU]. Evaluation should include a **focused sleep history**, medication review, and screening for comorbidities; **polysomnography is reserved** for suspected sleep apnea or movement disorders [^114kYjvs]. CBT-I is **first-line therapy** [^116NEnff] because it is safe and durable [^117CfHiJ]; pharmacologic options (prolonged-release melatonin, dual orexin receptor antagonists, or low-dose trazodone) may be added cautiously if needed [^116UfSZv] [^116CYwJZ]. Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs should generally be avoided due to falls, cognitive effects, and dependence [^111zCC1X] [^116oSMfN]; if used, they should be short-term with close monitoring [^1124NSMU]. Management should be individualized, with regular reassessment and deprescribing when possible [^112pGi9m].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

Prevalence rises with age, affecting **30–48% of older adults**, with chronic insomnia in 12–20% [^111VPHpY] [^117CfHiJ]. Consequences include **increased risks of falls, cognitive decline, depression, and reduced quality of life** [^1113SJSU] [^112RV5Gc].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Insomnia in the elderly is **multifactorial**; common contributors include:

- **Medical conditions**: chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, endocrine disorders, neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson's, Alzheimer's) [^111VPHpY] [^111fSewU].
- **Psychiatric disorders**: depression, anxiety, grief, stress [^111VPHpY] [^116J4Qxd].
- **Medications**: benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, corticosteroids, beta-blockers, diuretics [^117JeF1p] [^113zA3XN].
- **Lifestyle factors**: irregular sleep schedules, excessive daytime napping, caffeine/alcohol use, inactivity [^111VPHpY] [^112MKD9n].
- **Environmental factors**: noise, light, temperature, caregiving responsibilities [^111VPHpY] [^113pUoNH].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **comprehensive evaluation** should include:

- **Sleep history**: onset, maintenance, early awakening, daytime symptoms, sleep hygiene, and environmental factors [^116beeU3] [^111VPHpY].
- **Medical and psychiatric history**: comorbidities, medications, substance use [^111VPHpY] [^1113SJSU].
- **Physical examination**: identify medical contributors [^112uXHyU] [^114kYjvs].
- **Sleep diary/actigraphy**: quantify sleep patterns and identify behaviors [^114kYjvs] [^117H5CGa].
- **Polysomnography**: reserved for suspected sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, or REM behavior disorder [^114kYjvs].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological treatments are **first-line** because they are safe and effective:

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)**: gold standard; improves sleep onset, maintenance, and daytime function [^116NEnff] [^111ijSmS].
- **Sleep hygiene education**: regular schedule, avoid caffeine/alcohol, optimize bedroom environment [^113pUoNH].
- **Stimulus control and sleep restriction**: reduce time in bed, strengthen bed-sleep association [^117H5CGa] [^111ijSmS].
- **Relaxation techniques**: mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation [^notfound].
- **Exercise**: regular moderate aerobic activity improves sleep quality [^115X5o3K] [^116tw5ZV].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacotherapy should be **reserved for refractory cases** or when non-pharmacological treatments are unavailable or ineffective:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Melatonin receptor agonists | Prolonged-release melatonin | Sleep onset/maintenance | Safe, modest efficacy; preferred in elderly [^116UfSZv] [^112Pw3DQ] |
| Dual orexin receptor antagonists | Suvorexant, lemborexant, daridorexant | Sleep onset/maintenance | Effective, favorable safety; monitor for next-day somnolence [^116CYwJZ] |
| Antidepressants | Trazodone, mirtazapine | Comorbid depression/anxiety | Sedating; monitor orthostasis, falls [^notfound] |
| Benzodiazepines | Temazepam, lorazepam | Short-term use only | Avoid long-term; risk of falls, cognitive impairment, dependence [^111zCC1X] [^1124NSMU] |
| Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics | Zolpidem, eszopiclone | Short-term use only | Increased falls, cognitive effects; use lowest dose, short-term [^116oSMfN] [^1136knSb] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Polypharmacy**: review and deprescribe sedating medications when possible [^1136knSb] [^112pGi9m].
- **Cognitive impairment**: tailor interventions, consider caregiver involvement [^114kYjvs].
- **Falls risk**: prioritize non-pharmacological treatments, avoid sedatives [^111zCC1X] [^116oSMfN].
- **Comorbidities**: treat underlying medical/psychiatric conditions concurrently [^115KFRQc] [^112ijTwy].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular reassessment should track sleep quality, daytime function, and adverse effects [^113nb2o3] [^111eH173]. For pharmacologic therapy, **limit duration to the shortest effective period** and taper to discontinue when possible [^113Xs6Gk] [^112pGi9m]. Patient education should reinforce adherence to non-pharmacological strategies and highlight risks of sedative medications [^112ijTwy] [^115gJVR7].

---

Insomnia in the elderly is common and consequential; **CBT-I is first-line**, with pharmacotherapy reserved for select cases. Management should be individualized, with regular reassessment and deprescribing to minimize risks.

### Pain coping strategies for tension-type headache: possible implications for insomnia? [^117X3xA4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for tension-type headache, although the pathogenesis of sleep disturbance in this population is unclear. The present study examined pain-related self-management strategies in a nonclinical, young-adult sample for preliminary evidence to support a novel hypothesis for the development of insomnia in this population.

Methods

Self-report data on triggers of headache, pain interference with sleep, and pain-related self-management strategies were analyzed for 32 women with tension-type headache and 33 women with minimal pain who served as controls.

Results

The results revealed that a significantly greater proportion of the headache group relative to the control group reported sleep problems as a trigger of headaches, stress as a trigger of headache, and going to sleep as a coping strategy for pain. The headache group also reported significantly higher ratings of pain interference with sleep. Going to sleep was the most commonly used self-management strategy (81%) by headache sufferers and also rated as the most effective strategy (5.5 out of 7.0).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that a bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbance and headache is present in this young-adult sample. Furthermore, the frequent use of sleep as a self-management strategy for pain is consistent with the hypothesis that sleep-seeking behavior might be a mediating factor in the development of insomnia among people with tension-type headache. This hypothesis fits within the most widely accepted conceptual model of chronic insomnia and should be further investigated in individuals with both tension-type headache and insomnia.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of sleep disorders in older persons [^1113SJSU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Sleep-related disorders are most prevalent in the older adult population. A high prevalence of medical and psychosocial comorbidities and the frequent use of multiple medications, rather than aging per se, are major reasons for this. A major concern, often underappreciated and underaddressed by clinicians, is the strong bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and serious medical problems in older adults. Hypertension, depression, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are examples of diseases that are more likely to develop in individuals with sleep disorders. Conversely, individuals with any of these diseases are at a higher risk of developing sleep disorders. The goals of this article are to help guide clinicians in their general understanding of sleep problems in older persons, examine specific sleep disorders that occur in older persons, and suggest evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the assessment and treatment of sleep disorders in older persons. No such recommendations are available to help clinicians in their daily patient care practices. The four sections in the beginning of the article are titled, Background and Significance, General Review of Sleep, Recommendations Development, and General Approach to Detecting Sleep Disorders in an Ambulatory Setting. These are followed by overviews of specific sleep disorders: Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, Restless Legs Syndrome, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders, Parasomnias, Hypersomnias, and Sleep Disorders in Long-Term Care Settings. Evidence- and expert- based recommendations, developed by a group of sleep and clinical experts, are presented after each sleep disorder.

### Non-pharmacological management of primary and secondary insomnia among older people: review of assessment tools and treatments [^117H5CGa]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Background

primary and secondary insomnia, especially among older adults, is frequently encountered by family physicians. Pharmacological interventions, although effective in some circumstances, can be detrimental in others. Non-pharmacological management of insomnia may allow the patients to self-administer the treatment.

Objectives

review of published literature of assessment tools and treatments for primary and secondary insomnia.

Results

two frequently used self-reporting methods for obtaining sleep data are sleep diaries and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. A large amount of research supports the use of non-pharmacological treatments such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, multi-component therapy and paradoxical intention.

Conclusion

assessing the nature of insomnia by using an effective assessment tool and providing patients with a non-pharmacological treatment should be the first intervention for insomnia. It is shown that non-pharmacological treatments for primary and secondary insomnia are feasible and effective alternatives to the use of benzodiazepines, and that family physicians should consider these when managing older patients with insomnia.

### Insomnia [^117CfHiJ]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Insomnia is highly prevalent in clinical practice, occurring in up to 50% of primary care patients. Insomnia can present independently or alongside other medical conditions or mental health disorders and is a risk factor for the development and exacerbation of these other disorders if not treated. In 2016, the American College of Physicians recommended that insomnia be specifically targeted for treatment. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, whether the underlying cause has been identified or not, is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Currently, there is no global consensus regarding which pharmacological treatment has the best efficacy or risk-benefit ratio. Both CBT-I and pharmacological intervention are thought to have similar acute effects, but only CBT-I has shown durable long-term effects after treatment discontinuation. Administering a combined treatment of CBT-I and medication could decrease the latency to treatment response, but might diminish the durability of the positive treatment effects of CBT-I.

### Considerations for integrated cognitive behavioural treatment for older adults with coexisting nocturia and insomnia [^111ksaJU]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Nocturia and chronic insomnia disorder are common conditions that frequently coexist in older adults. Existing medication treatments for each condition have risks, particularly in older adults. While treatment guidelines recommend starting with behavioural therapy for each condition, no existing program simultaneously addresses nocturia and insomnia. Existing behavioural interventions for nocturia or insomnia contain concordant and discordant components. An expert panel (including geriatricians with sleep or nocturia research expertise, sleep psychologists and a behavioural psychologist) was convened to combine and reconcile elements of behavioural treatment for each condition. Concordant treatment recommendations involve using situational self-management strategies such as urge suppression or techniques to influence homeostatic drive for sleep. Fluid modification such as avoiding alcohol and evening caffeine and regular self-monitoring through a daily diary is also appropriate for both conditions. The expert panel resolved discordant recommendations by eliminating overnight completion of voiding diaries (which can interfere with sleep) and discouraging routine overnight voiding (a stimulus control strategy). The final product is an integrated cognitive behavioural treatment that is delivered by advanced practice providers weekly over 5 weeks. This integrated program addresses the common scenario of coexisting nocturia and chronic insomnia disorder.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^113nb2o3]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the methods developed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO and can be accessed under the registration number CRD42020156349.

Study inclusion criteria

Types of studies

Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies and observational studies reporting on the safety and efficacy of the use of Benzodiazepine-like medication (BDLM) in the treatment of insomnia in older adults were included. We excluded abstracts, editorials, opinion papers, case reports, case series, narrative reviews, letters, qualitative studies and dose-response studies.

Types of participants

The population was defined as patients aged 65 or older with the indication for the prescription of BDLM. This age-threshold was chosen due to it being in standard use as it reflects retirement age in some developed countries. The inclusion criteria were:

For systematic reviews and meta-analyses:
overall mean age − 1.2 SD ≥ 65 years; or
overall mean age < 65 with subgroup analysis of participants with mean age − 1.2 SD ≥ 65 years; or
overall mean age not reported but included studies accepting only participants ≥ 65 years

For individual controlled interventional and observational studies:
mean age − 1.2 SD ≥ 65 years; or
mean age < 65 with subgroup analysis of participants with mean age − 1.2 SD ≥ 65 years; or
mean age not reported but all participants ≥ 65 years

Types of interventions

Studies reporting on the efficacy and/or safety of BDLM in all doses and formulations for the treatment of insomnia were included. Control was either no therapy, placebo, standard therapy, or other pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions.

Types of outcomes

Outcomes included were quality of life, hospitalizations, mortality, falls, fractures, and severe organ failures.

Further outcomes that reflect the reduction of symptoms of insomnia and improvement in daytime function were included such as:
Sleep latency
Total sleep time
Wake time after sleep onset
Sleep quality
Daily function
Adverse events data

Setting

All settings were included.

Language

No language restrictions were included in the study searches.

### Non-pharmacological approaches for management of insomnia [^111MUYHN]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem associated with a constellation of negative health-related outcomes and significant socioeconomic burden. It commonly co-occurs with psychiatric and medical conditions, which may further exacerbate these comorbid conditions and hinder treatment response. There is much empirical evidence to support the clinical efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), in managing insomnia in a wide range of populations. This article reviews the research on the efficacy of CBT-I for primary insomnia and insomnia comorbid with other psychiatric and medical conditions, the empirical evidence regarding different CBT-I treatment modalities, the implementation of CBT-I across different age groups, and some initial evidence on the sequential combination of insomnia treatments. A brief overview of other non-pharmacological treatment with regard to complementary alternative medicine is also provided.

### Burden of insomnia and sleep disturbances and the impact of sleep treatments in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease: a structured literature review [^112Mxcu3]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by continuing cognitive decline and memory loss; it accounts for 60% to 80% of dementia cases in adults > 65 years of age. With an aging global population, the AD population is expected to triple over the next 40 years, to over 13 million cases.

AD is associated with significant healthcare costs and resource utilization, particularly when patients require admission to care facilities. The behavioral symptoms of dementia, including disturbed sleep, nighttime awakenings and wanderings place a substantial burden on family and caregivers, and lead to the early institutionalization of AD patients.

Insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep among individuals with adequate opportunity to sleep and is associated with daytime consequences, such as an inability to perform daily activities. Insomnia symptoms and sleep disturbances (collectively referred to in this manuscript as sleep problems) increase with age and are common in AD patients, with a prevalence of > 50%. AD patients also experience more severe symptoms of insomnia and sleep disturbances, such as increased sleep latency and reduced sleep maintenance, as well as progressive deterioration and instability of circadian rhythms, compared to older adults without AD. Moreover, insomnia is also a risk factor for AD, and a bidirectional relationship is thought to exist between poor sleep and AD pathology.

Despite the high prevalence and substantial disease burden of insomnia in AD patients, including negative impacts of insomnia symptoms on mental and physical health, quality of life (QoL), and functional ability, treatment options for this patient population are limited. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are associated with an increased risk of falls, fractures, and clinically significant impairments in balance and cognition upon awakening. The American Geriatrics Society strongly recommends against the use of benzodiazepines and related non-benzodiazepines in elderly patients. Moreover, current non-pharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) may not be effective as AD patients may be unwilling or unable to participate in therapy. Due to the limitations of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for the management of insomnia in AD patients there is a significant unmet need. Currently, one medication (suvorexant) has been specifically approved for the treatment of insomnia in AD patients by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This literature review aims to summarize the clinical, economic, and QoL impact of insomnia and sleep disturbances on patients and their caregivers, as well as the abilities of currently available therapies to treat sleep problems and reduce their impacts in this population.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, CGS 2020 guidelines recommend to avoid long-term use of BZRAs (> 4 weeks) in older adults, as these agents increase the risk of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and motor vehicle crashes. Offer alternative management strategies for insomnia, anxiety disorders, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

### Diagnosing and treating insomnia in adults and older adults [^112wqjVm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep-wake disorder, affects 6% to 10% of adults. It may result in interpersonal and occupational problems and has a deleterious effect on quality of life. Patients may experience difficulty with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, or both. Insomnia disorder is commonly comorbid with psychiatric, medical, and neurologic disorders, and insomnia and comorbid conditions have bidirectional relationships. Diagnosis should be based on patient interview, assessment with tools, and use of criteria. Selection of treatment for patients with insomnia should factor in efficacy for the patient's specific complaint as well as other features such as safety profile and abuse liability. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is a first-line recommendation by guidelines, but some patients are unable or unwilling to try it or may not respond to it. Older adults with insomnia disorder require careful consideration of medications' risk-benefit profiles.

### Challenges in managing insomnia in older people [^116tS9bc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Older people often experience insomnia, whether it is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. These sleep disturbances have a negative impact on quality of life and functioning. This report offers general considerations as well as specific data related to managing insomnia in older adults, including a brief review of treatment options with an emphasis on their tolerability profiles.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological therapies for sleep problems in later life [^114gM4hC]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Sleep problems become more common with age, affect quality of life for individuals and their families, and can increase healthcare costs. Older people are often prescribed a range of drugs for their health problems, many of which have side effects. Side effects are just one reason why there is an argument to be made for clinical use of non-pharmacological treatments. This review considers the effectiveness of three interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), bright light, and physical exercise. It considers sleep quality, duration and efficiency as primary outcome measures. Randomised controlled trials were selected where 80% or more of participants were over 60 and had a diagnosis of primary insomnia and where investigators had taken care to screen participants for dementia and/or depression. The data suggest a mild effect of CBT for sleep problems in older adults, best demonstrated for sleep maintenance insomnia. It may be that the provisions of 'top-up' or 'refresher' sessions of CBT training to improve durability of effect are worthy of investigation. Evidence of the efficacy of bright light and exercise were so limited that no conclusions about them can be reached as yet; however, in view of the promising results of bright light therapy in other populations with problems of sleep timing, further research into its effectiveness with older adults would seem justifiable. Exercise, though not appropriate for all in this population, may enhance sleep. Research involving exercise programmes designed with the elderly in mind is needed.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111gXhCp]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Long COVID is a complex condition characterized by more than 200 documented symptomsthat persist or develop following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multisystemic disease affects various bodily functions and causes significant neurological and psychological distress. According to the World Health Organization, 10–20% of COVID-19 patients go on to develop long COVID. With over 65 million cases reported worldwide as of 2023, long COVID presents challenges across all demographics, with particular prevalence in females and adults aged 18 years and older, regardless of the initial infection's severity.

Long COVID has many definitions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients with long COVID experience a "range of ongoing symptoms and conditions" lasting at least 3 months postinfection. The National Center for Infectious Diseases describes it as a group of symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients that "persist or emerge four weeks after the initial infection". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence further defines long COVID as symptoms developing during or after infection that prolong for "more than 12 weeks" and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Additionally, the World Health Organization characterizes long COVID as the persistence or emergence of new symptoms 3 months after initial infection, lasting at least 2 months without any other explanation.

Among the neurological and psychological symptoms reported, sleep disturbances are particularly prevalent. Sleep disturbances encompass disorders that disrupt normal sleep patterns, classified in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition into 6 major categories: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnolence and narcolepsy, circadian rhythm disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders. Studies on long COVID–associated sleep disturbances have identified common issues such as insomnia, frequent awakenings, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Chinvararak and Chalderfound that about 46% of patients with long COVID experienced sleep disturbances, with insomnia affecting 38%. Similarly, Seighali et al'smeta-analysis reported a 45% prevalence of sleep disorders among 15,362 patients. If not adequately managed, these disturbances can impair physical, psychological and social health, increase anxietyand dyspnoea, and significantly reduce quality of life.

GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) evidence to recommendation framework — balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to "the relative magnitudes or tradeoffs of anticipated benefits… and harms", and options include "benefits outweigh harms/burdens, benefits slightly outweigh harms/burdens, benefits and harms/burdens are balanced, harms/burdens slightly outweigh benefits, and harms/burdens outweigh benefits"; this domain states "most providers will offer patients an intervention if its advantages exceed the harms". Patient values and preferences are defined as "patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life" as they apply to benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience, with options "similar values, some variation, and large variation"; when values seem homogeneous, this domain "might increase the recommendation's strength", whereas when heterogeneous it "might decrease a recommendation's strength", and "the Work Group considered the findings from the Patient Focus Group". Other implications include "potential consequences or other impacts that might affect the strength or direction of the recommendation", with options such as "resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, and subgroup considerations", and examples where populations may be "geographically remote… (e.g., complex radiological equipment)" or "a drug might be contraindicated in a subgroup of patients". The table lists the decision domain "Confidence in the quality of the evidence" with questions "Among the designated critical outcomes, what is the lowest quality of relevant evidence?" and "How likely is further research to change the confidence in the estimate of effect?" and judgments "High", "Moderate", "Low", and "Very Low".

### Insomnia (primary) in older people: non-drug treatments [^113DsqLR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 40% of older adults have insomnia, with difficulty getting to sleep, early waking, or feeling unrefreshed on waking. The prevalence of insomnia increases with age. Other risk factors include psychological factors, stress, daytime napping, and hyperarousal.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of non-drug treatments for primary insomnia in older people (aged 60 years and older)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), exercise programmes, and timed exposure to bright light.

### Psychiatric aspects of late-life insomnia [^116J4Qxd]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiological trends towards a 'graying' population make the issue of insomnia in the elderly an increasingly important research and clinical topic. It is often challenging to determine how much of a psychiatric dimension there is to a clinical condition that is best viewed as both as a symptom and a true psychosomatic entity in its own right. To categorize insomnia as either psychiatric or medically based risks oversimplification of the complexities of sleep disruption in the elderly. Normal senescence-related changes in sleep architecture and circadian rhythms must be considered, as well as the frequent medical comorbidities that may affect sleep. Psychiatric diagnoses to consider include mood and anxiety disorders, which may be affected equally by physiological and psychological changes implicit in old age. Sleep disruption related to dementia is of particular interest to clinicians involved with patients in long-term care facilities. Insomnia may occasionally be iatrogenically induced or exacerbated, and particularly antidepressants must be carefully selected for this reason. Light therapy and behavior therapies are important in multimodal treatment of insomnia, and sleep hygiene includes both regular physical and social activities to preserve entrainment of circadian rhythms affecting sleep.

### Diagnosis and management of insomnia in older people [^116beeU3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common but underrecognized problem in elderly patients. Five basic steps can help clinicians identify and treat insomnia. The first step is to ask a single question about sleep at every new patient visit, which goes a long way toward detection of patients with insomnia. The second step is to perform an initial evaluation of the problem, including symptoms, contributing factors, and effects on daytime function. Step three is to determine whether the patient is in crisis. True sleep emergencies are rare, and in most cases, treatment can be delayed until another appointment can be made for a full evaluation of the problem. A sleep evaluation constitutes the fourth step and focuses mainly on a thorough sleep history; blood tests and polysomnography rarely have a role. The final step is intervention. Nonpharmacological strategies are a mainstay of treatment for chronic insomnia, but hypnotics have a role in treating transient insomnia and chronic insomnia that does not improve with nonpharmacological treatment or treatment of associated primary conditions. Pharmacological therapy usually consists of benzodiazepines with short half-lives or nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zaleplon, although lack of demonstrated efficacy against sleep maintenance difficulties, one of the primary symptoms of insomnia among older people, limits use of these agents. Emerging nonbenzodiazepine agents such as indiplon and eszopiclone may specifically address sleep maintenance problems in elderly patients and are pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. (Editor's note: Since preparation of this manuscript, the FDA has approved eszopiclone for treatment of insomnia.).

### Special considerations in insomnia diagnosis and management: depressed, elderly, and chronic pain populations [^115V3mzT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with insomnia who also have chronic pain or depression or who are elderly represent segments of the population that are particularly difficult to treat. These populations tend to be at higher risk for experiencing difficulty sleeping and are more likely to experience chronic insomnia, sleep maintenance problems, and/or nonrestorative sleep. Worsening insomnia may exacerbate other somatic and psychological symptoms and vice versa. Conversely, there is evidence that appropriate recognition and management of the sleep complaint may alleviate other symptoms related to the associated condition and help interrupt this vicious cycle.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^116oSMfN]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Z-drugs are usually prescribed as first line pharmacological therapy for insomnia. However, the benefits and risks of Z-drugs may differ for older adults. This systematic review investigated the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of Z-drugs in the management of insomnia in older adults.

Methods

The Cochrane database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional and observational studies using a pre-formulated search term. The target population was older adults (≥ 65 years old) with insomnia. Studies were included if they reported efficacy and/or safety outcomes of the use of Z-drugs for the management of insomnia compared to placebo, usual or no treatment, or other pharmacological agents.

Results

Eighteen studies were included (8 interventional and 10 observational studies). In short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs were similarly or better efficacious in improving both sleep and daytime parameters than placebo or other pharmacological treatments, while showing good results on measures of safety. However, in longer-term observational studies, Z-drugs significantly increased the risk for falls and fractures in comparison to no treatment or melatonin agonists.

Conclusions

Analyzing the evidence from short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs appear effective and safe for treatment of insomnia in older adults, but they may have unfavorable side effects when used for longer periods of time. We, therefore, recommend discontinuing Z-drugs, principally because of the high risk for falls and fractures. Nonetheless, quality and quantity of evidence are low. Due to the scarcity of data, especially concerning drug dependence after longer periods of treatment and due to the significantly increased risk for falls and fractures, further studies are needed to evaluate the benefit-risk profile of Z-drugs use in older patients, particularly for long-term use.

### British Association for Psychopharmacology consensus statement on evidence-based treatment of insomnia, parasomnias and circadian rhythm disorders [^115yJNBM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in the general population and even more so in clinical practice, yet are relatively poorly understood by doctors and other health care practitioners. These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines are designed to address this problem by providing an accessible up-to-date and evidence-based outline of the major issues, especially those relating to reliable diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A consensus meeting was held in London in May 2009. Those invited to attend included BAP members, representative clinicians with a strong interest in sleep disorders and recognized experts and advocates in the field, including a representative from mainland Europe and the USA. Presenters were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aimed to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was then circulated to all participants for comment. Key subsequent publications were added by the writer and speakers at draft stage. All comments were incorporated as far as possible in the final document, which represents the views of all participants although the authors take final responsibility for the document.

### Nonpharmacologic strategies in the management of insomnia [^112XqBSE]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Many psychiatric patients have significant sleep disturbance. Insomnia should be addressed directly even when comorbid with a psychiatric disorder. Nonpharmacologic treatments are effective and especially well suited for long-term management of sleep problems. Although the techniques themselves are fairly straightforward, they work best when applied with the kind of clinical insight and experience that psychiatrists regularly draw on in their practices. This article briefly reviews the evaluation of insomnia, with the aim of eliciting clinical material sufficiently comprehensive to inform the choice of treatment, and provides a practical overview of the basic nondrug approaches to insomnia, emphasizing what the clinician and the patient may expect from their application.

### Management of insomnia in the geriatric patient [^114kYjvs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Insomnia in older individuals is common and often undiagnosed, and can lead to significant patient morbidity. A stepwise, thorough history and physical examination, including interviews with the bed partner and use of a sleep diary, are valuable diagnostic adjuncts. Polysomnography should be reserved for patients whose history suggests specific sleep-related breathing or movement disorders of breathing. Contributing physical or psychiatric conditions require treatment as in other geriatric patients. Improved sleep hygiene will often provide symptom relief in mild to moderate insomnia, whereas a number of non-drug treatments can be tried for more refractory cases. Most prescription and over-the-counter medications carry significant risk of adverse events and drug interactions; others demonstrate an acceptable risk to benefit profile and are preferred in older patients.

### Sleep difficulties and cognition for 10 years in a national sample of U.S. older adults [^112RV5Gc]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications and Future Research

Several consensus statements call for increased attention to nature and methods for attenuating sleep difficulties among older adults, including a National Institutes of Health consensus statement, which recently addressed the diagnosis, risks, consequences, and treatment of chronic insomnia among adults. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has published practice guidelines for evaluating and managing sleep difficulties. The current study examined sleep difficulties and cognitive function among older adults, with the aim of informing policies and programs for improving the key aspects of sleep associated with cognitive function and the ultimate aim of improving cognitive function among older adults. Research using data from the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly suggests that treating sleep difficulty among older adults may be a promising approach for decelerating the rate of cognitive decline.

Our results also identify a number of opportunities for future research. For instance, research to better identify the causal pathway between sleep difficulty and the onset and development of AD and related dementia is one opportunity for future research. Future research may also consider how to design programs to attenuate sleep difficulty among older adults. For instance, evidence-based programs such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia may be tailored to the needs of older adults.

### Manipulating the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms to improve clinical management of major depression [^115UbGZt]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Therapeutic approaches focused on correction of sleep-wake and circadian disturbance in major depression

While there is a long tradition of studies examining the effects of sleep-wake or circadian interventions in persons with major mood disorders (see Table 3), they do not figure prominently in major therapeutic guidelines for these common conditions. By comparison with the size of large pharmaceutical trials focusing on modification of monoamine systems, and similarly psychological therapy trials focusing on cognitive, interpersonal and related behavioral factors, the evidence-base for sleep-wake and circadian interventions is only modest. Consequently, in major depression guidelines sleep and circadian-relevant interventions are referred to only as a general management strategy (for example, enhancing 'sleep hygiene' or promoting physical activity) or sleep and circadian related phenomena are viewed as possible presentations of alternative primary medical diagnosis (for example, sleep apnea).

Table 3
Therapeutic approaches for sleep and circadian disruptions in association with major depression

As most treatment guidelines (based on DSM-IV or International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10) utilize a simple severity model (that is, mild/moderate/severe), for the clinical management of major depression it is not surprising that an approach focusing on a putative sleep-wake cycle or circadian pathophysiology is not central to treatment selection for people with major depressive disorders. Another difficulty is that relevant information is distributed across a broader literature notably in relation to bipolar disorder, primary insomnia, other primary sleep disorders, chronic fatigue, geriatric medicine and other areas of general medicine. One of the more attractive features of the various sleep and circadian-based antidepressant approaches (behavioral or pharmacological) available appears to be the relatively rapid onset of action. Given the much slower onset of action of conventional psychological or monoamine-based treatments, it is very surprising that this relative benefit is underemphasized in clinical practice.

### Psychological and behavioral interventions for managing insomnia disorder: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^111ijSmS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Psychological and behavioral interventions are frequently used for insomnia disorder.

Purpose

To assess benefits and harms of psychological and behavioral interventions for insomnia disorder in adults.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO through September 2015, supplemented with hand-searching.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of psychological or behavioral interventions that were published in English and enrolled adults with insomnia disorder lasting 4 or more weeks.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Sixty trials with low to moderate risk of bias compared psychological and behavioral interventions with inactive controls or other psychological and behavioral interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved posttreatment global and most sleep outcomes, often compared with information or waitlist controls (moderate-strength evidence). Use of CBT-I improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Multicomponent behavioral therapy improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Stimulus control improved 1 or 2 sleep outcomes (low-strength evidence). Evidence for other comparisons and for harms was insufficient to permit conclusions.

Limitations

A wide variety of comparisons limited the ability to pool data. Trials did not always report global outcomes and infrequently conducted remitter or responder analysis. Comparisons were often information or waitlist groups, and publication bias was possible.

Conclusion

Use of CBT-I improves most outcomes compared with inactive controls. Multicomponent behavioral therapy and stimulus control may improve some sleep outcomes. Evidence on other outcomes, comparisons, and long-term efficacy were limited.

### Evaluation and management of insomnia in the clinical practice in Italy: a 2023 update from the insomnia expert consensus group [^116CYwJZ]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Insomnia is the most reported sleep disorder in industrialized countries, affecting, in the chronic form, around 10% of the European population. In Italy, such a percentage seems to be even higher. Although insomnia can be an independent disorder, it is frequently described as comorbid condition and may precipitate, exacerbate, or prolong a broad range of physical and mental disorders. Evaluating and targeting insomnia in the Italian clinical practice should be a priority.

Methods

The present expert opinions and recommendations represent an update from 2020 and insights from Insomnia Expert Consensus Group, based on systematic reviews according to PRISMA on available options in Italy from January 2020 to March 2023.

Results

We evaluated 28 papers among international guidelines, expert opinions, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis produced during the last 26 months.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that symptoms of insomnia must be assessed in the Italian clinical practice by evaluating nocturnal and daytime symptoms, comorbid conditions, and lifestyle. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia should be the first option according to availability. The choice of the drug should be based on different factors including type of insomnia, age, comorbidities, and potential side effects. If the choice would be a Z-drug or a short-acting benzodiazepine (in subjects < 65 years old), the use should be in the short term (≤ 4 weeks). Indeed, eszopiclone, as a new option in Italy, may present a different profile and may be used for up to 6 months, also in the elderly. If the choice is melatonin, it should be used melatonin 2 mg prolonged release in adults ≥ 55 years for up to 13 weeks. A new dual orexin antagonist, daridorexant, is available in Italy; it has been shown to be effective in adults and elderly and it can be used for at least 3 months and up to 1 year.

### Recent developments in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia [^1172wVpr]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Sleep/wake complaints, and specifically insomnia, are some of the more common problems encountered in the outpatient setting. Despite its prevalence, few clinicians are experts at diagnosing and treating this entity. Additionally, diagnosis and treatment of insomnia is a time-intensive process (often the initial interview takes at least 1 h, depending on the complexity of the insomnia). With a conservative estimate of the annual cost of insomnia between dollar 92.5 and dollar 107.5 billion dollars, it is becoming clear that insomnia has significant medical and public health implications. A problem that has hampered insomnia research is the lack of a standard definition of insomnia for use in research, as well as guidelines for assessment. In recent years, there have been important advances in the classification, evaluation, and treatment of insomnia with efforts to establish greater consensus in how to define and measure insomnia. Cognitive behavioral and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to be effective treatment approaches. Insomnia is a complex entity, often multifactorial in its etiology; and as research and clinical guidelines are established and validated (leading to better data interpretation), continued enhancement of our understanding of this disorder is expected.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116jL6Yv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — evidence grading and meta-analysis constraints states that quality of evidence grades for randomized clinical trials begin at HIGH and are downgraded progressively for heterogeneity, imprecision, and/or potential publication bias; since the vast majority of studies in this field are industry sponsored, the quality of evidence for nearly all of these studies is, therefore, reduced from HIGH to MODERATE, and when heterogeneity and imprecision are accounted for, the quality of evidence for many treatments considered is LOW or VERY LOW. Meta-analysis requires specific data (numerical data for a given outcome, presented as mean and standard deviation), many studies do not report data in the required format, resulting in exclusion of substantial amounts of data from the formal meta-analyses, and while these studies are discussed and considered in formulation of recommendations, the inability to include such data in meta-analysis represents a distinct limitation.

### Insomnia in the elderly: a review [^112uXHyU]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia remains one of the most common sleep disorders encountered in the geriatric clinic population, frequently characterized by the subjective complaint of difficulty falling or maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, producing significant daytime symptoms including difficulty concentrating and mood disturbances.

Methods

A search of the literature was conducted to review the epidemiology, definition, and age-related changes in sleep, as well as factors contributing to late-life insomnia and scales utilized for the assessment of insomnia in older people. The aim is to summarize recent diagnostic guidelines and both nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies for the management of insomnia in the older population.

Results

Insomnia remains a clinical diagnosis. There are several demographic, psychosocial, biologic, and behavioral factors that can contribute to late-life insomnia. Older adults are at higher risk for the medical and psychiatric effects of insomnia.

Conclusions

The most important aspect in evaluation of insomnia is detailed history taking and thorough physical examination. Nonpharmacological treatment options have favorable and enduring benefits compared to pharmacological therapy.

### Insomnia disorder: clinical and research challenges for the 21st century [^111q5Jdx]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Insomnia is a common and debilitating disorder that is frequently associated with important consequences for physical health and well-being.

Methods

An international expert group considered the current state of knowledge based on the most relevant publications in the previous 5 years, discussed the current challenges in the field of insomnia and identified future priorities.

Results

The association of trajectories of insomnia with subsequent quality of life, health and mortality should be investigated in large populations. Prospective health economics studies by separating the costs driven specifically by insomnia and costs attributable to its long-term effects are needed. Ignoring the heterogeneity of insomnia patients leads to inadequate diagnosis and inefficient treatment. Individualized interventions should be promoted. More data are needed on both the impact of sleep on overnight effects, such as emotion regulation, and the potential compensatory effort to counteract diurnal impairments. Another gap is the definition of neurocognitive deficits in insomnia patients compared to normal subjects after chronic sleep loss. There are also a number of key gaps related to insomnia treatment. Expert guidelines indicate cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia as first-line treatment. They neglect, however, the reality of major healthcare providers. The role of combined therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia plus pharmacological treatment, should be evaluated more extensively.

Conclusion

Whilst insomnia disorder might affect large proportions of the population, there are a number of significant gaps in the epidemiological/clinical/research studies carried out to date. In particular, the identification of different insomnia phenotypes could allow more cost-effective and efficient therapies.

### Physical exercise for sleep problems in adults aged 60 + [^115X5o3K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of sleep problems in adulthood increases with age. While not all sleep changes are pathological in later life, severe disturbances may lead to depression, cognitive impairments, deterioration of quality of life, significant stresses for carers and increased healthcare costs. The most common treatment for sleep disorders (particularly insomnia) is pharmacological. The efficacy of non-drug interventions has been suggested to be slower than pharmacological methods, but with no risk of drug-related tolerance or dependency. Physical exercise, taken regularly, may promote relaxation and raise core body temperature in ways that are beneficial to initiating and maintaining sleep.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of physical exercise amongst older adults (aged 60 and above).

Search Strategy

We searched: MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001); EMBASE (1980 - January 2002), CINAHL (1982 - January 2002; PsychINFO 1887 to 2002; The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2002); National Research Register (NRR [2002]). Bibliographies of existing reviews in the area, as well as of all trial reports obtained, were searched. Experts in the field were consulted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of physical exercise for primary insomnia where 80% or more of participants were over the age of 60. Participants must have been screened to exclude those with dementia and/or depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts of studies identified in searches of electronic databases were read and assessed to determine whether they might meet the inclusion criteria. Data were analysed separately depending on whether results had been obtained subjectively or objectively.

Main Results

One trial, including 43 participants with insomnia, examined the effectiveness of exercise in a population within an elderly population. At post-treatment, sleep onset latency improved slightly for both men and women. Total sleep duration, sleep onset latency and scores on a scale of global sleep quality showed significant improvement. Improvements in sleep efficiency were not significant. In some cases improvements indicated falls to below what are usually considered pathological levels but the wide confidence intervals and small sample size indicate that these findings must be interpreted with caution.

Reviewer's Conclusions

When the possible side-effects of standard treatment (hypnotics) are considered, there is an argument to be made for clinical use of alternative treatments in the elderly. Exercise, though not appropriate for all in this population, may enhance sleep and contribute to an increased quality of life. Research involving exercise programmes designed with the elderly in mind is needed.

### Pharmacotherapy for insomnia disorder in older adults [^111eH173]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Objectively measured improvement, in the absence of perceived improvement, is tantamount to no improvement. For example, consider chronic pain. Even if an objective measure of nociception existed, a treatment that changed this outcome without producing a diminution in the experience of self-reported pain intensity would likely be considered ineffective by the patient and the clinician. Ultimately, it is the patient's experience of pain and treatment-related diminution of pain that is paramount. The same is true for insomnia.

A possible ideal strategy for assessing insomnia outcomes would be to deploy both objective and subjective methods and to present such data side-by-side. This is especially important given that self-report is the basis of insomnia diagnosis, assessment of treatment progression, and determination of treatment outcome. Furthermore, patient preferences for perceivable treatment effects and reduced adverse effect profiles might ultimately determine which medications are most successful in real-world clinical applications.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol to establish how common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies should be used for managing insomnia [^112674CQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Insomnia, a highly prevalent clinical problem across the world, is frequently reported by patients and may be a significant sign of a number of sleep and medical illnesses. Indeed, epidemiological research has shown that the prevalence of insomnia among people of all ages is rising year on year. Insomnia places huge burdens on individuals, families, and society, but, despite this, insomnia has not received sufficient recognition nor management in clinical practice. An increasing number of clinical trials have reported that ASRTs guided by TCM theory are helpful for improving insomnia disorder and daytime functioning as well as being relatively cheap, convenient, available, and safe. ASRTs might represent a clinical treatment option that could be offered as a second-line treatment when first-line treatments are not viable or tolerated. In addition to acupuncture and acupressure, ASRTs have now evolved into numerous treatment techniques driven by clinical need, with acupoint selection varying from practitioner to practitioner. While several clinical common ASRTs for insomnia have been evaluated in previous systematic reviews, in the face of such a wide range of ASRTs, there is no conclusion on how ASRT clinicians should manage insomnia in clinical practice. To develop guidelines and further drive future clinical practice and research, a more thorough and comprehensive evaluation of all the existing literature is required. The clinically recognized acupoint stimulation techniques for the management of insomnia with or without comorbid physical or neuropsychiatric illnesses will be reviewed and assessed for efficacy and safety in this review. By doing this, we hope to provide answers to the issues of whether efficacy differs depending on the part of sleep being addressed as well as whether the effects vary depending on the precise acupoints used, the form of acupoint stimulation, or the type of insomnia present.

Up to 40% of adults have insomnia, with difficulty getting to sleep, early waking, or feeling unrefreshed on waking. The prevalence of insomnia increases with age. Other risk factors include psychological factors, stress, daytime napping, and hyperarousal.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug treatments for insomnia in elderly people? What are the effects of drug treatments for insomnia in elderly people? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: benzodiazepines (brotizolam, flurazepam, loprazolam, midazolam, nitrazepam, quazepam, temazepam, and triazolam), cognitive behavioural therapy, diphenhydramine, exercise programmes, timed exposure to bright light, zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone.

### Pharmacological management of insomnia [^113DtPb4]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition associated with significant morbidity, reduction in quality of life, and increase in healthcare costs, and is a risk factor for multiple physical and mental disorders. The primary treatment modality is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) but this is associated with difficulties with access and higher cost as well as poor response in some patients. Therefore, pharmacotherapy for insomnia is common and hypnotic agents are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the United States. Older medications for insomnia are limited by their side effect burden and narrow therapeutic window. Newer hypnotics, on the other hand, have been shown to have a better safety profile and longer term efficacy. While some studies have shown that long-term hypnotic use is associated with adverse outcomes, the current evidence is equivocal. The decision to treat chronic insomnia disorder with long-term hypnotics should be individualized and balance the potential risks of continuing hypnotic medication use with the risks of untreated persistent insomnia and associated functional limitations. This clinical review discusses the currently available medication options to treat insomnia, their mechanisms of action, dosing, and side effect profiles. This review also provides guidance on long-term management of hypnotics and the use of these medications in the elderly, those with medical comorbidities, and other special populations.

### The veterans administration and department of defense clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of sleep disorders: what does this mean for the practice of sleep medicine? [^114ieQxg]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

None

In 2017 the Veterans Administration (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) launched development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, with the goal of informing and improving patient care. The guideline development process followed GRADE methodology, considering studies and systematic reviews published over the 10-year period prior to guideline development. A total of 41 recommendations were made,18 related to the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 23 regarding chronic insomnia disorder. In contrast to other published guidelines, the VA DoD CPGs provide a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management of the two most common sleep disorders, including a discussion of the sequencing of diagnostic approaches and treatment options. Regarding OSA, strong recommendations were made for follow-up evaluation after non-diagnostic home sleep apnea tests, positive airway pressure therapy as first-line treatment, and the incorporation of supportive, educational and behavioral interventions for patients at high risk for PAP therapy non-adherence due to comorbid conditions. Strong recommendations were also made for the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia and against the use of kava (an herbal supplement) in the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder. These guidelines, while intended to directly inform care within VA and DOD, are broadly relevant to the practice of sleep medicine. The majority of scientific evidence was based on studies of non-military, non-veteran populations. The CPG is a major milestone for the VA and DOD in recognizing the importance of evidence-based treatments for sleep disorders in military personnel and veterans.

### Insomnia in the elderly: cause, approach, and treatment [^111LwR3Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent problem in late life. Sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is a subjective report of insufficient or nonrestorative sleep despite adequate opportunity to sleep. Despite the fact that more than 50% of elderly people have insomnia, it is typically undertreated, and nonpharmacologic interventions are underused by health care practitioners. This article will review the causes of insomnia in the elderly, the approach to patient evaluation, and the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of insomnia.

Strength of recommendations — GRADE assessment and evidence synthesis specify that the GRADE approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence, with the task force using objective data whenever possible (e.g., polysomnography) and designating objective data as the primary determinant of quality of evidence. Recommendation formulation balanced quality of evidence, benefits versus harms, and patient values and preferences. For quality judgments, criteria included imprecision (when 95% CI cross the clinical significance thresholds), inconsistency (I2 cutoff of 75%), indirectness (study population), and risk of publication bias (funding sources), and quality was based exclusively on studies included in meta-analyses. For meta-analyses, pooled results are expressed as the total number of patients, MD and 95% confidence interval (CI), with adverse events presented as risk difference.

International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3) — definition and prevalence of chronic insomnia indicate that "The disorder is identified as chronic when it has persisted for at least three months at a frequency of at least three times per week", and "When the disorder meets this frequency criteria but has persisted for less than three months, it is considered short-term insomnia". Epidemiology notes that "Occasional, short-term insomnia affects 30% to 50% of the population" and "The prevalence of chronic insomnia disorder in industrialized nations is estimated to be at least 5% to 10%".

### A compendium of placebo-controlled trials of the risks / benefits of pharmacological treatments for insomnia: the empirical basis for U.S. clinical practice [^115aZDBU]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

For many years practitioners have had limited data from double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to guide the types of decision-making needed to optimally manage patients with insomnia in clinical practice. However, in recent years there has been a great increase in insomnia research studies that address issues of clinical importance. This body of work represents an increasingly useful empirical basis for making clinical practice decisions. The purpose of this article is to compile the body of work on the pharmacological management of insomnia to make it available in as accessible form as possible for optimal application in clinical practice with the hopes that doing so will decrease the gap separating the available research and the clinical management of insomnia and, thereby, improve the care of the many individuals who suffer from this condition. The review of studies consists of the following sections: 1) basic pharmacology; 2) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with primary insomnia; 3) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with primary insomnia; 4) adverse effects reported in placebo-controlled trials in elderly primary insomnia patients; 5) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults and the elderly as a function of treatment duration; 6) double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of the treatment of comorbid insomnia. Issues related to the application of these data to clinical practice are discussed in the text.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114Usopc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — scope, methods, and strength definitions state that the purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated, and it includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition; a systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence, with recommendations and strengths assigned based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences, and literature reviews were provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations; under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow, and a WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, and this guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

### Sleep and its disorders in older adults [^113zA3XN]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

For many older adults, aging is associated with significant changes in sleep. There are a variety of potential causes, including primary sleep disorders, circadian rhythm disturbances, insomnia, depression, medical illness, and medications. As with younger adults, the diagnosis requires a thorough sleep history and an overnight sleep recording when appropriate. Treatment should address the primary sleep problem and can result in significant improvement in quality of life and daytime functioning in older adults.

### Primary insomnia in older persons… [^112exNR4]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Up to 40 percent of older adults have insomnia, with difficulty falling asleep, early awakening, or feeling tired on awakening. The prevalence of insomnia increases with age. Other risk factors include medical and psychiatric illnesses, psychological factors, stress, daytime napping, and hyperarousal. Primary insomnia is a chronic and relapsing condition that may increase the risk of accidents. Definition Insomnia is defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd ed., as repeated difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate time and opportunity for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impairment. Chronic insomnia is defined as insomnia occurring at least three nights a week for one month or longer.

Primary insomnia is defined as chronic insomnia without specific underlying medical, psychiatric, or other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, depression, dementia, periodic limb movement disorder, or circadian rhythm sleep disorder. This review covers only primary insomnia in older persons. For this review, we define older persons as those 60 years and older. Incidence and Prevalence One population survey in Sweden found that, across all adult age groups, up to 40 percent of individuals had insomnia. A U. S. survey of persons 18 to 79 years of age found that insomnia affected 35 percent of all adults during the course of one year, and that prevalence increased with age, with estimates ranging from 31 to 38 percent in persons 18 to 64 years of age, to 45 percent in persons 65 to 79 years of age. One U. S. prospective cohort study found that between 23 and 34 percent of persons older than 65 years had insomnia, and between 7 and 15 percent had chronic insomnia.

The study also reported a higher incidence of insomnia in women than in men. Etiology and Risk Factors The cause of insomnia is uncertain. The risk of primary insomnia increases with age and may be related to changes in circadian rhythms associated with age, or the onset of chronic conditions and poorer health as a result of aging. Psychological factors and lifestyle changes may exacerbate perceived effects of changes in sleep patterns associated with age, leading to reduced satisfaction with sleep. Other possible risk factors in all age groups include hyperarousal, chronic stress, and daytime napping.

### Secondary insomnia: diagnostic challenges and intervention opportunities [^1161g9t5]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The assessment and treatment of secondary insomnia (SI), the most common form of insomnia, are often complicated. Establishing an accompanying disorder as causal rather than comorbid is the key to assessment, but can be difficult even for experienced clinicians. Treatment often focuses on the primary disorder. In many cases, however, there is reason to treat the insomnia directly (insomnia is partially independent, does not respond to treatment of the primary condition, or has been misdiagnosed as SI). Although hypnotic medications are frequently used, behavioral interventions may be the best treatment approach, providing better long-term management of symptoms. Older adults warrant special consideration as age-related illnesses, changes in drug absorption and metabolism, and polypharmacy make them especially susceptible to SI. Recent research suggests successful treatment of insomnia may also relieve the primary disorder and merits follow-up. Future research is also needed on the efficacy of psychological treatment for SI for specific disorders as well as for older adults.

### Management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116NEnff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Benzodiazepine misuse in the elderly: risk factors, consequences, and management [^112c59ZZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) inappropriate use (i.e., misuse and overuse) is a worldwide public health problem. Despite current knowledge about increased sensitivity to side effects in the elderly, that should lead to more caution, only a third of BZD prescriptions in this age group are considered appropriate. The most frequent inadequate situations are excessive duration and/or dosage of a medical prescription or self-medication, especially in a context where it would be contraindicated, e.g., long-acting BZD in the elderly. Polypharmacy and comorbidities are major risk factors. Consequences of BZD inappropriate use are falls, delirium and other cognitive dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, car accidents, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. An emerging concern is a potentially increased risk of dementia. Contrary to most clinicians' belief, discontinuation of chronic BZD use in elderly patients is feasible, with adequate psychotherapeutic or pharmacological strategies, and can lead to long-term abstinence. Brief cognitive therapy mostly relies on psychoeducation and motivational enhancement and is particularly useful in this context. Further research is needed, notably in three areas: (1) assessing the impact of public health programs to prevent BZD inappropriate use in the elderly, (2) developing alternative strategies to treat anxiety and insomnia in elderly patients, and (3) exploring the association between chronic BZD use and dementia.

### Prevalence and comorbidity of insomnia and effect on functioning in elderly populations [^117JeF1p]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

A good night's sleep is often more elusive as we age, because the prevalence of insomnia in older people is high. Insufficient sleep can have important effects on daytime function by increasing the need to nap, reducing cognitive ability including attention and memory, slowing response time, adversely affecting relationships with friends and family, and contributing to a general sense of being unwell. However, rather than aging per se, circadian rhythm shifts, primary sleep disorders, comorbid medical/psychiatric illnesses, and medication use cause sleep difficulties in older people, which psychosocial factors may also affect. Clinicians should ask elderly patients about satisfaction with sleep. Any sleep complaints warrant careful evaluation of contributing factors and appropriate treatment.

### Insomnia and cognitive function in the elderly patient… [^112TJUVE]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Sleep problems are reported by many elderly patients with major depressive disorders. However, these problems do not always coexist, even though they share similar risk factors. Insomnia is often associated with dependence on sleep medications, chronic fatigue, and increased risk of falls. Chronic sleep disturbances may lead to nursing home placement. Cricco and associates investigated the relationship between self-reported insomnia and cognitive function in elderly adults. Patients were selected from participants in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Patients who were at least 65 years of age and cognitively intact at baseline were included. Various demographic data were collected. Education levels, physical function, depressive symptoms, and a mental status questionnaire were reviewed.

A variety of questions about sleep disturbance were included, with insomnia defined as "trouble falling asleep or trouble with waking up too early and not being able to fall asleep again". There were 6, 444 patients included in the study. Of these patients, 27. 2 percent of the women and
21. 0 percent of the men were categorized as having insomnia. Prescription sleep medications were used in 8. 2 percent of the women and
4. 8 percent of the men. Depression was most likely to be noted in patients with chronic insomnia and least likely to occur in those without chronic insomnia. Cognitive decline occurred in 26. 8 percent of women and
25. 5 percent of men during the three-year follow-up period. Among the male participants, insomnia was an independent risk factor for cognitive decline, regardless of whether the man also had a depressed mood.

Specifically, a nondepressed man with chronic insomnia was nearly one half as likely to show evidence of cognitive decline as the men who did not have insomnia at the three-year follow-up visit. In women, chronic insomnia was associated with cognitive decline only if the participant also had high levels of depressive symptoms. The authors conclude that chronic insomnia is an independent risk factor for cognitive decline in patients 65 years and older, especially in men. Depression and insomnia did not seem to contribute synergistically to cognitive decline, although each was independently associated with poorer scores on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. editor's note: It is incumbent on the physician to recognize and treat complaints of chronic insomnia in elderly patients, knowing that maintenance of cognitive function may be one positive byproduct. — g. b. h.

### Prevalence, associated risks, and treatment patterns of insomnia [^1156L7o1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Insomnia, the most commonly reported sleep problem, affects about one third of the adult American population. Insomnia impairs the individual's functioning, diminishes his or her quality of life, and contributes to accidents, health care costs, and problems at work. Insomnia is frequently comorbid with physical and mental illness, as either a consequence or a contributing factor. In particular, considerable research supports a strong association between insomnia and depression. Because the majority of individuals who have trouble sleeping attempt to treat the problem independently using over-the-counter medications or alcohol, insomnia is undertreated by health care providers, despite its serious consequences.

### Sleep and aging… [^115ih88D]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Complaints of sleep difficulty are common among the elderly. In a National Institute on Aging study of over 9, 000 persons aged 65 years and older, over one half of the men and women reported at least one chronic sleep complaint. 1 Typical symptoms of sleep problems in the elderly include difficulty falling asleep and maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness. A variety of processes may interfere with sleep and wakefulness in the elderly. 2, 3 Among them are acute and chronic medical illnesses, medication effects, psychiatric disorders, primary sleep disorders, social changes, poor sleep habits and circadian rhythm shifts. Sleep-wake problems may be compounded further by inappropriate treatment initiated by the patient, family members, physicians or other care providers. Figure 1, elderly persons have more fragmented sleep and a shorter duration of stage 3 and stage 4 sleep than that occurring in young adults.

Overall, the sleep-wake cycle in the elderly may be fragmented, with interrupted nighttime sleep and daytime wakefulness interrupted by naps. The deepest stages of non-REM sleep are frequently reduced or nonexistent in elderly persons; however, REM sleep tends to be preserved. Although a mild deterioration in sleep quality may be normal in the aging process, an elderly patient's complaint of significantly disrupted nighttime sleep or impaired daytime functioning because of excessive sleepiness must be evaluated. Factors That May Disrupt Sleep It is important to keep multiple factors in mind when evaluating sleep complaints in elderly patients because a number of problems may contribute to poor sleep. PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Distress from acute symptoms of a psychiatric disorder may promote disturbed sleep. A classic example is insomnia in association with major depression.

The tendency toward increased arousals and early-morning awakening in an elderly person may be severely exacerbated in the presence of depression. Also contributing to a deterioration in the quality of sleep are the psychologic manifestations of the assorted life changes that elderly persons often experience. Significant factors include physical limitations, loss of loved ones and leaving a familiar home to live in a more supervised setting. REM-BEHAVIOR DISORDER The rare REM-behavior disorder occurs most commonly in elderly persons. Underlying this disorder is disinhibition of the process that normally prevents transmission of muscle activity during dreaming. The patient may thrash about in bed, sometimes falling or leaping from the bed and incurring significant injury. Treatment with bedtime doses of a long-acting benzodiazepine such as clonazepam often provides effective control of this disorder.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115MQyym]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep-promoting medications — evidence limitations and research needs — are characterized by overall quality of evidence that is relatively low in the vast majority of cases, with insufficient evidence for numerous drugs and highly variable, idiosyncratic data reporting that precludes comparing data from one study to another or conducting meta-analyses; virtually all studies of prescription hypnotic agents are industry-funded, and potential publication bias, particularly lack of publication of negative results, and the role of industry in study design and data analysis may compromise evidence quality and uniformity; with these limitations, the task force recommends for future investigations: clear definitions of inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequately powering studies to detect significant differences for key sleep variables, and development and utilization of uniform data collection instruments to improve cross-study analysis and comparisons.

Search method

A comprehensive search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies and observational studies was conducted using a predeveloped search term on four databases: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

The PICOS-framework was used to develop a search term (population: people over 65 years, intervention: BDLM, comparator: no limits, outcomes: see list above 'Types of outcomes' and study design: systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies and observational studies). The full search term can be found as Additional file 1.

The search was conducted on the 19th of June 2019 by a data research team at the University of Witten using the OVID interface for each database.

Data management

Search results were saved on EndNote X9 reference management software. Upon retrieval, results were de-duplicated.

Selection of studies

The titles and abstracts identified were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers. Full text articles were obtained for all references meeting the inclusion criteria, or where there was uncertainty about inclusion. VS, LH and EM were involved in this task.

Consensus was established and in case of disagreement arbitrated by AS.

Reference lists of included studies and studies identified via snowballing were screened for eligibility.

Studies excluded in full text were listed with a justification for exclusion.

Data extraction

Data extraction was conducted independently using a previously developed standardized data extraction form. Data items extracted were study design, objective, data of participants, intervention and comparator, study duration, outcome measures and sponsors. Completeness and accuracy of data extraction were double-checked by two further independent reviewers.

Quality appraisal

For different study designs distinct validated tools of assessment were used to evaluate quality. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were appraised using the critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews (AMSTAR2), clinical studies utilizing the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2), and for observational studies the critical appraisal skills program checklist (CASP) was used.

Quality appraisal was carried out by two independent researchers (VS and EM) and in case of disagreement arbitrated by a third reviewer (AS).

Data synthesis

A descriptive and narrative summary of results with a focus on clinical endpoints was formulated. Quality of included studies was described. In case of data from included studies being homogenous enough in terms of treatments, study duration, study design and outcomes, a meta-analysis of results was calculated.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^1166GCm1]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This systematic review has several limitations. One of the major limitations is the small number of eligible studies included in the meta-analyses that have a high level of heterogeneity, which diminishes the predictive certainty.

Furthermore, the search strategy and inclusion criteria were designed to identify studies focusing on older people; studies on the general population that may have contained relevant information for the older population might have been overlooked. However, the risk was minimized through examination of the full texts of references where these data were unclear in the abstracts. We also checked the reference lists of all included studies to identify further eligible studies. In addition, using independent reviewers for study selection, evaluation of bias and extraction of data should have minimized this problem. We could also have missed studies because of language bias as we only included studies written in English or German.

Another limitation is the discrepancy in safety data between interventional and observational studies. Due to the limited participant size and duration of the included interventional studies, rare adverse events or adverse events that develop over a certain duration of intake are not reflected in their safety data and the increased risk of falls and fractures that our recommendation is based on can only be found in the observational studies, which have much larger sample sizes and study durations. Finally, our recommendation only focusses on the discontinuation of BDLM. Nevertheless, this systematic review aims at providing an overview on the existing evidence on both the benefits and the risks of the use of BDLM in older people.

### Consequences of insomnia and its therapies [^112KbZk8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Insomnia has a number of clinically significant associations. In particular, patients with chronic insomnia have higher rates of psychiatric and medical illnesses, and insomnia is an important risk factor in the development of depression. Insomniacs also have higher rates of health care utilization and reduced quality of life. This article reviews important clinical correlates of insomnia and evidence for possible causal relationships between sleep and health.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111q51Bu]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) & insomnia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include key epidemiology and outcomes: COPD has an estimated prevalence in U.S. adults of 13.9% and OSA affects 9% to 26% of the U.S. adult population. Patients with both COPD and OSA have a worse prognosis compared with either condition alone, with more frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation and more total sleep time with hypoxemia and hypercapnia than OSA patients without COPD. In combined OSA and COPD, apneic events have more profound hypoxemia and more cardiac arrhythmias, and these patients are more likely to develop daytime pulmonary hypertension than patients with just OSA or COPD alone. The use of positive pressure ventilation in patients with COPD and OSA has been reported to reduce all-cause hospitalizations, emergency room visits, moderate and severe exacerbations and associated healthcare costs. Insomnia in COPD is associated with higher rates of outpatients' visits and hospitalizations.

### Cognitive behavioural interventions for sleep problems in adults aged 60 + [^117UAEAq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of sleep problems in adulthood increases with age. While not all sleep changes are pathological in later life, severe disturbances may lead to depression, cognitive impairments, deterioration of quality of life, significant stresses for carers and increased healthcare costs. The most common treatment for sleep disorders (particularly insomnia) is pharmacological. The efficacy of non-drug interventions has been suggested to be slower than pharmacological methods, but with no risk of drug-related tolerance or dependency. Cognitive and behavioural treatments for sleep problems aim to improve sleep by changing poor sleep habits, promoting better sleep hygiene practices and by challenging negative thoughts, attitudes and beliefs about sleep.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions in improving sleep quality, duration and efficiency amongst older adults (aged 60 and above).

Search Strategy

The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 - October 2001); EMBASE (1980 - January 2002), CINAHL (1982 - January 2002; PsychINFO 1887 to 2002; The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2002); National Research Register (NRR [2002]). Bibliographies of existing reviews in the area, as well as of all trial reports obtained, were searched. Experts in the field were consulted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of cognitive behavioural treatments for primary insomnia where 80% or more of participants were over 60. Participants must have been screened to exclude those with dementia and/or depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts of studies identified in searches of electronic databases were read and assessed to determine whether they might meet the inclusion criteria. Data were analysed separately depending on whether results had been obtained subjectively or objectively.

Main Results

Six trials, including 282 participants with insomnia, examined the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural treatments (CBT) for sleep problems in this population. The final total of participants included in the meta-analysis was 224. The data suggest a mild effect of CBT for sleep problems in older adults, best demonstrated for sleep maintenance insomnia.

Reviewer's Conclusions

When the possible side-effects of standard treatment (hypnotics) are considered, there is an argument to be made for clinical use of cognitive-behavioural treatments. Research is needed to establish the likely predictors of success with such treatments. As it may well be the case that the treatment efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy itself is not durable, the provision of "top-up" ("refresher" sessions of CBT training to improve durability of effect are worthy of investigation.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^11614ihX]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Guideline recommendation scope and strength — these analyses yield recommendations for use of a limited number of drugs for a limited number of specific indications such as sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance, and in all cases the recommendations are "weak", based on relatively limited and/or low quality evidence; many agents shown to be "statistically significantly superior" to placebo may nonetheless be "not recommended", reflecting differences between FDA criteria and the GRADE approach, which establishes evidence quality ratings and clinical significance thresholds not used in individual studies or FDA approval, and each prescriber bears responsibility for treatment determinations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^115ceogm]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Epidemiology and impact in the general population — insomnia and OSA prevalence and risk factors are reported as follows: Sleep disturbances affect 50% of the general adult population worldwide, and in the United States the National Institutes of Health estimate that roughly 30–40% of the general population complain of sleep disruption. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint among adults; approximately 5%-50% of adults in the U.S. have experienced insomnia symptoms, and the prevalence of chronic insomnia disorder is estimated to be between 6%-23%. Risk for insomnia is more prevalent among women, older adults, shift workers, family history of insomnia, and patients with co-existing medical and psychiatric disorders; additional factors associated with an increased risk include being African American, serving in the military, and those experiencing lower socioeconomic status or adverse social determinants of health. Obstructive sleep apnea is one of the most common sleep disorders, with a prevalence that ranges from 9% to 38%, and the prevalence of OSA increases with age, body mass index (BMI), and males (2:1), but after menopause the risk in women increases.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^1136knSb]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review underscores the lack of high-quality evidence on the benefits and risks of BDLM treatment for insomnia. In short-term studies, the intake of BDLM appears to improve both sleep and daytime parameters, while producing neither hangover, induction of tolerance nor dependence and virtually no ADE other than unpleasant taste when compared to placebo. However, no long-term controlled prospective studies on the use of BDLM in older people are available. Furthermore, in observational studies, the use of BDLM is associated with a significant increase in the risk for falls and fractures.

Our recommendation is that clinicians should consider discontinuing BDLM, principally because of the high risk for falls and fractures.

High quality and independent studies on the risks and benefits of BDLM use for insomnia in older populations, especially in the light of the lack of long-term studies, are needed in order to enable evidence-based decision making on an individual patient level.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^112ijTwy]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

General information on insomnia disorder — patient education emphasizes that insomnia disorder can be a difficult experience but "there are treatments that are effective"; insomnia symptoms are usually first brought on because of stressful life events and sleep difficulties can persist "due to the coping strategies used that were unhelpful", so "the solution must address the unhelpful coping strategies that cause your insomnia to persist". When also treating a comorbid condition, the script states that insomnia is "not merely a symptom of another condition" and "we should treat the insomnia as well". If symptoms have been of short duration, patients are told that strategies adopted to cope "can promote a chronic problem" and "I'd like to get you started with a behavioral treatment to avoid that happening if possible".
