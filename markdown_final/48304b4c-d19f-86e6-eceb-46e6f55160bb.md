## Question

What is the management of hypernatremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of hypernatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. Then, I should classify hypernatremia by severity and determine acuity. Next, I will calculate the free water deficit and plan fluid replacement, including the type of fluids and correction targets. After that, I need to address the underlying cause, especially diabetes insipidus and iatrogenic sources. Finally, I will reconcile conflicting evidence on correction rates, set a monitoring cadence, and outline special populations and safety checks, making sure I verify each step against the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation come first, and in hypernatremia I must not jump to conclusions about fluids before ensuring hemodynamic stability. If the patient is unstable, isotonic saline is appropriate initially to restore intravascular volume, even though it does not correct the free water deficit, and I should correct volume status before targeting sodium correction, because perfusion takes precedence over tonicity in the acute phase [^1eb0921f] [^3dce1e4c].

> Next, I should review severity and acuity. Severe hypernatremia is typically defined as serum sodium greater than 160 mmol/L, and I need to distinguish acute onset within 48 hours from chronic beyond 48 hours, as this distinction influences correction strategy and risk of cerebral adaptation complications. I should double-check that the classification aligns with endocrine guidance and contemporary cohorts, which consistently use greater than 160 mmol/L as severe and recognize the prognostic weight of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^7e54f740] [^58268124].

> I will now examine the free water deficit, because this drives therapy. The standard formula is Free Water Deficit = TBW × (Current Na / Desired Na − 1), where TBW is approximated as 0.6 × weight in kg for adult males, 0.5 for adult females, and 0.5 for elderly males and 0.45 for elderly females. Wait, let me verify the TBW fractions and the desired sodium target; most adults aim for 140 mmol/L, and I should remember that this calculation estimates the static deficit and does not account for ongoing losses, so I need to add replacement for those separately [^05a765fe] [^e6156249].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fluids. I should tailor the replacement to volume status and acuity. For hypovolemic patients, I should start with isotonic saline to stabilize, then transition to hypotonic fluids once euvolemic. For euvolemic patients, D5W or 0.45% saline are reasonable depending on glucose tolerance and the magnitude of hypernatremia. For hypervolemic patients, I need to promote a negative sodium balance using diuretics plus hypotonic fluids rather than simply adding water, to avoid worsening edema. I should confirm that this approach aligns with endocrine guidance on controlled correction and with ICU-focused reviews emphasizing tonicity balance rather than electrolyte-free water alone [^ff6cd528] [^46b54c9c] [^8c4777f6].

> Now, the contentious issue: correction rate. Traditional teaching caps correction at 0.5 mmol/L per hour or 10 mmol/L per 24 hours to avoid cerebral edema, and endocrine guidance for CDI still advises not exceeding 0.5 mmol/L per hour in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, with a 5 mmol/L initial drop allowed in symptomatic acute cases, not to exceed 10 mmol/L in 24 hours. But wait, I should verify whether this applies broadly to adults with severe hypernatremia, because large retrospective cohorts suggest faster correction is associated with lower mortality without increased neurological complications, challenging the slow approach. Given the strength of observational data, I should individualize: in stable adults with severe hypernatremia, faster correction up to about 1 mmol/L per hour may be reasonable with close monitoring, whereas in children, neonates, or chronic hypernatremia, I should remain conservative and adhere to 0.5 mmol/L per hour or less to mitigate cerebral edema risk [^0e19c87b] [^b1ac3736] [^f21e5a80] [^571ec9e5] [^a31d8624].

> I need to ensure I address the cause concurrently. For central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin is indicated with careful fluid management to avoid overly rapid correction from combined free water and antidiuresis. For nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, I should treat the underlying cause and use thiazides or amiloride when appropriate, while replacing water losses. For iatrogenic sodium excess, I must stop hypertonic or sodium-rich sources and use diuretics with hypotonic fluids. Let me double-check that endocrine guidance supports early desmopressin in CDI and emphasizes stopping iatrogenic drivers, which it does [^6cdc2b28] [^fc734c2f].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence. Initially, I should check serum sodium every 2 to 4 hours during active correction, then space to every 4 to 6 hours once the trajectory is stable. I also need to track urine output, volume status, and neurologic status, and I should weigh the patient when feasible to refine TBW estimates and ongoing losses. I should confirm that this intensity matches endocrine and critical care recommendations for close surveillance during correction [^ff6cd528] [^3dce1e4c].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or neonate. I should correct more slowly in pediatrics, generally not exceeding 0.5 mmol/L per hour, and in neonates I must be particularly cautious given case reports of osmotic demyelination after rapid correction. Enteral rehydration is preferred when feasible, and if using parenteral fluids, I should prefer solutions with sodium content roughly 10 to 15 mmol/L below the current serum sodium in severe cases to blunt the rate of decline, with frequent sodium checks. I should double-check that these pediatric nuances are supported by pediatric nephrology guidance and case-based literature [^fb4026a7] [^a31d8624] [^b31e6d70].

> I should also consider special contexts. In organ donors, hypernatremia at procurement worsens transplant outcomes, so correcting sodium to below 155 mmol/L before retrieval is recommended. In traumatic brain injury, sustained hypernatremia is sometimes induced for cerebral edema control, but I need to balance this against the mortality signal seen with hypernatremia in ICU cohorts and avoid prolonged hypernatremia. In hyperglycemic hyperosmolar states, corrected sodium better reflects tonicity and should guide fluid planning, and I should remember that effective osmolarity greater than 300 mOsm/L is more sensitive than total osmolarity for diagnosing HHS [^28893c6e] [^314f88fa] [^e251962c] [^67944125].

> Hold on, I should verify safety checks and what to do if the sodium is falling too fast. If the sodium decline accelerates beyond the intended rate, I can slow correction by switching to a solution with higher sodium content or by administering a small amount of hypertonic saline to transiently raise sodium and reassess. Conversely, if sodium is not changing as expected, I should recalculate the deficit, reassess ongoing losses, and confirm that the TBW estimate and fluid delivery are accurate. These adjustments are consistent with endocrine guidance and critical care reviews emphasizing dynamic reassessment of tonicity balance [^ff6cd528] [^8c4777f6].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: stabilize and correct hypovolemia first, classify severity and acuity, calculate the free water deficit, choose fluids based on volume status, correct at a rate tailored to patient population and context with a bias toward faster correction in stable adults given emerging data, treat the underlying cause aggressively, and monitor closely with frequent sodium checks and clinical reassessment. I should confirm that this synthesis aligns with contemporary cohort evidence, endocrine guidance, and critical care best practices, and I will remain ready to adjust the plan as new data or patient-specific factors emerge [^f21e5a80] [^571ec9e5] [^0e19c87b] [^3dce1e4c].

Hypernatremia management centers on **correcting the free water deficit** and treating the underlying cause, with careful attention to correction rate to avoid cerebral edema [^e6156249]. Use **D5W or 0.45% saline** for fluid replacement, and correct sodium by **no more than 0.5 mmol/L/h (10 mmol/L/24 h)** in chronic cases; faster correction (up to 1 mmol/L/h) is acceptable in acute hypernatremia if closely monitored [^0e19c87b] [^58268124]. Monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially, adjust fluids to ongoing losses, and avoid overcorrection to prevent seizures or cerebral edema [^e5caa0b6] [^ff6cd528].

---

## Step 1: confirm diagnosis and assess severity

Confirm true hypernatremia by measuring **serum sodium** and **serum osmolality**, and exclude pseudohypernatremia from hyperglycemia or lab artifacts [^861c01c9]. Classify severity as mild (146–149 mmol/L), moderate (150–159 mmol/L), or severe (≥ 160 mmol/L) to guide urgency and monitoring [^7e54f740].

---

## Step 2: determine etiology and volume status

Identify the cause and assess **volume status** to guide therapy:

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | - GI losses <br/> - Osmotic diuresis <br/> - Diuretics | - Dry mucosa <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypotension |
| Euvolemic | - Central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus | - Polyuria <br/> - Polydipsia <br/> - Normal volume |
| Hypervolemic | - Hypertonic saline <br/> - Sodium bicarbonate <br/> - Salt poisoning | - Edema <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Weight gain |

---

## Step 3: calculate free water deficit

Estimate the **free water deficit** using the formula:

Free water deficit (L) = TBW × [(current Na / desired Na) − 1]

where TBW is total body water (about 0.6 × weight in kg for men, 0.5 × weight in kg for women) and desired Na is typically 140 mmol/L [^05a765fe].

---

## Step 4: select appropriate fluids and correction rate

Choose fluids and a correction rate based on **volume status** and **acuity**:

- **Hypovolemic**: Give isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) until hemodynamically stable, then switch to hypotonic fluids (D5W or 0.45% saline) to correct sodium [^1eb0921f].
- **Euvolemic**: Use D5W or 0.45% saline to replace free water [^fc734c2f].
- **Hypervolemic**: Use diuretics (e.g. furosemide) with D5W to promote sodium excretion and water replacement [^3dce1e4c].

---

## Step 5: monitor and adjust therapy

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check serum sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours once stable [^e5caa0b6].
- **Correction rate**: Limit to ≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h (≤ 10 mmol/L/24 h) in chronic hypernatremia; up to 1 mmol/L/h may be acceptable in acute cases with close monitoring [^0e19c87b] [^58268124].
- **Ongoing losses**: Replace continuing water losses (e.g. polyuria, insensible losses) to prevent rebound hypernatremia [^46b54c9c].

---

## Step 6: address underlying causes

Treat the cause directly: manage **diabetes insipidus** with desmopressin or address nephrogenic causes, stop iatrogenic sodium sources, and treat infections or gastrointestinal losses [^fc734c2f].

---

## Step 7: prevent complications

Avoid **rapid overcorrection** to prevent cerebral edema and seizures; if overcorrection occurs, consider administering hypertonic saline to stabilize sodium and slow correction [^e5caa0b6]. Monitor for neurologic changes, electrolyte disturbances, and fluid overload throughout treatment [^3dce1e4c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Correct more slowly (≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h) and use enteral fluids when feasible; monitor closely for neurologic complications [^fb4026a7] [^a31d8624].
- **Chronic hypernatremia**: Correct slowly due to cerebral adaptation; avoid exceeding 10 mmol/L in 24 hours [^0e19c87b].
- **Acute hypernatremia**: Faster correction (up to 1 mmol/L/h) may be safe with careful monitoring, but evidence is limited [^58268124].

---

Hypernatremia management requires **careful correction of the free water deficit**, treatment of the underlying cause, and close monitoring to avoid complications. The key is to balance effective correction with patient safety, tailoring the approach to the cause, acuity, and volume status.

Key Points

Question

Is the rate of correction associated with mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia?

Findings

In this cohort study of 4265 adults with severe hypernatremia, patient survival was strongly correlated with hypernatremia correction rate. There was no evidence of any neurological complications associated with rapid correction of severe hypernatremia.

Meaning

The results suggest that faster correction rates than currently recommended for severe hypernatremia might translate to better patient outcomes.

### Salt and water: a review of hypernatremia [^e6156249]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum sodium disorders are generally a marker of water balance in the body. Thus, hypernatremia is most often caused by an overall deficit of total body water. Other unique circumstances may lead to excess salt, without an impact on the body's total water volume. Hypernatremia is commonly acquired in both the hospital and community. As hypernatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, treatment should be initiated promptly. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology and management of the main types of hypernatremia, which can be categorized as either a loss of water or gain of sodium that can be mediated by renal or extrarenal mechanisms.

### Hypernatremia in the intensive care unit [^80cd96da]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypernatremia is a relatively frequent electrolyte disorder seen in critically ill patients. As many as 27% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) develop hypernatremia of variable severity during an ICU stay. Debate among specialists often ensues as to whether to correct hypernatremia or not. Some practitioners, particularly intensivists, believe that correction of hypernatremia with fluids may cause expansion of the extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) thereby worsening ventilation and impeding extubation. Other practitioners, including many nephrologists, do not expect correction of hypernatremia to lead to clinically apparent ECFV expansion, and fear other deleterious effects of hypernatremia. In this review we address the controversy regarding appropriate practice.

Recent Findings

There are no randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) to guide the administration of electrolyte-free fluid administration in hypernatremic patients. However, there are associations, demonstrated in the literature, suggesting that hypernatremia of any severity will increase the mortality and length of stay in these patients. These associations generally support the practice of correction of hypernatremia. In addition, our knowledge of the distribution of total body water influences us towards correcting hypernatremia as an appropriate therapy. We do not expect that adequate RCTs addressing this question will be performed.

Summary

Allowing persistence of any degree of hypernatremia is associated with increased mortality, length of stay (LOS) and postdischarge mortality. We expect that proper use of electrolyte-free water intake will avoid adverse outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### A clinical approach to the treatment of chronic hypernatremia [^0bf0ed1e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypernatremia is a commonly encountered electrolyte disorder occurring in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Community-acquired hypernatremia typically occurs at the extremes of age, whereas hospital-acquired hypernatremia affects patients of all age groups. Serum sodium concentration is linked to water homeostasis, which is dependent on the thirst mechanism, arginine vasopressin, and kidney function. Because both hypernatremia and the rate of correction of hypernatremia are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, prompt effective treatment is crucial. Chronic hypernatremia can be classified into 3 broad categories, hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic forms, with each form having unique treatment considerations. In this teaching case, we provide a clinically based quantitative approach to the treatment of both hypervolemic and hypovolemic hypernatremia, which occurred in the same patient during the course of a prolonged illness.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^195abf41]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, we found that all levels of hospital-acquired hypernatremia were independently associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, and discharge to nursing facilities of the patients. The strength of this association suggests that hypernatremia may serve as a widely available risk factor of poor outcomes among hospitalized patients. These findings underscore the need for more awareness of hospital-acquired hypernatremia, especially among patients with advanced kidney dysfunction, and may provide the opportunity to prevent and minimize subsequent adverse outcomes. Further work focusing on prevention, duration, and rate of correction of hospital-acquired hypernatremia are crucial next steps because treatment of hypernatremia may be inadequate or delayed. Finally, physician training to promote awareness and the development of hospital-based algorithms to prevent fluid prescription errors could result in improved management and even avoidance of hospital-acquired hypernatremia.

### Understanding hypernatremia [^919f58bb]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### Hypernatremia [^05a765fe]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia" for hypernatremia.

The Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia calculator estimates the amount of free water (in liters) needed to correct hypernatremia based on the patient's sodium levels, weight, and total body water (TBW) percentage

The calculator assesses the free water deficit in individuals with hypernatremia by integrating five particular inputs: gender, age group, weight, current serum sodium level, and desired serum sodium level. This metric is invaluable for determining how much free water is necessary to adjust serum sodium levels back to normal.

The calculation process unfolds through these steps:

- **Weight Conversion**: The individual's weight can be entered in either kilograms or pounds. If pounds are used, the calculator converts this to kilograms:
Weight in kg = Weight in lbs / 2.20462.

- **Total Body Water (TBW) Fraction**: This fraction represents the portion of body weight that comprises water. Its determination hinges on both the individual's gender and age group:

- The TBW fraction is 0.6 for children, adult males, and non-elderly males.
- For adult females, the TBW fraction adapts to 0.5.
- In the elderly, it decreases to 0.5 for males and further to 0.45 for females.

- **Sodium Levels**: Input for serum sodium levels is accepted in mEq/L or mmol/L, given the equivalence of these units, no conversion is needed.

- **Computation of Free Water Deficit**: This quantity is calculated with the formula:
Free Water Deficit (L) = TBW fraction × Weight (kg) × [(Current Serum Sodium / Desired Serum Sodium) - 1].

- **Outcome**: The free water deficit is calculated and then rounded to one decimal place, delivered in liters.

This calculator offers a tailored analysis essential for the customized management of hypernatremia. This consideration of individual parameters facilitates personalized fluid replacement therapy, ensuring serum sodium levels are safely normalized.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, SE 2018 guidelines recommend to administer IV or IM vasopressin 1–2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output, with close observation of the clinical and biochemical response. Consider administering further doses of desmopressin when production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^9abf1fb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^71f64df0]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality of hypernatremic patients reaches 20% to 60% and varies according to comorbidities, associated illness, and whether hypernatremia is present at admission or acquired during hospitalization. Hypernatremia at admission or acquired during the hospitalization is an independent mortality risk factor.

In this study, we report clinical characteristics, management, outcome and mortality risk factors of severely hypernatremic patients admitted to the ED.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^861c01c9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This Core Curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^541c761a]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Some of the rationale supporting current expert opinion recommending controlled correction of hypernatremia rests on a perceived symmetry with correction of hyponatremia. While it is appealing to group these 2 common sodium disorders together, published data do not support this approach. The evidence supporting slow correction of hyponatremia is supported by animal studies, numerous case reports and large observational studies. In contrast, there are no convincing reports of even 1 adult harmed by rapid correction of hypernatremia. From a physiological perspective the risk of neurological complications seems to be much higher with rapid correction of hyponatremia, as the adaptations of brain cells to hypernatremia are much slower than to hyponatremia. Also, while the risk of complication associated with rapid correction is more common with chronic hyponatremia compared with acute hyponatremia, chronic hypernatremia is considerably less common than acute hypernatremia. Our results were comparable for patients with hypernatremia on admission compared with those who were diagnosed during hospitalization, also supporting the safety of rapid correction of hypernatremia even when there is no clear documentation of an acute condition.

The 30-day mortality was alarmingly high in the reported cohort. This is in line with previous studies of severe hypernatremia. The absolute difference in survival between rapidly and slowly corrected patients was very large and remained so after adjustment for potential confounders. Interestingly, the size of the absolute difference in survival was comparable at 30 days and at 1 year following documentation of severe hypernatremia. This might suggest that the different mortality rates do not represent differences in the patient populations unaccounted by the statistical analysis, but rather the results of the treatment strategies for severe hypernatremia, namely the rate of correction. An additional support to this hypothesis is the strong correlation reported between the absolute sodium correction in the first 24 hours and patient survival. This implies that the high mortality rates known to be associated with severe hypernatremia might be partly attributed to lack of aggressive rehydration, which might improve patient outcomes.

### HYPERNATREMIA IN INFANTS: an evaluation of the clinical and biochemical findings accompanying this state… [^47bdca23]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been shown that hypernatremia may accompany dehydration in infants with diarrhea and with infections associated with interference with water intake. Suitable modification of the treatment dehydration for these patients has appeared to improve the results of their care. Hypernatremic dehydration may be suspected from the history and clinical features and is readily diagnosed by laboratory procedures. The occurrence of neurological manifestations, some of which may be irreversible, is a feature of outstanding importance. Despite loss of body water the usual changes in tissue turgor and the circulatory state associated with severe dehydration may not be present. Because in this type of dehydration, a large intracellular water deficit exists, the repair solution should be relatively dilute with respect to sodium. The best results have been obtained by administering fluids which, if combined, would have a final sodium concentration of from 15 to 40 mEq. /l.

Hypocalcemia has been a frequent complication and more study is needed to elucidate its pathogenesis. Awareness of its occurrence facilitates therapy. As in other types of dehydration in infants, the potassium deficit may be impressive and should be corrected promptly after restoration of renal function. The somewhat special treatment indicated for patients with hypernatremic dehydration makes recognition important. Recognition or suspicion from clinical signs and rapid laboratory diagnosis are essential for optimal management. Comments.

Conclusion

This is the first study assessing outcome of hypernatremic patients in an ED according to the provided treatment. It suggests that medical management of hypernatremic patients must be improved regarding evaluation (weight, diuresis, urinary ionogram) and management (type of solute, perfusion speed) and that a too slow correction speed is associated with an increased risk of death regardless of initial natremia.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^58268124]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypernatremia is a common finding in hospitalized patients, with reported incidence 1% to 3%, and up to 9% in intensive care units (ICUs). Hypernatremia indicates a deficit in total body water, usually occurring in patients with inadequate access to water or impaired thirst mechanisms such as ICU patients, infants, and older adults. The clinical presentation of hypernatremia ranges from mild, nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, headache, and lethargy, to severe neurological symptoms such as seizure and coma. Hypernatremia is associated with higher mortality rates than any other electrolyte abnormality, although this is often attributed to the comorbidities of patients with hypernatremia rather than its direct consequences.

Data regarding the optimal rate of correction of hypernatremia are lacking. Current expert opinion states that hypernatremia correction rate should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h or 10 mmol/L/d to avoid the development of cerebral edema and permanent neurological damage. These complications were documented mainly in neonates. Clinical data supporting the safety and clinical benefits of slow correction of hypernatremia in adults are scarce. Several small studies reported that slow correction of hypernatremia is associated with excess mortality. Faster correction rates of up to 1 millimole per liter per hour have been suggested as appropriate for patients with rapidly developing hypernatremia. A recent study found no association between rate of correction of hypernatremia and clinical outcomes. Whether current guidelines reflect the optimal balance between patient safety and potential harm is unknown.

The current study aimed to elucidate the association between the rate of correction of hypernatremia and patient outcomes. We hypothesized that fast correction rates would be associated with more favorable patient outcomes.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^571ec9e5]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

In perhaps the largest patient cohort published to date, faster correction of severe hypernatremia than currently suggested was associated with significantly better survival rates. Even very fast correction rates were not associated with adverse neurological events. Health care professionals caring for patients with hypernatremia should take these findings into account when considering the optimal correction rates for their patients.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^7019bb76]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

About 1% of patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) have hypernatremia, a condition associated with a mortality rate of 20 to 60%. Management recommendations originate from intensive care unit studies, in which patients and medical diseases differ from those in ED.

Methods

We retrospectively studied clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of severely hypernatremic patients in the ED and risk factors associated with death occurrence during hospitalization.

Results

During 2010, 85 cases of severe hypernatremia ≥ 150 mmol/l were admitted to ED. Hypernatremia occurred in frail patients: mean age 79.7 years, 55% institutionalized, 28% with dementia. Twenty four percent of patients died during hospitalization. Male gender and low mean blood pressure (MBP) were independently associated with death, as well as slow natremia correction speed, but not the severity of hyperosmolarity at admission. Infusion solute was inappropriate for 45% of patients with MBP < 70 mmHg who received hypotonic solutes and 22% of patients with MBP ≥ 70 mmHg who received isotonic solutes or were not perfused.

Conclusions

This is the first study assessing outcome of hypernatremic patients in the ED according to the treatment provided. It appears that not only a too quick, but also a too slow correction speed is associated with an increased risk of death regardless of initial natremia. Medical management of hypernatremic patients must be improved regarding evaluation and treatment.

### Undercorrection of hypernatremia is frequent and associated with mortality [^6776f3d3]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypernatremia is diagnosed in 1 to 2% of patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED). Such patients often have various underlying pathologies implicated in hypernatremia occurrence. In most cases, treatment of hypernatremia is started at ED, but there have been only two reports on the characteristics, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes of severely hypernatremic patients at ED.

The recommended hypernatremia correction speed, based on pediatric retrospective case-series, is 1 mmol/L/h when hypernatremia occurrence has been quick (a few hours) and 0.5 mmol/L/h when it has been long or is unknown. A too fast correction can induce cerebral edema and irreversible neurologic sequels that are avoided with a slow correction. Unless shock or hypotension are present, isotonic or hypertonic solutes are not recommended. Moreover, experts recommend first replacing fluid losses in dehydrated/hypovolemic patients by use of isotonic or slightly hypotonic fluids (e.g. lactated Ringer's).

To avoid over- or under-treatment, which both might cause neurological complications (cerebral edema, seizure, or coma), management of intravenous fluid must be rationalized. Mathematic calculation of water deficit based on sodium and water distribution in the intra- and extra-cellular spaces has been proposed. This requires two clinical data: natremia measurement and patient weight. For example, Adrogue and Madias's formula serves to calculate natremia variation after perfusion of one liter of solute according to the type of solute, initial natremia, and total body water volume: Attended natremia = ([Na] of solute – initial natremia)/(Total body water volume - 1). Most formulas consider the human body as a closed system and do not integrate undergoing losses of water. Furthermore, total body water volume required for calculation is extrapolated from weight regardless of the percentage of body fat variability. Also, these formulas were found to be imprecise in individual patients with deviations > 10 mmol/L. Their inappropriate use might lead to hypernatremia under-correction or worsening.

Discussion

Our study describes initial presentation, management, and outcomes of severely hypernatremic patients (≥ 150 mmol/L) in the ED and during the following hospitalization. Relative to the 50 000 patients hospitalized each year in our ED, severe hypernatremia is a rare event. However, unlike in-hospital acquired hypernatremia, most patients with hypernatremia at hospital admission receive initial treatment in the ED. To our knowledge, very few studies have reported on presentation, management and outcome of severely hypernatremic patients upon their arrival to the hospital (Table 5). Arampatzis et al. reported hypernatremia > 145 mmol/L in 0.9% of patients admitted toED and 1.5% of patients with natremia dosing, and severe hypernatremia ≥ 150 mmol/L in 0.1% of admissions and 0.2% of patients with natremia dosing, which is similar to our results.

Studies reporting out-of-hospital acquired hypernatremia

Arampatzis et al. published two studies in the same year. Patients of the second study with hypernatremia defined as ≥ 150 mmol/L were a subgroup of the former larger study, with an unclassical hypernatremia definition.

In our study, hypernatremic patients were old (mean age 79.7 years-old), lived in medical institutions or at home with medical care (55%), and had cognitive impairment (28% had dementia), which are situations of thirst impairment and/or limited access to water and at high risk for dehydration. Moreover, for 47% of patients with severe hypernatremia ≥ 150 mmol/l, the main diagnosis was a situation associated with water loss, and 23% of patients had a treatment modifying renal water excretion.

### Hypernatremia in children with diarrhea: presenting features, management, outcome, and risk factors for death [^06032565]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

We sought to investigate the magnitude, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of children suffering from hypernatremic diarrhea and to identify risk factors for fatal outcome among them. We reviewed 2 data sets of children < 15 years admitted to the in-patient ward of the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr, b) with diarrhea and hypernatremia (serum sodium ≥ 150 mmol/L): (a) March 2001 to March 2002 (n = 371) and (b) March 2009 to August 2011 (n = 360). We reviewed their records and collected relevant information for analyses. The prevalence of hypernatremia was 5.1% (371/7212) and 2.4% (360/15 219), case fatality rate was 15% and 19%, respectively. In logistic regression analysis, the risk for death significantly increased in association with serum sodium ≥ 170 mmol/L, nutritional edema, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and absent peripheral pulses and reduced with the sole use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) or ORS following intravenous fluid, if indicated (for all, P < .05). Thus, managing children with hypernatremia using only ORS or ORS following intravenous fluid may help reduce the number of deaths.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^0761db33]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Despite the high prevalence of hypernatremia, data guiding optimal correction rates are scarce. To our knowledge, we report on the largest cohort to date of patients with severe hypernatremia. Rapid correction rate of hypernatremia was associated with better overall survival and shorter hospitalizations. We did not identify any evidence supporting an association between rapid rate of correction and patient harm, and no neurological complications were observed in patients with rapid correction. These findings challenge current expert opinion advising slower, controlled correction rates to avoid potentially devastating neurological complications.

Most previous studies of patients with hypernatremia included less than 200 patients. Smaller studies are subject to potentially fragile results leading to coincidental findings, selection bias, and publication bias. To our knowledge, the largest study to date, including 450 patients, reported no association between hypernatremia correction rate and patient survival. However, these were patients who were critically ill and hospitalized in ICUs, representing a different patient population. Furthermore, we reported on a considerably larger cohort of patients, making the results more robust.

The currently suggested correction rate of hypernatremia is an extrapolation of the suggested correction rate in neonates, a very different patient population with different physiology, comorbidities, and etiologies for hypernatremia. Faster correction of hypernatremia in adults can theoretically improve patient outcomes in several ways. Faster correction of severe volume contraction and the accompanying acute kidney failure can reduce the risk of potential adverse events, such as electrolyte abnormalities, infections, chronic kidney failure, and cardiovascular complications. Longer hospitalizations associated with slower correction of hypernatremia are also associated with potential complications such as hospital-acquired infections, falls, delirium and deconditioning, more so in patients with kidney failure, all known to be associated with worse patient outcomes. Additionally, it is possible that hypernatremia directly causes time-dependent neurological injury, which can be minimized with rapid correction. This hypothesis, supported by the reported results, should be tested separately, perhaps in an animal model.

We advocate early identification of chronic hypernatremia and effective administration of intravenous fluids in the Emergency Department that is decided on a case-by-case basis. In cases of severe and extreme hypernatraemia in particular, accurate calculation of free water deficit is essential to manage the patient effectively. In line with this, we must ensure that such patients are always weighed on admission.

Hypernatremia

Hypernatremia is characterized by a plasma sodium concentration greater than 145 mmol/L. Hypernatremia is a less common SEA and generally affects children less than 4 years old. This condition typically arises from decreased free water intake or increased loss of solute-free water and viral gastroenteritis is the leading cause. Additionally, a less common cause is salt poisoning. Importantly, hypernatremic dehydration can result from excessive water loss due to conditions including osmotic diuresis or urinary concentration defects. Determining the cause of the hypernatremic state is crucial for effective management and is depicted in Fig. 3. When the FENa is less than 1% and the patient demonstrates weight loss, this can be either attributed to free water loss or insufficient water intake. Free water loss in a hypernatremic state is attributed to extrarenal causes such as vomiting and diarrhea or renal losses such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) resistance or osmotic diuresis. Furthermore, if a patient demonstrates a FENa of greater than 2% with weight gain, this is typically attributed to salt excess. Additionally, Table 2 demonstrates the various causes of hypernatremia in children.

After excluding pseudohypernatremia, early management is tailored to the volume status and weight of the patient. While free water loss and insufficient water intake are associated with weight loss and low urine sodium, children with salt intoxication gain weight and their urine sodium is high. Measurement of plasma and urine osmolality is important in determining the cause of hypernatremia

Table 2
Etiology of hypernatremia in children

Hypernatremia may lead to neurologic symptoms due to the shift of water from the intracellular compartment, resulting in cellular shrinkage. These symptoms include irritability, fever, and weakness. Severe cases may present with lethargy, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, coma, seizures, and death. Children with hypernatremic dehydration should first receive intravenous isotonic solutions to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion, followed by solutions containing higher free water content to correct hypernatremia. The free water deficit can be estimated using the formula: 4 mL x weight (kg) x desired change in serum sodium (mmol/L). This formula can be applied for patient management in situations where children are experiencing hypernatremia dehydration and require fluid supplements. It is essential to correct hypernatremia gradually with a recommended correction rate of below 1 mmol/L/h and 15 mmol/24 h to prevent the development of cerebral edema. Some experts recommend administering solutions with slightly higher sodium content (10–15 mmol/L lower) in children with severe hypernatremia (greater than 175 mmol/L) to avoid the risk of rapid decline in serum sodium due to excessive free water intake. Regular monitoring of serum sodium is necessary to avoid a rapid drop in serum sodium levels. Following fluid replacement for losses, hypotonic solutions with lower sodium content (Na 75 mmol/L) are recommended for severe hypernatremia and (Na 30 mmol/L) for mild cases to help control and gradually adjust the sodium concentration. Rehydration strategies are different in children with renal concentration defects to control sodium levels according to specific needs. Individuals with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should be given hypotonic solutions (dextrose), whereas those with central diabetes insipidus require replacement of water loss with hypotonic fluids alongside desmopressin administration. However, caution is exercised with these treatments as they potentially lead to hyponatremia in cases of renal impairment affecting electrolyte balance. Therefore, careful monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential when administering desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to prevent the development of hyponatremia. In hemodynamically unstable patients, rapid correction of intravascular volume with isotonic saline should be initially used to stabilize the patient. Once stability is achieved, transitioning to hypotonic solutions may be considered.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^d6f4f757]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Induced and sustained hypernatremia for the prevention and treatment of cerebral edema following brain injury [^314f88fa]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema develops in response to and as a result of a variety of neurologic insults such as ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and tumor. It deforms brain tissue, resulting in localized mass effect and increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) that are associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. When administered in bolus form, hyperosmolar agents such as mannitol and hypertonic saline have been shown to reduce total brain water content and decrease ICP, and are currently the mainstays of pharmacological treatment. However, surprisingly, little is known about the increasingly common clinical practice of inducing a state of sustained hypernatremia. Herein, we review the available studies employing sustained hyperosmolar therapy to induce hypernatremia for the prevention and/or treatment of cerebral edema. Insufficient evidence exists to recommend pharmacologic induction of hypernatremia as a treatment for cerebral edema. The strategy of vigilant avoidance of hyponatremia is currently a safer, potentially more efficacious paradigm.

### Rate of correction of hypernatremia and health outcomes in critically ill patients [^55d0eafc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hypernatremia is common in hospitalized, critically ill patients. Although there are no clear guidelines on sodium correction rate for hypernatremia, some studies suggest a reduction rate not to exceed 0.5 mmol/L per hour. However, the data supporting this recommendation and the optimal rate of hypernatremia correction in hospitalized adults are unclear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We assessed the association of hypernatremia correction rates with neurologic outcomes and mortality in critically ill patients with hypernatremia at admission and those that developed hypernatremia during hospitalization. We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III and identified patients with hypernatremia (serum sodium level > 155 mmol/L) on admission (n = 122) and hospital-acquired (n = 327). We calculated different ranges of rapid correction rates (> 0.5 mmol/L per hour overall and > 8, > 10, and > 12 mmol/L per 24 hours) and utilized logistic regression to generate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to examine association with outcomes.

Results

We had complete data on 122 patients with severe hypernatremia on admission and 327 patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia. The difference in in-hospital 30-day mortality proportion between rapid (> 0.5 mmol/L per hour) and slower (≤ 0.5 mmol/L per hour) correction rates were not significant either in patients with hypernatremia at admission with rapid versus slow correction (25% versus 28%; P = 0.80) or in patients with hospital-acquired hypernatremia with rapid versus slow correction (44% versus 40%; P = 0.50). There was no difference in aOR of mortality for rapid versus slow correction in either admission (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.5 to 3.7) or hospital-acquired hypernatremia (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.3). Manual chart review of all suspected chronic hypernatremia patients, which included all 122 with hypernatremia at admission, 128 of the 327 hospital-acquired hypernatremia, and an additional 28 patients with ICD-9 codes for cerebral edema, seizures and/or alteration of consciousness, did not reveal a single case of cerebral edema attributable to rapid hyprnatremia correction.

Conclusions

We did not find any evidence that rapid correction of hypernatremia is associated with a higher risk for mortality, seizure, alteration of consciousness, and/or cerebral edema in critically ill adult patients with either admission or hospital-acquired hypernatremia.

### Dysnatremia and mortality: do sweat the small stuff [^43c40038]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Marked dysnatremia is associated with increased mortality in patients admitted to intensive care. However, new evidence suggests that even mild deviations from normal and simple variability of sodium values may also be significant. Should these findings prompt clinicians to re-evaluate the approach to fluid management in this setting? Sodium disorders, on one hand, are known to result from overzealous administration or restriction of free water or sodium ions. However, they are also associated with a range of co-morbidities and drug treatments that alter water loss and sodium handling in the nephron independently of prescribed fluid regimens. Moreover, powerful neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses to surgery, trauma and other acute illness may induce or intensify such changes, altering the response to administered fluids. These observations suggest that both patient and treatment variables contribute, but the extent to which sodium disturbances are preventable and whether prevention improves outcome are unknown. Dysnatremia certainly reflects underlying systemic disorders, but how important is fluid management as a cause, and does it contribute independently to poorer outcomes through osmotic or other mechanisms? Although total fluid volume and doses of potassium and glucose are regularly adjusted in critically ill patients, sodium is usually delivered at standard concentrations as long as serum values lie within an acceptable range. It may be prudent to pay closer attention to these values, especially when abnormal, when fluctuating or when an adverse trend is present. More frequent measurements of sodium in blood, urine and drainage fluids, and appropriate adjustment of the sodium content of prescribed fluids, may be indicated. Until more light can be shed on the pathophysiology of dysnatremia in the critically ill, we should assume that better control of plasma sodium levels may yield better outcomes.

### Acute severe hypernatremia complicated by osmotic demyelination syndrome in a 13-day-old infant [^7896d1c6]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Sudden osmolar variations due to dysnatremia can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome in neonates, although this complication is exceptionally rare. Clinical signs are nonspecific, and diagnosis relies on brain MRI. While effective treatments are lacking, prevention through careful fluid management remains crucial. Correction rates and rehydration strategies should be tailored to both the speed and magnitude of sodium imbalance, and strictly monitored to avoid iatrogenic complications. This case highlights the importance of vigilance when prescribing fluids in neonates and the need for specific guidelines on hypernatremia management in this vulnerable population.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^1eb0921f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^9a4cd98e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Hypernatremia at any time point during hospital stay is related to excess in-hospital mortality, whereas hyponatremia at presentation is associated with a higher likelihood of requiring advanced ventilatory support. Hyponatremia was not a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, except for the subgroup of hypovolemic hyponatremia. Therefore, serum sodium values could be used in clinical practice to identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of poor outcomes who would benefit from more intensive monitoring and judicious rehydration.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^c11ecc5a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding age, in our study, patients who developed hospital-acquired hypernatremia were older compared with patients with normonatremia. However, age was less important in the multivariable model after accounting for CKD status. It is well known that hypernatremia mostly results from net water loss reflecting pure water or hypotonic fluid loss, while thirst provides the ultimate defense against developing hypernatremia assuming the ability to access water. Therefore, hypernatremia in adults largely occurs in older patients with infirmity, cognitive deficits, or altered mental status who depend on others for their water requirements. Thirst is also suppressed in older patients. However, hypernatremia can result from hypertonic sodium gainduring hospitalization as well and may be iatrogenic. A recent study showed that a greater volume of free water prescription was associated with progression to severe hospital-acquired hypernatremia. The prescribed amount of free water was considered inadequate in the context of ongoing use of sodium-rich solutions and lower total volumes during progression of hypernatremia. Finally, hypernatremia is frequently associated with increased extracellular fluid volume, even outside intensive care units.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

Liver donor hypernatremia — outcomes and target sodium: Hypernatremia at procurement is linked to worse outcomes; organs from donors with serum sodium "more than 155 mEq/L" have an increased 30‑day retransplantation need, and one study reported 90‑day failure rates of "33%" vs "12.7%" for hypernatremic versus normal sodium donors. Donors initially hypernatremic but corrected "to less than 155 mEq/L" before retrieval had a 90‑day failure rate of "11%". Pending further studies, "hypernatremia in the potential organ donor should be corrected", and "at a minimum, the sodium level should be less than 155 mEq/L".

### The impact of different rates of sodium reduction on the central nervous system in acute hypernatremia in rabbits [^be4adbee]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The harmfulness of hypernatremia is mainly due to the degree of hypernatremia, the duration of hypernatremia, and the dangers brought by incorrect correction of hypernatremia. Studies have found that hypernatremia increases the 28-day mortality rate of patients. The focus of treating hypernatremia is to address the cause, supplement free water, and closely monitor serum sodium concentrations. A study analysis found that current recommendations for treating acute and chronic hypernatremia are not based on high-quality research. For chronic hypernatremia, Richard et al. proposed that no more than 8–10 mEq/L should be corrected in chronic hypernatremia patients every 24 h, with a maximum correction rate of 0.5 mEq/L/h, and regular assessment of serum sodium concentration should be required during the correction phase. In 1995, Borra et al. concluded through experiments that the correction rate of hypernatremia is related to the improvement of mental status, and the frequency of improvement in the level of consciousness is higher when hypernatremia is corrected within 4 days. A retrospective study found that rapid correction of hypernatremia is not related to a higher mortality rate of hypernatremia, defining "rapid correction" as greater than 0.5 mEq/L. Other studies have shown that the mortality rate of hypernatremia is often related to insufficient correction. There are currently no guidelines or consensuses for the rate of sodium reduction during the treatment of acute hypernatremia for clinical reference. It is recommended to quickly reduce serum sodium to normal at a rate of 2 mEq/L/h, and experts in the literature do not mention the reason for reducing sodium at this rate, but consider that it is necessary to quickly reduce serum sodium to normal levels for acute hypernatremia, as persistent hypernatremia itself will have an impact on patients. Some experts also state that reducing sodium at a rate of 1 mEq/L/h is safe, and this is based on case reports. According to pathophysiological theory, some experts also recommend using glucose-based hypotonic solutions to quickly correct acute hypernatremia and reduce it to 145 mEq/L within 24 h. A retrospective study showed that the 30-day and 1-year mortality rates after rapid correction of hypernatremia were lower than those after slow correction.

Critical Care 2025, 29(S1): P208

Introduction: Hypernatremia, defined as serum sodium > 145 mmol/L, is common in critically ill patients. Extreme hypernatremia (> 190 mmol/L) is rare, with high mortality [1]. While typical causes include dehydration and salt ingestion, extreme weight-cutting practices in competitive sports are underreported. This case highlights the challenges and adaptations needed in hypernatremia management.

Methods: A 29-year-old athlete presented with seizures and unresponsiveness after severe dehydration via hot baths and fluid restriction to cut weight for competition. Initial serum sodium exceeded 190 mmol/L (Table), with acute kidney injury and metabolic encephalopathy. ICU management required deviations from standard hypernatremia protocols, including using a hypertonic dialysate in continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). The dialysate initially matched the patient's serum sodium and was gradually reduced by titrating hypertonic saline, ensuring a slower correction rate. Multidisciplinary care addressed systemic complications.

Results: Sodium was cautiously lowered by approximately 8–10 mmol/L/day to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome. Imaging revealed metabolic brain injury. Despite metabolic stabilization, neurological deficits required prolonged ICU care. Neurorehabilitation resulted in assisted walking after two months, though mild motor deficits persisted.

Conclusions: This case emphasizes the risks of extreme weight-cutting and the critical need for flexible, individualized sodium correction strategies when standard protocols are inadequate. By tailoring CVVHDF, we safely managed sodium correction. Multidisciplinary care was essential to address systemic and neurological sequelae. Greater awareness and proactive intervention are crucial to prevent similar cases.

### Disorders of body water homeostasis in critical illness [^13a06749]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Disorders of sodium and water homeostasis are among the most commonly encountered disturbances in the critical care setting, because many disease states cause defects in the complex mechanisms that control the intake and output of water and solute. Because body water is the primary determinant of extracellular fluid osmolality, disorders of body water balance can be categorized into hypoosmolar and hyperosmolar disorders depending on the presence of an excess or a deficiency of body water relative to body solute. Because the main constituent of plasma osmolality is sodium, hypoosmolar and hyperosmolar disease states are generally characterized hy hyponatremia and hypernatremia, respectively. After a brief review of normal water metabolism, this article focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in the critical care setting.

The usual way to decide why hyponatremia or hypernatremia has developed and to plan goals for its therapy is to analyze events in electrolyte-free water (EFW) terms. We shall demonstrate that an EFW balance does not supply this information. Rather, one must calculate mass balances for water and sodium plus potassium separately (a tonicity balance) to understand the basis for the change in natremia and the proper goals for its therapy. These points are illustrated with a clinical example.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^f21e5a80]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Hypernatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is associated with high mortality rates. Current guidelines suggest avoiding fast correction rates but are not supported by robust data.

Objective

To investigate whether there is an association between hypernatremia correction rate and patient survival.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study examined data from all patients admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center between 2007 and 2021 who were diagnosed with severe hypernatremia (serum sodium ≥ 155 mmol/L) at admission or during hospitalization. Statistical analysis was performed from April 2022 to August 2023.

Exposure

Patients were grouped as having fast correction rates (> 0.5 mmol/L/h) and slow correction rates (≤ 0.5 mmol/L/h) in accordance with current guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause 30-day mortality.

Results

A total of 4265 patients were included in this cohort, of which 2621 (61.5%) were men and 343 (8.0%) had fast correction rates; the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 78 (64–87) years. Slow correction was associated with higher 30-day mortality compared with fast correction (50.7% [1990 of 3922] vs 31.8% [109 of 343]; P < .001). These results remained significant after adjusting for demographics (age, gender), Charlson comorbidity index, initial sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels, hospitalization in an ICU, and severe hyperglycemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.02 [95% CI, 1.55–2.62]), regardless of whether hypernatremia was hospital acquired (aOR, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.57–3.05]) or documented on admission (aOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.06–2.55]). There was a strong negative correlation between absolute sodium correction during the first 24 hours following the initial documentation of severe hypernatremia and 30-day mortality (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.80 [95% CI, -0.93 to -0.50]; P < .001). Median (IQR) hospitalization length was shorter for fast correction vs slow correction rates (5.0 [2.1–14.9] days vs 7.2 [3.5–16.1] days; P < .001). Prevalence of neurological complications was comparable for both groups, and none were attributed to fast correction rates of hypernatremia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study of patients with severe hypernatremia found that rapid correction of hypernatremia was associated with shorter hospitalizations and significantly lower patient mortality without any signs of neurologic complications. These results suggest that physicians should consider the totality of evidence when considering the optimal rates of correction for patients with severe hypernatremia.

Pituitary disease management during COVID-19 — diabetes insipidus (DI) guidance emphasizes safety: in patients with DI without concomitant illness the main risk is iatrogenic hyponatremia; if access to regular electrolyte monitoring is difficult it would be prudent to advise patients to withhold a weekly dose of desmopressin to allow for an aquaresis and favor under-dosing during daytime, with an aim to relieve symptoms of polyuria particularly overnight; in those with mild or partial DI, treatment with desmopressin may not be required as long as patients are instructed to drink to thirst and have access to fluids; in hospitalized patients, hypernatremia is more likely to occur, particularly in those with adipsic DI, and regular electrolyte monitoring is required, with requirement for parenteral desmopressin and intravenous fluids in cases of severe illness.

### Hyperglycemic hypernatremic hypertonic state: a predominant HHS subtype and its clinical and diagnostic features [^67944125]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) with concurrent hypernatremia is an emerging and under-investigated subtype of HHS.

Objective

To investigate the clinical characteristics, prevalence, and diagnostic parameters of this under-recognized HHS subtype.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive adults with diabetes admitted with HHS from 2018 to 2024 at a single institution. We assessed measured and corrected sodium, free water deficit, calculated effective serum osmolarity, calculated total serum osmolarity, and coexisting diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and metabolic acidosis.

Results

Among 174 patients with HHS, hypernatremia based on measured sodium (> 145 mmol/L) was uncommon (14/174, 8%), consistent with prior reports. However, hypernatremia based on corrected sodium for hyperglycemia was highly prevalent (166/174, 95.4%), suggesting that HHS with hypernatremia is the predominant subtype of HHS. Effective serum osmolarity > 300 mOsm/L was more sensitive than total serum osmolarity > 320 mOsm/L for diagnosing HHS. Additionally, 65.5% (114/174) of HHS cases had concurrent DKA, suggesting that the traditional exclusion of significant ketonemia and acidemia in HHS diagnosis may warrant reconsideration.

Conclusion

HHS with hypernatremia, defined by corrected sodium, is highly prevalent and clinically relevant, as corrected sodium better reflects the true free water deficit. HHS management should include evaluating both measured and corrected sodium, adopting effective serum osmolarity > 300 mOsm/L as a more sensitive diagnostic criterion, and reevaluating the exclusion criteria of significant ketonemia and acidosis. These refinements may enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable more personalized fluid management in HHS.

### Fluid and electrolyte management in the very low birth weight neonate [^f7b6113f]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Fluid and electrolyte management in the very low birth weight infant is critical to survival. The amount of fluid present in the plasma, interstitial fluid, and cellular fluid changes throughout the fetal and neonatal period, presenting a challenging situation. One of the many factors influencing fluid requirements is the insensible water loss by mechanisms such as evaporation. Low birth weight infants are especially susceptible to this due to their large body surface area and immature skin, often resulting in hypernatremia and the complications associated with it. However, some infants may experience hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, and/or hyponatremia, resulting in various other complications. Careful monitoring is essential in deciding how to manage these infants. This article aims to discuss the management of fluid and electrolytes in very low birth weight infants and address ways to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the imbalances in fluid and electrolytes seen in this population.

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in Hyper- and Hyponatremia

Copeptin Measurement in Hypernatremia

While hypernatremia is a rare finding in outpatients, it is much more common in hospitalized patients showing a prevalence of 2% to 3%. Hypernatremia results from a free water deficit due to renal (central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, glycosuria) or extrarenal water loss or from iatrogenic sodium overload (eg, uncontrolled saline infusion, tube feeding). In the majority of hospitalized hypernatremia patients, the electrolyte imbalance is not present at admission, but develops during hospitalization. Besides iatrogenic issues, many other factors and comorbidities such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, neurological impairment with impaired thirst perception, or inability to drink may promote the development of hypernatremia in the acute setting. Hypernatremia is therefore also a marker of disease severity and, unsurprisingly, studies consistently report increased mortality rates in patients with hypernatremia.

The most important measure to correct hypernatremia is to increase the free water supply, such as by intravenous hypotonic infusion. Additionally, in salt-overloaded patients iatrogenic action has to be stopped and diabetes insipidus patients need timely treatment with desmopressin.

The high rate of hospital-acquired hypernatremia underpins insufficient hypernatremia awareness in hospitalized patients, with the result of inadequate treatment and worse outcome. Specifically, for hospitalized patients with diabetes insipidus, a retrospective audit showed that desmopressin treatment was delayed in 88% of patients at admission, putting them at risk of hypernatremia. This prompted the Society for Endocrinology to publish guidelines on in-hospital management of central diabetes insipidus in 2018. For patients with undiagnosed diabetes insipidus who are also at need for early desmopressin treatment, copeptin has been proposed as a readily available diagnostic marker in the acute setting.

Hyperkalemia contributors and diet strategies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — non-dietary factors and when diet restriction applies are outlined. Medications, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmosis due to hyperglycemia, hypernatremia or uremia, and constipation are more likely to explain plasma potassium abnormalities than diet. Although short-term dietary restriction of the foods highest in potassium is a valid strategy to treat acute hyperkalemia, restriction of foods highest in bioavailable potassium may be a supportive prevention strategy for people with a history of hyperkalemia or during periods in which hyperkalemia risk is a concern.

### The impact of different rates of sodium reduction on the central nervous system in acute hypernatremia in rabbits [^4a27e494]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypernatremia is defined as a plasma sodium ion concentration > 145 mEq/L and is closely associated with the severity of patients' conditions. It is relatively common in intensive care units, with an incidence rate of hypernatremia in critically ill patients ranging from 4 to 26%, and it is an independent risk factor affecting patient prognosis. Based on the duration of hypernatremia, it can be divided into acute and chronic hypernatremia, with hypernatremia lasting less than 48 h referred to as acute hypernatremia, and hypernatremia lasting more than 48 h referred to as chronic hypernatremia.

In terms of the rate of sodium reduction, there has been a lack of clear guidelines and consensus, presenting challenges for clinical physicians in practice. Some studies have indicated that rapid correction of hypernatremia is not associated with seizure occurrence, brain edema, or mortality. Other studies have suggested that too slow correction can lead to higher mortality rates. For acute hypernatremia, some recommend rapidly reducing serum sodium to normal levels at a rate of 2 mEq/L/h, while others suggest that a reduction rate of 1 mEq/L/h is safe.

This study uses animal experiments as a means to delve into the impact of different rates of sodium reduction on the central nervous system during acute hypernatremia. By simulating different sodium reduction conditions in the experiment and measuring neurological indicators such as intracranial pressure, the study clarifies the damage to the central nervous system caused by different sodium reduction rates. Finally, by observing pathological changes in brain tissue, the types of central nervous system damage caused by different sodium reduction rates are identified.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^bff37ea2]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

### The impact of different rates of sodium reduction on the central nervous system in acute hypernatremia in rabbits [^236fd9d1]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute hypernatremia is a prevalent electrolyte imbalance in the intensive care unit (ICU), closely associated with the severity of patients' conditions. This study employs animal experimentation to investigate the effects of varying sodium reduction rates on the central nervous system in acute hypernatremia, aiming to identify the optimal rate of sodium reduction.

Methods

A stepwise sodium titration approach was used to establish an acute hypernatremia model, targeting a sodium increase of 0.5 mEq/L per hour (target serum sodium: a rise of 15 mEq/L within 48 h from baseline). Subsequently, a stepwise sodium decrement method was applied to reduce sodium levels to baseline. The study included four groups with different target sodium reduction rates: 1 mEq/L/h (Slow group), 2 mEq/L/h (Middle group), 3 mEq/L/h (Fast group), and Sham surgery group. Blood sodium and potassium levels, as well as urine sodium and potassium, were measured at various time points; central venous pressure (CVP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored; fluid intake and output were recorded to calculate fluid balance. After sodium reduction, brain tissue was extracted for pathological examination.

Results

Twenty adult, healthy male rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups (five rabbits per group). Before and after sodium reduction, the ICP significantly increased in the Fast group from 7.00 ± 0.71 to 13.20 ± 2.95 and in the Middle group from 6.80 ± 0.45 to 11.40 ± 0.89 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.000, respectively); the Slow group showed no significant change in ICP. Pathological findings revealed edema and disorganized brain tissue in the cerebral cortex and brainstem in the Fast and Middle groups, with statistically significant differences compared to the sham-operated group in semi-quantitative analysis.

Conclusion

For acute hypernatremia that develops within 48 h, sodium reduction rates exceeding 1 mEq/L/h are associated with greater increases in ICP and more severe brain edema. Therefore, for managing acute hypernatremia, our result prompted that sodium reduction rates might not exceed 1 mEq/L/h.

P178 Extreme hypernatremia and sepsis in a patient with Huntington's dementia: a conundrum in fluid management

H. Venkatesh 1, S. Ramachandran 2, A. Basu 3, H. Nair 3

1 Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, UK; 2 Imperial College London, London, UK; 3 Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan, UK

Introductions: Approximately 1 to 2% of patients attending the Emergency Department have hypernatremia(1). Hypernatremia over 160 mmol/L is considered to be very severe and as such needs to be treated with caution(2). Extreme cases of hypernatraemia are rare (where sodium levels are exceptionally high), especially in adults and the most common pathophysiology in such cases would be related to severe dehydration. We see this more in the elderly population, children, the institutionalised and patients with dementia.

Methods: We report a unique case of extreme hypernatremia of 196 mmol/L and severe sepsis in a young 39-year-old adult with Huntington's dementia, which presented a challenge in fluid management.

Results: The hypernatraemia was thought to be caused by chronic severe dehydration from poor intake and the sepsis was thought to have started as an inadequately treated urinary tract infection. The patient was initially treated aggressively with hypotonic saline and intravenous antibiotics, but was subsequently managed using a slower correction rate after identifying the chronic nature of the natremia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extreme hypernatremia and severe sepsis manifesting concomitantly in such a young patient.

Conclusions: We highlight the difficulties of balancing the risks and benefits of rapid versus slow fluid resuscitation in such complex clinical situations. We highlight the difficulty of balancing the risks and benefits of rapid fluid resuscitation, necessitated by severe sepsis and acute kidney injury, against the complexities of fluid resuscitation in correcting such an extreme hypernatremia.

### Acute severe hypernatremia complicated by osmotic demyelination syndrome in a 13-day-old infant [^b31e6d70]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In the neonatal period, other etiologies such as inborn errors of metabolism can also be a cause of ODS. We considered this possibility, but no investigations were performed, given the clear iatrogenic context and absence of typical features of inborn errors of metabolism (e.g. symptom-free interval, apnea, hyperammonemia) in this case.

There is no specific treatment for ODS. Corticosteroids or immunoglobulins have been used in some reports, but prevention remains key.

Pediatric data on optimal rehydration strategies remain limited. ESPNIC (European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care) recently recommended enteral hydration when feasible, isotonic and balanced fluids, and individualized approaches. Severe hypernatremia may benefit from iso-osmolar solutions, while milder cases can be managed with hypo-osmolar fluids.

Guidelines to correct hypernatremia disorders in neonates are scarce. Isotonic solution should be considered when facing hemodynamic disorders and hypernatremia to restore blood volume. Correction should be < 0.5 mmol/L/h (i.e. < 12 mmol/L/24 h) and properly monitored every 2 to 4 h during the first 12 h of correction and then adjusted to natremia levels to adapt rehydration. Enteral rehydration may be considered for hypernatremia < 160 mmol/L without hemodynamic issue otherwise, this parenteral correction should be initiated until a safer threshold of natremia level is reached (i.e. 150–160 mmol/L). When opting for enteral correction, milk should be preferred over water or other solutions, to minimize the risk of ulcerative enterocolitis in neonates. To our knowledge, specific recommendations for sudden-onset hypernatremia in children, as herein reported, do not exist.

### A mathematical approach to severe hyponatremia and hypernatremia in renal replacement therapies [^908c4563]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe dysnatremias are perplexing problems in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy on a chronic or acute basis. The ability to manipulate sodium concentration in the dialysate or replacement solutions is limited. Compounding dialysate or replacement fluids to alter sodium concentration could result in errors. Rapid correction of hyponatremia or hypernatremia due to equilibrium with dialysate or replacement solutions could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome or cerebral edema respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy is the preferred dialysis modality in patients with severe dysnatremias. In this article, we present simple formulas to determine the rate of hypotonic or hypertonic solutions needed to mitigate rapid correction of dysnatremias. These formulas can be used readily by the clinician at bedside.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^1b00a737]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential organ donor fluid management — initial volume replacement, crystalloid selection, hypernatremia management, colloids, and transfusion — is summarized as follows: Initial intravascular volume replacement with crystalloids or colloids is acceptable, and the recommended isotonic crystalloids are 0.9% saline and lactated Ringer solution, although hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may preclude the use of 0.9% saline and the hypoosmolar effects and electrolyte content of lactated Ringer solution may not be advisable for some donors. If volume status is stabilized but correction of hypernatremia is needed, hypotonic fluids (e.g. D5W) can be used; patients with metabolic acidosis may benefit from solutions containing sodium bicarbonate, with 50–150 mmol/L depending on phase and severity, and in hypernatremic donors, 0.45% saline with or without sodium bicarbonate can be used. For colloids, HES should not be used routinely for colloidal resuscitation in organ donors, and if it is used the infused volume should be limited to 500–1,000 mL. Packed RBCs may be required for severe anemia, and although the optimal hemoglobin is unknown in this population, in other critically ill populations a target above 7 g/dL has been recommended.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f84ee988]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

Potential organ donor in the ICU — diabetes insipidus (DI) with significant hypernatremia is managed by initiating desmopressin when sodium is > 145–150 mmol/L without hypotension, using an initial IV dose of 1–4 μg with dosing titrated to urine output, urine osmolality, and serum sodium, and typically giving an additional 1 or 2 μg every 6 hours; both AVP and desmopressin can be used concurrently in the hemodynamically unstable donor with severe hypernatremia, and electrolytes should be monitored closely and replenished due to risks of hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Maintenance intravenous fluids (IVFs) in children — hypernatremia risk with isotonic solutions was evaluated as a concern defined as serum sodium > 145 mEq/L. A systematic review found no evidence of an increased risk of hypernatremia associated with isotonic fluids, although the quality of evidence was judged to be low; the report clarifies that there was not evidence of no risk and the risk is unclear from the meta-analysis results. The estimated risk ratio was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.65–2.38), drawn from 9 studies with 937 patients, with 3 studies having no events and not contributing to the estimate, and researchers in 2 large studies published since the meta-analysis did not find evidence of an increased risk of hypernatremia with isotonic IVFs.

### Outcomes of hospital-acquired hypernatremia [^a8c314d1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

A caveat that needs attention in our work is the ascertainment of CKD classification by the use of hospitalized ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Back in 2000 (starting year of data retrieval for this analysis), ICD codes were relatively new and CKD as a diagnosis was underreported, especially mild CKD. Therefore, the prevalence of CKD stages 1–4 reported herein may be undercounted. Nevertheless, an existing diagnostic code for CKD may reflect that the hospitalized patient had previous care and available records, which may, in part, explain why the risk of in-hospital mortality was lower for patients with CKD and no AKI/no hypernatremia.

The fact that our inpatient study population suffered more acute conditions could be a major determinant of our findings. Furthermore, the physiologic plausibility of our findings relies on the strategic role the kidney plays in sodium and water homeostasis. In early stages of CKD, hyponatremia is more common than hypernatremia. In more advanced stages of CKD, water handling becomes more impaired and hypernatremia is more common. When eGFR drops below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, the risk of mortality seems to become the highest. The age distribution of hospital-acquired hypernatremia is usually similar to that of the general hospitalized population. Both the kidneys and the brain collaborate to regulate hospital-acquired hypernatremia. When the kidneys function relatively normal, iatrogenic or central nervous system causes should be considered. Inadequate and inappropriate prescription of fluids to patients with predictably increased water losses and impaired thirst and/or restricted free water intake may result in iatrogenic hospital-acquired hypernatremia, and the treatment is often inadequate or delayed.

### Postoperative dysnatremia in pediatric patients undergoing palatoplasty [^e5caa0b6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Hypernatremia treatment relies on addressing the underlying cause (listed in Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and correcting the serum sodium level and free water deficit. Treating the etiology may include stopping gastrointestinal or cutaneous losses, controlling fever, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria, withholding diuretics, treating other electrolyte disorders, adapting feeding formula, or in case of diabetes insipidus, replacing vasopressin. Fluid management requires correction of the free water deficit and replacement of the ongoing losses, which can be calculated as follows (desired natremia change in mmol/l). Free water deficit (ml) = 4 ml×lean body weight (kg)×(desired natremia change in mmol/l).

To avoid correction errors and subsequent neurological symptoms, one should aim for a natremia change of 1 mmol/h or 15 mmol/24h. In case of severe hypernatremia (Na > 170 mmol/l), the correction should not go below 150 mmol/l in the first 48 to 72 hours. It is necessary to monitor sodium levels at 1 to 4-hour intervals early in the treatment to ensure a gradual decrease of sodium level. The development of seizures may be a sign of cerebral oedema due to the rapid correction of hypernatremia. Administration of hypertonic saline to slightly increase sodium concentration usually permits to slow the rate of correction and resolves the neurological symptoms.

The treatment of hyponatremia requires analysis of serum osmolality, volume status, and urine osmolality.

Measurement of serum osmolality identifies "true hyponatremia", hypotonic hyponatremia. Euvolemic hyponatremia is a pseudohyponatremia caused by a high concentration of proteins in the plasma, while hypertonic hyponatremia appears in the case of hyperglycemia.

Once hypotonic hyponatremia is confirmed, the extracellular volume status of the patient should be evaluated. Clinical history of fluid imbalance, weight changes, drugs, and underlying medical conditions and clinical examination permit to identify the etiology and type of hyponatremia (see Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 2). In addition, assessing the urinary sodium concentration permits one to distinguish between renal (U[Na] > 20) and nonrenal causes (U[Na] < 20) of hyponatremia. It is the classification of the natremia that defines its treatment (Figure 2).

### Only some septicaemic patients develop hypernatremia in the burn intensive care unit: why? [^fd43df19]. Burns (2002). Low credibility.

From April 1993 to January 2000, 105 patients in the burn intensive care unit (BICU) that developed septicaemia in the course of their treatment were studied retrospectively to investigate as to why only 36 septicaemic patients (34%) developed hypernatremia (serum sodium > 150mmol/l). Septicaemic burn patients who developed hypernatremia were found to have a higher incidence of inhalation injury and a larger burn area (TBSA) signifying greater free water losses in the face of increasing fluid requirements. Patients who developed hypernatremia showed a characteristic pattern of septicaemia: early onset, multiple episodes, polymicrobial, need for multiple antibiotics, longer duration and a higher mortality, indicating a more severe degree of sepsis. The level of incapacitation either from the burn itself, mechanical ventilation or from impaired mental status leading to an inadequate free water intake was more in septicaemic patients who developed hypernatremia. Increased urinary free water losses and solute diuresis from hyperglycemia were significant factors in the development of hypernatremia. Patients who were treated with early wound excisions were less prone to develop hypernatremia when compared to those who did not undergo early wound excision. The close association between the onset of hypernatremia and the onset of septicaemia noted in this study suggests the use of hypernatremia as a marker for septicaemia in burn patients. Hypernatremia in a septicaemic burn patient is multi-factorial and a thorough understanding of the underlying factors will help prevent the onset and progress of hypernatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Severe hypernatremia and gastric dilation from chronic eating disorder and intentional salt ingestion [^71142170]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 21-year-old female presenting with severe hypernatremia and a gastric outlet obstruction due to chronic purging behavior with salt water flushes. She presented obtunded following emesis and a witnessed seizure. She was found to have a corrected sodium level of 177 mmol/L. Following initial intubation and resuscitation, her CT imaging showed massive gastric dilation with high-density material in the gastric lumen. After orogastric flushing was unsuccessful and the patient's abdominal distention worsened, she was managed surgically and found to have a salt bezoar leading to bowel ischemia and perforation. This case details the complications and management of acute hypernatremia and gastric outlet obstruction in an otherwise healthy, young female. In a society where eating disorders are pervasive, Emergency Medicine physicians should be familiar with dangerous dietary behaviors as well as the management of their rare, but potentially life-threatening, complications.

### Clinical review: practical approach to hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in critically ill patients [^3dce1e4c]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Disturbances in sodium concentration are common in the critically ill patient and associated with increased mortality. The key principle in treatment and prevention is that plasma [Na+] (P-[Na+]) is determined by external water and cation balances. P-[Na+] determines plasma tonicity. An important exception is hyperglycaemia, where P-[Na+] may be reduced despite plasma hypertonicity. The patient is first treated to secure airway, breathing and circulation to diminish secondary organ damage. Symptoms are critical when handling a patient with hyponatraemia. Severe symptoms are treated with 2 ml/kg 3% NaCl bolus infusions irrespective of the supposed duration of hyponatraemia. The goal is to reduce cerebral symptoms. The bolus therapy ensures an immediate and controllable rise in P-[Na+]. A maximum of three boluses are given (increases P-[Na+] about 6 mmol/l). In all patients with hyponatraemia, correction above 10 mmol/l/day must be avoided to reduce the risk of osmotic demyelination. Practical measures for handling a rapid rise in P-[Na+] are discussed. The risk of overcorrection is associated with the mechanisms that cause hyponatraemia. Traditional classifications according to volume status are notoriously difficult to handle in clinical practice. Moreover, multiple combined mechanisms are common. More than one mechanism must therefore be considered for safe and lasting correction. Hypernatraemia is less common than hyponatraemia, but implies that the patient is more ill and has a worse prognosis. A practical approach includes treatment of the underlying diseases and restoration of the distorted water and salt balances. Multiple combined mechanisms are common and must be searched for. Importantly, hypernatraemia is not only a matter of water deficit, and treatment of the critically ill patient with an accumulated fluid balance of 20 litres and corresponding weight gain should not comprise more water, but measures to invoke a negative cation balance. Reduction of hypernatraemia/hypertonicity is critical, but should not exceed 12 mmol/l/day in order to reduce the risk of rebounding brain oedema.

### Hospital-associated hypernatremia spectrum and clinical outcomes in an unselected cohort [^50aef1a3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although hypernatremia is associated with adverse outcomes, most studies examined selected populations.

Methods

Discharge data of 19,072 unselected hospitalized adults were analyzed. The crude relationship between serum sodium [Na +] and mortality defined hypernatremia as serum [Na +] > 142 mEq/L. Patients with community-acquired hypernatremia or hospital-acquired hypernatremia were compared with normonatremic patients (admission [Na +] 138–142 mEq/L) regarding in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and discharge disposition. Patients with community-acquired hypernatremia whose hypernatremia worsened during hospitalization were compared with those without aggravation.

Results

Community-acquired hypernatremia occurred in 21% of hospitalized patients and was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38–2.01) for in-hospital mortality and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.32–1.56) for discharge to a short-/long-term care facility and an adjusted 10% (95% CI, 7–13) increase in length of stay. Hospital-acquired hypernatremia developed in 25.9% of hospitalized patients and was associated with an adjusted OR of 3.17 (95% CI, 2.45–4.09) for in-hospital mortality and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.32–1.59) for discharge to a facility, and an adjusted 49% (95% CI, 44–53) increase in length of stay. Hospital-aggravated hypernatremia developed in 11.7% of patients with community-acquired hypernatremia and was associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.32–2.56) and discharge to a facility (adjusted OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.71–2.69), and an adjusted 16% (95% CI, 7–27) increase in length of stay.

Conclusions

The hypernatremia spectrum in unselected hospitalized patients is independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality and heightened resource consumption.

### Characteristics, symptoms, and outcome of severe dysnatremias present on hospital admission [^efb2d79d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Dysnatremias are common in critically ill patients and associated with adverse outcomes, but their incidence, nature, and treatment rarely have been studied systematically in the population presenting to the emergency department. We conducted a study in patients presenting to the emergency department of the University of Bern.

Methods

In this retrospective case series at a university hospital in Switzerland, 77,847 patients admitted to the emergency department between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2011, were included. Serum sodium was measured in 43,911 of these patients. Severe hyponatremia was defined as less than 121 mmol/L, and severe hypernatremia was defined as less than 149 mmol/L.

Results

Hypernatremia (sodium > 145 mmol/L) was present in 2% of patients, and hyponatremia (sodium < 135 mmol/L) was present in 10% of patients. A total of 74 patients had severe hypernatremia, and 168 patients had severe hyponatremia. Some 38% of patients with severe hypernatremia and 64% of patients with hyponatremia had neurologic symptoms. The occurrence of symptoms was related to the absolute elevation of serum sodium. Somnolence and disorientation were the leading symptoms in hypernatremic patients, and nausea, falls, and weakness were the leading symptoms in hyponatremic patients. The rate of correction did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Patients with symptomatic hypernatremia showed a further increase in serum sodium concentration during the first 24 hours after admission. Corrective measures were not taken in 18% of hypernatremic patients and 4% of hyponatremic patients.

Conclusions

Dysnatremias are common in the emergency department. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia have different symptoms. Contrary to recommendations, serum sodium is not corrected more rapidly in symptomatic patients.

Hypopituitarism during COVID-19 — clinicians should remain vigilant given increased background mortality and management trade-offs. Patients with hypopituitarism have increased mortality, particularly from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. There is a careful balance between preventing adrenal insufficiency and avoiding prolonged glucocorticoid over-replacement with consequent immunosuppression. Diabetes insipidus poses fluid-balance challenges during significant illness, and hypernatremia is linked to increased mortality in intensive care admissions.

### Intravenous solutions in the care of patients with volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities [^50bc95cd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infusion fluids are often given to restore blood pressure (volume resuscitation), but may also be administered to replace ongoing losses, match insensible losses, correct electrolyte or acid-base disorders, or provide glucose. The development of new infusion fluids has provided clinicians with a wide range of products. Although the choice for a certain infusion fluid is often driven more by habit than by careful consideration, we believe it is useful to approach infusion fluids as drugs and consider their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. This approach not only explains why infusion fluids may cause electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, but also why they may compromise kidney function or coagulation. In this teaching case, we present a 19-year-old patient in whom severe hypernatremia developed as a result of normal saline solution infusion and explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of frequently used infusion fluids. We review clinical evidence to guide the selection of the optimal infusion fluid.

### Correcting hypernatremia in children [^a31d8624]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In children with hypernatremia, current clinical guidelines recommend a reduction in serum sodium of 0.5 mmol/L per hour or less to avoid complications of cerebral edema. However, no large-scale studies have been conducted in the pediatric setting to inform this recommendation. Therefore, this study aimed to report the association between the rate of correction of hypernatremia, neurological outcomes, and all-cause mortality in children.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2016 to 2019 at a quaternary pediatric center in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. All children with at least one serum sodium level ≥ 150 mmol/L were identified through interrogation of the hospital's electronic medical record. Medical notes, neuroimaging reports, and electroencephalogram results were reviewed for evidence of seizures and/or cerebral edema. The peak serum sodium level was identified and correction rates over the first 24 hours and overall were calculated. Unadjusted and multivariable analyses were used to examine the association between the rate of sodium correction and neurological complications, the requirement for neurological investigation, and death.

Results

There were 402 episodes of hypernatremia among 358 children over the 3-year study period. Of these, 179 were community-acquired and 223 developed during admission. A total of 28 patients (7%) died during admission. Mortality was higher in children with hospital-acquired hypernatremia, as was the frequency of intensive care unit admission and hospital length of stay. Rapid correction (> 0.5 mmol/L per hour) occurred in 200 children and was not associated with greater neurological investigation or mortality. Length of stay was longer in children who received slow correction (< 0.5 mmol/L per hour).

Conclusions

Our study did not find any evidence that rapid sodium correction was associated with greater neurological investigation, cerebral edema, seizures, or mortality; however, slow correction was associated with a longer hospital length of stay.

### Association between an increase in serum sodium and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients [^732c3fa4]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A considerable number of patients are admitted to the ICU with dysnatremia, a deranged serum sodium concentration. Furthermore, a substantial number of patients develop dysnatremia during ICU admission.

Hypernatremia ([Na] > 145 mmol/L) is relatively rare at ICU admission but develops in up to 24% of patients during ICU stay and is an independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU. ICU patients are predisposed to developing hypernatremia because of the administration of hypertonic solutions, renal-free water loss due to renal disease, diuretics, and gastrointestinal fluid losses.

Hyponatremia ([Na] < 135 mmol/L) is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients. It is a disorder of water excretion and can occur in many different conditions. Severe hyponatremia ([Na] < 125 mmol/L) can result in neurologic symptoms, coma, and death especially if the decrease in plasma sodium develops rapidly. In ICU patients hyponatremia is often mild and is most often already present at ICU admission. Hyponatremia is independently associated with mortality, which may be due to a direct causal relationship. If this association is causal, correction of hyponatremia would decrease mortality. However, we hypothesize that mild hyponatremia could also be an evolutionary adaptive mechanism in critical illness, as it is common in a wide variety of disease states. If so, the higher mortality rate in patients with mild hyponatremia would reflect the severity of the underlying illness, but increase of serum sodium, either intentional or as side effect of other treatments, would not be beneficial and could even paradoxically be harmful and decrease survival.

The objective of this study was to assess the independent association of changes in serum sodium concentration in the first 48 hours of ICU admission with mortality specifically in patients admitted with mild hyponatremia but also for severe hyponatremia, normonatremia, and hypernatremia in a large cohort of ICU patients.

### Severe hypernatremia in children after surgical resection of hepatic echinococcosis: a rare and potentially fatal complication [^f5cfc7f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 4
World mortality reports of Echinococcosis with postoperative hypernatremia

Na sodium; E endocystectomy; LPC laparoscopic partial cystectomy; LE laparoscopic endocystectomy

Acute hypernatremia should be treated more carefully. However, optimal correction rate of acute hypernatremia in children has not been established. Based on experimental data on cerebral volume regulation, a faster pace of correction, such as decreasing serum sodium concentration by 1 mmol/l/h, as we practiced, was suggested for hypernatremia of rapid onset. Even after an intraoperative upward serum sodium shift of 60 mmol/l, a prompt and rational correction of hypernatremia may be in alignment with survival without neurologic sequelae and improve the patient prognosis.

Our experience over 26 pediatric cases of operative treatment of echinococcosis indicated that the HS irrigation during operation of echinococcosis may cause hypernatremia with a potentially fatal outcome. Encouragingly, our rapid therapeutic interventions were successful, and mortality was avoided. To our knowledge, this is the first retrospective study on severe hypernatremia in children after surgical resection of hepatic echinococcosis. Our study is inevitably limited by small sample size and lack of a control group. More rigorous experimental protocols should be designed to offer opportunities for prevention and treatment.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^1d4c3bb3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several important limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the study increases the risk for bias and confounding. Fast correction of hypernatremia might be a marker of healthier patients, and not directly associated with survival. This seems less likely as results remained statistically significant after adjusting for comorbidities, and as there was no excess mortality in the slow correction rate group between 30 days and 1 year, implying differences in mortality rates are less likely to be attributed to comorbidities and background factors. Unaccounted confounding factors and data entry mistakes might affect the reported results. The substantial discrepancy in sample sizes between the slow and fast correction rate groups, representing class imbalance, might also affect the reported results. Second, many patients were corrected slower than possible under the current guidelines, perhaps due to concerns of overly rapid correction. Of note, the median maximal correction rates in the slow correction rate group are close to currently suggested correction rates for these patients, probably reflecting relatively aggressive initiation of rehydration followed by slower and more careful treatment. Moreover, this slow rate of correction of hypernatremia is similar to rates reported in previous non-ICU studies, implying slow correction rates might be more common than previously thought and perhaps representing physician concerns of neurological complications of overcorrection. It is possible that faster rates of correction might have translated to better patient outcomes. Third, the study did not include different treatments for hypernatremia, which could potentially influence prognosis. Fourth, our analysis did not include correction of sodium levels for hyperglycemia. However, this is probably not a significant factor for most patients and should be comparable between the 2 studied groups. Also, for the fast correction group, any hyperglycemia would have made true correction rates even higher than currently calculated, underlining the safety of rapid correction. Fifth, our results might not be generalizable to patients with less severe hypernatremia, or for patients in other hospitals. Strengths of our study include the large sample size and the inclusion of all consecutive patients with severe hypernatremia in a predefined time frame.

### Survival of acute hypernatremia due to massive soy sauce ingestion [^eee2d16d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intentional massive sodium chloride ingestions are rare occurrences and are often fatal.

Objectives

There are a variety of treatment recommendations for hypernatremia, ranging from dialysis to varying rates of correction. We report a case of acute severe hypernatremia corrected with rapid free-water infusions that, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported.

Case Report

A 19-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department in a comatose state with seizure-like activity 2 hours after ingesting a quart of soy sauce. He was administered 6 L of free water over 30 min and survived neurologically intact without clinical sequelae. Corrected for hyperglycemia, the patient's peak serum sodium was 196 mmol/L, which, to our knowledge, is the highest documented level in an adult patient to survive an acute sodium ingestion without neurologic deficits.

Conclusion

Emergency physicians should consider rapidly lowering serum sodium with hypotonic intravenous fluids as a potential management strategy for acute severe hypernatremia secondary to massive salt ingestion.

### Multiphase management of sodium imbalance following traumatic brain injury: a case-based review [^7fe6e55e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium imbalance in TBI results from disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, intracranial pressure, and renal handling of water and electrolytes. Initial osmotic diuresis is a common consequence of mannitol use, leading to hypernatremia if not carefully monitored. Arginine vasopressin deficiency arises due to hypothalamic or pituitary injury, impairing arginine vasopressin secretion and causing polyuria and hypernatremia. SIAD, on the other hand, reflects non-osmotic release of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary, leading to water retention, hyponatremia, and concentrated urine.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^ecf0d2d2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Acute severe hypernatremia complicated by osmotic demyelination syndrome in a 13-day-old infant [^1901ebaa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In adults, correction of chronic hypernatremia should be cautiously monitored, not exceeding 0.5 mmol/L/h to avoid cerebral oedema. Yet, acute onset hypernatremia should aim a rapid restoration of normal natremia within 24 h for a better prognosis.

In our case, a normal natremia level was restored 26.5 h after treatment initiation, 30.5 h after the sodium load, with a correction rate averaging 3 mmol/L/h within the first 4 h and then 1.45 mmol/L/h. Sodium lactate was preferred to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis.

Unlike previously reported cases related to oral overload or continuous infusion errors leading to progressive hypernatremia, instantaneous iatrogenic sodium overload, resulting in sudden severe hypernatremia and ODS. To our knowledge, this is the first reported neonatal ODS case. The CNS's incomplete myelination at this age makes the imaging and clinical recovery particularly noteworthy, and may explain the rapid reversibility observed.

This case report has several limitations. First, although the iatrogenic context was unequivocal, no metabolic work-up was performed to formally exclude inborn errors of metabolism, which can also predispose to ODS. Second, enterovirus meningitis may have contributed to the neurological symptoms and MRI abnormalities, as initial febrile hypotonia was highly consistent with meningitis. Nevertheless, the appearance of new neurological signs after sodium correction, the bilateral lenticular lesions on DWI/ADC sequences, and their complete reversibility strongly favor ODS as the primary mechanism. Third, as a single case report, the generalizability of our findings remains limited. Prospective data or systematic neonatal cohorts are lacking, making it difficult to define the natural history, prognosis, or optimal correction strategies in this age group.
